          <p>SENECA, the favourite classic of the early fathers of <lb/>
            the church and of the Middle Ages, whom Jerome, <lb/>
            Tertullian, and Augustine speak of as " Seneca noster," <lb/>
            who was believed to have corresponded with St. Paul, and <lb/>
            upon whom 1 Calvin wrote a commentary, seems almost <lb/>
            forgotten in modern times. Perhaps some of his popu­ <lb/>
            larity may have been due to his being supposed to be <lb/>
            the author of those tragedies which the world has long <lb/>
            ceased to read, but which delighted a period that preferred <lb/>
            Euripides to Aeschylus: while casuists must have found <lb/>
            congenial matter in an author whose fantastic cases of <lb/>
            conscience are often worthy of Sanchez or Escobar. Yet <lb/>
            Seneca's morality is always pure, and from him we gain, <lb/>
            albeit at second hand, an insight into the doctrines of the <lb/>
            Greek philosophers, Zeno, Epicurus, Chrysippus, &amp;c., <lb/>
            whose precepts and system of religious thought had in <lb/>
            cultivated Roman society taken the place of the old <lb/>
            worship of Jupiter and Quirinus.</p>
          <p>Since Lodge's edition (fol. 1614), no complete translation <lb/>
            of Seneca has been published in England, though Sir <lb/>
            Roger L'Estrange wrote paraphrases of several Dialogues, <lb/>
            which seem to have been enormously popular, running <lb/>
            through more than sixteen editions. I think we may con­ <lb/>
            jecture that Shakespeare had seen Lodge's translation, <note type="footnote"> 1 On the “De Clementia,” an odd subject for the man who burned <lb/>
            Servetus alive for differing with him. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="VI"/>
            from several allusions to philosophy, to that impossible <lb/>
            conception " the wise man," and especially from a passage <lb/>
            in " All's Well that ends Well," which seems to breathe the <lb/>
            very spirit of " De Beneficiis.” <lb/>
            " 'Tis pity— <lb/>
            That wishing well had not a body in it <lb/>
            Which might be felt: that we, the poorer born, <lb/>
            Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes, <lb/>
            Might with effects of them follow our friends <lb/>
            And show what we alone must think5 which never <lb/>
            Returns us thanks." <lb/>
            All’s Well that ends Well, Act i. sc. 1. <lb/>
            Though, if this will not fit the supposed date of that play, <lb/>
            he may have taken the idea from " The Woorke of Lucius <lb/>
            Annæus Seneca concerning Benefyting, that is too say, the <lb/>
            dooing, receyving, and requyting of good turnes, translated <lb/>
            out of Latin by A. Golding. J. Day, London, 1578." <lb/>
            And even during the Restoration, Pepys's ideal of virtuous <lb/>
            and lettered seclusion is a country house in whose garden <lb/>
            he might sit on summer afternoons with his friend, Sir W. <lb/>
            Coventry, " it maybe, to read a chapter of Seneca." In <lb/>
            sharp contrast to this is Vahlen's preface to the minor Dia­ <lb/>
            logues, which he edited after the death of his friend Koch, <lb/>
            who had begun that work, in which he remarks that " he has <lb/>
            read much of this writer, in order to perfect his knowledge <lb/>
            of Latin, for otherwise he neither admires his artificial <lb/>
            subtleties of thought, nor his childish mannerisms of <lb/>
            style " (Vahlen, preface, p. v., ed. 1879, Jena).</p>
          <p>Yet by the student of the history of Rome under the <lb/>
            Caesars, Seneca is not to be neglected, because, whatever <lb/>
            may be thought of the intrinsic merit of his speculations, <lb/>
            he represents, more perhaps even than Tacitus, the intel­ <lb/>
            lectual characteristics of his age, and the tone of society in <lb/>
            Rome-nor could we well spare the gossiping stories which <lb/>
            we find imbedded in his graver dissertations. The follow­ <lb/>
             <pb n="VII"/>
            ing extract from Dean Merivale's " History of the Romans <lb/>
            under the Empire " will show the estimate of him which <lb/>
            has been formed by that accomplished writer:­</p>
          <p>" At Rome, we have no reason to suppose that Chris­ <lb/>
            tianity was only the refuge of the afflicted and miserable; <lb/>
            rather, if we may lay any stress on the documents above <lb/>
            referred to, it was first embraced by persons in a certain <lb/>
            grade of comfort and respectability; by persons approaching <lb/>
            to what we should call the middle classes in their condition, <lb/>
            their education, and their moral views. Of this class <lb/>
            Seneca himself was the idol, the oracle; he was, so to <lb/>
            speak, the favourite preacher of the more intelligent and <lb/>
            humane disciples of nature and virtue. Now the writings <lb/>
            of Seneca show, in their way, a real anxiety among this <lb/>
            class to raise the moral tone of mankind around them; a <lb/>
            spirit of reform, a zeal for the conversion of souls, which, <lb/>
            though it never rose, indeed, under the teaching of the <lb/>
            philosophers, to boiling heat, still simmered with genial <lb/>
            warmth on the surface of society. Far different as was <lb/>
            their social standing-point, far different as were the <lb/>
            foundations and the presumed sanctions of their teaching <lb/>
            respectively, Seneca a.nd St. Paul were both moral re­ <lb/>
            formers; both, be it said with reverence, were fellow­ <lb/>
            workers in the cause of humanity, though the Christian <lb/>
            could look beyond the proximate aims of morality and <lb/>
            prepare men for a final development on which the Stoic <lb/>
            could not venture to gaze. Hence there is so much in <lb/>
            their principles, so much even in their language, which <lb/>
            agrees together, so that the one has been thought, though <lb/>
            it must be allowed without adequate reason, to have <lb/>
            borrowed directly from the other. But the philosopher, <note type="footnote"> 1 It is hardly necessary to refer to the pretended letters between <lb/>
            St. Paul and Seneca. Besides the evidence from style, some of the <lb/>
            dates they contain are quite sufficient to condemn them as clumsy <lb/>
            forgeries. They are mentioned, but with no expression of belief in </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="VIII"/>
            be it remembered, discoursed to a large and not inattentive <lb/>
            audience, and surely the soil was not all unfruitful on <lb/>
            which his seed was scattered when he proclaimed that God <lb/>
            dwells not in temples of wood and stone, nor wants the <lb/>
            ministrations of human hands: 1 that He has no delight in the <lb/>
            blood of victims:2 that He is near to all His creatures:3 that <lb/>
            His Spirit resides in men’s hearts :4 that all men are truly <lb/>
            His offspring :5 that we are members of one body, which is <lb/>
            God or Nature :6 that men must believe in God before they <lb/>
            can approach Him:7 that the true service of God is to be <lb/>
            like unto Him:8 that all men have sinned, and none per­ <lb/>
            formed all the works of the law : 9 that God is no respecter of <lb/>
            nations, ranks, or conditions, but all, barbarian and Roman, <lb/>
            bond and free, are alike under His all-seeing Providence.10</p>
          <p>" St. Paul enjoined submission and obedience even to the <lb/>
            tyranny of Nero, and Seneca fosters no ideas subversive of <lb/>
            political subjection. Endurance is the paramount virtue <lb/>
            of the Stoic. To forms of government the wise man was <note type="footnote"> their genuineness, by Jerome and Augustine. See Jones, 11 On the <lb/>
            Canon," ii. 80. </note><note type="footnote"> I Sen., Ep. 95, and in Lactantius, Inst. vi. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Ep. 116: " Colitur Deus non tauris sed pia et recta voluntate." </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Ep. 41, 73. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Ep. 46: " Sacer intra nos spiritus sedet." </note><note type="footnote"> 5 41 De Prov.," i. </note><note type="footnote"> 8 Ep. 93, 95: " Membra sumus magni corporis." </note><note type="footnote"> 7 Ep. 95 : “ Primus Deorum cultus est Deos credere." </note><note type="footnote"> 8 Ep. 95 : “ Satis coluit quisquis imitatus est." </note><note type="footnote"> 9 Sen. de Ira. i. 14; ii. 27 : “ Quis est iste qui Be profitetur omnibus <lb/>
            leg! bus innocentem ? " </note><note type="footnote"> 10 " De Benef.," iii. 18 : " Virtus omnes admittit, libertinos, servos, <lb/>
            reges." These and many other passages are collected by Champagny, <lb/>
            ii. 546, after Fabricius and others, and compared with well-known texts <lb/>
            of Scripture. The version of the Vulgate shows a great deal of verbal <lb/>
            correspondence. M. Troplong remarks, after De Maistre, that Seneca <lb/>
            has written a fine book on Providence, for which there was not even a <lb/>
            name at Rome in the time of Cicero.—“ L'Influence du Christianisme," <lb/>
            &amp;c., i., ch. 4. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="IX"/>
            wholly indifferent; they were among the external circum­ <lb/>
            stances above which his spirit soared in serene self-con­ <lb/>
            templation. We trace in Seneca no yearning for a resto­ <lb/>
            ration of political freedom, nor does he even point to the <lb/>
            senate, after the manner of the patriots of the day, as a <lb/>
            legitimate check to the autocracy of the despot. The only <lb/>
            mode, in his view, of tempering tyranny is to educate the <lb/>
            tyrant himself in virtue. His was the self-denial of the <lb/>
            Christians, but without their anticipated compensation. It <lb/>
            seems impossible to doubt that in his highest flights of <lb/>
            rhetoric-and no man ever recommended the unattainable <lb/>
            with a finer grace-Seneca must have felt that he was <lb/>
            labouring to build up a house without foundations; that his <lb/>
            system, as Caius said of his style, was sand without lime. <lb/>
            He was surely not unconscious of the inconsistency of his <lb/>
            own position, as a public man and a minister, with the <lb/>
            theories to which he had wedded himself; and of the im­ <lb/>
            possibility of preserving in it the purity of his character as <lb/>
            a philosopher or a man. He was aware that in the exist­ <lb/>
            ing state of society at Rome, wealth was necessary to men <lb/>
            high in station ; wealth alone could retain influence, and a <lb/>
            poor minister became at once contemptible. The distri­ <lb/>
            butor of the Imperial favours must have his banquets, his <lb/>
            receptions, his slaves and freedmen; he must possess the <lb/>
            means of attracting if not of bribing; he must not seem <lb/>
            too virtuous, too austere, among an evil generation; in <lb/>
            order to do good at all he must swim with the stream, <lb/>
            however polluted it might be. All this inconsistency <lb/>
            Seneca must have contemplated without blenching; and <lb/>
            there is something touching in the serenity he preserved <lb/>
            amidst the conflict that must have perpetually raged be­ <lb/>
            tween his natural sense and his acquired principles. Both <lb/>
            Cicero and Seneca were men of many weaknesses, and we <lb/>
            remark them the more because both were pretenders to <lb/>
            unusual strength of character; but while Cicero lapsed <lb/>
             <pb n="X"/>
            into political errors, Seneca cannot be absolved of actual <lb/>
            crime. Nevertheless, if we may compare the greatest <lb/>
            masters of Roman wisdom together, the Stoic will appear, I <lb/>
            think, the more earnest of the two, the more anxious to do <lb/>
            his duty for its own sake, the more sensible of the claims <lb/>
            of mankind upon him for such precepts of virtuous living <lb/>
            as he had to give. In an age of unbelief and compromise <lb/>
            he taught that Truth was positive and Virtue objective. <lb/>
            He conceived, what never entered Cicero's mind, the idea <lb/>
            of improving his fellow-creatures; he had, what Cicero <lb/>
            had not, a heart for conversion to Christianity."</p>
          <p>To this eloquent account of Seneca's position and of the <lb/>
            tendency of his writings I have nothing to add. The <lb/>
            main particulars of his life, his Spanish extraction (like <lb/>
            that of Lacan and Martial), his father's treatises on <lb/>
            Rhetoric, his mother Helvia, his brothers, his wealth, his <lb/>
            exile in Corsica, his outrageous flattery of Claudius and <lb/>
            his satiric poem on his death—“ The Vision of Judgment," <lb/>
            Merivale calls it, after Lord Byron—his position as Nero's <lb/>
            tutor, and his death, worthy at once of a Roman and a <lb/>
            Stoic, by the orders of that tyrant, may be read of in <lb/>
            " The History of the Romans under the Empire," or in the <lb/>
            article 11 Seneca" in the " Dictionary of Classical Bio­ <lb/>
            graphy," and need not be reproduced here: but I cannot <lb/>
            resist pointing out how entirely Grote's view of the <lb/>
            “ Sophists " as a sort of established clergy, and Seneca's <lb/>
            account of the various sects of philosophers as representing <lb/>
            the religious thought of the time, is illustrated by his <lb/>
            anecdote of Julia Augusta, the mother of Tiberius, better <lb/>
            known to English readers as Livia the wife of Augustus, <lb/>
            who in her first agony of grief at the loss of her first hus­ <lb/>
            band applied to his Greek philosopher, Areus, as to a kind <lb/>
            of domestic chaplain, for spiritual consolation. ("Ad <lb/>
            Marciam de Consolatione," ch. iv.)</p>

          <p>A <lb/>
            MONO- the numerous faults of those who pass their <lb/>
            lives recklessly and without clue reflexion, my good <lb/>
            friend Liberalis, I should say that there is hardly any one <lb/>
            so hurtful to society as this, that we neither know how to <lb/>
            bestow or how to receive a benefit. It follows from this <lb/>
            that benefits are badly invested, and become bad debts: <lb/>
            in these cases it is too late to complain of their not being <lb/>
            returned, for they were thrown away when we bestowed <lb/>
            them. Nor need we wonder that while the greatest vices are <lb/>
            common, none is more common than ingratitude: for this <lb/>
            I see is brought about by various causes. The first of <lb/>
            these is, that we do not choose worthy persons upon whom <lb/>
            to bestow our bounty, but although when we are about to <lb/>
            lend money we first make a careful enquiry into the means <lb/>
            and habits of life of our debtor, and avoid sowing seed in <lb/>
            a worn-out or unfruitful soil, yet without any discrimina­ <lb/>
            tion we scatter our benefits at random rather than bestow <lb/>
            them. It is hard to say whether it is more dishonourable <note type="footnote"> B </note> <pb n="2"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. I.</note>for the receiver to disown a benefit, or for the giver to <lb/>
            demand a return of it: for a benefit is a loan, the repay­ <lb/>
            ment of which depends merely upon the good feeling of the <lb/>
            debtor. To misuse a benefit like a spendthrift is most <lb/>
            shameful, because we do not need our wealth but only our <lb/>
            intention to set us free from the obligation of it; for a <lb/>
            benefit is repaid by being acknowledged. Yet while they <lb/>
            are to blame who do not even show so much gratitude as <lb/>
            to acknowledge their debt, we ourselves are to blame no <lb/>
            less. We And many men ungrateful, yet we make more <lb/>
            men so, because at one time we harshly and reproachfully <lb/>
            demand some return for our bounty, at another we are <lb/>
            fickle and regret what we have given, at another we are <lb/>
            peevish and apt to find fault with trifles. By acting thus <lb/>
            we destroy all sense of gratitude, not only after we have <lb/>
            given anything, but while we are in the act of giving it. <lb/>
            Who has ever thought it enough to be asked for anything <lb/>
            in an off-hand manner, or to be asked only once ? Who, <lb/>
            when he suspected that he was going to be asked for any <lb/>
            thing, has not frowned, turned away his face, pretended to <lb/>
            be busy, or purposely talked without ceasing, in order not <lb/>
            to give his suitor a chance of preferring his request, and <lb/>
            avoided by various tricks having to help his friend in his <lb/>
            pressing need? and when driven into a corner, has not <lb/>
            either put the matter off, that is, given a cowardly re­ <lb/>
            fusal, or promised his help ungraciously, with a wry face, <lb/>
            and with unkind words, of which he seemed to grudge the <lb/>
            utterance. Yet no one is glad to owe what he has not <lb/>
            so much received from his benefactor, as wrung out of <lb/>
            him. Who can be grateful for what has been disdainfully <lb/>
            flung to him, or angrily cast at him, or been given him out <lb/>
            of weariness, to avoid further trouble? No one need <lb/>
            expect any return from those whom he has tired out with <lb/>
            delays, or sickened with expectation. A benefit is received <lb/>
            in the same temper in which it is given, and ought not, <pb n="3"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. I.]</note>therefore, to be given carelessly, for a man thanks him­ <lb/>
            self for that which he receives without the knowledge of <lb/>
            the giver. Neither ought we to give after long delay, <lb/>
            because in all good offices the will of the giver counts for <lb/>
            much, and he who gives tardily must long have been un­ <lb/>
            willing to give at all. Nor, assuredly, ought we to give in <lb/>
            an offensive manner, because human nature is so consti­ <lb/>
            tuted that insults sink deeper than kindnesses; the re­ <lb/>
            membrance of the latter soon passes away, while that of the <lb/>
            former is treasured in the memory; so what can a man <lb/>
            expect who insults while he obliges? All the gratitude <lb/>
            which he deserves is to be forgiven for helping us. On the <lb/>
            other hand, the number of the ungrateful ought not to deter <lb/>
            us from earning men's gratitude; for, in the first place, <lb/>
            their number is increased by our own acts. Secondly, the <lb/>
            sacrilege and indifference to religion of some men does not <lb/>
            prevent even the immortal gods from continuing to shower <lb/>
            their benefits upon us: for they act according to their <lb/>
            divine nature and help all alike, among them even those <lb/>
            who so ill appreciate their bounty. Let us take them for <lb/>
            our guides as far as the weakness of our mortal nature <lb/>
            permits ; let us bestow benefits, not put them out at inte­ <lb/>
            rest. The man who while he gives thinks of what he will <lb/>
            get in return, deserves to be deceived. But what if the belie­ <lb/>
            fit turns out ill ? Why, our wives and our children often <lb/>
            disappoint our hopes, yet we marry and bring up children, <lb/>
            and are so obstinate in the face of experience that we fight <lb/>
            after we have been beaten, and put to sea after we have <lb/>
            been shipwrecked. How much more constancy ought we <lb/>
            to show in bestowing benefits ! If a man does not bestow <lb/>
            benefits because he has not received any, he must have <lb/>
            bestowed them in order to receive them in return, and he <lb/>
            justifies ingratitude, whose disgrace lies in not returning <lb/>
            benefits when able to do so. How many are there who are <lb/>
            mworthy of the light of day? and nevertheless the sun <lb/>
            <pb n="4"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. I.</note>rises. How many complain because they have been born ? <lb/>
            yet Nature is ever renewing our race, and even suffers men <lb/>
            to live who wish that they had never lived. It is the pro­ <lb/>
            perty of a great and good mind to covet, not the fruit of <lb/>
            good deeds, but good deeds themselves, and to seek for a <lb/>
            good man even after having met with bad men. If there <lb/>
            were no rogues, what glory would there be in doing good <lb/>
            to many ? As it is, virtue consists in bestowing benefits <lb/>
            for which we are not certain of meeting with any return, <lb/>
            but whose fruit is at once enjoyed by noble minds. So <lb/>
            little influence ought this to have in restraining us from <lb/>
            doing good actions, that even though I were denied the <lb/>
            hope of meeting with a grateful man, yet the fear of not <lb/>
            having my benefits returned would not prevent my bestow­ <lb/>
            ing them, because he who does not give, forestalls the vice <lb/>
            of him who is ungrateful. I will explain what I mean. <lb/>
            He who does not repay a benefit, sins more, but he who <lb/>
            does not bestow one, sins earlier. <lb/>
            " If thou at random dost thy bounties waste, <lb/>
            Much must be lost, for one that's rightly placed."</p>
          <p>II. In the former verse you may blame two things, for <lb/>
            one should not cast them at random, and it is not right to <lb/>
            waste anything, much less benefits; for unless they be <lb/>
            given with judgement, they cease to be benefits, and may <lb/>
            be called by any other name you please. The meaning of <lb/>
            the latter verse is admirable, that one benefit rightly be­ <lb/>
            stowed makes amends for the loss of many that have been <lb/>
            lost. See, I pray you, whether it be not truer and more <lb/>
            worthy of the glory of the giver, that we should encourage <lb/>
            him to give, even though none of his gifts should be <lb/>
            worthily placed. “Much must be lost." Nothing is lost, <lb/>
            because he who loses had counted the cost before. Thw <lb/>
            book-keeping of benefits is simple: it is all expenditure <lb/>
            if any one returns it, that is clear gain; if he does <unclear>no</unclear> <pb n="5"/>
            <note type="margin">CH. III.]</note> <lb/>
            return it, it is not lost, I gave it for the sake of giving. No <lb/>
            one writes down his gifts in a ledger, or like a grasping <lb/>
            creditor demands repayment to the day and hour. A <lb/>
            good man never thinks of such matters, unless reminded of <lb/>
            them by some one returning his gifts; otherwise they become <lb/>
            like debts owing to him. It is a base usury to regard a <lb/>
            benefit as an investment. Whatever may have been the <lb/>
            result of your former benefits, persevere in bestowing <lb/>
            others upon other men ; they will be all the better placed <lb/>
            in the hands of the ungrateful, whom shame, or a favour­ <lb/>
            able opportunity, or imitation of others may some day <lb/>
            cause to be grateful. Do not grow weary, perform your <lb/>
            duty, and act as becomes a good man. Help one man with <lb/>
            money, another with credit, another with your favour; <lb/>
            this man with good advice, that one with sound maxims. <lb/>
            Even wild beasts feel kindness, nor is there any animal so . <lb/>
            savage that good treatment will not tame it and win love <lb/>
            from it. The mouths of lions are handled by their keepers <lb/>
            with impunity ; to obtain their food fierce elephants become <lb/>
            as docile as slaves: so that constant unceasing kindness <lb/>
            wins the hearts even of creatures who, by their nature, <lb/>
            cannot comprehend or weigh the value of a benefit. Is a <lb/>
            man ungrateful for one benefit ? perhaps he will not be so <lb/>
            after receiving a second. Has he forgotten two kind­ <lb/>
            nesses ? perhaps by a third he may be brought to remem. <lb/>
            ber the former ones also.</p>
          <p>III. He who is quick to believe that he has thrown away <lb/>
            his benefits, does really throw them away; but he who <lb/>
            presses on and adds new benefits to his former ones, forces <lb/>
            out gratitude even from a hard and forgetful breast. In <lb/>
            the face of many kindnesses, your friend will not dare to <lb/>
            raise his eyes; let him see you whithersoever he turns him­ <lb/>
            self to escape from his remembrance of you; encircle <lb/>
            him with your benefits. As for the power and pro­ <lb/>
            perty of these, I will explain it to you if first you will <lb/>
            <pb n="6"/>
            <note type="margin">[BK. I.</note><lb/>
            allow me to glance at a matter which does not belong to <lb/>
            our subject, as to why the Graces are three in number, <lb/>
            why they are sisters, why hand in hand, and why they are <lb/>
            smiling and young, with a loose and transparent dress. <lb/>
            Some writers think that there is one who bestows a benefit, <lb/>
            one who receives it, and a third who returns it; others <lb/>
            say that they represent the three sorts of benefactors, those <lb/>
            who bestow, those who repay, and those who both receive <lb/>
            and repay them. But take whichever you please to be <lb/>
            true; what will this knowledge profit us ? What is the <lb/>
            meaning of this dance of sisters in a circle, hand in hand ? <lb/>
            It means that the course of a benefit is from hand to hand, <lb/>
            back to the giver; that the beauty of the whole chain is <lb/>
            lost if a single link fails, and that it is fairest when it pro­ <lb/>
            ceeds in unbroken regular order. In the dance there is one <lb/>
            esteemed beyond the others, who represents the givers of <lb/>
            benefits. Their faces are cheerful, as those of men who give <lb/>
            or receive benefits are wont to be. They are young, because <lb/>
            the memory of benefits ought not to grow old. They are <lb/>
            virgins, because benefits are pure and untainted, and held <lb/>
            holy by all; in benefits there should be no strict or binding <lb/>
            conditions, therefore the Graces wear loose flowing tunics, <lb/>
            which are transparent, because benefits love to be seen. <lb/>
            People who are not under the influence of Greek literature <lb/>
            may say that all this is a matter of course; but there can <lb/>
            be no one who would think that the names which Hesiod <lb/>
            has given them bear upon our subject. He named the <lb/>
            eldest Aglaia, the middle one Euphrosyne, the third Thalia. <lb/>
            Every one, according to his own ideas, twists the meaning <lb/>
            of these names, trying to reconcile them with some system, <lb/>
            though Hesiod merely gave his maidens their names from <lb/>
            his own fancy. So Homer altered the name of one of them, <lb/>
            naming her Pasithea, and betrothed her to a husband, in <lb/>
            order that you may know that they are not vestal virgins.' <note type="footnote"> 1 i.e. not vowed to chastity. </note> <pb n="7"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. IV.]</note><lb/>
            I could find another poet, in whose writings they are girded, <lb/>
            and wear thick or embroidered Phrygian robes. Mercury <lb/>
            stands with them for the same reason, not because argu­ <lb/>
            ment or eloquence commends benefits, but because the <lb/>
            painter chose to do so. Also Chrysippus, that man of <lb/>
            piercing intellect who saw to the very bottom of truth, who <lb/>
            speaks only to the point, and makes use of no more words <lb/>
            than are necessary to express his meaning, fills his whole <lb/>
            treatise with these puerilities, insomuch that he says but <lb/>
            very little about the duties of giving, receiving, and return­ <lb/>
            ing a benefit, and has not so much inserted fables among <lb/>
            these subjects, as he has inserted these subjects among a <lb/>
            mass of fables. For, not to mention what Hecaton borrows <lb/>
            from him, Chrysippus tells us that the three Graces are the <lb/>
            daughters of Jupiter and Eurynome, that they are younger <lb/>
            than the Hours, and rather more beautiful, and that on <lb/>
            that account they are assigned as companions to Venus. <lb/>
            He also thinks that the name of their mother bears upon <lb/>
            the subject, and that she is named Eurynome because to <lb/>
            distribute benefits requires a wide inheritance; as if the <lb/>
            mother usually received her name after her daughters, or as <lb/>
            if the names given by poets were true. In truth, j ust as with <lb/>
            a' nomenclator' audacity supplies the place of memory, and <lb/>
            he invents a name for every one whose name he cannot re­ <lb/>
            collect, so the poets think that it is of no importance to <lb/>
            speak the truth, but are either forced by the exigencies of <lb/>
            metre, or attracted by sweetness of sound, into calling every <lb/>
            one by whatever name runs neatly into verse. Nor do <lb/>
            they suffer for it if they introduce another, name into the <lb/>
            list, for the next poet makes them bear what name he <lb/>
            pleases. That you may know that this is so, for instance <lb/>
            Thalia, our present subject of discourse, is one of the Graces <lb/>
            in Hesiod's poems, while in those of Homer she is one of <lb/>
            the Muses.</p>
          <p>TV. But lest I should do the very thing which I am <pb n="8"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. I.</note><lb/>
            blaming, I will pass over all these matters, which are so <lb/>
            far from the subject that they are not even connected with <lb/>
            it. Only do you protect me, if any one attacks me for <lb/>
            putting down Chrysippus, who, by Hercules, was a great <lb/>
            man, but yet a Greek, whose intellect, too sharply pointed, <lb/>
            is often bent and turned back upon itself; even when it <lb/>
            seems to be in earnest it only pricks, but does not pierce. <lb/>
            Here, however, what occasion is there for subtlety ? We <lb/>
            are to speak of benefits, and to define a matter which <lb/>
            is the chief bond of human society; we are to lay down <lb/>
            a rule of life, such that neither careless openhandedness <lb/>
            may commend itself to us under the guise of goodness <lb/>
            of heart, and yet that our circumspection, while it mode­ <lb/>
            rates, may not quench our generosity, a quality in which <lb/>
            we ought neither to exceed nor to fall short. Men must <lb/>
            be taught to be willing to give, willing to receive, willing <lb/>
            to return; and to place before themselves the high aim, <lb/>
            not merely of equalling, but even of surpassing those to <lb/>
            whom they are indebted, both in good offices and in good <lb/>
            feeling; because the man whose duty it is to repay, can <lb/>
            never do so unless he out-does his benefactor;1 the one <lb/>
            class must be taught to look for no return, the other to <lb/>
            feel deeper gratitude. In this noblest of contests to outdo <lb/>
            benefits by benefits, Chrysippus encourages us by bidding <lb/>
            us beware lest, as the Graces are the daughters of Jupiter, <lb/>
            to act ungratefully may not be a sin against them, and <lb/>
            may not wrong those beauteous maidens. Do thou teach <lb/>
            me how I may bestow more good things, and be more <lb/>
            grateful to those who have earned my gratitude, and how <lb/>
            the minds of both parties may vie- with one another, the <lb/>
            giver in forgetting, the receiver in remembering his debt. <lb/>
            As for those other follies, let them be left to the poets, <lb/>
            whose purpose is merely to charm the ear and to weave a <note type="footnote"> 1 That is, he never comes up to his benefactor unless he leaves him <lb/>
            behind: he can only make a dead heat of it by getting a start. </note> <pb n="9"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. V.]</note><lb/>
            pleasing story; but let those who wish to purify men's <lb/>
            minds, to retain honour in their dealings, and to imprint <lb/>
            on their minds gratitude for kindnesses, let them speak in <lb/>
            sober earnest and act with all their strength ; unless you <lb/>
            imagine, perchance, that by such flippant and mythical <lb/>
            talk, and such old wives' reasoning, it is possible for us to <lb/>
            prevent that most ruinous consummation, the repudiation <lb/>
            of benefits.</p>
          <p>V, However, while I pass over what is futile and irrele­ <lb/>
            vant, I must point out that the first thing which we have <lb/>
            to learn is, what we owe in return for a benefit received. <lb/>
            One man says that he owes the money which he has re­ <lb/>
            ceived, another that he owes a consulship, a priesthood, a <lb/>
            province, and so on. These, however, are but the outward <lb/>
            signs of kindnesses, not the kindnesses themselves. A <lb/>
            benefit is not to be felt and handled, it is a thing which <lb/>
            exists only in the mind. There is a great difference be­ <lb/>
            tween the subject-matter of a benefit, and the benefit <lb/>
            itself. Wherefore neither gold, nor silver, nor any of those <lb/>
            things which are most highly esteemed, are benefits, but the <lb/>
            benefit lies in the goodwill of him who gives them. The <lb/>
            ignorant take notice only of that which comes before their <lb/>
            eyes, and which can be owned and passed from hand to hand, <lb/>
            while they disregard that which gives these things their value. <lb/>
            The things which we hold in our hands, which we see with <lb/>
            our eyes, and which our avarice hugs, are transitory, they <lb/>
            may be taken from us by ill luck or by violence; but a <lb/>
            kindness lasts even after the loss of that by means of <lb/>
            which it was bestowed; for it is a good deed, which no <lb/>
            violence can undo, For instance, suppose that I ransomed <lb/>
            a friend from pirates, but another pirate has caught him <lb/>
            and thrown him into prison. The pirate has not robbed <lb/>
            him of my benefit, but has only robbed him of the <lb/>
            enjoyment of it. Or suppose that I have saved a man's <lb/>
            children from a shipwreck or a fire, and that afterwards <pb n="10"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. I.</note><lb/>
            disease or accident has carried them off; even when they <lb/>
            are no more, the kindness which was done by means of <lb/>
            them remains. All those things, therefore, which im­ <lb/>
            properly assume the name of benefits, are means by which <lb/>
            kindly feeling manifests itself. In other cases also, we <lb/>
            find a distinction between the visible symbol. and the <lb/>
            matter itself, as when a general bestows collars of gold, <lb/>
            or civic or mural crowns upon any one. What value <lb/>
            has the crown in itself ? or the purple-bordered robe ? or <lb/>
            the fasces? or the judgment-seat and car of triumph? <lb/>
            None of these things is in itself an honour, but is an <lb/>
            emblem of honour. In like manner, that which is seen is <lb/>
            not a benefit—it is but the trace and mark of a benefit.</p>
          <p>VI. What, then, is a benefit ? It is the art of doing a <lb/>
            kindness which both bestows pleasure and gains it by be­ <lb/>
            stowing it, and which does its office by natural and spon. <lb/>
            taneous impulse. It is not, therefore, the thing which is <lb/>
            done or given, but the spirit in which it is done or given, <lb/>
            that must be considered, because a benefit exists, not in <lb/>
            I that which is done or given, but in the mind of the doer <lb/>
            I or giver. How great the distinction between them is, you <lb/>
            may perceive from this, that while a benefit is necessarily <lb/>
            good, yet that which is done or given is neither good nor <lb/>
            bad. The spirit in which they are given can exalt small <lb/>
            things, can glorify mean ones, and can discredit great and <lb/>
            precious ones; the objects themselves which are sought <lb/>
            after have a neutral nature, neither good nor bad; all <lb/>
            depends upon the direction given them by the guiding <lb/>
            spirit from which things receive their shape. That which <lb/>
            is paid or handed over is not the benefit itself, just as the <lb/>
            honour which we pay to the gods lies not in the victims <lb/>
            themselves, although they be fat and glittering with gold,, <lb/>
            but in the pure and holy feelings of the worshippers. <note type="footnote"> 1 Alluding to the practice of gilding the horns of the victims. </note> <lb/>
            <pb n="11"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. VII.]</note><lb/>
            Thus good men are religious, though their offering be <lb/>
            meal and their vessels of earthenware; whilst bad men will <lb/>
            not escape from their impiety, though they pour the blood <lb/>
            of many victims upon the altars.</p>
          <p>VII. If benefits consisted of things, and not of the wish <lb/>
            to benefit, then the more things we received the greater <lb/>
            the benefit would be. But this is not true, for sometimes <lb/>
            we feel more gratitude to one who gives us trifles nobly, <lb/>
            one who, like Virgil's poor old soldier, " holds himself as <lb/>
            rich as kings," if he has given us ever so little with a good <lb/>
            will; a man who forgets his own need when he sees mine, <lb/>
            who has not only a wish but a longing to help, who thinks <lb/>
            that he receives a benefit when he bestows one, who gives <lb/>
            as though he would receive no return, receives a repay­ <lb/>
            ment as though he had originally given nothing, and who <lb/>
            watches for and seizes an opportunity of being useful. <lb/>
            On the other hand, as I said before, those gifts which are <lb/>
            hardly wrung from the giver, or which drop unheeded <lb/>
            from his hands, claim no gratitude from us, however great <lb/>
            they may appear and may be. We prize much more what <lb/>
            comes from a willing hand, than what comes from a full <lb/>
            one. This man has given me but little, yet more he <lb/>
            could not afford, while what that one has given is much <lb/>
            indeed, but he hesitated, he put it off, he grumbled when <lb/>
            he gave it, he gave it haughtily, or he proclaimed it aloud, <lb/>
            and did it to please others, not to please the person to <lb/>
            whom he gave it; he offered it to his own pride, not to me.</p>
          <p>VIII. As the pupils of Socrates, each in proportion to <lb/>
            his means, gave him large presents, Aeschines, a poor pupil, <lb/>
            said, " 1 can find nothing to give you which is worthy of <lb/>
            you ; I feel my poverty in this respect alone. Therefore I <lb/>
            present you with the only thing I possess, myself. I pray <lb/>
            that you may take this my present, such as it is, in good <lb/>
            part, and may remember that the others, although they <lb/>
            gave you much, yet left for themselves more than they <pb n="12"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. I.</note><lb/>
            gave." Socrates answered, " Surely you have bestowed a <lb/>
            great present upon me, unless perchance you set a small <lb/>
            value upon yourself. I will accordingly take pains to <lb/>
            restore you to yourself a better man than when I received <lb/>
            you." By- this present Aeschines outdid Alcibiades, whose <lb/>
            mind was as great as his wealth, and all the splendour of <lb/>
            the most wealthy youths of Athens.</p>
          <p>IX. You see how the mind even in the straitest circum­ <lb/>
            stances finds the means of generosity. Aeschines seems to <lb/>
            me to have said, “Fortune, it is in vain that you have <lb/>
            made me poor; in spite of this I will find a worthy pre­ <lb/>
            sent for this man. Since I can give him nothing of yours, I <lb/>
            will give him something of my own." Nor need you sup­ <lb/>
            pose that he held himself cheap ; he made himself his own <lb/>
            price. By a stroke of genius this youth discovered a means <lb/>
            of presenting Socrates to himself. We must not consider <lb/>
            how great presents are, but in what spirit they are given.</p>
          <p>A rich man is well spoken of if he is clever enough to <lb/>
            render himself easy of access to men of immoderate ambi­ <lb/>
            tion, and although he intends to do nothing to help them, <lb/>
            yet encourages their unconscionable hopes; but he is <lb/>
            thought the worse of if he be sharp of tongue, sour in <lb/>
            appearance, and displays his wealth in an invidious fashion. <lb/>
            For men respect and yet loathe a fortunate man, and hate <lb/>
            him for doing what, if they had the chance, they would do <lb/>
            themselves.</p>
          <p>Men nowadays no longer secretly, but openly outrage <lb/>
            the wives of others, and allow to others access to their own <lb/>
            wives. A match is thought countrified, uncivilized, in bad <lb/>
            style, and to be protested against by all matrons, if the hus­ <lb/>
            band should forbid his wife to appear in public in a litter, <lb/>
            and to be carried about exposed to the gaze of all observers. <lb/>
            If a man has not made himself notorious by a liaison with <lb/>
            some mistress, if he does not pay an annuity to some one <pb n="13"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. X.]</note><lb/>
            else's wife, married women speak of him as a poor-spirited <lb/>
            creature, a man given to low vice, a lover of servant girls. <lb/>
            Soon adultery becomes the most respectable form of mar. <lb/>
            riage, and widowhood and celibacy are commonly practised. <lb/>
            No one takes a wife unless he takes her away from some <lb/>
            one else. Now men vie with one another in wasting what <lb/>
            they have stolen, and in collecting together what they have <lb/>
            wasted with the keenest avarice; they become utterly <lb/>
            reckless, scorn poverty in others, fear personal injury more <lb/>
            than anything else, break the peace by their riots, and by <lb/>
            violence and terror domineer over those who are weaker <lb/>
            than themselves. No wonder that they plunder provinces <lb/>
            and offer the seat of judgment for sale, knocking it down <lb/>
            after an auction to the highest bidder, since it is the law <lb/>
            of nations that you may sell what you have bought.</p>
          <p>X. However, my enthusiasm has carried me further <lb/>
            than I intended, the subject being an inviting one. Let <lb/>
            me, then, end by pointing out that the disgrace of these <lb/>
            crimes does not belong especially to our own time. Our <lb/>
            ancestors before us have lamented, and our children after <lb/>
            us will lament, as we do, the ruin of morality, the preva­ <lb/>
            lence of vice, and the gradual deterioration of mankind ; <lb/>
            yet these things are really stationary, only moved slightly <lb/>
            to and fro like the waves which at one time a rising tide <lb/>
            washes further over the land, and at another an ebbing <lb/>
            one restrains within a lower water mark. At one time the <lb/>
            chief vice will be adultery, and licentiousness will exceed <lb/>
            all bounds; at another time a rage for feasting will be in <lb/>
            vogue, and men will waste their inheritance in the most <lb/>
            shameful of all ways, by the kitchen; at another, exces­ <lb/>
            sive care for the body, and a devotion to personal beauty <lb/>
            which implies ugliness of mind ; at another time, injudi­ <lb/>
            ciously granted liberty will show itself in wanton reckless­ <lb/>
            ness and defiance of authority; sometimes there will be a <lb/>
            reign of cruelty both in public and private, and the mad­ <pb n="14"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. I.</note><lb/>
            ness of the civil wars will come upon us, which destroy all <lb/>
            that is holy and inviolable. Sometimes even drunkenness <lb/>
            will be held in honour, and it will be a virtue to swallow <lb/>
            most wine. Vices do not lie in wait for us in one place <lb/>
            alone, but hover around us in changeful forms, sometimes <lb/>
            even at variance one with another, so that in turn they <lb/>
            win and lose the field; yet we shall always be obliged <lb/>
            to pronounce the same verdict upon ourselves, that we <lb/>
            are and always were evil, and, I unwillingly add, that <lb/>
            we always shall be. There always will be homicides, <lb/>
            tyrants, thieves, adulterers, ravishers, sacrilegious, traitors: <lb/>
            worse than all these is the ungrateful man, except we con­ <lb/>
            sider that all these crimes flow from ingratitude, without <lb/>
            which hardly any great wickedness has ever grown to full <lb/>
            stature. Be sure that you guard against this as the greatest <lb/>
            of crimes in yourself, but pardon it as the least of crimes <lb/>
            in another. For all the injury which you suffer is this: you <lb/>
            have lost the subject-matter of a benefit, not the benefit it­ <lb/>
            self, for you possess unimpaired the best part of it, in that <lb/>
            you have given it. Though we ought to be careful to bestow <lb/>
            our benefits by preference upon those who are likely to <lb/>
            show us gratitude for them, yet we must sometimes do <lb/>
            what we have little hope will turn out well, and bestow <lb/>
            benefits upon those who we not only think will prove <lb/>
            ungrateful, but who we know have been so. For instance, <lb/>
            if I should be able to save a man's children from a great <lb/>
            danger with no risk to myself, I should not hesitate to do <lb/>
            so. If a man be worthy I would defend him even with <lb/>
            my blood, and would share his perils ; if he be unworthy, <lb/>
            and yet by merely crying for help I can rescue him from <lb/>
            robbers, I would without reluctance raise the shout which <lb/>
            would save a fellow-creature.</p>
          <p>XI. The next point to be defined is, what kind of bene­ <lb/>
            fits are to be given, and in what manner. First let us <lb/>
            give what is necessary, next what is useful, and then what <pb n="15"/>
            <note type="margin">CH. XI.]</note><lb/>
            is pleasant, provided that they be lasting. We must begin <lb/>
            with what is necessary, for those things which support life <lb/>
            affect the mind very differently from those which adorn <lb/>
            and improve it. A man may be nice, and hard to please, <lb/>
            in things which he can easily do without, of which he can <lb/>
            say, " Take them back ; I do not want them, I am satis. <lb/>
            fied with what I have." Sometimes we wish not only to <lb/>
            return what we have received, but even to throw it away. <lb/>
            Of necessary things, the first class consists of things with­ <lb/>
            out which we cannot live; the second, of things without <lb/>
            which we ought not to live; and the third, of things with­ <lb/>
            out which we should not care to live. The first class are, <lb/>
            to be saved from the hands of the enemy, from the anger <lb/>
            of tyrants, from proscription, and the various other perils <lb/>
            which beset human life. By averting any one of these, we <lb/>
            shall earn gratitude proportionate to the greatness of the <lb/>
            danger, for when men think of the greatness of the misery <lb/>
            from which they have been saved, the terror which they <lb/>
            have gone through enhances the value of our services. <lb/>
            Yet we ought not to delay rescuing any one longer than <lb/>
            we are obliged, solely in order to make his fears add <lb/>
            weight to our services. Next come those things with­ <lb/>
            out which we can indeed live, but in such a manner that <lb/>
            it would be better to die, such as liberty, chastity, or a <lb/>
            good conscience. After these are what we have come to <lb/>
            hold dear by connexion and relationship and long use and <lb/>
            custom, such as our wives and children, our household <lb/>
            gods, and so on, to which the mind so firmly attaches itself <lb/>
            that separation from them seems worse than death.</p>
          <p>After these come useful things, which form a very wide <lb/>
            and varied class; in which will be money, not in excess, <lb/>
            but enough for living in a moderate style; public office, <lb/>
            and, for the ambitious, due advancement to higher posts ; <lb/>
            for nothing can be more useful to a man than to be <lb/>
            placed in a position in which he can benefit himself. All <pb n="16"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. I.</note><lb/>
            benefits beyond these are superfluous, and are likely to <lb/>
            spoil those who receive them. In giving these we must <lb/>
            be careful to make them acceptable by giving them at the <lb/>
            appropriate time, or by giving things which are not common, <lb/>
            but such as few people possess, or at any rate few possess in <lb/>
            our times; or again, by giving things in such a mauner, <lb/>
            that though not naturally valuable, they become so by the <lb/>
            time and place at which they are given. We must reflect <lb/>
            what present will produce the most pleasure, what will <lb/>
            most frequently come under the notice of the possessor of <lb/>
            it, so that whenever he is with it he may be with us also ; <lb/>
            and in all cases we must be careful not to send useless <lb/>
            presents, such as hunting weapons to a woman or old man, <lb/>
            or books to a rustic, or nets to catch wild animals to a <lb/>
            quiet literary man. On the other hand, we ought to be <lb/>
            careful, while we wish to send what will please, that we <lb/>
            do not send what will insultingly remind our friends of <lb/>
            their failings, as, for example, if we send wine to a hard <lb/>
            drinker or drugs to an invalid, for a present which con­ <lb/>
            tains an allusion to the shortcomings of the receiver, <lb/>
            becomes an outrage.</p>
          <p>XII. If we have a free choice as to what to give, we <lb/>
            should above all choose lasting presents, in order that our <lb/>
            gift may endure as long as possible; for few are so grate­ <lb/>
            ful as to think of what they have received, even when they <lb/>
            do not see it. Even the ungrateful remember us by our <lb/>
            gifts, when they are always in their sight and do not allow <lb/>
            themselves to be forgotten, but constantly obtrude and <lb/>
            stamp upon the mind the memory of the giver. As we <lb/>
            never ought to remind men of what we have given them, <lb/>
            we ought all the more to choose presents that will be per­ <lb/>
            manent ; for the things themselves will prevent the remem­ <lb/>
            brance of the giver from fading away. I would more wil­ <lb/>
            lingly give a present of plate than of coined money, and <lb/>
            would more willingly give statues than clothes or other <pb n="17"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XIII.]</note><lb/>
            things which are soon worn out. Few remain grateful after <lb/>
            the present is gone: many more remember their presents <lb/>
            only while they make use of them. If possible, I should <lb/>
            like my present not to be consumed ; let it remain in exis­ <lb/>
            tence, let it stick to my friend and share his life. No one <lb/>
            is so foolish as to need to be told not to send gladiators or <lb/>
            wild beasts to one who has just given a public show, or not <lb/>
            to send summer clothing in winter time, or winter clothing <lb/>
            in summer. Common sense must guide our benefits; we <lb/>
            must consider the time and the place, and the character of <lb/>
            the receiver, which are the weights in the scale, which cause <lb/>
            our gifts to be well or ill received. How far more accept­ <lb/>
            able a present is, if we give a man what he has not, than <lb/>
            if we give him what he has plenty of! if we give him <lb/>
            what he has long been searching for in vain, rather than <lb/>
            what he sees everywhere! Let us make presents of things <lb/>
            which are rare and scarce rather than costly, things which <lb/>
            even a rich man will be glad of, just as common fruits, <lb/>
            such as we tire of after a few days, please us if they <lb/>
            have ripened before the usual season. People will also <lb/>
            esteem things which no one else has given to them, or <lb/>
            which we have given to no one else.</p>
          <p>XIII. When the conquest of the East had flattered <lb/>
            Alexander of Macedon into believing himself to be more <lb/>
            than man, the people of Corinth sent an embassy to con­ <lb/>
            gratulate him, and presented him with the franchise of <lb/>
            their city. When Alexander smiled at this form of cour­ <lb/>
            tesy, one of the ambassadors said, " We have never en­ <lb/>
            rolled any stranger among our citizens except Hercules and <lb/>
            yourself." Alexander willingly accepted the proffered <lb/>
            honour, invited the ambassadors to his table, and showed <lb/>
            them other courtesies. He did not think of who offered the <lb/>
            citizenship, but to whom they had granted it; and being <lb/>
            altogether the slave of glory, though he knew neither its <lb/>
            true nature or its limits, had followed in the footsteps of <note type="footnote"> c </note> <pb n="18"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. I.</note><lb/>
            Hercules and Bacchus, and had not even stayed his march <lb/>
            where they ceased; so that he glanced aside from the givers <lb/>
            of this honour to him with whom he shared it, and fancied <lb/>
            that the heaven to which his vanity aspired was indeed <lb/>
            opening before him when he was made equal to Hercules. <lb/>
            In what indeed did that frantic youth, whose only merit <lb/>
            was his lucky audacity, resemble Hercules ? Hercules <lb/>
            conquered nothing for himself; he travelled throughout <lb/>
            the world, not coveting for himself but liberating the <lb/>
            countries which he conquered, an enemy to bad men, a <lb/>
            defender of the good, a peacemaker both by sea and land ; <lb/>
            whereas the other was from his boyhood a brigand and <lb/>
            desolator of nations, a pest to his friends and enemies alike, <lb/>
            whose greatest joy was to be the terror of all mankind, <lb/>
            forgetting that men fear not only the fiercest but also the <lb/>
            most cowardly animals, because of their evil and venomous <lb/>
            nature.</p>
          <p>XIV. Let us now return to our subject. He who bestows <lb/>
            a benefit without discrimination, gives what pleases no <lb/>
            one ; no one considers himself to be under any obligation <lb/>
            to the landlord of a tavern, or to be the guest of any one <lb/>
            with whom he dines in such company as to be able to say, <lb/>
            " What civility has he shown to me ? no more than he has <lb/>
            shown to that man, whom he scarcely knows, or to that <lb/>
            other, who is both his personal enemy and a man of infa­ <lb/>
            mous character. Do you suppose that he wished to do me <lb/>
            any honour ? not so, he merely wished to indulge his own <lb/>
            vice of profusion." If you wish men to be grateful for <lb/>
            anything, give it but seldom ; no one can bear to receive <lb/>
            what you give to all the world. Yet let no one gather from <lb/>
            this that I wish to impose any bonds upon generosity; let <lb/>
            her go to what lengths she will, so that she go a steady <lb/>
            course, not at random. It is possible to bestow gifts in <lb/>
            such a manner that each of those who receive them, al­ <lb/>
            though he shares them with many others, may yet feel <pb n="19"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XV.]</note><lb/>
            himself to be distinguished from the common herd. Let <lb/>
            each man have some peculiarity about his gift which may <lb/>
            make him consider himself more highly favoured than the <lb/>
            rest. He may say, " I received the same present that he <lb/>
            did, but I never asked for it." 11 I received the same pre­ <lb/>
            sent, but mine was given me after a few days, whereas he <lb/>
            had earned it by long service." “ Others have the same <lb/>
            present, but it was not given to them with the same cour­ <lb/>
            tesy and gracious words with which it was given to me." <lb/>
            “ That man got it because he asked for it; I did not ask." <lb/>
            “ That man received it as well as I, but then he could easily <lb/>
            return it; one has great expectations from a rich man, old <lb/>
            and childless, as he is; whereas in giving the same present <lb/>
            to me he really gave more, because he gave it without the hope <lb/>
            of receiving any return for it." Just as a courtesan divides <lb/>
            her favours among many men, so that no one of her friends <lb/>
            is without some proof of her affection, so let him who wishes <lb/>
            his benefits to be prized consider how he may at the same <lb/>
            time gratify many men, and nevertheless give each one of <lb/>
            them some especial mark of favour to distinguish him <lb/>
            from the rest.</p>
          <p>XV. I am no advocate of slackness in giving benefits: <lb/>
            the more and the greater they are, the more praise they <lb/>
            will bring to the giver. Yet let them be given with <lb/>
            discretion ; for what is given carelessly and recklessly can <lb/>
            please no one. Whoever, therefore, supposes that in giving <lb/>
            this advice I wish to restrict benevolence and to confine it <lb/>
            to narrower limits, entirely mistakes the object of my <lb/>
            warning. What virtue do we admire more than benevo­ <lb/>
            lence ? Which do we encourage more ? Who ought to <lb/>
            applaud it more than we Stoics, who preach the brother­ <lb/>
            hood of the human race ? What then is it ? Since no im­ <lb/>
            pulse of the human mind can be approved of, even though <lb/>
            it springs from a right feeling, unless it be made into a <lb/>
            virtue by discretion, I forbid generosity to degenerate into <pb n="20"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. I.</note><lb/>
            extravagance. It is, indeed, pleasant to receive a benefit <lb/>
            with open arms, when reason bestows it upon the worthy, <lb/>
            not when it is flung hither or thither thoughtlessly and at <lb/>
            random; this alone we care to display and claim as our <lb/>
            own. Can you call anything a benefit, if you feel ashamed <lb/>
            to mention the person who gave it you ? How far more <lb/>
            grateful is a benefit, how far more deeply does it impress <lb/>
            itself upon the mind, never to be forgotten, when we <lb/>
            rejoice to think not so much of what it is, as from whom <lb/>
            we have received it! Crispus Passienus was wont to say <lb/>
            that some men's advice was to be preferred to their pre­ <lb/>
            sents, some men's presents to their advice ; and he added <lb/>
            as an example, “I would rather have received advice <lb/>
            from Augustus than a present; I would rather receive a <lb/>
            present from Claudius than advice." I, however, think that <lb/>
            one ought not to wish for a benefit from any man whose <lb/>
            judgement is worthless. What then ? Ought we not to <lb/>
            receive what Claudius gives? We ought; but we ought <lb/>
            to regard it as obtained from fortune, which may at any <lb/>
            moment turn against us. Why do we separate this which <lb/>
            naturally is connected ? That is not a benefit, to which the <lb/>
            best part of a benefit, that it be bestowed with judgment, <lb/>
            is wanting: a really great sum of money, if it be given <lb/>
            neither with discernment nor with good will, is no more a <lb/>
            benefit than if it remained hoarded. There are, however, <lb/>
            many things which we ought not to reject, yet for which <lb/>
            we cannot feel indebted.</p><pb n="21"/>

          <p>L <lb/>
            ET us consider, most excellent Liberalis, what still <lb/>
            remains of the earlier part of the subject; in what <lb/>
            way a benefit should be bestowed. I think that I can <lb/>
            point out the shortest way to this ; let us give in the way <lb/>
            in which we ourselves should like to receive. Above all <lb/>
            we should give willingly, quickly, and without any hesita. <lb/>
            tion ; a benefit commands no gratitude if it has hung foi <lb/>
            a long time in the hands of the giver, if he seems unwilling <lb/>
            to part with it, and gives it as though he were being robbed <lb/>
            of it. Even though some delay should intervene, let us <lb/>
            by all means in our power strive not to seem to have been <lb/>
            in two minds about giving it at alL To hesitate is the <lb/>
            next thing to refusing to give, and destroys all claim to <lb/>
            gratitude. For just as the. sweetest part of a benefit is the <lb/>
            kindly feeling of the giver, it follows that one who has by <lb/>
            his very delay proved that he gives unwillingly, must be <lb/>
            regarded not as having given anything, but as having been <lb/>
            unable to keep it from an importunate suitor. Indeed, <lb/>
            many men are made generous by want of firmness. The <lb/>
            most acceptable benefits are those which are waiting for <lb/>
            us to take them, which are easy to be received, and offer <lb/>
            themselves to us, so that the only delay is caused by the <lb/>
            modesty of the receiver. The best thing of all is to antici­ <lb/>
            pate a person's wishes; the next, to follow them: the former <lb/>
            is the better course, to be beforehand with our friends by <lb/>
            giving them what they want before they ask us for it, for <pb n="22"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. II.</note><lb/>
            the value of a gift is much enhanced by sparing an honest <lb/>
            man the misery of asking for it with confusion and blushes. <lb/>
            He who gets what he asked for does not get it for nothing, <lb/>
            for indeed, as our austere ancestors thought, nothing is so <lb/>
            dear as that which is bought by prayers. Men would be <lb/>
            much more modest in their petitions to heaven, if these had <lb/>
            to be made publicly; so that even when addressing the <lb/>
            gods, before whom we can with all honour bend our knees, <lb/>
            we prefer to pray silently and within ourselves.</p>
          <p>II. It is unpleasant, burdensome, and covers one with <lb/>
            shame to have to say, " Give me." You should spare your <lb/>
            friends, and those whom you wish to make your friends, <lb/>
            from having to do this; however quick he may be, a man <lb/>
            gives too late who gives what he has been asked for. We <lb/>
            ought, therefore, to divine every man's wishes, and when <lb/>
            we have discovered them, to set him free from the hard <lb/>
            necessity of asking; you may be sure that a benefit which <lb/>
            comes unasked will be delightful and will not be forgotten. <lb/>
            If we do not succeed in anticipating our friends, let us at <lb/>
            any rate cut them short when they ask us for anything, so <lb/>
            that we may appear to be reminded of what we meant to <lb/>
            do, rather than to have been asked to do it. Let us assent <lb/>
            at once, and by our promptness make it appear that we <lb/>
            meant to do so even before we were solicited. As in deal­ <lb/>
            ing with sick persons much depends upon when food is <lb/>
            given, and plain water given at the right moment some­ <lb/>
            times acts as a remedy, so a benefit, however slight and <lb/>
            commonplace it may be, if it be promptly given without <lb/>
            losing a moment of time, gains enormously in importance, <lb/>
            and wins OUT gratitude more than a far more valuable <lb/>
            present given after long waiting and deliberation. One <lb/>
            who gives so readily must needs give with good will; he <lb/>
            therefore gives cheerfully and shows his disposition in his <lb/>
            countenance.</p>
          <p>III. Many who bestow immense benefits spoil them by <pb n="23"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. IV.]</note><lb/>
            their silence or slowness of speech, which gives them an ; <lb/>
            air of moroseness, as they say " yes " with a face which <lb/>
            seems to say " no." How much better is it to join kind <lb/>
            words to kind actions, and to enhance the value of our <lb/>
            gifts by a civil and gracious commendation of them I To <lb/>
            cure your friend of being slow to ask a favour of you, you <lb/>
            may join to your gift the familiar rebuke, " I am angry <lb/>
            with you for not having long ago let me know what you <lb/>
            wanted, for having asked for it so formally, or for having <lb/>
            made interest with a third party." “ I congratulate my­ <lb/>
            self that you have been pleased to make trial of me; here­ <lb/>
            after, if you want anything, ask for it as your right; how­ <lb/>
            ever, for this time I pardon your want of manners." By <lb/>
            so doing you will cause him to value your friendship more <lb/>
            highly than that, whatever it may have been, which he <lb/>
            came to ask of you. The goodness and kindness of a bene. <lb/>
            factor never appears so great as when on leaving him one <lb/>
            says, " I have to-day gained much; I am more pleased at <lb/>
            finding him so kind than if I had obtained many times <lb/>
            more of this, of which I was speaking, by some other <lb/>
            means; I never can make any adequate return to this man <lb/>
            for his goodness."</p>
          <p>IV. Many, however, there are who, by harsh words and <lb/>
            contemptuous manner, make their very kindnesses odious, <lb/>
            for by speaking and acting disdainfully they make us <lb/>
            sorry that they have granted our requests. Various delays <lb/>
            also take place after we have obtained a promise; and <lb/>
            nothing is more heartbreaking than to be forced to beg <lb/>
            for the very thing which you already have been promised.- <lb/>
            Benefits ought to be bestowed at once, but from some <lb/>
            persons it is easier to obtain the promise of them than to <lb/>
            get them. One mail has to be asked to remind our bene­ <lb/>
            factor of his purpose; another, to bring it into effect; and <lb/>
            thus a single present is worn away in passing through <lb/>
            many hands, until hardly any gratitude is left for the <pb n="24"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. II.</note><lb/>
            original promiser, since whoever we are forced to solicit <lb/>
            after the giving of the promise receives some of the grati­ <lb/>
            tude which we owe to the giver. Take care, therefore, if <lb/>
            you wish your gifts to be esteemed, that they reach those <lb/>
            to whom they are promised entire, and, as the saying is, <lb/>
            without any deduction. Let no one intercept them or <lb/>
            delay them; for no one can take any share of the gratitude <lb/>
            due for your gifts without robbing you of it.</p>
          <p>V. Nothing is more bitter than long uncertainty; some can <lb/>
            bear to have their hopes extinguished better than to have <lb/>
            _ them deferred. Yet many men are led by an unworthy <lb/>
            vanity into this fault of putting off the accomplishment of <lb/>
            their promises, merely in order to swell the crowd of their <lb/>
            suitors, like the ministers of royalty, who delight in pro­ <lb/>
            longing the display of their own arrogance, hardly think­ <lb/>
            ing themselves possessed of power unless they let each <lb/>
            man see for a long time how powerful they are. They do <lb/>
            nothing promptly, or at one sitting; they are indeed swift <lb/>
            to do mischief, but slow to do good. Be sure that the <lb/>
            comic poet speaks the most absolute truth in the verses :­ <lb/>
            " Know you not this ? If you your gifts delay, <lb/>
            You take thereby my gratitude away." <lb/>
            And the following lines, the expression of virtuous pain­ <lb/>
            a high-spirited man's misery,­ <lb/>
            “What thou doest, do quickly ;” <lb/>
            and :­ <lb/>
            “Nothing in the world <lb/>
            Is worth this trouble; I had rather you <lb/>
            Refused it to me now,"</p>
          <p>When the mind begins through weariness to hate the <lb/>
            promised benefit, or while it is wavering in expectation of <lb/>
            it, how can it feel grateful for it? As the most refined <lb/>
            cruelty is that which prolongs the torture, while to kill the <lb/>
            victim at once is a. kind of mercy, since the extremity of <lb/>
            torture brings. its own end with it-the interval is the <pb n="25"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. VI.]</note><lb/>
            worst part of the execution-so the shorter time a benefit <lb/>
            hangs in the balance, the more grateful it is to the <lb/>
            receiver. It is possible to look forward with anxious <lb/>
            disquietude even to good things, and, seeing that most <lb/>
            benefits consist in a release from some form of misery, a <lb/>
            a man destroys the value of the benefit which he confers, <lb/>
            if he has the power to relieve us, and yet allows us to <lb/>
            suffer or to lack pleasure longer than we need. Kindness <lb/>
            is always eager to do good, and one who acts by love <lb/>
            naturally acts at once; he who does us good, but does it <lb/>
            tardily and with long delays, does not do so from the heart. <lb/>
            Thus he loses two most important things : time, and the <lb/>
            proof of his good will to us; for a lingering consent is <lb/>
            but a form of denial.</p>
          <p>VI. The manner in which things are said or done, my <lb/>
            Liberalis, forms a very important part of every transaction. <lb/>
            We gain much by quickness, and lose much by slowness. <lb/>
            Just as in darts, the strength of the iron head remains the <lb/>
            same, but there is an immeasureable difference between <lb/>
            the blow of one hurled with the full swing of the arm and <lb/>
            one which merely drops from the hand, and the same <lb/>
            sword either grazes or pierces according as the blow is <lb/>
            delivered; so, in like manner, that which is given is the <lb/>
            same, but the manner in which it is given makes the <lb/>
            difference. How sweet, how precious is a gift, when he <lb/>
            who gives does not permit himself to be thanked, and <lb/>
            when while he gives he forgets that he has given! To <lb/>
            reproach a man at the very moment that you are doing <lb/>
            him a service is sheer madness; it is to mix insult with <lb/>
            your favours. We ought not to make our benefits burden­ <lb/>
            some, or to add any bitterness to them. Even if there be <lb/>
            some subject upon which you wish to warn your friend, <lb/>
            choose some other time for doing so.</p>
          <p>VII. Fabius Verrucosus used to compare a benefit be­ <lb/>
            stowed by a harsh man in an offensive manner to a gritty <pb n="26"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. II.</note><lb/>
            loaf of bread, which a hungry man is obliged to re­ <lb/>
            ceive, but which is painful to eat. When Marius Nepos <lb/>
            of the praetorian guard asked Tiberius Caesar for help to <lb/>
            pay his debts, Tiberius asked him for a list of his creditors; <lb/>
            this is calling a meeting of creditors, not paying debts. <lb/>
            When the list was made out, Tiberius wrote to Nepos <lb/>
            telling him that he had ordered the money to be paid, and <lb/>
            adding some offensive reproaches. The result of this was <lb/>
            that Nepos owed no debts, yet received no kindness; <lb/>
            Tiberius, indeed, relieved him from his creditors, but laid <lb/>
            him under no obligation. Tiberius, however, had some <lb/>
            design in doing so; I imagine he did not wish more of his <lb/>
            friends to come to him with the same request. His mode <lb/>
            of proceeding was, perhaps, successful in restraining men's <lb/>
            extravagant desires by shame, but he who wishes to confer <lb/>
            benefits must follow quite a different path. In all ways <lb/>
            you should make your benefit as acceptable as possible by <lb/>
            presenting it in the most attractive form; but the method <lb/>
            of Tiberius is not to confer benefits, but to reproach.</p>
          <p>VILI. Moreover, if incidentally I should say what I <lb/>
            think of this part of the subject, I do not consider that it <lb/>
            is becoming even to an emperor to give merely in order to <lb/>
            cover a man with shame. " And yet," we are told, <lb/>
            " Tiberius did not even by this means attain his object; <lb/>
            for after this a good many persons were found to make the <lb/>
            same request. He ordered all of them to explain the <lb/>
            reasons of their indebtedness before the senate, and when <lb/>
            they did so, granted them certain definite sums of money." <lb/>
            This is not an act of generosity, but a reprimand. You <lb/>
            may call it a subsidy, or an imperial contribution; it is <lb/>
            not a benefit, for the receiver cannot think of it without <lb/>
            shame. I was summoned before a judge, and had to be <lb/>
            tried at bar before I obtained what I asked for.</p>
          <p>IX. Accordingly, all writers on ethical philosophy tell us <lb/>
            that some benefits ought to be given in secret, others in. <pb n="27"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. X.]</note><lb/>
            public. Those things which it is glorious to receive, such <lb/>
            as military decorations or public offices, and whatever else <lb/>
            gains in value the more widely it is known, should be <lb/>
            conferred in public; on the other hand, when they do not <lb/>
            promote a man or add to his social standing, but help him <lb/>
            when in weakness, in want, or in disgrace, they should be <lb/>
            given silently, and so as to be known only to those who <lb/>
            profit by them.</p>
          <p>X. Sometimes even the person who is assisted. must be <lb/>
            deceived, in order that he may receive our bounty with­ <lb/>
            out knowing the source from whence it flows. It is said <lb/>
            that Arcesilaus had a friend who was poor, but concealed <lb/>
            his poverty; who was ill, yet tried to hide his disorder, <lb/>
            and who had not money for the necessary expenses of <lb/>
            existence. Without his knowledge, Arcesilaus placed a <lb/>
            bag of money under his pillow, in order that this victim of <lb/>
            false shame might rather seem to find what he wanted <lb/>
            than to receive. "What," say you, "ought he not to <lb/>
            know from whom he received it ? " Yes ; let him not know <lb/>
            it at first, if it be essential to your kindness that he should <lb/>
            not; afterwards I will do so much for him, and give him <lb/>
            so much that he will perceive who was the giver of the <lb/>
            former benefit; or, better still, let him not know that he <lb/>
            has received anything, provided I know that I have given <lb/>
            it. “This," you say, "is to get too little return for one's <lb/>
            goodness." True, if it be an investment of which you are <lb/>
            thinking ; but if a gift, it should be given in the way which <lb/>
            will be of most service to the receiver. You should be satisfied <lb/>
            with the approval of your own conscience ; if not, you do not <lb/>
            really delight in doing good, but in being seen to do good. <lb/>
            " For all that," say you, " I wish him to know it." Is it a <lb/>
            debtor that you seek for ? " For all that, I wish him to know <lb/>
            it." What! though- it be more useful, more creditable, <lb/>
            more pleasant for him not to know his benefactor, will you <lb/>
            not consent to stand aside? "I wish him to know." So, <pb n="28"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. II.</note><lb/>
            then, you would not save a man's life in the dark? I do <lb/>
            not deny that, whenever the matter admits of it, one ought <lb/>
            to take into consideration the pleasure which we receive <lb/>
            from the joy of the receiver of our kindness; but if he <lb/>
            ought to have help and is ashamed to receive it-if what <lb/>
            we bestow upon him pains him unless it be concealed—I <lb/>
            forbear to make my benefits public. Why should I not <lb/>
            refrain from hinting at my having given him anything, <lb/>
            when the first and most essential rule is, never to reproach <lb/>
            a man with what you have done for him, and not even to <lb/>
            remind him of it. The rule for the giver and receiver of a <lb/>
            benefit is, that the one should straightway forget that he has <lb/>
            given, the other should never forget that he has received it.</p>
          <p>XI. A constant reference to one's own services wounds <lb/>
            our friend's feelings. Like the man who was saved from <lb/>
            the proscription under the triumvirate by one of Caesar's <lb/>
            friends, and afterwards found it impossible to endure his <lb/>
            preserver's arrogance, they wish to cry, " Give me back to <lb/>
            Caesar." How long will you go on saying, " I saved you, <lb/>
            I snatched you from the jaws of death ? " This is indeed <lb/>
            life, if I remember it by my own will, but death if I re­ <lb/>
            member it at yours ; I owe you nothing, if you saved me <lb/>
            merely in order to have some one to point at. How long <lb/>
            do you mean to lead me about ? how long do you mean to <lb/>
            forbid me to forget my adventure? If I had been a <lb/>
            defeated enemy, I should have been led in triumph <lb/>
            but once. We ought not to speak of the benefits which <lb/>
            we have conferred; to remind men of them is to ask <lb/>
            them to return them. We should not obtrude them, or <lb/>
            recall the memory of them ; you should only remind a man <lb/>
            of what you have given him by giving him something else. <lb/>
            We ought not even to tell others of our good deeds. He <lb/>
            who confers a benefit should be silent, it should be told by <lb/>
            the receiver; for otherwise you may receive the retort <lb/>
            which was made to one who was everywhere boasting of <pb n="29"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XI.]</note><lb/>
            the benefit which he had conferred : 11 You will not deny," <lb/>
            said his victim, " that you have received a return for it ? " <lb/>
            " When P" asked he. 11 Often," said the other, " and in <lb/>
            many places, that is, wherever and whenever you have <lb/>
            told the story." What need is there for you to speak, and <lb/>
            to take the place which belongs to another ? There is a <lb/>
            man who can tell the story in a way much more to your <lb/>
            credit, and thus you will gain glory for not telling it your­ <lb/>
            self. You would think me ungrateful if, through your <lb/>
            own silence, no one is to know of your benefit. So far <lb/>
            from doing this, even if any one tells the story in our pre­ <lb/>
            sence, we ought to make answer, " He does indeed deserve <lb/>
            much more than this, and I am aware that I have not <lb/>
            hitherto done any great things for him, although I wish to <lb/>
            do so." This should not be said jokingly, nor yet with <lb/>
            that air by which some persons repel those whom they <lb/>
            especially wish to attract. In addition to this, we ought <lb/>
            to act with the greatest politeness towards such persons. <lb/>
            If the farmer ceases his labours after he has put in the <lb/>
            seed, he will lose what he has sown; it is only by great <lb/>
            pains that seeds are brought to yield a crop; no plant will <lb/>
            bear fruit unless it be tended with equal care from first to <lb/>
            last, and the same rule is true of benefits. Can any bene­ <lb/>
            fits be greater than those which children receive from their <lb/>
            parents ? Yet these benefits are useless if they be deserted <lb/>
            while young, if the pious care of the parents does not for a <lb/>
            long time watch over the gift which they have bestowed. <lb/>
            So it is with other benefits; unless you help them, you <lb/>
            will lose them; to give is not enough, you must foster what <lb/>
            you have given. If you wish those whom you lay under <lb/>
            an obligation to be grateful to you, you must not merely <lb/>
            confer benefits upon them, but you must also love them. <lb/>
            Above all, as I said before, spare their ears ; you will <lb/>
            weary them if you remind them of your goodness, if you <lb/>
            reproach them with it you will make them hate you.</p><pb n="30"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin">[BK. II.</note>Pride ought above all things to be avoided when you <lb/>
            confer a benefit. What need have you for disdainful airs, <lb/>
            or swelling phrases? the act itself will exalt you. Let us <lb/>
            shun vain boasting; let us be silent, and let our deeds <lb/>
            speak for us. A benefit conferred with haughtiness not <lb/>
            only wins no gratitude, but causes dislike.</p>
          <p>XII. Gaius Caesar granted Pompeius Pennus his life, <lb/>
            that is, if not to take away life be to grant it; then, when <lb/>
            Pompeius was set free and returning thanks to him, he <lb/>
            stretched out his left foot to be kissed. Those who excuse <lb/>
            this action, and say that it was not done through arro­ <lb/>
            gance, say that he wished to show him a gilded, nay a <lb/>
            golden slipper studded with pearls. "Well," say they, <lb/>
            “what disgrace can there be in a man of consular rank <lb/>
            kissing gold and pearls, and what part of Caesar's whole <lb/>
            body was it less pollution to kiss ? " So, then, that man, <lb/>
            the object of whose life was to change a free state into a <lb/>
            Persian despotism, was not satisfied when a senator, an <lb/>
            aged man, a man who had filled the highest offices in the <lb/>
            state, prostrated himself before him in the presence of all <lb/>
            the nobles, just as the vanquished prostrate themselves <lb/>
            before their conqueror! He discovered a place below his <lb/>
            knees down to which he might thrust liberty. What is <lb/>
            this but trampling upon the commonwealth, and that, too, <lb/>
            with the left foot, though you may say that this point does <lb/>
            not signify ? It was not a sufficiently foul and frantic out­ <lb/>
            rage for the emperor to sit at the trial of a consular for his <lb/>
            life wearing slippers, he must needs push his shoes into a <lb/>
            senatores face.</p>
          <p>XIII. 0 pride, the silliest fault of great good fortune! <lb/>
            how pleasant it is to take nothing from thee! how dost <lb/>
            thou turn all benefits into outrages! how dost thou delight <lb/>
            in all excess ! how ill all things become thee! The higher <lb/>
            thou risest the lower thou art, and proves! that the good <lb/>
            things by which thou art so puffed up profit thee not; <pb n="31"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XIV.]</note><lb/>
            thou spoilest all that thou givest. It is worth while to <lb/>
            inquire why it is that pride thus swaggers and changes the <lb/>
            form and appearance of her countenance, so that she pre­ <lb/>
            fers a mask to her own face. It is pleasant to receive gifts <lb/>
            when they are conferred in a kindly and gentle manner, <lb/>
            when a superior in giving them does Dot exalt himself over <lb/>
            me, but shows as much good feeling as possible, placing <lb/>
            himself on a level with me, giving without parade, and <lb/>
            choosing a time when I am glad of his help, rather than <lb/>
            waiting till I am in the bitterest need. The only way by <lb/>
            which you can prevail upon proud men not to spoil their <lb/>
            gifts by their arrogance is by proving to them that benefits <lb/>
            do not appear greater because they are bestowed with great <lb/>
            pomp and circumstance; that no one will think them <lb/>
            greater men for so doing, and that excessive pride is a <lb/>
            mere delusion which leads men to hate even what they <lb/>
            ought to love.</p>
          <p>XIV. There are some things which injure those who re­ <lb/>
            ceive them, things which it is not a benefit to give but to <lb/>
            withhold; we should therefore consider the usefulness of <lb/>
            our gift rather than the wish of the petitioner to receive it; <lb/>
            for we often long for hurtful things, and are unable to dis­ <lb/>
            cern how ruinous they are, because our judgment is biassed <lb/>
            by our feelings ; when, however, the longing is past, when <lb/>
            that frenzied impulse which masters our good sense has <lb/>
            passed away, we abhor those who have given us hurtful <lb/>
            gifts. As we refuse cold water to the sick, or swords to <lb/>
            the grief-stricken or remorseful, and take from the insane <lb/>
            whatever they might in their delirium use to their own de­ <lb/>
            struction, so must we persist in refusing to give anything <lb/>
            whatever that is hurtful, although our friends earnestly <lb/>
            and humbly, nay, sometimes even most piteously beg for <lb/>
            it. We ought to look at the end of our benefits as well <lb/>
            as the beginning, and not merely to give what men are glad <lb/>
            to receive, but what they will hereafter be glad to have re­ <pb n="32"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. II.</note><lb/>
            ceived. There are many who say, " I know that this will <lb/>
            do him no good, but what am I to do ? he begs for it, I <lb/>
            cannot withstand his entreaties. Let him see to it; he <lb/>
            will blame himself, not me." Not so: you he will blame, <lb/>
            and deservedly; when he comes to his right mind, when the <lb/>
            frenzy which now excites him has left him, how can he help <lb/>
            hating the man who has assisted him to harm and to en­ <lb/>
            danger himself ? It is a cruel kindness to allow one's self <lb/>
            to be won over into granting that which injures those who <lb/>
            beg for it. Just as it is the noblest of acts to save men <lb/>
            from harm against their will, so it is but hatred, under the <lb/>
            mask of civility, to grant what is harmful to those who ask <lb/>
            for it. Let us confer benefits of such a kind, that the more <lb/>
            they are made use of the better they please, and which never <lb/>
            can turn into injuries. I never will give money to a man <lb/>
            if I know that he will pay it to an adulteress, nor will I be <lb/>
            found in connexion with any wicked act or plan; if pos­ <lb/>
            sible, I will restrain men from crime ; if not, at least I will <lb/>
            never assist them in it. Whether my friend be driven into <lb/>
            doing wrong by anger, or seduced from the path of safety <lb/>
            by the heat of ambition, he shall never gain the means of <lb/>
            doing mischief except from himself, nor will I enable him <lb/>
            one day to say, " He ruined me out of love for me." Our <lb/>
            friends often give us what our enemies wish us to receive; <lb/>
            we are driven by the unseasonable fondness of the former <lb/>
            into the ruin which the latter hope will befall us. Yet, often <lb/>
            as it is the case, what can be more shameful than that <lb/>
            there should be no difference between a benefit and hatred ?</p>
          <p>XV. Let us never bestow gifts which may recoil upon us to <lb/>
            our shame. As the sum total of friendship consists in making <lb/>
            our friends equal to ourselves, we ought to consider the in­ <lb/>
            terests of both parties; I must give to him that wants, yet so <lb/>
            that I do not want myself; I must help him who is perish­ <lb/>
            ing, yet so that I do not perish myself, unless by so doing <lb/>
            I can save a great man or a great cause. I must give no <lb/>
            benefit which it would disgrace me to ask for. I ought not <pb n="33"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XVI.]</note><lb/>
            to make a small benefit appear a great one, nor allow great <lb/>
            benefits to be regarded as small; for although it destroys <lb/>
            all feeling of gratitude to treat what you give like a creditor, <lb/>
            yet you do not reproach a man, but merely set off your gift <lb/>
            to the best advantage by letting him know what it is worth. <lb/>
            Every man must consider what his resources and powers <lb/>
            are, so that we may not give either more or less than we are <lb/>
            able. We must also consider the character and position of <lb/>
            the person to whom we give, for some men are too great to <lb/>
            give small gifts, while others are too small to receive great <lb/>
            ones. Compare, therefore, the character both of the giver <lb/>
            and the receiver, and weigh that which you give between <lb/>
            the two, taking care that what is given be neither too <lb/>
            burdensome nor too trivial for the one to give, nor yet such <lb/>
            as the receiver will either treat with disdain as too small, <lb/>
            or think too great for him to deal with.</p>
          <p>XVI. Alexander, who was of unsound mind, and always <lb/>
            full of magnificent ideas, presented somebody with a city. <lb/>
            When the man to whom he gave it had reflected upon the <lb/>
            scope of his own powers, he wished to avoid the jealousy <lb/>
            which so great a present would excite, saying that the gift <lb/>
            did not suit a man of his position. “I do not ask," re­ <lb/>
            plied Alexander, " what is becoming for you to receive, but <lb/>
            what is becoming for me to give." This seems a spirited <lb/>
            and kingly speech, yet really it is a most foolish one. <lb/>
            Nothing is by itself a becoming gift for any one: all de­ <lb/>
            pends upon who gives it, to whom he gives it, when, for <lb/>
            what reason, where, and so forth, without which details it <lb/>
            is impossible to argue about it. Inflated creature! if it <lb/>
            did not become him to receive this gift, it could not become <lb/>
            thee to give it. There should be a proportion between <lb/>
            men's characters and the offices which they fill; and as <lb/>
            virtue in all cases should be our measure, he who gives too <lb/>
            much acts as wrongly as he who gives too little. Even <lb/>
            granting that fortune has raised you so high, that, where <note type="footnote"> D </note> <pb n="34"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. II.</note><lb/>
            other men give cups, you give cities (which it would show <lb/>
            a greater mind in you not to take than to take and <lb/>
            squander), still there must be some of your friends who <lb/>
            are not strong enough to put a city in their pockets.</p>
          <p>XVII. A certain cynic asked Antigonus for a talent. <lb/>
            Antigonus answered that this was too much for a cynic to <lb/>
            ask for. After this rebuff he asked for a penny. Antigonus <lb/>
            answered that this was too little for a king to give. " This <lb/>
            kind of hair-splitting " (you say) "is contemptible: he found <lb/>
            the means of giving neither. In the matter of the penny <lb/>
            he thought of the king, in that of the talent he thought of <lb/>
            the cynic, whereas with respect to the cynic it would have <lb/>
            been right to receive the penny, with respect to the king it <lb/>
            would have been right to give the talent. Though there <lb/>
            may be things which are too great for a cynic to receive, <lb/>
            yet nothing is so small, that it does not become a gracious <lb/>
            king to bestow it." If you ask me, I applaud Antigonus; <lb/>
            for it is not to be endured that a man who despises money <lb/>
            should ask for it. Your cynic has publicly proclaimed his <lb/>
            hatred of money, and assumed the character of one who <lb/>
            despises it: let him act up to his professions. It is most <lb/>
            inconsistent for him to earn money by glorifying his poverty. <lb/>
            I wish to use Chrysippus's simile of the game of ball, in <lb/>
            which the ball must certainly fall by the fault either of the <lb/>
            thrower or of the catcher; it only holds its course when it <lb/>
            passes between the hands of two persons who each throw <lb/>
            it and catch it suitably. It is necessary, however, for a good <lb/>
            player to send the ball in one way to a comrade at a long dis­ <lb/>
            tance, and in another to one at a short distance. So it is with <lb/>
            a benefit: unless it be suitable both for the giver and the <lb/>
            receiver, it will neither leave the one nor reach the other as <lb/>
            it ought. If we have to do with a practised and skilled <lb/>
            player, we shall throw the ball more recklessly, for how­ <lb/>
            ever it may come, that quick and agile hand will send it <lb/>
            back again ; if we are playing with an unskilled novice, we <pb n="35"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XVIII.]</note><lb/>
            shall not throw it so hard, but far more gently, guiding it <lb/>
            straight into his very hands, and we shall run to meet it <lb/>
            when it returns to us. This is just what we ought to do <lb/>
            in conferring benefits ; let us teach some men how to do <lb/>
            so, and be satisfied if they attempt it, if they have the <lb/>
            courage and the will to do so. For the most part, however, <lb/>
            we make men ungrateful, and encourage them to be so, <lb/>
            as if our benefits were only great when we cannot receive <lb/>
            any gratitude for them ; just as some spiteful ball-players <lb/>
            purposely put out their companion, of course to the ruin of <lb/>
            the game, which cannot be carried on without entire agree­ <lb/>
            ment. Many men are of so depraved a nature that they had <lb/>
            rather lose the presents which they make than be thought <lb/>
            to have received a return for them, because they are proud, <lb/>
            and like to lay people under obligations: yet how much <lb/>
            better and more kindly would it be if they tried to enable <lb/>
            the others also to perform their parts, if they encouraged <lb/>
            them in returning gratitude, put the best construction upon <lb/>
            all their acts, received one who wished to thank them just <lb/>
            as cordially as if he came to repay what he had received, <lb/>
            and easily lent themselves to the belief that those whom <lb/>
            they have laid under an obligation wish to repay it. We <lb/>
            blame usurers equally when they press harshly for payment, <lb/>
            and when they delay and make difficulties about taking <lb/>
            back the money which they have lent; in the same way, it <lb/>
            is just as right that a benefit should be returned, as it is <lb/>
            wrong to ask any one to return it. The best man is he who <lb/>
            gives readily, never asks for any return, and is delighted when <lb/>
            a return is made, because, having really and truly forgotten <lb/>
            what he gave, he receives it as though it were a present.</p>
          <p>XVIII. Some men not only give, but even receive bene­ <lb/>
            fits haughtily, a mistake into which we ought not to fall: <lb/>
            for now let us cross over to the other side of the subject, <lb/>
            and consider how men should behave when they receive <lb/>
            benefits. Every function which is performed by two per­ <pb n="36"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. II.</note><lb/>
            sons makes equal demands upon both: after you have con­ <lb/>
            sidered what a father ought to be, you will perceive that <lb/>
            there remains an equal task, that of considering what a <lb/>
            son ought to be: a husband has certain duties, but those <lb/>
            of a wife are no less important. Each of these give and <lb/>
            take equally, and each require a similar rule of life, which, <lb/>
            as Hecaton observes, is hard to follow : indeed, it is difficult <lb/>
            for us to attain to virtue, or even to anything that comes <lb/>
            near virtue: for we ought not only to act virtuously but <lb/>
            to do so upon principle. We ought to follow this guide <lb/>
            throughout our lives, and to do everything great and small <lb/>
            according to its dictates: according as virtue prompts us <lb/>
            we ought both to give and to receive. Now she will declare <lb/>
            at the outset that we ought not to receive benefits from every <lb/>
            man. " From whom, then, ought we to receive them ? ” To <lb/>
            answer you briefly, I should say, from those to whom we <lb/>
            have given them. Let us consider whether we ought not <lb/>
            to be even more careful in choosing to whom we should <lb/>
            owe than to whom we should give. For even supposing <lb/>
            that no unpleasantness should result (and very much always <lb/>
            does), still it is a great misery to be indebted to a man to <lb/>
            whom you do not wish to be under an obligation; whereas <lb/>
            it is most delightful to receive a benefit from one whom <lb/>
            you can love even after he has wronged you, and when the <lb/>
            pleasure which you feel in his friendship is justified by the <lb/>
            grounds on which it is based. Nothing is more wretched <lb/>
            for a modest and honourable man than to feel it to be his <lb/>
            duty to love one whom it does not please him to love. I <lb/>
            must constantly remind you that I do not speak of wise men, <lb/>
            who take pleasure in everything that is their duty, who have <lb/>
            their feelings under command, and are able to lay down <lb/>
            whatever law they please to themselves and keep it, but that <lb/>
            I speak of imperfect beings struggling to follow the right <lb/>
            path, who often have trouble in bending their passions to <lb/>
            their will. I must therefore choose the man from whom I <pb n="37"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XVIII.]</note><lb/>
            will accept a benefit; indeed, I ought to be more careful in <lb/>
            the choice of my creditor for a benefit than for money; for I <lb/>
            have only to pay the latter as much as I received of him, <lb/>
            and when I have paid it I am free from all obligation ; but <lb/>
            to the other I must both repay more, and even when I have <lb/>
            repaid his kindness we remain connected, for when I have <lb/>
            paid my debt I ought again to renew it, while our friendship <lb/>
            endures unbroken. Thus, as I ought not to make an un­ <lb/>
            worthy man my friend, so I ought not to admit an unworthy <lb/>
            man into that most holy bond of gratitude for benefits, from <lb/>
            which friendship arises. You reply, " I cannot always say <lb/>
            ' No': sometimes I must receive a benefit even against my <lb/>
            wilL Suppose I were given something by a cruel and <lb/>
            easily offended tyrant, who would take it as an affront if <lb/>
            his bounty were slighted ? am I not to accept it ? Suppose <lb/>
            it were offered by a pirate, or a brigand, or a king of the <lb/>
            temper of a pirate or brigand. What ought I to do ? Such <lb/>
            a man is not a worthy object for me to owe a benefit to." <lb/>
            When I say that you ought to choose, I except vis major and <lb/>
            fear, which destroy all power of choice. If you are free, if <lb/>
            it lies with you to decide whether you will or not, then you <lb/>
            will turn over in your own mind whether you will take a <lb/>
            gift from a man or not; but if your position makes it im­ <lb/>
            possible for you to choose, then be assured that you do not <lb/>
            receive a gift, you merely obey orders. No one incurs any <lb/>
            obligation by receiving what it was not in his power to refuse; <lb/>
            if you want to know whether I wish to take it, arrange <lb/>
            matters so that I have the power of saying' No.' " Yet sup­ <lb/>
            pose he gave you your life." It does not matter what the <lb/>
            gift was, unless it be given and received with good will: <lb/>
            you are not my preserver because you have saved my life. <lb/>
            Poison sometimes acts as a medicine, yet it is not on <lb/>
            that account regarded as wholesome. Some things benefit <lb/>
            us but put us under no obligation: for instance a man <lb/>
            who intended to kill a tyrant, cut with his sword a tumour <pb n="38"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. II.</note><lb/>
            from which he suffered: yet the tyrant did not show him <lb/>
            gratitude because by wounding him he had healed a disease <lb/>
            which surgeons had feared to meddle with.</p>
          <p>XIX. You see that the actual thing itself is not of much <lb/>
            importance, because it is not regarded as a benefit at all, if <lb/>
            you do good when you intended to do evil; in such a case <lb/>
            the benefit is done by chance, the man did harm. I have <lb/>
            seen a lion in the amphitheatre, who recognized one of the <lb/>
            men who fought with wild beasts, who once had been his <lb/>
            keeper, and protected him against the attacks of the other <lb/>
            animals. Are we, then, to say that this assistance of the <lb/>
            brute was a benefit ? By no means, because it did not <lb/>
            intend to do it, and did not do it with kindly intentions. <lb/>
            You may class the lion and your tyrant together: each of <lb/>
            them saved a man's life, yet neither conferred a benefit. <lb/>
            Because it is not a benefit to be forced to receive one, <lb/>
            neither is it a benefit to be under an obligation to a man to <lb/>
            whom we do not wish to be indebted. You must first give <lb/>
            me personal freedom of decision, and then your benefit.</p>
          <p>XX. The question has been raised, whether Marcus Brutus <lb/>
            ought to have received his life from the hands of Julius <lb/>
            Caesar, who, he had decided, ought to be put to death.</p>
          <p>As to the grounds upon which he put him to death, I <lb/>
            shall discuss them elsewhere; for to my mind, though he <lb/>
            was in other respects a great man, in this he seems to have <lb/>
            been entirely wrong, and not to have followed the maxims of <lb/>
            the Stoic philosophy. He must either have feared the name <lb/>
            of " King," although a state thrives best under a good <lb/>
            king, or he must have hoped that liberty could exist in a, <lb/>
            state where some had so much to gain by reigning, and <lb/>
            others had so much to gain by becoming slaves. Or, <lb/>
            again, he must have supposed that it would be possible <lb/>
            to restore the ancient constitution after all the ancient <lb/>
            manners had been lost, and that citizens could continue to <lb/>
            possess equal rights, or laws remain inviolate, in a state in <lb/>
            which he had been so many thousands of men fighting to <pb n="39"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXI.]</note><lb/>
            decide, not whether they should be slaves or free, but which <lb/>
            master they should serve. How forgetful he seems to have <lb/>
            been, both of human nature and of the history of his own <lb/>
            country, in supposing that when one despot was destroyed <lb/>
            another of the same temper would not take his place, <lb/>
            though, after so many kings had perished by lightning and <lb/>
            the sword, a Tarquin was found to reign! Yet Brutus did <lb/>
            right in receiving his life from Caesar, though he was not <lb/>
            bound thereby to regard Caesar as his father, since it was <lb/>
            by a wrong that 'Caesar had come to be in a position to <lb/>
            bestow this benefit. A man does not save your life who <lb/>
            does not kill you; nor does he confer a benefit, but merely <lb/>
            gives you your discharged</p>
          <p>XXI. It seems to offer more opportunity for debate to <lb/>
            consider what a captive ought to do, if a man of abomin­ <lb/>
            able vices offers him the price of his ransom? Shall I <lb/>
            permit myself to be saved by a wretch ? When safe, what <lb/>
            recompense can I make to him ? Am I to live with an <lb/>
            infamous person ? Yet, am I not to live with my pre­ <lb/>
            server ? I will tell you my opinion. I would accept money, <lb/>
            even from such a person, if it were to save my life; yet I <lb/>
            would only accept it as a loan, not as a benefit. I would <lb/>
            repay him the money, and if I were ever able to preserve <lb/>
            him from dangei i would do so. As for friendship, which <lb/>
            can only exist between equals, I would not condescend to <lb/>
            be such a man's friend; nor would I regard him as my <lb/>
            preserver, but merely as a money-lender, to whom I am <lb/>
            only bound to repay what I borrowed from him.</p>
          <p>A man may be a worthy person for me to receive a <lb/>
            benefit from, but it will hurt him to give it. For this <lb/>
            reason I will not receive it, because he is ready to help me <lb/>
            to his own prejudice, or even danger. Suppose that he is <lb/>
            willing to plead for me in court, but by so doing will make <lb/>
            the king his enemy. I should be his enemy, if, when he is <note type="footnote"> 1 The I discharge alluded to is that which was granted to the beaten <lb/>
            one of a pair of gladiators, when their duel was not to the death. </note> <pb n="40"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. II.</note><lb/>
            willing to risk himself for me, if I were not to risk <lb/>
            myself without him, which moreover is easier for me to <lb/>
            do. ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗</p>
          <p>As an instance of this, Hecaton calls the case of Arcesi­ <lb/>
            laus silly, and not to the purpose. Arcesilaus, he says, re­ <lb/>
            fused to receive a large sum of money which was offered <lb/>
            to him by a son, lest the son should offend his penurious <lb/>
            father. What did he do deserving of praise, in not re­ <lb/>
            ceiving stolen goods, in choosing not to receive them, in­ <lb/>
            stead of returning them ? What proof of self-restraint is <lb/>
            there in refusing to receive another man's property. If <lb/>
            you want an instance of magnanimity, take the case of <lb/>
            Julius Graecinus, whom Caius Caesar put to death merely <lb/>
            on the ground that he was abetter man than it suited a tyrant <lb/>
            for any one to be. This man, when he was receiving sub­ <lb/>
            scriptions from many of his friends to cover his expenses <lb/>
            in exhibiting public games, would not receive a large sum <lb/>
            which was sent him by Fabius Persicus; and when he was <lb/>
            blamed for rejecting it by those who think more of what is <lb/>
            given than of who gives it, he answered, " Am I to accept a <lb/>
            present from a man when I would not accept his offer to <lb/>
            drink a glass of wine with him ? "</p>
          <p>When a consular named Rebilius, a man of equally bad <lb/>
            character, sent a yet larger sum to Graecinus, and pressed <lb/>
            him to receive it. " I must beg," answered he, 11 that you <lb/>
            will excuse me. I did not take money from Persicus <lb/>
            either." Ought we to call this receiving presents, or rather <lb/>
            taking one's pick of the senate ?</p>
          <p>XXII. When we have decided to accept, let us accept <lb/>
            with cheerfulness, showing pleasure, and letting the giver <lb/>
            see it, so that he may at once receive some return for his <lb/>
            goodness: for as it is a good reason for rejoicing to see our <lb/>
            friend happy, it is a better one to have made him so. Let <lb/>
            us, therefore, show how acceptable a gift is by loudly ex­ <lb/>
            pressing our gratitude for it; and let us do so, not only in <pb n="41"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXIII.]</note><lb/>
            the hearing of the giver, but everywhere. He who receives <lb/>
            a benefit with gratitude, repays the first instalment of it.</p>
          <p>XXIII. There are some, who only like to receive benefits <lb/>
            privately: they dislike having any witnesses and confidants. <lb/>
            Such men, we may believe, have no good intentions. As a <lb/>
            giver is justified in dwelling upon those qualities of his <lb/>
            gift which will please the receiver, so a main, when he re­ <lb/>
            ceives, should do so publicly; you should not take from <lb/>
            a man what you are ashamed to owe him. Some return <lb/>
            thanks to one stealthily, in a corner, in a whisper. This is <lb/>
            not modesty, but a kind of denying of the debt: it is the <lb/>
            part of an ungrateful man not to express his gratitude be­ <lb/>
            fore witnesses. Some object to any accounts being kept <lb/>
            between them and their benefactors, and wish no brokers to <lb/>
            be employed or witnesses to be called, but merely to give <lb/>
            their own signature to a receipt. Those men do the like, <lb/>
            who take care to let as few persons as possible know of <lb/>
            the benefits which they have received. They fear to receive <lb/>
            them in public, in order that their success may be attributed <lb/>
            rather to their own talents than to the help of others: they are <lb/>
            very seldom to be found in attendance upon those to whom <lb/>
            they owe their lives and their fortunes, and thus, while avoid­ <lb/>
            ing the imputation of servility, they incur that of ingratitude.</p>
          <p>XXIV. Some men speak in the most offensive terms of <lb/>
            those to whom they owe most. There are men whom it is <lb/>
            safer to affront than to serve, for their dislike leads them <lb/>
            to assume the airs of persons who are not indebted to us: <lb/>
            although nothing more is expected of them than that they <lb/>
            should remember what they owe us, refreshing their memory <lb/>
            from time to time, because no one can be grateful who <lb/>
            forgets a kindness, and he who remembers it, by so doing <lb/>
            proves his gratitude. We ought neither to receive benefits <lb/>
            with a fastidious air, nor yet with a slavish humility: for if a <lb/>
            man does not care for a benefit when it is freshly bestowed <lb/>
            -a time at which all presents please us most-what will <pb n="42"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. II.</note><lb/>
            he do when its first charms have gone off ? Others receive <lb/>
            with an air of disdain, as much as to say. " I do not want <lb/>
            it; but as you wish it so very much, I will allow you to <lb/>
            give it to me." Others take benefits languidly, and leave <lb/>
            the giver in doubt as to whether they know that they have <lb/>
            received them ; others barely open their lips in thanks, and <lb/>
            would be less offensive if they said nothing. One ought to <lb/>
            proportion one's thanks to the importance of the benefit <lb/>
            received, and to use the phrases, " You have laid more of <lb/>
            us than you think under an obligation," for every one likes <lb/>
            to find his good actions extend further than he expected. <lb/>
            11 You do not know what it is that you have done for me; <lb/>
            but you ought to know how much more important it is <lb/>
            than you imagine." It is in itself an expression of gratitude <lb/>
            to speak of one's self as overwhelmed by kindness; or <lb/>
            " I shall never be able to thank you sufficiently ; but, at <lb/>
            any rate. I will never cease to express everywhere my in­ <lb/>
            ability to thank you."</p>
          <p>XXV. By nothing did Furnius gain greater credit with <lb/>
            Augustus and make it easy for him to obtain anything else <lb/>
            for which he might ask, than by merely saying, when at his <lb/>
            request Augustus pardoned his father for having taken <lb/>
            Antonius's side, " One wrong alone I have received at your <lb/>
            hands, Caesar; you have forced me to live and to die owing <lb/>
            you a greater debt of gratitude than I can ever repay."</p>
          <p>What can prove gratitude so well as that a man should <lb/>
            never be satisfied, should never even entertain the hope of <lb/>
            making any adequate return for what he has received ? By <lb/>
            these and similar expressions we must try not to conceal our <lb/>
            gratitude, but to display it as clearly as possible. No words <lb/>
            need be used; if we only feel as we ought, our thank- <lb/>
            fulness will be shown in our countenances. He who intends <lb/>
            to be grateful, let him think how he shall repay a kindness <lb/>
            while he is receiving it. Cbrysippus says that such a man <lb/>
            must watch for his opportunity, and spring forward when­ <pb n="43"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXVI.]</note><lb/>
            ever it offers, like one who has been entered for a race, and <lb/>
            who stands at the starting-point waiting for the barriers to <lb/>
            be thrown open ; and even then he must use great exertions <lb/>
            and great swiftness to catch the other, who has a start of him.</p>
          <p>XXVI. We must now consider what is the main cause of <lb/>
            ingratitude. It is caused by excessive self-esteem, by that <lb/>
            fault innate in all mortals, of taking a partial view of our­ <lb/>
            selves and our own acts, by greed, or by jealousy.</p>
          <p>Let us begin with the first of these. Every one is preju­ <lb/>
            diced in his own favour, from which it follows that he <lb/>
            believes himself to have earned all that he receives, regards <lb/>
            it as payment for his services, and does not think that he <lb/>
            has been appraised at a valuation sufficiently near his own. <lb/>
            “He has given me this," says he, " but how late, after how <lb/>
            much toil ? how much more might I have earned if I had <lb/>
            attached myself to So and so, or to So and so ? I did not <lb/>
            expect this; I have been treated like one of the herd; did he <lb/>
            really think that I only deserved so little ? why, it would have <lb/>
            been less insulting to have passed me over altogether."</p>
          <p>XXVII. The augur Cnaeus Lentulus, who, before his <lb/>
            freedmen reduced him to poverty, was one of the richest of <lb/>
            men, who saw himself in possession of a fortune of four <lb/>
            hundred millions—I say advisedly, " saw," for he never did <lb/>
            more than see it--was as barren and contemptible in in­ <lb/>
            tellect as he was in spirit. Though very avaricious, yet he <lb/>
            was so poor a speaker that he found it easier to give <lb/>
            men coins than words. This man, who owed all his <lb/>
            prosperity to the late Emperor Augustus, to whom he had <lb/>
            brought only poverty, encumbered with a noble name, when <lb/>
            he had risen to be the chief man in Rome, both in wealth <lb/>
            and influence, used sometimes to complain that Augustus <lb/>
            had interrupted his legal studies, observing that he had not <lb/>
            received anything like what he had lost by giving up the <lb/>
            study of eloquence. Yet the truth was that Augustus, <lb/>
            besides loading him with other gifts, had set him free from <pb n="44"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. II.</note><lb/>
            the necessity of making himself ridiculous by labouring <lb/>
            at a profession in which he never could succeed.</p>
          <p>Greed does not permit any one to be grateful; for what <lb/>
            is given is never equal to its base desires, and the more we <lb/>
            receive the more we covet, for avarice is much more eager <lb/>
            when it has to deal with great accumulations of wealth, <lb/>
            just as the power of a flame is enormously greater in propor­ <lb/>
            tion to the size of the conflagration from which it springs. <lb/>
            Ambition in like manner suffers no man to rest satisfied <lb/>
            with that measure of public honours, to gain which was <lb/>
            once the limit of his wildest hope; no one is thankful for <lb/>
            becoming tribune, but grumbles at not being at once pro­ <lb/>
            moted to the post of praetor; nor is he grateful for this if <lb/>
            the consulship does not follow; and even this does not satisfy <lb/>
            him if he be consul but once. His greed ever stretches <lb/>
            itself out further, and he does not understand the great­ <lb/>
            ness of his success because he always looks forward to the <lb/>
            point at which he aims, and never back towards that from <lb/>
            which he started.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. A more violent and distressing vice than any <lb/>
            of these is jealousy, which disturbs us by suggesting com­ <lb/>
            parisons. "He gave me this, but he gave more to that <lb/>
            man, and he gave it to him before me; " after which he <lb/>
            sympathises with no one, but pushes his own claims to the <lb/>
            prejudice of every one else. How much more straightfor­ <lb/>
            ward and modest is it to make the most of what we have <lb/>
            received, knowing that no man is valued so highly by <lb/>
            any one else as by his own self! " I ought to have received <lb/>
            more, but it was not easy for him to give more; he was <lb/>
            obliged to distribute his liberality among many persons. <lb/>
            This is only the beginning; let me be contented, and by <lb/>
            my gratitude encourage him to show me more favour; he <lb/>
            has not done as much as he ought, but he will do so the <lb/>
            more frequently; he certainly preferred that man to me, <lb/>
            but he has preferred me before many others; that man is <pb n="45"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXIX.]</note><lb/>
            not my equal either in virtue or in services, but he has <lb/>
            some charm of his own: by complaining I shall not make <lb/>
            myself deserve to receive more, but shall become unworthy <lb/>
            of what I have received. More has been given to those <lb/>
            most villainous men than has been given to me; well, <lb/>
            what is that to the purpose? how seldom does Fortune <lb/>
            show judgment in her choice? We complain every day of <lb/>
            the success of bad men; very often the hail passes over <lb/>
            the estates of the greatest villains and strikes down the <lb/>
            crops of the best of men; every man has to take his <lb/>
            chance, in friendship as well as in everything else." <lb/>
            There is no benefit so great that spitefulness can pick no <lb/>
            holes in it, none so paltry that it cannot be made more of <lb/>
            by friendly interpretation. We shall never want a subject <lb/>
            for complaint if we look at benefits on their wrong side.</p>
          <p>XXIX. See how unjustly the gifts of heaven are valued <lb/>
            even by some who profess themselves philosophers, who <lb/>
            complain that we are not as big as elephants, as swift as <lb/>
            stags, as light as birds, as strong as bulls ; that the skins <lb/>
            of seals are stronger, of hinds prettier, of bears thicker, of <lb/>
            beavers softer than ours; that dogs excel us in delicacy of <lb/>
            scent, eagles in keenness of sight, crows in length of days, <lb/>
            and many beasts in ease of swimming. And although <lb/>
            nature itself does not allow some qualities, as for example <lb/>
            strength and swiftness, to be combined in the same person, <lb/>
            yet they call it a monstrous thing that men are not com­ <lb/>
            pounded of different and inconsistent good qualities, and <lb/>
            call the gods neglectful of us because we have not been <lb/>
            given health which even our vices cannot destroy, or know­ <lb/>
            ledge of the future. They scarcely refrain from rising to <lb/>
            such a pitch of impudence as to hate nature because we <lb/>
            are below the gods, and not on an equality with them. <lb/>
            How much better is it to turn to the contemplation of so <lb/>
            many great blessings, and to be thankful that the gods <lb/>
            have been pleased to give us a place second only to them­ <pb n="46"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. II.</note><lb/>
            selves in this most beautiful abode, and that they have <lb/>
            appointed us to be the lords of the earth! Can any one <lb/>
            compare us with the animals over whom we rule ? <lb/>
            Nothing has been denied us except what could not have <lb/>
            been granted. In like manner, thou that takest an unfair <lb/>
            view of the lot of mankind, think what blessings our <lb/>
            Father has bestowed upon us, how far more powerful <lb/>
            animals than ourselves we have broken to harness, how <lb/>
            we catch those which are far swifter, how nothing that <lb/>
            has life is placed beyond the reach of our weapons! We <lb/>
            have received so many excellencies, so many crafts, above <lb/>
            all our mind, which can pierce at once whatever it is <lb/>
            directed against, which is swifter than the stars in their <lb/>
            courses, for it arrives before them at the place which they <lb/>
            will reach after many ages; and besides this, so many <lb/>
            fruits of the earth, so much treasure, such masses of <lb/>
            various things piled one upon another. You may go <lb/>
            through the whole order of nature, and since you find no <lb/>
            entire creature which you would prefer to be, you may <lb/>
            choose from each the special qualities which you would like <lb/>
            to be given to yourself; then, if you rightly appreciate the <lb/>
            partiality of nature for you, you cannot but confess your­ <lb/>
            self to be her spoiled child. So it is ; the immortal gods <lb/>
            have unto this day always held us most dear, and have be. <lb/>
            stowed upon us the greatest possible honour, a place <lb/>
            nearest to themselves. We have indeed received great <lb/>
            things, yet not too great.</p>
          <p>XXX. I have thought it necessary, my friend Liberalis, <lb/>
            to state these facts, both because when speaking of small <lb/>
            benefits one ought to make some mention of the greatest, <lb/>
            and because also this shameless and hateful vice (of in­ <lb/>
            gratitude), starting with these, transfers itself from them <lb/>
            to all the rest. If a man scorn these, the greatest of all <lb/>
            benefits, to whom will he feel gratitude, what gift will he <lb/>
            regard as valuable or deserving to be returned: to whom <pb n="47"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXXI.]</note><lb/>
            will he be grateful for his safety or his life, if he denies <lb/>
            that he has received from the gods that existence which he <lb/>
            begs from them daily ? He, therefore, who teaches men to <lb/>
            be grateful, pleads the cause not only of men, but even of <lb/>
            the gods, for though they, being placed above all desires, <lb/>
            cannot be in want of anything, yet we can nevertheless <lb/>
            offer them our gratitude.</p>
          <p>No one is justified in seeking an excuse for ingratitude <lb/>
            in his own weakness or poverty, or in saying, " What am I <lb/>
            to do, and how ? When can I repay my debt to my <lb/>
            superiors the lords of heaven and earth ? " Avaricious as <lb/>
            you are, it is easy for you to give them thanks, without <lb/>
            expense; lazy though you be, you can do it without labour. <lb/>
            At the same instant at which you received your debt to­ <lb/>
            wards them, if you wish to repay it, you have done as <lb/>
            much as any one can do, for he returns a benefit who <lb/>
            receives it with good will.</p>
          <p>XXXI. This paradox of the Stoic philosophy, that he <lb/>
            returns a benefit who receives it with good will, is, in my <lb/>
            opinion, either far from admirable, or else it is incredible. <lb/>
            For if we look at everything merely from the point of view of <lb/>
            our intentions, every man has done as much as he chose to <lb/>
            do; and since filial piety, good faith, justice, and in short <lb/>
            every virtue is complete within itself, a man may be grateful <lb/>
            in intention even though he may not be able to lift a hand <lb/>
            to prove his gratitude. Whenever a man obtains what he <lb/>
            aimed at, he receives the fruit of his labour. When a man <lb/>
            bestows a benefit, at what does he aim ? clearly to be of <lb/>
            service and afford pleasure to him upon whom he be­ <lb/>
            stows it. If he does what he wishes, if his purpose reaches <lb/>
            me and fills us each with joy, he has gained his object. He <lb/>
            does not wish anything to be given to him in return, or else <lb/>
            it becomes an exchange of commodities, not a bestowal of <lb/>
            benefits. A man steers well who reaches the port for which <lb/>
            he started: a dart hurled by a steady hand performs its duty <pb n="48"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK.</note><lb/>
            if it hits the mark; one who bestows a benefit wishes it to be <lb/>
            received with gratitude ; he gets what he wanted if it be <lb/>
            well received. " But," you say, " he hoped for some profit <lb/>
            also." Then it was not a benefit, the property of which is <lb/>
            to think nothing of any repayment. I receive what was <lb/>
            given me in the same spirit in which it was given: then I <lb/>
            have repaid it. If this be not true, then this best of deeds <lb/>
            has this worst of conditions attached to it, that it depends <lb/>
            entirely upon fortune whether I am grateful or not, for if <lb/>
            my fortune is adverse I can make no repayment. The <lb/>
            intention is enough. " What then ? am I not to do what­ <lb/>
            ever I may be able to repay it, and ought I not ever to be <lb/>
            on the watch for an opportunity of filling the bosom 1 of him <lb/>
            from whom I have received any kindness ? True; but a <lb/>
            benefit is in an evil plight if we cannot be grateful for it <lb/>
            even when we are empty-handed.</p>
          <p>XXXII. " A man," it is argued, " who has received a <lb/>
            benefit, however gratefully he may have received it, has not <lb/>
            yet accomplished all his duty, for there remains the part of <lb/>
            repayment; just as in playing at ball it is something to catch <lb/>
            the ball cleverly and carefully, but a man is not called a <lb/>
            good player unless he can handily and quickly send back <lb/>
            the ball which he has caught." This analogy is imperfect; <lb/>
            and why ? Because to do this creditably depends upon the <lb/>
            movement and activity of the body, and not upon the <lb/>
            mind : and an act of which we judge entirely by the eye, <lb/>
            ought to be all clearly displayed. But if a man caught the <lb/>
            ball as he ought to do, I should not call him a bad player <lb/>
            for not returning it, if his delay in returning it was not <lb/>
            caused by his own fault. " Yet," say you, " although the <lb/>
            player is not wanting in skill, because he did one part of <lb/>
            his duty, and was able to do the other part, yet in such a <note type="footnote"> 1 Sinus, the fold of the toga over the breast, used as a pocket by the <lb/>
            Romans. The great French actor Talma, when dressed for the first <lb/>
            time in correct classical costume, indignantly asked where he was to put <lb/>
            his snuff-box. </note> <pb n="49"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXXIII.]</note><lb/>
            case the game is imperfect, for its perfection lies in sending <lb/>
            the ball backwards and forwards." I am unwilling to expose <lb/>
            this fallacy further; let us think that it is the game, not <lb/>
            the player that is imperfect: so likewise in the subject <lb/>
            which we are discussing, the thing which is given lacks <lb/>
            something, because another equal thing ought to be returned <lb/>
            for it, but the mind of the giver lacks nothing, because it <lb/>
            has found another mind equal to itself, and as far as in­ <lb/>
            tentions go, has effected what it wished.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. A man bestows a benefit upon me: I receive <lb/>
            it just as he wished it to be received: then he gets at once <lb/>
            what he wanted, and the only thing which he wanted, and <lb/>
            therefore I have proved myself grateful. After this it <lb/>
            remains for me to enjoy my own resources, with the <lb/>
            addition of an advantage conferred upon me by one whom <lb/>
            I have obliged ; this advantage is not the remainder of an <lb/>
            imperfect service, but an addition to a perfected serviced <lb/>
            For example, Phidias makes a statue. Now the product <lb/>
            of an art is one thing, and that of a trade is another. <lb/>
            It is the business of the art to make the thing which he <lb/>
            wished to make, and that of the trade to make it with a <lb/>
            profit. Phidias has completed his work, even though he <lb/>
            does not sell it. The product, therefore, of his work is <lb/>
            threefold: there is the consciousness of having made it, <lb/>
            which he receives when his work is completed; there is <lb/>
            the fame which he receives; and thirdly, the advantage <lb/>
            which he obtains by it, in influence, or by selling it, or <lb/>
            otherwise. In like manner the first fruit of a benefit is the <lb/>
            consciousness of it, which we feel when we have bestowed <lb/>
            it upon the person whom we chose; secondly and thirdly <lb/>
            there is the credit which we gain by doing so, and there <lb/>
            are those things which we may receive in exchange for it. <lb/>
            So when a benefit has been graciously received, the giver <note type="footnote"> 1 Nothing is wanted to make a benefit, conferred from good motives, <lb/>
            perfect: if it is returned, the gratitude is to be counted as net profit. </note> <note type="footnote"> £ </note> <pb n="50"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. II.</note><lb/>
            has already received gratitude, but has not yet received <lb/>
            recompense for it: that which we owe in return is therefore <lb/>
            something apart from the benefit itself, for we have paid <lb/>
            for the benefit itself when we accept it in a grateful spirit.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. " What," say you, " can a man repay a benefit, <lb/>
            though he does nothing ? " He has taken the first step, <lb/>
            he has offered you a good thing with good feeling, and, <lb/>
            which is the characteristic of friendship, has placed you <lb/>
            both on the same footing. In the next place, a benefit <lb/>
            is not repaid in the same manner as a loan: you have no <lb/>
            reason for expecting me to offer you any payment; the <lb/>
            account between us depends upon the feelings alone. <lb/>
            What I say will not appear difficult, although it may not <lb/>
            at first accord with your ideas, if you will do me the <lb/>
            favour to remember that there are more things than <lb/>
            there are words to express them. There is an enormous <lb/>
            mass of things without names, which we do nol speak of <lb/>
            under distinctive names of their own, but by the names of <lb/>
            other things transferred to them. We speak of our own <lb/>
            foot, of the foot of a couch, of a sail, or of a poem; we apply <lb/>
            the word I dog' to a hound, a fish, and a star. Because we <lb/>
            have not enough words to assign a separate name to each <lb/>
            thing, we borrow a name whenever we want one. Bravery <lb/>
            is the virtue which rightly despises danger, or the science of <lb/>
            repelling, sustaining, or inviting dangers: yet we call a brave <lb/>
            man a gladiator, and we use the same word for a good-for­ <lb/>
            nothing slave, who is led by rashness to defy death. Economy <lb/>
            is the science of avoiding unnecessary expenditure, or the <lb/>
            art of using one's income with moderation: yet we call a <lb/>
            man of mean and narrow mind, most economical, although <lb/>
            there is an immeasurable distance between moderation <lb/>
            and meanness. These things are naturally distinct, yet <lb/>
            the poverty of our language compels us to call both these <lb/>
            men economical, just as he who views slight accidents with <lb/>
            rational contempt, and he who without reason runs into <pb n="51"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXV.]</note><lb/>
            danger are alike called brave. Thus a benefit is both a <lb/>
            beneficent action, and also is that which is bestowed by <lb/>
            that action, such as money, a house, an office in the state: <lb/>
            there is but one name for them both, though their force <lb/>
            and power are widely different.</p>
          <p>XXXV. Wherefore, give me your attention, and you <lb/>
            will soon perceive that I say nothing to which you can <lb/>
            object. That benefit which consists of the action is repaid <lb/>
            when we receive it graciously; that other, which consists <lb/>
            of something material, we have not then repaid, but we <lb/>
            hope to do so. The debt of goodwill has been discharged <lb/>
            by a return of goodwill; the material debt demands a <lb/>
            material return. Thus, although we may declare that he <lb/>
            who has received a benefit with good-will has returned the <lb/>
            favour, yet we counsel him to return to the giver some­ <lb/>
            thing of the same kind as that which he has received. <lb/>
            Some part of what we have said departs from the conven­ <lb/>
            tional line of thought, and then rejoins it by another path. <lb/>
            We declare that a wise man cannot receive an injury; yet, <lb/>
            if a man hits him with his fist, that man will be found guilty <lb/>
            of doing him an injury. We declare that a fool can possess <lb/>
            nothing; yet if a man stole anything from a fool, we should <lb/>
            find that man guilty of theft. We declare that all men are <lb/>
            mad, yet we do not dose all men with hellebore; but we put <lb/>
            into the hands of these very persons, whom we call madmen, <lb/>
            both the right of voting and of pronouncing judgment. <lb/>
            Similarly, we say that a man who has received a benefit <lb/>
            with good-will has returned the favour, yet we leave him <lb/>
            in debt nevertheless-bound to repay it even though he has <lb/>
            repaid it. This is not to disown benefits, but is an en­ <lb/>
            couragement to us neither to fear to receive benefits, nor to <lb/>
            faint under the too great burden of them. " Good things <lb/>
            have been given to me; I have been preserved from starving; <lb/>
            I have been saved from the misery of abject poverty; my <lb/>
            life, and what is dearer than life, my liberty, has been pre­ <pb n="52"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. II.</note><lb/>
            served. How shall I be able to repay these favours ? When <lb/>
            will the day come upon which I can prove my gratitude to <lb/>
            him?" When a man speaks thus, the day has already <lb/>
            come. Receive a benefit, embrace it, rejoice, not that you <lb/>
            have received it, but that you have to owe it and return it ; <lb/>
            then you will never be in peril of the great sin of being ren­ <lb/>
            dered ungrateful by mischance. I will not enumerate any <lb/>
            difficulties to you, lest you should despair, and faint at the <lb/>
            prospect of a long and laborious servitude. I do not refer <lb/>
            you to the future; do it with what means you have at hand. <lb/>
            You never will be grateful unless you are so straightway. <lb/>
            What, then, will you do ? You need not take up arms, yet <lb/>
            perhaps you may have to do so; you need not cross the <lb/>
            seas, yet it may be that you will pay your debt, even when <lb/>
            the wind threatens to blow a gale. Do you wish to return <lb/>
            the benefit? Then receive it graciously; you have then <lb/>
            returned the favour-not, indeed, so that you can think <lb/>
            yourself to have repaid it, but so that you can owe it with <lb/>
            a quieter conscience.</p><pb n="53"/>

          <p>N <lb/>
            OT to return gratitude for benefits, my Æbutius <lb/>
            Liberals, is both base in itself, and is thought base <lb/>
            by all men; wherefore even ungrateful men complain of <lb/>
            ingratitude, and yet what all condemn is at the same time <lb/>
            rooted in all; and so far do men sometimes run into the <lb/>
            other extreme that some of them become our bitterest <lb/>
            enemies, not merely after receiving benefits from us, <lb/>
            but because they have received them. I cannot deny <lb/>
            that some do this out of sheer badness of nature; but <lb/>
            more do so because lapse of time destroys their remem­ <lb/>
            brance, for time gradually effaces what they felt vividly <lb/>
            at the moment. I remember having had an argument <lb/>
            with you about this class of persons, whom you wished <lb/>
            to call forgetful rather than ungrateful, as if that which <lb/>
            caused a man to be ungrateful was any excuse for his <lb/>
            being so, or as if the fact of this happening to a man <lb/>
            prevented his being ungrateful, when we know that it <lb/>
            only happens to ungrateful men. There are many classes <lb/>
            of the ungrateful as there are of thieves or of homicides, <lb/>
            who all have the same fault, though there is a great <lb/>
            variety in its various forms. The man is ungrateful who <lb/>
            denies that he has received a benefit; who pretends that <lb/>
            he has not received it; who does not return it. The <lb/>
            most ungrateful man of all is he who forgets it. The <lb/>
            others, though they do not repay it, yet feel their debt, and <lb/>
            possess some traces of worth, though obstructed by their <pb n="54"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. III.</note><lb/>
            bad conscience. They may by some means and at some <lb/>
            time be brought to show their gratitude, if, for instance, <lb/>
            they be pricked by shame, if they conceive some noble <lb/>
            ambition such as occasionally rises even in the breasts of <lb/>
            the wicked, if some easy opportunity of doing so offers; <lb/>
            but the man from whom all recollection of the benefit has <lb/>
            passed away can never become grateful. Which of the <lb/>
            two do you call the worse-he who is ungrateful for kind­ <lb/>
            ness, or he who does not even remember it ? The eyes which <lb/>
            fear to look at the light are diseased, but those which can­ <lb/>
            not see it are blind. It is filial impiety not to love one's <lb/>
            parents, but not to recognise them is madness.</p>
          <p>II. Who is so ungrateful as he who has so completely <lb/>
            laid aside and cast away that which ought to be in the fore­ <lb/>
            front of his mind and ever before him, that he knows it not ? <lb/>
            It is clear that if forgetfulness of a benefit steals over a <lb/>
            man, he cannot have often thought about repaying it.</p>
          <p>In short, repayment requires gratitude, time, opportunity, <lb/>
            and the help of fortune; whereas, he who remembers a <lb/>
            benefit is grateful for it, and that too without expendi­ <lb/>
            ture. Since gratitude demands neither labour, wealth, <lb/>
            nor good fortune, he who fails to render it has no excuse <lb/>
            behind which to shelter himself; for he who places a <lb/>
            benefit so far away that it is out of his sight, never could <lb/>
            have meant to be grateful for it. Just as those tools which <lb/>
            are kept in use, and are daily touched by the hand, are <lb/>
            never in danger of growing rusty, while those which are not <lb/>
            brought before our eyes, and lie as if superfluous, not being <lb/>
            required for common use, collect dirt by the mere lapse of <lb/>
            time, so likewise that which our thoughts frequently turn <lb/>
            over and renew never passes from our memory, which only <lb/>
            loses those things to which it seldom directs its eyes.</p>
          <p>III. Besides this, there are other causes which at times <lb/>
            erase the greatest services from our minds. The first and <lb/>
            most powerful of these is that, being always intent upon <pb n="55"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. IV.]</note><lb/>
            new objects of desire, we think, not of what we have, but <lb/>
            of what we are striving to obtain. Those whose mind is fixed <lb/>
            entirely upon what they hope to gain, regard with contempt <lb/>
            all that is their own already. It follows that since men's <lb/>
            eagerness for something new makes them undervalue what­ <lb/>
            ever they have received, they do not esteem those from <lb/>
            whom they have received it. As long as we are satisfied <lb/>
            with the position we have gained, we love our benefactor, <lb/>
            we look up to him, and declare that we owe our position <lb/>
            entirely to him; then we begin to entertain other aspira­ <lb/>
            tions, and hurry forward to attain them after the manner of <lb/>
            human beings, who when they have gained much always <lb/>
            covet more; straightway all that we used to regard as bene­ <lb/>
            fits slip from our memory, and we no longer consider the <lb/>
            advantages which we enjoy over others, but only the in­ <lb/>
            solent prosperity of those who have outstripped us. Now <lb/>
            no one can at the same time be both jealous and grateful, <lb/>
            because those who are jealous are querulous and sad, while <lb/>
            the grateful are joyous. In the next place, since none of <lb/>
            us think of any time but the present, and but few turn <lb/>
            back their thoughts to the past, it results that we forget <lb/>
            our teachers, and all the benefits which we have obtained <lb/>
            from them, because we have altogether left our childhood <lb/>
            behind us: thus, all that was done for us in our youth <lb/>
            perishes unremembered, because our youth itself is never <lb/>
            reviewed. What has been is regarded by every one, not <lb/>
            only as past, but as gone; and for the same reason, our <lb/>
            memory is weak for what is about to happen in the future.</p>
          <p>IV. Here I must do Epicurus the justice to say that he <lb/>
            constantly complains of our ingratitude for past benefits, <lb/>
            because we cannot bring back again, or count among our <lb/>
            present pleasures, those good things which we have received <lb/>
            long ago, although no pleasures can be more undeniable <lb/>
            than those which cannot be taken from us. Present good <lb/>
            is not yet altogether complete, some mischance may inter­ <pb n="56"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. III.</note><lb/>
            rupt it; the future is in suspense, and uncertain; but what <lb/>
            is past is laid up in safety. How can any man feel grati­ <lb/>
            tude for benefits, if he skips through his whole life entirely <lb/>
            engrossed with the present and the future ? It is remem­ <lb/>
            brance that makes men grateful; and the more men hope, <lb/>
            the less they remember.</p>
          <p>V. In the same way, my Liberalis, as some things remain <lb/>
            in our memory as soon as they are learned, while to know <lb/>
            others it is not enough to have learned them, for our know­ <lb/>
            ledge slips away from us unless it be kept up—I allude to <lb/>
            geometry and astronomy, and such other sciences as are <lb/>
            hard to remember because of their intricacy-so the great­ <lb/>
            ness of some benefits prevents their being forgotten, while <lb/>
            others, individually less, though many more in number, and <lb/>
            bestowed at different times, pass from our minds, because, as <lb/>
            I have stated above, we do not constantly think about them, <lb/>
            and do not willingly recognize how much we owe to each of <lb/>
            our benefactors. Listen to the words of those who ask for <lb/>
            favours. There is not one of them who does not declare <lb/>
            that his remembrance will be eternal, who does not vow <lb/>
            himself your devoted servant and slave, or find, if he can, <lb/>
            some even greater expression of humility with which to <lb/>
            pledge himself. After a brief space of time these same <lb/>
            men avoid their former expressions, thinking them abject, <lb/>
            and scarcely befitting free-born men; afterwards they arrive <lb/>
            at the same point to which, as I suppose, the worst and <lb/>
            most ungrateful of men come-that is, they forget. So <lb/>
            little does forgetfulness excuse ingratitude, that even the <lb/>
            remembrance of a benefit may leave us ungrateful</p>
          <p>VI. The question has been raised, whether this most <lb/>
            odious vice ought to go unpunished; and whether the law <lb/>
            commonly made use of in the schools, by which we can <lb/>
            proceed against a man for ingratitude, ought to be adopted <lb/>
            by the State also, since all men agree that it is just. Why <lb/>
            not ? " you may say, " seeing that even cities cast in each <pb n="57"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. VII.]</note><lb/>
            other's teeth the services which they have performed to one <lb/>
            another, and demand from the children some return for <lb/>
            benefits conferred upon their fathers ? " On the other hand, <lb/>
            our ancestors, who were most admirable men, made de­ <lb/>
            mands upon their enemies alone, and both gave and lost <lb/>
            their benefits with magnanimity. With the exception of <lb/>
            Macedonia, no nation has ever established an action at law <lb/>
            for ingratitude. And this is a strong argument against its <lb/>
            being established, because all agree in blaming crime; <lb/>
            and homicide, poisoning, parricide, and sacrilege are visited <lb/>
            with different penalties in different countries, but every­ <lb/>
            where with some penalty; whereas this most common vice <lb/>
            is nowhere punished, though it is everywhere blamed. We <lb/>
            do not acquit it; but as it would be most difficult to reckon <lb/>
            accurately the penalty for so varying a matter, we condemn <lb/>
            it only to be hated, and place it upon the list of those <lb/>
            crimes which we refer for judgment to the gods.</p>
          <p>VII. Many arguments occur to me which prove that this <lb/>
            vice ought not to come under the action of the law. First <lb/>
            of all, the best part of a benefit is lost if the benefit can <lb/>
            be sued for at law, as in the case of a loan, or of letting and <lb/>
            hiring. Indeed, the finest part of a benefit is that we have <lb/>
            given it without considering whether we shall lose it or not, <lb/>
            that we have left all this to the free choice of him who <lb/>
            receives it : if I call him before a judge, it begins to be not a <lb/>
            benefit, but a loan. Next, though it is a most honourable <lb/>
            thing to show gratitude, it ceases to be honourable if it be <lb/>
            forced, for in that case no one will praise a grateful man <lb/>
            any more than he praises him who restores the money <lb/>
            which was deposited in his keeping, or who pays what he <lb/>
            borrower without the intervention of a judge. We should <lb/>
            therefore spoil the two finest things in human life,-a <lb/>
            grateful man and a beneficent man ; for what is there ad­ <lb/>
            mirable in one who does not give but merely lends a benefit, <lb/>
            or in one who repays it, not because he wishes, but because <pb n="58"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. III.</note><lb/>
            he is forced to do so ? There is no credit in being grateful, <lb/>
            unless it is safe to be ungrateful. Besides this, all the <lb/>
            courts would hardly be enough for the action of this one <lb/>
            law. Who would not plead under it ? Who would not be <lb/>
            pleaded against? for every one exalts his own merits, every <lb/>
            one magnifies even the smallest matters which he has be­ <lb/>
            stowed upon another. Besides this, those things which form <lb/>
            the subject of a judicial inquiry can be distinctly defined, <lb/>
            and cannot afford unlimited licence to the judge; wherefore <lb/>
            a good cause is in a better position if it be tried before a <lb/>
            judge than before an arbitrator, because the words of the <lb/>
            law tie down a judge and define certain limits beyond <lb/>
            which he may not pass, whereas the conscience of an arbi­ <lb/>
            trator is free and not fettered by any rules, so that he can <lb/>
            either give or take away, and can arrange his decision, not <lb/>
            according to the precepts of law and justice, but just as <lb/>
            his own kindly feeling or compassion may prompt him. <lb/>
            An action for ingratitude would not bind a judge, but <lb/>
            would place him in the position of an autocrat. It cannot <lb/>
            be known what or how great a benefit is; all that would <lb/>
            be really important would be, how indulgently the judge <lb/>
            might interpret it. No law defines an ungrateful person, <lb/>
            often, indeed, one who repays what he has received is un­ <lb/>
            grateful, and one who has not returned it is grateful. <lb/>
            Even an unpractised judge can give his vote upon some <lb/>
            matters; for instance, when the thing to be determined is <lb/>
            whether something has or has not been done, when a dispute <lb/>
            is terminated by the parties giving written bonds, or when <lb/>
            the casting up of accounts decides between the disputants. <lb/>
            When, however, motives have to be guessed at, when matters <lb/>
            upon which wisdom alone can decide, are brought into court, <lb/>
            they cannot be tried by a judge taken at random from the <lb/>
            list of " select judges," 1 whom property and the inheritance <lb/>
            of an equestrian fortune2 has placed upon the roll. <note type="footnote"> 1 See Smith's 11 Dict, of Antiq.," s.v. 2 400,000 sesterces. </note> <pb n="59"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin">CH. VIII.]</note> VIII. Ingratitude, therefore, is not only matter unfit to <lb/>
            be brought into court, but no judge could be found fit to <lb/>
            try it; and this you will not be surprised at, if you exa­ <lb/>
            mine the difficulties of any one who should attempt to <lb/>
            prosecute a man upon such a charge. One man may have <lb/>
            given a large sum of money, but he is rich and would not <lb/>
            feel it; another may have given it at the cost of his entire <lb/>
            inheritance. The sum given is the same in each case, but <lb/>
            the benefit conferred is not the same. Add another in­ <lb/>
            stance : suppose that to redeem a debtor from slavery one <lb/>
            man paid money from his own private means, while another <lb/>
            man paid the same sum, but had to borrow it or beg for it, <lb/>
            and allow himself to be laid under a great obligation to <lb/>
            some one; would you rank the man who so easily bestowed <lb/>
            his benefit on an equality with him who was obliged to <lb/>
            receive a benefit himself before he could bestow it ? Some <lb/>
            benefits are great, not because of their amount, but because <lb/>
            of the time at which they are bestowed; it is a benefit to <lb/>
            give an estate whose fertility can bring down the price of <lb/>
            corn, and it is a benefit to give a loaf of bread in time of <lb/>
            famine; it is a benefit to give provinces through which <lb/>
            flow vast navigable rivers, and it is a benefit, when men <lb/>
            are parched with thirst, and can scarcely draw breath <lb/>
            through their dry throats, to show them a spring of <lb/>
            water. Who will compare these cases with one another, <lb/>
            or weigh one against the other? It is hard to give a <lb/>
            decision when it is not the thing given, but its meaning, <lb/>
            which has to be considered; though what is given is <lb/>
            the same, yet if it be given under different circumstances <lb/>
            it has a different value. A man may have bestowed a <lb/>
            benefit upon me, but unwillingly; he may have com­ <lb/>
            plained of having given it; he may have looked at me <lb/>
            with greater haughtiness than he was wont to do; he may <lb/>
            have been so slow in giving it, that he would have done me <lb/>
            a greater service if he had promptly refused it, How could <pb n="60"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. III.</note><lb/>
            a judge estimate the value of these things, when words, hesi­ <lb/>
            tation, or looks can destroy all their claim to gratitude ?</p>
          <p>IX. What, again, could he do, seeing that some things <lb/>
            are called benefits because they are unduly coveted, whilst <lb/>
            others are not benefits at all, acccording to this common <lb/>
            valuation, yet are of even greater value, though not so <lb/>
            showy ? You call it a benefit to cause a man to be adopted <lb/>
            as a member of a powerful city, to get him enrolled among <lb/>
            the knights, or to defend one who is being tried for his <lb/>
            life: what do you say of him who gives useful advice ? of <lb/>
            him who holds you back when you would rush into crime? <lb/>
            of him who strikes the swvrd from the hands of the suicide ? <lb/>
            of him who by his power of consolation brings back to the <lb/>
            duties of life one who was plunged in grief, and eager to <lb/>
            follow those whom he had lost ? of him who sits at the <lb/>
            bedside of the sick man, and who, when health and reco­ <lb/>
            very depend upon seizing the right moment, administers <lb/>
            food in due season, stimulates the failing veins with wine, <lb/>
            or calls in the physician to the dying man ? Who can esti­ <lb/>
            mate the value of such services as these ? who can bid us <lb/>
            weigh dissimilar benefits one with another? “I gave you <lb/>
            a house," says one. Yes, but I forewarned you that your <lb/>
            own house would come down upon your head. " I gave you <lb/>
            an estate," says he. True, but I gave a plank to you when <lb/>
            shipwrecked. " I fought for you and received wounds for <lb/>
            you," says another. But I saved your life by keeping <lb/>
            silence. Since a benefit is both given and returned differently <lb/>
            by different people, it is hard to make them balance.</p>
          <p>X. Besides this, no day is appointed for repayment of a <lb/>
            benefit, as there is for borrowed money ; consequently he <lb/>
            who has not yet repaid a benefit may do so hereafter: for <lb/>
            tell me, pray, within what time a man is to be declared <lb/>
            ungrateful? The greatest benefits cannot be proved by <lb/>
            evidence; they often lurk in the silent consciousness of two <lb/>
            men only; are we to introduce the rule of not bestowing <pb n="61"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XI.]</note><lb/>
            benefits without witnesses ? Next, what punishment are <lb/>
            we to appoint for the ungrateful ? is there to be one only <lb/>
            for all, though the benefits which they have received are <lb/>
            different? or should the punishment be varying, greater <lb/>
            or less according to the benefit which each has received ? <lb/>
            Are our valuations to be restricted to pecuniary fines? <lb/>
            what are we to do, seeing that in some cases the benefit <lb/>
            conferred is life, and things dearer than life? What <lb/>
            punishment is to be assigned to ingratitude for these? <lb/>
            One less than the benefit ? That would be unjust. One <lb/>
            equal to it; death ? What could be more inhuman than to <lb/>
            cause benefits to result in cruelty ?</p>
          <p>XI. It may be argued, 11 Parents have certain privileges: <lb/>
            these are regarded as exempt from the action of ordinary <lb/>
            rules, and so also ought to be the case with other beneficent <lb/>
            persons." Nay; mankind has assigned a peculiar sanctity <lb/>
            to the position of parents, because it was advantageous that <lb/>
            children should be reared, and people had to be tempted <lb/>
            into undergoing the toil of doing so, because the issue of <lb/>
            their experiment was doubtful. One cannot say to them, <lb/>
            as one does to others who bestow benefits, " Choose the man <lb/>
            to whom you give: you must only blame yourself if you <lb/>
            are deceived; help the deserving." In rearing children <lb/>
            nothing depends upon the judgment of those who rear <lb/>
            them; it is a matter of hope: in order, therefore, that <lb/>
            people may be more willing to embark upon this lottery, it <lb/>
            was right that they should be given a certain authority; <lb/>
            and since it is useful for youth to be governed, we have <lb/>
            placed their parents in the position of domestic magistrates, <lb/>
            under whose guardianship their lives may be ruled. More­ <lb/>
            over, the position of parents differs from that of other bene­ <lb/>
            factors, for their having given formerly to their children does <lb/>
            not stand in the way of their giving now and hereafter; <lb/>
            and also, there is no fear of their falsely asserting that <lb/>
            they have given: with others one has to inquire not only <pb n="62"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. III.</note><lb/>
            whether they have received, but whether they have given; <lb/>
            but the good deeds of parents are placed beyond doubt. <lb/>
            In the next place, one benefit bestowed by parents is the <lb/>
            same for all, and might be counted once for all; while the <lb/>
            others which they bestow are of various kinds, unlike one <lb/>
            to another, differing from one another by the widest possible <lb/>
            intervals; they can therefore come under no regular rule, <lb/>
            since it would be more just to leave them all unrewarded <lb/>
            than to give the same reward to all.</p>
          <p>XII. Some benefits cost much to the givers, some are of <lb/>
            much value to the receivers but cost the givers nothing. <lb/>
            Some are bestowed upon friends, others on strangers: now <lb/>
            although that which is given be the same, yet it becomes <lb/>
            more when it is given to one with whom you are beginning <lb/>
            to be acquainted through the benefits which you have <lb/>
            previously conferred upon him. One man may give us <lb/>
            help, another distinctions, a third consolation. You may <lb/>
            find one who thinks nothing pleasanter or more important <lb/>
            than to have some one to save him from distress; you may <lb/>
            again find one who would rather be helped to great place <lb/>
            than to security; while some consider themselves more in­ <lb/>
            debted to those who save their lives than to those who save <lb/>
            their honour. Each of these services will be held more or <lb/>
            less important, according as the disposition of our judge in­ <lb/>
            clines to one or the other of them. Besides this, I choose my <lb/>
            creditors for myself, whereas I often receive benefits from <lb/>
            those from whom I would not, and sometimes I am laid <lb/>
            under an obligation without my knowledge. What will you <lb/>
            do in such a case ? When a man has received a benefit un­ <lb/>
            known to himself, and which, had he known of it, he would <lb/>
            have refused to receive, will you call him ungrateful if he <lb/>
            does not repay it, however he may have received it ? Sup­ <lb/>
            pose that some one has bestowed a benefit upon me, and that <lb/>
            the same man has afterwards done me some wrong; am <lb/>
            I to be bound by his one bounty to endure with patience <pb n="63"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XIII.]</note><lb/>
            any wrong that he may do me, or will it be the same as if <lb/>
            I had repaid it, because he himself has by the subsequent <lb/>
            wrong cancelled his own benefit ? How, in that case, would <lb/>
            you decide which was the greater; the present which the <lb/>
            man has received, or the injury which has been done him ? <lb/>
            Time would fail me if I attempted to discuss all the diffi­ <lb/>
            culties which would arise.</p>
          <p>XIII. It may be argued that 11 we render men less willing <lb/>
            to confer benefits by not supporting the claim of those <lb/>
            which have been bestowed to meet with gratitude, and by <lb/>
            not punishing those who repudiate them." But you would <lb/>
            find, on the other hand, that men would be far less willing <lb/>
            to receive benefits, if by so doing they were likely to incur <lb/>
            the danger of having to plead their cause in court, and <lb/>
            having more difficulty in proving their integrity. This <lb/>
            legislation would also render us less willing to give : for no <lb/>
            one is willing to give to those who are unwilling to receive, <lb/>
            but one who is urged to acts of kindness by his own good <lb/>
            nature and by the beauty of charity, will give all the more <lb/>
            freely to those who need make no return unless they <lb/>
            choose. It impairs the credit of doing a service, if in doing <lb/>
            it we are carefully protected from loss.</p>
          <p>XIV. " Benefits, then, will be fewer, but more genuine: <lb/>
            well, what harm is there in restricting people from giving <lb/>
            recklessly ? " Even those who would have no legislation upon <lb/>
            the subject follow this rule, that we ought to be somewhat <lb/>
            careful in giving, and in choosing those upon whom we be­ <lb/>
            stow favours. Reflect over and over again to whom you <lb/>
            are giving: you will have no remedy at law, no means of <lb/>
            enforcing repayment. You are mistaken if you suppose <lb/>
            that the judge will assist you: no law will make full <lb/>
            restitution to you, you must look only to the honour of the <lb/>
            receiver. Thus only can benefits retain their influence, and <lb/>
            thus only are they admirable : you dishonour them if you <lb/>
            make them the grounds of litigation. "Pay what you <pb n="64"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. III.</note><lb/>
            owe " is a most just proverb, and one which carries with it <lb/>
            the sanction of all nations ; but in dealing with benefits it <lb/>
            is most shameful. "Pay!" How is a man to pay who owes <lb/>
            his life, his position, his safety, or his reason to another? <lb/>
            None of the greatest benefits can be repaid. " Yet," it is <lb/>
            said, " you ought to give in return for them something of <lb/>
            equal value." This is just what I have been saying, that <lb/>
            the grandeur of the act is ruined if we make our benefits <lb/>
            commercial transactions. We ought not to encourage our­ <lb/>
            selves in avarice, in discontent, or in quarrels ; the human <lb/>
            mind is prone enough to these by nature. As far as we <lb/>
            are able, let us check it, and cut off the opportunities for <lb/>
            which it seeks.</p>
          <p>XV. Would that we could indeed persuade mento receive <lb/>
            back money which they have lent from those debtors only <lb/>
            who are willing to pay! would that no agreement ever bound <lb/>
            the buyer to the seller, and that their interests were not pro­ <lb/>
            tected by sealed covenants and agreements, but rather by <lb/>
            honour and a sense of justice! However, men prefer what <lb/>
            is needful to what is truly best, and choose rather to <unclear>foro</unclear> <lb/>
            their creditors to keep faith with them than to trust the <lb/>
            they will do so. Witnesses are called on both sides; thE <lb/>
            one, by calling in brokers, makes several names appear in <lb/>
            his accounts as his debtors instead of one; the other is not <lb/>
            content with the legal forms of question and answer unless <lb/>
            he holds the other party by the hand. What a shameful <lb/>
            admission of the dishonesty and wickedness of mankind ! <lb/>
            men trust more to our signet-rings than to our intentions. <lb/>
            For what are these respectable men summoned ? for what <lb/>
            do they impress their seals ? it is in order that the borrower <lb/>
            may not deny that he has received what he has received. <lb/>
            You regard these men, I suppose, as above bribes, as main­ <lb/>
            tainers of the truth: well, these very men will not be en­ <lb/>
            trusted with money except on the same terms. Would it not, <lb/>
            then, be more honourable to be deceived by some than to <pb n="65"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XVI.]</note><lb/>
            suspect all men of dishonesty ? To fill up the measure of <lb/>
            avarice one thing only is lacking, that we should bestow no <lb/>
            benefit without a surety. To help, to be of service, is the <lb/>
            part of a generous and noble mind; he who gives acts like <lb/>
            a god, he who demands repayment acts like a money-lender. <lb/>
            Why then, by trying to protect the rights of the former <lb/>
            class, should we reduce them to the level of the basest of <lb/>
            mankind ?</p>
          <p>XVI. 11 More men," our opponent argues, 11 will be un­ <lb/>
            grateful, if no legal remedy exists against ingratitude." <lb/>
            Nay, fewer, because then benefits will be bestowed with <lb/>
            more discrimination. In the next place, it is not advisable <lb/>
            that it should be publicly known how many ungrateful <lb/>
            men there are: for the number of sinners will do away with <lb/>
            the disgrace of the sin, and a reproach which applies to all <lb/>
            men will cease to be dishonourable. Is any woman ashamed <lb/>
            of being divorced, now that some noble ladies reckon the <lb/>
            years of their lives, not by the number of the consuls, but <lb/>
            by that of their husbands, now that they leave their homes <lb/>
            a order to marry others, and marry only in order to be <lb/>
            divorced? Divorce was only dreaded as long as it was <lb/>
            unusual; now that no gazette appears without it, women <lb/>
            learn to do what they hear so much about. Can any one <lb/>
            feel ashamed of adultery, now that things have come to <lb/>
            such a pass that no woman keeps a husband at all, unless <lb/>
            fit be to pique her lover? Chastity merely implies ugliness. <lb/>
            Where will you find any woman so abject, so repulsive, <unclear/> <lb/>
            as to be satisfied with a single pair of lovers, without <unclear/> <lb/>
            naving a different one for each hour of the day; nor is <lb/>
            the day long enough for all of them, unless she has taken <lb/>
            her airing in the grounds of one, and passes the night with <lb/>
            another. A woman is frumpish and old-fashioned if she <lb/>
            does not know that " adultery with one paramour is nick­ <lb/>
            named marriage." Just as all shame at these vices has <lb/>
            disappeared since the vice itself became so widely spread, <note type="footnote"> F </note> <pb n="66"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. III.</note><lb/>
            so if you made the ungrateful begin to count their own <lb/>
            numbers, you would both make them more numerous, and <lb/>
            enable them to be ungrateful with greater impunity.</p>
          <p>XVII. “ What then ? shall the ungrateful man go un­ <lb/>
            punished ? " What then, I answer, shall we punish the <lb/>
            undutiful, the malicious, the avaricious, the headstrong, <lb/>
            and the cruel ? Do you imagine that those things which <lb/>
            are loathed are not punished, or do you suppose that any <lb/>
            punishment is greater than the hate of all men ? It is a <lb/>
            punishment not to dare to receive a benefit from anyone, <lb/>
            not to dare to bestow one, to be, or to fancy that you are <lb/>
            a mark for all men's eyes, and to lose all appreciation of <lb/>
            so excellent and pleasant a matter. Do you call a man <lb/>
            unhappy who has lost his sight, or whose hearing has been <lb/>
            impaired by disease, and do you not call him wretched who <lb/>
            has lost the power of feeling benefits ? He fears the gods, <lb/>
            the witnesses of all ingratitude; he is tortured by the <lb/>
            thought of the benefit which he has misapplied, and, in <lb/>
            fine, he is sufficiently punished by this great penalty, that, <lb/>
            as I said before, he cannot enjoy the fruits of this most <lb/>
            delightful act. On the other hand, he who takes pleasure <lb/>
            in receiving a benefit, enjoys an unvarying and continuous <lb/>
            happiness, which he derives from consideration, not of the <lb/>
            thing given, but of the intention of the giver. A benefit <lb/>
            gives perpetual joy to a grateful man, but pleases an un­ <lb/>
            grateful one only for a moment. Can the lives of such <lb/>
            men be compared, seeing that the one is sad and gloomy— <lb/>
            as it is natural that a denier of his debts and a defrauder <lb/>
            should be, a man who does not give his parents, his nurses, <lb/>
            or his teachers the honour which is their due—while the <lb/>
            other is joyous, cheerful, on the watch for an opportunity <lb/>
            of proving his gratitude, and gaining much pleasure from <lb/>
            this frame of mind itself ? Such a man has no wish to j <lb/>
            become bankrupt, but only to make the fullest and most <lb/>
            copious return for benefits, and that not only to parents <pb n="67"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XVIII.]</note><lb/>
            and friends, but also to more humble persons; for even <lb/>
            if he receives a benefit from his own slave, he does not <lb/>
            consider from whom he receives it, but what he receives.</p>
          <p>XVIII. It has, however, been doubted by Hecaton and <lb/>
            some other writers, whether a slave can bestow a benefit <lb/>
            upon his master. Some distinguish between benefits, <lb/>
            duties, and services, calling those things benefits which <lb/>
            are bestowed by a stranger-that is, by one who could dis­ <lb/>
            continue them without blame-while duties are performed <lb/>
            by our children, our wives, and those whom relationship <lb/>
            prompts and orders to afford us help; and, thirdly, ser­ <lb/>
            vices are performed by slaves, whose position is such that <lb/>
            nothing which they do for their master can give them any <lb/>
            claim upon him....</p>
          <p>Besides this, he who affirms that a slave does not some­ <lb/>
            times confer a benefit upon his master is ignorant of the <lb/>
            rights of man; for the question is, not what the station <lb/>
            in life of the giver may be, but what his intentions are. <lb/>
            The path of virtue is closed to no one, it lies open to all; <lb/>
            it admits and invites all, whether they be free-born men, <lb/>
            slaves or freed-men, kings or exiles; it requires no quali­ <lb/>
            fications of family or of property, it is satisfied with a <lb/>
            mere man. What, indeed, should we have to trust to for <lb/>
            defence against sudden misfortunes, what could a noble <lb/>
            mind promise to itself to keep unshaken, if virtue could <lb/>
            be lost together with prosperity ? If a slave cannot confer <lb/>
            a benefit upon his master, then no subject can confer a <lb/>
            benefit upon his king, and no soldier upon his general; for <lb/>
            so long as the man is subject to supreme authority, the <lb/>
            form of authority can make no difference. If main force, <lb/>
            or the fear of death and torture, can prevent a slave from <lb/>
            gaining any title to his master's gratitude, they will also <lb/>
            prevent the subjects of a king, or the soldiers of a general <lb/>
            from doing so, for the same things may happen to either <lb/>
            of these classes of men, though under different names. <pb n="68"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. III.</note><lb/>
            Yet men do bestow benefits upon their kings and their <lb/>
            generals; therefore slaves can bestow benefits upon their <lb/>
            masters. A slave can be just, brave, magnanimous; he <lb/>
            can therefore bestow a benefit, for this is also the part of a <lb/>
            virtuous man. So true is it that slaves can bestow benefits <lb/>
            upon their masters, that the masters have often owed <lb/>
            their lives to them.</p>
          <p>XIX. There is no doubt that a slave can bestow a bene­ <lb/>
            fit upon anyone ; why, then, not upon his master ? " Be­ <lb/>
            cause," it is argued, "he cannot become his master's <lb/>
            creditor if he gives him money. If this be not so, he daily <lb/>
            lays his master under an obligation to him; he attends <lb/>
            him when on a journey, he nurses him when sick, he works <lb/>
            most laboriously at the cultivation of his estate; yet all <lb/>
            these, which would be called benefits if done for us by any­ <lb/>
            one else, are merely called service when done by a slave. <lb/>
            A benefit is that which some one bestows who has the <lb/>
            option of withholding it: now a slave has no power to <lb/>
            refuse, so that he does not afford us his help, but obeys our <lb/>
            orders, and cannot boast of having done what he could not <lb/>
            leave undone." Even under these conditions I shall win <lb/>
            the day, and will place a slave in such positions, that for <lb/>
            many purposes he will be free ; in the meanwhile, tell me, <lb/>
            if I give you an instance of a slave fighting for his master's <lb/>
            safety without regard to himself, pierced through with <lb/>
            wounds, yet spending the last drops of his blood, and gain­ <lb/>
            ing time for his master to escape by the sacrifice of his <lb/>
            life, will you say that this man did not bestow a benefit <lb/>
            upon his master because he was a slave ? If I give an <lb/>
            instance of one who could not be bribed to betray his <lb/>
            master's secrets by any of the offers of a tyrant, who was <lb/>
            not terrified by any threats, nor overpowered by any tor­ <lb/>
            tures, but who, as far as he was able, placed his questioners <lb/>
            upon a wrong scent, and paid for his loyalty with his life, <lb/>
            will you say that this man did not confer a benefit upon <pb n="69"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XX.]</note><lb/>
            his master because he was a slave? Consider, rather, <lb/>
            whether an example of virtue in a slave be not all the <lb/>
            greater because it is rarer than in free men, and whether <lb/>
            it be not all the more gratifying that, although to be com­ <lb/>
            manded is odious, and all submission to authority is irk­ <lb/>
            some, yet in some particular cases love for a master has <lb/>
            been more powerful than men's general dislike to servi. <lb/>
            tude. A benefit does not, therefore, cease to be a benefit <lb/>
            because it is bestowed by a slave, but is all the greater on <lb/>
            that account, because not even slavery could restrain him <lb/>
            from bestowing it.</p>
          <p>XX. It is a mistake to imagine that slavery pervades a <lb/>
            man's whole being; the better part of him is exempt from <lb/>
            it: the body indeed is subjected and in the power of a <lb/>
            master, but the mind is independent, and indeed is so free <lb/>
            and wild, that it cannot be restrained even by this prison <lb/>
            of the body, wherein it is confined, from following its <lb/>
            own impulses, dealing with gigantic designs, and soaring <lb/>
            into the infinite, accompanied by all the host of heaven. <lb/>
            It is, therefore, only the body which misfortune hands <lb/>
            over to a master, and which he buys and sells; this in­ <lb/>
            ward part cannot be transferred as a chattel. Whatever <lb/>
            comes from this, is free; indeed, we are not allowed to <lb/>
            order all things to be done, nor are slaves compelled to <lb/>
            obey us in all things; they will not carry out treasonable <lb/>
            orders, or lend their hands to an act of crime.</p>
          <p>XXI. There are some things which the law neither <lb/>
            enjoins nor forbids; it is in these that a slave finds the <lb/>
            means of bestowing benefits. As long as we only receive <lb/>
            what is generally demanded from a slave, that is mere <lb/>
            service; when more is given than a slave need afford us, <lb/>
            it is a benefit; as soon as what he does begins to partake <lb/>
            of the affection of a friend, it can no longer be called <lb/>
            service. There are certain things with which a master is <lb/>
            bound to provide his slave, such as food and clothing; no <pb n="70"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. III.</note><lb/>
            one calls this a benefit; but supposing that he indulges <lb/>
            his slave, educates him above his station, teaches him arts <lb/>
            which free-born men learn, that is a benefit. The converse <lb/>
            is true in the case of the slave; anything which goes <lb/>
            beyond the rules of a slave's duty, which is done of his <lb/>
            own free will, and not in obedience to orders, is a benefit, <lb/>
            provided it be of sufficient importance to be called by such <lb/>
            a name if bestowed by any other person.</p>
          <p>XXII. It has pleased Chrysippus to define a slave as " a <lb/>
            hireling for life." Just as a hireling bestows a benefit <lb/>
            when he does more than he engaged himself to do, so when <lb/>
            a slave's love for his master raises him above his condition <lb/>
            and urges him to do something noble-something which <lb/>
            would be a credit even to men more fortunate by birth­ <lb/>
            he surpasses the hopes of his master, and is a benefit found <lb/>
            in the house. Do you think it is just that we should be <lb/>
            angry with our slaves when they do less than their duty, <lb/>
            and that we should not be grateful to them when they do <lb/>
            more ? Do you wish to know when their service is not a <lb/>
            benefit ? When the question can be asked, " What if he <lb/>
            had refused to do it ? " When he does that which he <lb/>
            might have refused to do, we must praise his good will. <lb/>
            Benefits and wrongs are opposites; a slave can bestow a <lb/>
            benefit upon his master, if he can receive a wrong from his <lb/>
            master. Now an official has been appointed to hear com­ <lb/>
            plaints of the wrongs done by masters to their slaves, <lb/>
            whose duty it is to restrain cruelty and lust, or avarice in <lb/>
            providing them with the necessaries of life. What follows, <lb/>
            then ? Is it the master who receives a benefit from his <lb/>
            slave? nay, rather, it is one man who receives it from <lb/>
            another. Lastly, he did all that lay in his power; he <lb/>
            bestowed a benefit upon his master; it lies in your power <lb/>
            to receive or not to receive it from a slave. Yet who is <lb/>
            so exalted, that fortune may not make him need the aid <lb/>
            even of the lowliest ?</p><pb n="71"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin">CH. XXIII.] </note>XXIII. I shall now quote a number of instances of <lb/>
            benefits, not all alike, some even contradictory. Some <lb/>
            slaves have given their master life, some death; have <lb/>
            saved him when perishing, or, as if that were not enough, <lb/>
            have saved him by their own death; others have helped <lb/>
            their master to die, some have saved his life by stratagem. <lb/>
            Claudius Quadrigarius tells us in the eighteenth book of <lb/>
            his 11 Annals," that when Grumeutum was being besieged, <lb/>
            and had been reduced to the greatest straits, two slaves <lb/>
            deserted to the enemy, and did valuable service. After­ <lb/>
            wards, when the city was taken, and the victors were rush­ <lb/>
            ing wildly in every direction, they ran before every one <lb/>
            else along the streets, which they well knew, to the house <lb/>
            in which they had been slaves, and drove their mistress <lb/>
            before them; when they were asked who she might be, <lb/>
            they answered that she was their mistress, and a most <lb/>
            cruel one, and that they were leading her away for punish­ <lb/>
            ment. They led her outside the walls, and concealed her <lb/>
            with the greatest care until the fighting was over; then, <lb/>
            as the soldiery, satisfied with the sack of the city, quickly <lb/>
            resumed the manners of Romans, they also returned to <lb/>
            their own countrymen, and themselves restored their mis­ <lb/>
            tress to them. She manumitted each of them on the spot, <lb/>
            and was not ashamed to receive her life from men over <lb/>
            whom she had held the power of life and death. She <lb/>
            might, indeed, especially congratulate herself upon this; <lb/>
            for had she been saved otherwise, she would merely have <lb/>
            received a common and hackneyed piece of kindness, <lb/>
            whereas, by being saved as she was, she became a glorious <lb/>
            legend, and an example to two cities. In the confusion of <lb/>
            the captured city, when every one was thinking only of his <lb/>
            own safety, all deserted her except these deserters; but <lb/>
            they, that they might prove what had been their intentions <lb/>
            in effecting that desertion, deserted again from the victors <lb/>
            to the captive, wearing the masks of unnatural murderers. <pb n="72"/>
            <note type="margin">[BK. III.</note><lb/>
            They thought-and this was the greatest part of the service <lb/>
            which they rendered-they were content to seem to have <lb/>
            murdered their mistress, if thereby their mistress might be <lb/>
            saved from murder. Believe me, it is the mark of no slavish <lb/>
            soul to purchase a noble deed by the semblance -of crime.</p>
          <p>When Vettius, the praetor of the Marsi, was being led <lb/>
            into the presence of the Roman general, his slave snatched <lb/>
            a sword from the soldier who was dragging him along, and <lb/>
            first slew his master. Then he said, 11 It is now time for me <lb/>
            to look to myself; I have already set my master free," and <lb/>
            with these words transfixed himself with one blow. Can you <lb/>
            tell me of anyone who saved his master more gloriously ?</p>
          <p>XXIV. When Caesar was besieging Corfinium, Domitius, <lb/>
            who was shut up in the city, ordered a slave of his own, <lb/>
            who was also a physician, to give him poison. Observing <lb/>
            the manus hesitation, he said, "Why do you delay, as <lb/>
            though the whole business was in your power ? I ask for <lb/>
            death with arms in my hands." Then the slave assented, <lb/>
            and gave him a harmless drug to drink. When Domitius <lb/>
            fell asleep after drinking this, the slave went to his son, <lb/>
            and said, 11 Give orders for my being kept in custody until <lb/>
            you learn from the result whether I have given your father <lb/>
            poison or no." Domitius lived, and Caesar saved his life; <lb/>
            but his slave had saved it before.</p>
          <p>XXV. During the civil war, a slave hid his master, who <lb/>
            had been proscribed, put on his rings and clothes, met the <lb/>
            soldiers who were searching for him, and, after declaring <lb/>
            that he would not stoop to entreat them not to carry out <lb/>
            their orders, offered his neck to their swords. What a <lb/>
            noble spirit it shows in a slave to have been willing to die <lb/>
            for his master, at a time when few were faithful enough to <lb/>
            wish their master to live! to be found kind when the state <lb/>
            was cruel, faithful when it was treacherous! to be eager <lb/>
            for the reward of fidelity, though it was death, at a time <lb/>
            when such rich rewards were offered for treachery !</p><pb n="73"/>
            
          <p>CH. XXVI.] XXVI. I will not pass over the instances which our own <lb/>
            age affords. In the reign of Tiberius Caesar, there was a. <lb/>
            common and almost universal frenzy for informing, which <lb/>
            was more ruinous to the citizens of Rome than the whole <lb/>
            civil war; the talk of drunkards, the frankness of jesters, <lb/>
            was alike reported to the government; nothing was safe; <lb/>
            every opportunity of ferocious punishment was seized, <lb/>
            and men no longer waited to hear the fate of accused per­ <lb/>
            sons, since it was always the same. One Paulus, of the <lb/>
            Praetorian guard, was at an entertainment, wearing a por­ <lb/>
            trait of Tiberius Caesar engraved in relief upon a gem. It <lb/>
            would be absurd for me to beat about the bush for some <lb/>
            delicate way of explaining that he took up a chamber-pot, <lb/>
            an action which was at once noticed by Maro, one of the <lb/>
            most notorious informers of that time, and the slave of the <lb/>
            man who was about to fall into the trap, who drew the ring <lb/>
            from the finger of his drunken master. When Maro called <lb/>
            the guests <unclear>to</unclear> witness that Paulus had dishonoured the por­ <lb/>
            trait of the emperor, and was already drawing up an act of <lb/>
            accusation, the slave showed the ring upon his own finger. <lb/>
            Such a man no more deserves to be called a slave, than <lb/>
            Maro deserved to be called a guest.</p>
          <p>XXVII. In the reign of Augustus men's own words were <lb/>
            not yet able to ruin them, yet they sometimes brought them <lb/>
            into trouble. A senator named Rufus, while at dinner, <lb/>
            expressed a hope that Caesar would not return safe from a <lb/>
            journey for which he was preparing, and added that all <lb/>
            bulls and calves wished the same thing. Some of those <lb/>
            present carefully noted these words. At daybreak, the <lb/>
            slave who had stood at his feet during the dinner, told <lb/>
            him what he had said in his cups, and urged him to be the <lb/>
            first to go to Caesar, and denounce himself. Rufus followed <lb/>
            this advice, met Caesar as he was going down to the forum, <lb/>
            and, swearing that he was out of his mind the day before, <lb/>
            prayed that what he had said might fall upon his own <pb n="74"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. III.</note><lb/>
            head and that of his children ; he then begged Caesar to <lb/>
            pardon him, and to take him back into favour. When <lb/>
            Caesar said that he would do so, he added, “No one will <lb/>
            believe that you have taken me back into favour unless you <lb/>
            make me a present of something;" and he asked for and <lb/>
            obtained a sum of money so large, that it would have been <lb/>
            a gift not to be slighted even if bestowed by an unoffended <lb/>
            prince. Caesar added: "In future I will take care never <lb/>
            to quarrel with you, for my own sake." Caesar acted <lb/>
            honourably in pardoning him, and in being liberal as well <lb/>
            as forgiving; no one can hear this anecdote without praising <lb/>
            Caesar, but he must praise the slave first. You need not <lb/>
            wait for me to tell you that the slave who did his master <lb/>
            this service was set free ; yet his master did not do this for <lb/>
            nothing, for Caesar had already paid him the price of the <lb/>
            slave's liberty.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. After so many instances, can we doubt that a <lb/>
            master may sometimes receive a benefit from a slave? <lb/>
            Why need the person of the giver detract from the thing <lb/>
            which he gives ? why should not the gift add rather to the <lb/>
            glory of the giver. All men descend from the same original <lb/>
            stock; no one is better born than another, except in so far <lb/>
            as his disposition is no bIer and better suited for the per­ <lb/>
            formance of good actions. Those who display portraits of <lb/>
            their ancestors in their halls, and set up in the entrance to <lb/>
            their houses the pedigree of their family drawn out at <lb/>
            length, with many complicated collateral branches, are <lb/>
            they not notorious rather than noble? The universe is <lb/>
            the one parent of all, whether they trace their descent <lb/>
            from this primary source through a glorious or a mean <lb/>
            line of ancestors. Be not deceived when men who are <lb/>
            reckoning up their genealogy, wherever an illustrious name <lb/>
            is wanting, foist in that of a god in its place. You need <lb/>
            despise no one, even though he bears a commonplace name, <lb/>
            and owes little to fortune. Whether your immediate an­ <pb n="75"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXIX.] </note> cestors were freedmen, or slaves, or foreigners, pluck up <lb/>
            your spirits boldly, and leap over any intervening disgraces <lb/>
            of your pedigree ; at its source, a noble origin awaits you. <lb/>
            Why should our pride inflate us to such a degree that we <lb/>
            think it beneath us to receive benefits from slaves, and think <lb/>
            only of their position, forgetting their good deeds? You, <lb/>
            the slave of lust, of gluttony, of a harlot, nay, who are <lb/>
            owned as a joint chattel by harlots, can you call anyone <lb/>
            else a slave ? Call a man a slave ? why, I pray you, whither <lb/>
            are you being hurried by those bearers who carry your litter ? <lb/>
            whither are these men with their smart military-looking <lb/>
            cloaks carrying you ? is it not to the door of some door­ <lb/>
            keeper, or to the gardens of some one who has not even a sub­ <lb/>
            ordinate office? and then you, who regard the salute of an­ <lb/>
            other man's slave as a benefit, declare that you cannot receive <lb/>
            a benefit from your own slave. What inconsistency is this ? <lb/>
            At the same time you despise and fawn upon slaves, you <lb/>
            are haughty and violent at home, while out of doors you <lb/>
            are meek, and as much despised as you despise your <lb/>
            slaves; for none abase themselves lower than those who un­ <lb/>
            conscionably give themselves airs, nor are anymore prepared <lb/>
            to trample upon others than those who have learned how to <lb/>
            offer insults by having endured them.</p>
          <p>XXIX. I felt it my duty to say this, in order to crush <lb/>
            the arrogance of men who are themselves at the mercy of <lb/>
            fortune, and to claim the right of bestowing a benefit for <lb/>
            slaves, in order that I may claim it also for sons. The <lb/>
            question arises, whether children can ever bestow upon <lb/>
            their parents greater benefits than those which they have <lb/>
            received from them.</p>
          <p>It is granted that many sons become greater and more <lb/>
            powerful than their parents, and also that they are better <lb/>
            men. If this be true, they may give better gifts to their <lb/>
            fathers than they have received from them, seeing that <lb/>
            their fortune and their good nature are alike greater than <pb n="76"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. III.</note><lb/>
            that of their father. " Whatever a father receives from <lb/>
            his son," our opponent will urge, " must in any case be less <lb/>
            than what the son received from him, because the son owes <lb/>
            to his father the very power of giving. Therefore the father <lb/>
            can never be surpassed in the bestowal of benefits, because <lb/>
            the benefit which surpasses his own is really his." I <lb/>
            answer, that some things derive their first origin from <lb/>
            others, yet are greater than those others; and a thing <lb/>
            may be greater than that from which it took its rise, al­ <lb/>
            though without that thing to start from it never could <lb/>
            have grown so great. All things greatly outgrow their <lb/>
            beginnings. Seeds are the causes of all things, and yet <lb/>
            are the smallest part of the things which they produce. <lb/>
            Look at the Rhine, or the Euphrates, or any other famous <lb/>
            rivers; how small they are, if you only view them at the <lb/>
            place from whence they take their rise ? they gain all that <lb/>
            makes them terrible and renowned as they flow along. <lb/>
            Look at the trees which are tallest if you consider their <lb/>
            height, and the broadest if you look at their thickness and <lb/>
            the spread of their branches; compared with all this, how <lb/>
            small a part of them is contained in the slender fibres of <lb/>
            the root ? Yet take away their roots, and no more groves <lb/>
            will arise, nor great mountains be clothed with trees. <lb/>
            Temples and cities are supported by their foundations; <lb/>
            yet what is built as the foundation of the entire building <lb/>
            lies out of sight. So it is in other matters; the subsequent <lb/>
            greatness of a thing ever eclipses its origin. I could never <lb/>
            have obtained anything without having previously received <lb/>
            the boon of existence from my parents; yet it does not <lb/>
            follow from this that whatever I obtain is less than that <lb/>
            without which I could not obtain it. If my nurse had not <lb/>
            fed me when I was a child, I should not have been able to <lb/>
            conduct any of those enterprises which I now carry on, <lb/>
            both with my head and with my hand, nor should I ever <lb/>
            have obtained the fame which is due to my labours both <pb n="77"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXX.] </note><lb/>
            in peace and war; would you on that account argue that <lb/>
            the services of a nurse were more valuable than the most <lb/>
            important undertakings? Yet is not the nurse as im­ <lb/>
            portant as the father, since without the benefits which I <lb/>
            have received from each of them alike, I should have been <lb/>
            alike unable to effect anything ? If I owe all that I now <lb/>
            can do to my original beginning, I cannot regard my father <lb/>
            or my grandfather as being this original beginning; there <lb/>
            always will be a spring further back, from which the spring <lb/>
            next below is derived. Yet no one will argue that I owe <lb/>
            more to unknown and forgotten ancestors than to my <lb/>
            father; though really I do owe them more, if I owe it to <lb/>
            my ancestors that my father begat me.</p>
          <p>XXX. " Whatever I have bestowed upon my father," <lb/>
            says my opponent, 11 however great it may be, yet is less <lb/>
            valuable than what my father has bestowed upon me, <lb/>
            because if he had not begotten me, it never could have <lb/>
            existed at all." By this mode of reasoning, if a man has <lb/>
            healed my father when ill, and at the point of death, I <lb/>
            shall not be able to bestow anything upon him equivalent <lb/>
            to what I have received from him; for had my father not <lb/>
            been healed, he could not have begotten me. Yet think <lb/>
            whether it be not nearer the truth to regard all that I can <lb/>
            do, and all that I have done, as mine, due to my own <lb/>
            powers and my own will ? Consider what the fact of my <lb/>
            birth is in itself; you will see that it is a small matter, the <lb/>
            outcome of which is dubious, and that it may lead equally <lb/>
            to good or to evil; no doubt it is the first step to every­ <lb/>
            thing, but because it is the first, it is not on that account <lb/>
            more important than all the others. Suppose that I have <lb/>
            saved my father's life, raised him to the highest honours, <lb/>
            and made him the chief man in his city, that I have not <lb/>
            merely made him illustrious by my own deeds, but have <lb/>
            furnished him himself with an opportunity of performing <lb/>
            great exploits, which is at once important, easy, and safe, <pb n="78"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. III.</note><lb/>
            as well as glorious; that I have loaded him with appoint­ <lb/>
            ments, wealth, and all that attracts men's minds; still, even <lb/>
            when I surpass all others, I am inferior to him. Now if you <lb/>
            say, “You owe to your father the power of doing all this," <lb/>
            I shall answer, " Quite true, if to do all this it is only neces­ <lb/>
            sary to be born; but if life is merely an unimportant <lb/>
            factor in the art of living well, and if you have bestowed <lb/>
            upon me only that which I have in common with wild <lb/>
            beasts and the smallest, and some of the foulest of crea­ <lb/>
            tures, do not claim for yourself what did not come into <lb/>
            being in consequence of the benefits which you bestowed, <lb/>
            even though it could not have come into being without <lb/>
            them."</p>
          <p>XXXI. Suppose, father, that I have saved your life, in <lb/>
            return for the life which I received from you: in this case <lb/>
            also I have outdone your benefit, because I have given life <lb/>
            to one who understands what I have done, and because I <lb/>
            understood what I was doing, since I gave you your life <lb/>
            not for the sake of, or by the means of my own pleasure; <lb/>
            for just as it is less terrible to die before one has time to <lb/>
            fear death, so it is a much greater boon to preserve one's <lb/>
            life than to receive it. I have given life to one who will <lb/>
            at once enjoy it, you gave it to one who knew not if he <lb/>
            should ever live; I have given life to one who was in fear <lb/>
            of death, your gift of life merely enables me to die; I have <lb/>
            given you a life complete, perfect; you begat me without <lb/>
            intelligence, a burden upon others. Do you wish to know <lb/>
            how far from a benefit it was to give life under such con­ <lb/>
            ditions? You should have exposed me as a child, for you <lb/>
            did me a wrong in begetting me. What do I gather from <lb/>
            this ? That the cohabitation of a father and mother is <lb/>
            the very least of benefits to their child, unless in addition <lb/>
            this beginning of kindnesses be followed up by others, and <lb/>
            confirmed by other services. It is not a good tiling to live, <lb/>
            but to live well. " But," say you, " I do live well." True, but <pb n="79"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXXII.]</note><lb/>
            I might have lived ill; so that your part in me is merely <lb/>
            this, that I live. If you claim merit to yourself for giving <lb/>
            me mere life, bare and helpless, and boast of it as a great <lb/>
            boon, reflect that this you claim merit for giving me is a <lb/>
            boon which I possess in common with flies and worms. In <lb/>
            the next place, if I say no more than that I have applied <lb/>
            myself to honourable pursuits, and have guided the course <lb/>
            of my life along the path of rectitude, then you have <lb/>
            received more from your benefit than you gave; for you <lb/>
            gave me to myself ignorant and unlearned, and I have <lb/>
            returned to you a son such as you would wish to have <lb/>
            begotten.</p>
          <p>XXXII. My father supported me. If I repay this kind­ <lb/>
            ness, I give him more than I received, because he has the <lb/>
            pleasure, not only of being supported, but of being sup­ <lb/>
            ported by a son, and receives more delight from my filial <lb/>
            devotion than from the food itself, whereas the food which <lb/>
            he used to give me merely affected my body. What ? if <lb/>
            any man rises so high as to become famous among nations <lb/>
            for his eloquence, his justice, or his military skill, if much <lb/>
            of the splendour of his renown is shed upon his father also, <lb/>
            and by its clear light dispels the obscurity of his birth, <lb/>
            does not such a man confer an inestimable benefit upon <lb/>
            his parents? Would anyone have heard of Aristo and <lb/>
            Gryllus except through Xenophon and Plato, their sons ? <lb/>
            Socrates keeps alive the memory of Sophroniscus. It <lb/>
            would take long to recount the other men whose names <lb/>
            survive for no other reason than that the admirable quali­ <lb/>
            ties of their sons have handed them down to posterity. <lb/>
            Did the father of Marcus Agrippa, of whom nothing was <lb/>
            known, even after Agrippa became famous, confer the <lb/>
            greater benefit upon his son, or was that greater which <lb/>
            Agrippa conferred upon his father when he gained the <lb/>
            glory, unique in the annals of war, of a naval crown, and <lb/>
            when he raised so many vast buildings in Rome, which <pb n="80"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. III.</note><lb/>
            not only surpassed all former grandeur, but have been <lb/>
            surpassed by none since P Did Octavius confer a greater <lb/>
            benefit upon his son, or the Emperor Augustus upon his <lb/>
            father, obscured as he was by the intervention of an adop­ <lb/>
            tive father? What joy would he have experienced, if, <lb/>
            after the putting down of the civil war, he had seen his <lb/>
            son ruling the state in peace and security ? He would not <lb/>
            have recognized the good which he had himself bestowed, <lb/>
            and would hardly have believed, when he looked back upon <lb/>
            himself, that so great a man could have been born in his <lb/>
            house. Why should I go on to speak of others who would <lb/>
            now be forgotten, if the glory of their sons had not raised <lb/>
            them from obscurity, and kept them in the light until this <lb/>
            day ? In the next place, as we are not considering what <lb/>
            son may have given back to his father greater benefits than <lb/>
            he received from him, but whether a son can give back <lb/>
            greater benefits, even if the examples which I have quoted <lb/>
            are not sufficient, and such benefits do not outweigh the <lb/>
            benefits bestowed by the parents, if no age has produced <lb/>
            an actual example, still it is not in the nature of things <lb/>
            impossible. Though no solitary act can outweigh the <lb/>
            deserts of a parent, yet many such acts combined by one <lb/>
            son may do so. 0</p>
          <p>XXXIII. Scipio, while under seventeen years of age, <lb/>
            rode among the enemy in battle, and saved his father's <lb/>
            life. Was it not enough, that in order to reach his father <lb/>
            he despised so many dangers when they were pressing <lb/>
            hardest upon the greatest generals, that he, a novice in <lb/>
            his first battle, made his way through so many obstacles, <lb/>
            over the bodies of so many veteran soldiers, and showed <lb/>
            strength and courage beyond his years? Add to this, <lb/>
            that he also defended his father in court, and saved him <lb/>
            from a plot of his powerful enemies, that he heaped upon <lb/>
            him a second and a third consulship and other posts <lb/>
            which were coveted even by consulars, that when his father <pb n="81"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XXXIV.] </note><lb/>
            was poor he bestowed upon him the plunder which he took <lb/>
            by military licence, and that he made him rich with the <lb/>
            spoils of the enemy, which is the greatest honour of a <lb/>
            soldier. If even this did not repay his debt, add to it <lb/>
            that he caused him to be constantly employed in the <lb/>
            government of provinces and in special commands, add, <lb/>
            that after he had destroyed the greatest cities, and became <lb/>
            without a rival either in the east or in the west, the <lb/>
            acknowledged protector and second founder of the Roman <lb/>
            Empire, he bestowed upon one who was already of noble <lb/>
            birth the higher title of " the father of Scipio; " can we <lb/>
            doubt that the commonplace benefit of his birth was out­ <lb/>
            done by his exemplary conduct, and by the valour which <lb/>
            was at once the glory and the protection of his country ? <lb/>
            Next, if this be not enough, suppose that a son were to <lb/>
            rescue his father from the torture, or to undergo it in his <lb/>
            stead. You can suppose the benefits returned by the son <lb/>
            as great as you please, whereas the gift he received from <lb/>
            his father was of one sort only, was easily performed, and <lb/>
            was a pleasure to the giver ; that he must necessarily have <lb/>
            given the same thing to many others, even to some to <lb/>
            whom he knows not that he has given it, that he had a <lb/>
            partner in doing so, and that he had in view the law, <lb/>
            patriotism, the rewards bestowed upon fathers of families <lb/>
            by the state, the maintenance of his house and family: every­ <lb/>
            thing rather than him to whom he was giving life. What? <lb/>
            supposing that any one were to learn philosophy and teach <lb/>
            it to his father, could it be any longer disputed that the <lb/>
            son had given him something greater than he had received <lb/>
            from him, having returned to his father a happy life, <lb/>
            whereas he had received from him merely life ?</p>
          <p>XXXIV. “But,” says our opponent, " whatever you do, <lb/>
            whatever you are able to give to your father, is part of his <lb/>
            benefit bestowed upon you." So it is the benefit of my <lb/>
            teacher that I have become proficient in liberal studies; <note type="footnote"> G </note> <pb n="82"/>
            <note type="margin">[BK. III.</note><lb/>
            yet we pass on from those who taught them to us, at any <lb/>
            rate from those who taught us the alphabet; and although <lb/>
            no one can learn anything without them, yet it does not <lb/>
            follow that whatsoever success one subsequently obtains, <lb/>
            one is still inferior to those teachers. There is a great <lb/>
            difference between the beginning of a thing and its final <lb/>
            development; the beginning is not equal to the thing at <lb/>
            its greatest, merely upon the ground that, without the <lb/>
            beginning, it could never have become so great.</p>
          <p>XXXV. It is now time for me to bring forth something, <lb/>
            so to speak, from my own mint. So long as there is some­ <lb/>
            thing better than the benefit which a man bestows, he may <lb/>
            be outdone. A father gives life to his son; there is some­ <lb/>
            thing better than life; therefore a father may be outdone, <lb/>
            because there is. something better than the benefit which <lb/>
            he has bestowed. Still further, he who has given any one <lb/>
            his life, if he be more than once saved from peril of death <lb/>
            by him, has received a greater benefit than he bestowed. <lb/>
            Now, a father has given life to his son : if, therefore, he be <lb/>
            more than once saved from peril by his son, he can receive a <lb/>
            greater benefit than he gave. A benefit becomes greater <lb/>
            to the receiver in proportion to his need of it. Now he <lb/>
            who is alive needs life more than he who has not been born, <lb/>
            seeing that such a one can have no need at all; consequently <lb/>
            a father, if his life is saved by his son, receives a greater <lb/>
            benefit than his son received from him by being born. It <lb/>
            is said, " The benefits conferred by fathers cannot be out­ <lb/>
            done by those returned by their sons." Why? " Because <lb/>
            the son received life from his father, and had he not re­ <lb/>
            ceived it, he could not have returned any benefits at all." <lb/>
            A father has this in common with all those who have given <lb/>
            any men their lives ; it is impossible that these men could <lb/>
            repay the debt if they had not received their life. Then I <lb/>
            suppose one cannot overpay one's debt to a physician, for <lb/>
            a physician gives life as well as a father; or to a sailor <pb n="83"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XXXVI.]</note><lb/>
            who has saved us when shipwrecked? Yet the benefits <lb/>
            bestowed by these and by all the others who give us life <lb/>
            in whatever fashion, can be outdone: consequently those <lb/>
            of our fathers can be outdone. If any one bestows upon <lb/>
            me a benefit which requires the help of benefits from many <lb/>
            other persons, whereas I give him what requires no one to <lb/>
            help it out, I have given more than I have received; now a <lb/>
            father gave to his son a life which, without many accesso­ <lb/>
            ries to preserve it, would perish; whereas a son, if he gives <lb/>
            life to his father, gives him a life which requires no assis­ <lb/>
            tance to make it lasting; therefore the father who receives <lb/>
            life from his son, receives a greater benefit than he himself <lb/>
            bestowed upon his son.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. These considerations do not destroy the respect <lb/>
            clue to parents, or make their children behave worse to <lb/>
            them, nay, better; for virtue is naturally ambitious, and <lb/>
            wishes to outstrip those who are before it. Filial piety <lb/>
            will be all the more eager, if, in returning a father's bene­ <lb/>
            fits, it can hope to outdo them ; nor will this be against <lb/>
            the will or the pleasure of the father, since in many con­ <lb/>
            tests it is to our advantage to be outdone. How does this <lb/>
            contest become so desirable ? How comes it to be such <lb/>
            happiness to parents that they should confess themselves <lb/>
            outdone by the benefits bestowed by their children ? Unless <lb/>
            we decide the matter thus, we give children an excuse, and <lb/>
            make them less eager to repay their debt, whereas we ought <lb/>
            to spur them on, saying, 11 Noble youths, give your attention <lb/>
            to this! You are invited to contend in an honourable- <lb/>
            strife between parents and children, as to which party has <lb/>
            received more than it has given. Your fathers have not <lb/>
            necessarily won the day because they are first in the field: <lb/>
            only take courage, as befits you, and do not give up <lb/>
            the contest; you will conquer if you wish to do so. In <lb/>
            this honourable warfare you will have no lack of leaders <lb/>
            who will encourage you to perform deeds like their <lb/>
             <pb n="84"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. III.</note><lb/>
            own, and bid you follow in their footsteps upon a path <lb/>
            by which victory has often before now been won over <lb/>
            parents.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. Æneas conquered his father in well doing, for <lb/>
            he himself had been but a light and a safe burden for him <lb/>
            when he was a child, yet he bore his father, when heavy <lb/>
            with age, through the midst of the enemy's lines and the <lb/>
            crash of the city which was falling around him, albeit the <lb/>
            devout old man, who bore the sacred images and the house­ <lb/>
            hold gods in his hands, pressed him with more than his own <lb/>
            weight; nevertheless (what cannot filial piety accomplish!) <lb/>
            Æneas bore him safe through the blazing city, and placed <lb/>
            him in safety, to be worshipped as one of the founders of <lb/>
            the Roman Empire. Those Sicilian youths outdid their <lb/>
            parents whom they bore away safe, when Ætna, roused <lb/>
            to unusual fury, poured fire over cities and fields through­ <lb/>
            out a great part of the island. It is believed that the fires <lb/>
            parted, and that the flames retired on either side, so as to <lb/>
            leave a passage for these youths to pass through, who <lb/>
            certainly deserved. to perform their daring task in safety. <lb/>
            Antigonus outdid his father when, after having conquered <lb/>
            the enemy n a great battle, he transferred the fruits of it to <lb/>
            him, and handed over to him the empire of Cyprus. This is <lb/>
            true kingship, to choose not to be a king when you might. <lb/>
            Manlius conquered his father, imperious1 though he was, <lb/>
            when, in spite of his having previously been banished for a <lb/>
            time by his father on account of his dulness and stupidity <lb/>
            as a boy, he came to an interview which he had demanded <lb/>
            with the tribune of the people, who had filed an action <lb/>
            against his father. The tribune had granted him the inter­ <lb/>
            view, hoping that he would betray his hated father, and <lb/>
            believed that he had earned the gratitude of the youth, <lb/>
            having, amongst other matters, reproached old Manlius <note type="footnote"> 1 There is an allusion to the surname of both the father and the son, <lb/>
            f Imperiosus," given them on account of their severity. </note> <pb n="85"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXXVIII.] </note><lb/>
            with sending him into exile, treating it as a very serious <lb/>
            accusation; but the youth, having caught him alone, drew <lb/>
            a sword which he had hidden in his robe, and said, <lb/>
            “Unless you swear to give up your suit against my father, <lb/>
            I will run you through with this sword. It is in your <lb/>
            power to decide how my father shall be freed from his <lb/>
            prosecutor." The tribune swore, and kept his oath; he <lb/>
            related the reason of his abandonment of his action to an <lb/>
            assembly at the Rostra. No other man was ever permitted <lb/>
            to put down a tribune with impunity.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. There are instances without number of men <lb/>
            who have saved their parents from danger, have raised <lb/>
            them from the lowest to the highest station, and, taking <lb/>
            them from the nameless mass of the lower classes, have <lb/>
            given them a name glorious throughout all ages. By no <lb/>
            force of words, by no power of genius, can one rightly ex­ <lb/>
            press how desirable, how admirable, how never to be erased <lb/>
            from human memory it is to be able to say, " I obeyed my <lb/>
            parents, I gave way to them, I was submissive to their autho­ <lb/>
            rity whether it was just, or unjust and harsh; the only point <lb/>
            in which I resisted them was, not to be conquered by them <lb/>
            in benefits." Continue this struggle, I beg of you, and even <lb/>
            though weary, yet re-form your ranks. Happy are they who <lb/>
            conquer, happy they who are conquered. What can be more <lb/>
            glorious than the youth who can say to himself-it would <lb/>
            not be right to say it to another—“ I have conquered my <lb/>
            father with benefits " ? What is more fortunate than that <lb/>
            old man who declares everywhere to everyone that he has <lb/>
            been conquered in benefits by his son ? What, again, is <lb/>
            more blissful than to be overcome in such a contest ? "</p><pb n="86"/>

          <p>O <lb/>
            IF all the matters which we have discussed, Æbutius <lb/>
            Liberalis, there is none more essential, or which, as <lb/>
            Sallust says, ought to be stated with more care than that <lb/>
            which is now before us: whether the bestowal of benefits <lb/>
            and the return of gratitude for them are desirable objects <lb/>
            in themselves. Some men are found who act honourably <lb/>
            from commercial motives, and who do not care for unre­ <lb/>
            warded virtue, though it can confer no glory if it brings <lb/>
            any profit. What can be more base than for a man to <lb/>
            consider what it costs him to be a good man, when virtue <lb/>
            neither allures by gain nor deters by loss, and is so far from <lb/>
            bribing any one with hopes and promises, that on the other <lb/>
            hand she bids them spend money upon herself, and often <lb/>
            consists in voluntary gifts ? We must go to her, trampling <lb/>
            what is merely useful under our feet: whithersoever she <lb/>
            may call us or send us we must go, without any regard for <lb/>
            our private fortunes, sometimes without sparing even our <lb/>
            own blood, nor must we ever refuse to obey any of her com­ <lb/>
            mands. " What shall I gain," says my opponent, " if I do <lb/>
            this bravely and gratefully ? " You will gain the doing <lb/>
            of it-the deed itself is your gain. Nothing beyond this is <lb/>
            promised. If any advantage chances to accrue to you, count <lb/>
            it as something extra. The reward of honourable dealings <lb/>
            lies in themselves. If honour is to be sought after for itself, <lb/>
            since a benefit is honourable, it follows that because both of <pb n="87"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. II.] </note><lb/>
            these are of the same nature, their conditions must also be <lb/>
            the same. Now it has frequently and satisfactorily been <lb/>
            proved, that honour ought to be sought after for itself alone.</p>
          <p>H. In this part of the subject we oppose the Epicureans, <lb/>
            an effeminate and dreamy sect who philosophize in their <lb/>
            own paradise, amongst whom virtue is the handmaid of <lb/>
            pleasures, obeys them, is subject to them, and regards them <lb/>
            as superior to itself. You say, " there is no pleasure with­ <lb/>
            out virtue." But wherefore is it superior to virtue ? Do <lb/>
            you imagine that the matter in dispute between them is <lb/>
            merely one of precedence ? Nay, it is virtue itself and its <lb/>
            powers which are in question. It cannot be virtue if it can <lb/>
            follow; the place of virtue is first, she ought to lead, to <lb/>
            command, to stand in the highest rank; you bid her look <lb/>
            for a cue to follow. " What," asks our opponent, " does <lb/>
            that matter to you ? I also declare that happiness is im­ <lb/>
            possible without virtue. Without virtue I disapprove of <lb/>
            and condemn the very pleasures which I pursue, and to <lb/>
            which I have surrendered myself. The only matter in dis­ <lb/>
            pute is this, whether virtue be the cause of the highest good, <lb/>
            or whether it be itself the highest good." Do you suppose, <lb/>
            though this be the only point in question, that it is a mere <lb/>
            matter of precedence? It is a confusion and obvious <lb/>
            blindness to prefer the last to the first. I am not angry <lb/>
            at virtue being placed below pleasure, but at her being <lb/>
            mixed up at all with pleasure, which she despises, whose <lb/>
            enemy she is, and from which she separates herself as far <lb/>
            as possible, being more at home with labour and sorrow, <lb/>
            which are manly troubles, than with your womanish good <lb/>
            things.</p>
          <p>III. It was necessary to in serf this argument, my Liberalis, <lb/>
            because it is the part of virtue to bestow those benefits <lb/>
            which we are now discussing, and it is most disgraceful to <lb/>
            bestow benefits for any other purpose than that they should <lb/>
            be free gifts. If we give with the hope of receiving a return, <pb n="88"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. IV.</note><lb/>
            we should give to the richest men, not to the most de­ <lb/>
            serving: whereas we prefer a virtuous poor man to an <lb/>
            unmannerly rich one. That is not a benefit, which takes <lb/>
            into consideration the fortune of the receiver. Moreover, <lb/>
            if our only motive for benefiting others was our own <lb/>
            advantage, those who could most easily distribute benefits, <lb/>
            such as rich and powerful men, or kings, and persons who <lb/>
            do not stand in need of the help of others, ought never to <lb/>
            do so at all; the gods would not bestow upon us the <lb/>
            countless blessings which they pour upon us unceasingly by <lb/>
            night and by day, for their own nature suffices them in <lb/>
            all respects, and renders them complete, safe, and beyond <lb/>
            the reach of harm; they will, therefore, never bestow a <lb/>
            benefit upon any one, if self and self interest be the only <lb/>
            cause for the bestowal of benefits. To take thought, not <lb/>
            where your benefit will be best bestowed, but where it <lb/>
            may be most profitably placed at interest, from whence <lb/>
            you will most easily get it back, is not bestowal of benefits, <lb/>
            but usury. Now the gods have nothing to do with usury; <lb/>
            it follows, therefore, that they cannot be liberal; for if the <lb/>
            only reason for giving is the advantage of the giver, since <lb/>
            God cannot hope to receive any advantages from us, there <lb/>
            is no cause why God should give anything.</p>
          <p>IV. I know what answer may be made to this. “True; <lb/>
            therefore God does not bestow benefits, but, free from care <lb/>
            and unmindful of us, He turns away from our world and <lb/>
            either does something else, or else does nothing, which <lb/>
            Epicurus thought the greatest possible happiness, and He <lb/>
            is not affected either by benefits or by injuries." The <lb/>
            man who says this cannot surely hear the voices of wor­ <lb/>
            shippers, and of those who all around hhn are raising their <lb/>
            hands to heaven and praying for the success both of their <lb/>
            private affairs and those of the state; which certainly <lb/>
            would not be the case, all men would not agree in this <lb/>
            madness of appealing to deaf and helpless gods, unless we <pb n="89"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. V.]</note><lb/>
            knew that their benefits are sometimes bestowed upon us <lb/>
            unasked, sometimes in answer to our prayers, and that they <lb/>
            give us both great and seasonable gifts, which shield us <lb/>
            from the most terrible dangers. Who is there so poor, so <lb/>
            uncared for, born to sorrow by so unkind a fate, as never <lb/>
            to have felt the vast generosity of the Gods ? Look even <lb/>
            at those who complain and are discontented with their lot; <lb/>
            you will find that they are not altogether without a share <lb/>
            in the bounty of heaven, that there is no one upon whom <lb/>
            something has not been shed from that most gracious <lb/>
            fount. Is the gift which is bestowed upon all alike, at <lb/>
            their birth, not enough ? However unequally the blessings <lb/>
            of after life may be dealt out to us, did nature give us too <lb/>
            little when she gave us herself ?</p>
          <p>V. It is said, " God does not bestow benefits." Whence, <lb/>
            then, conies all that you possess, that you give or refuse to <lb/>
            give, that you hoard or steal? whence come these innu­ <lb/>
            merable delights of our eyes, our ears, and our minds? <lb/>
            whence the plenty which provides us even with luxury-for it <lb/>
            is not our bare necessities alone against which provision is <lb/>
            made; we are loved so much as actually to be pampered­ <lb/>
            whence so many trees bearing various fruits, so many whole­ <lb/>
            some herbs, so many different sorts of food distributed <lb/>
            throughout the year, so that even the slothful may find sus­ <lb/>
            tenance in the chance produce of the earth? Then, too, <lb/>
            whence come the living creatures of all kinds, some inhabit­ <lb/>
            ing the dry land, others the waters, others alighting from <lb/>
            the sky, that every part of nature may pay us some tribute; <lb/>
            the rivers which encircle our meadows with most beauteous <lb/>
            bends, the others which afford a passage to merchant fleets <lb/>
            as they flow on, wide and navigable, some of which in <lb/>
            summer time are subject to extraordinary overflowings in <lb/>
            order that lands lying parched under a glowing sun may <lb/>
            suddenly be watered by the rush of a midsummer torrent ?</p>
          <p>What of the fountains of medicinal waters ? What of <pb n="90"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. IV.</note><lb/>
            the bursting forth of warm waters upon the seashore itself ? <lb/>
            Shall I <lb/>
            " Tell of the seas round Italy that flow, <lb/>
            Which laves her shore above, and which below; <lb/>
            Or of her lakes, unrivalled Larius, thee, <lb/>
            Or thee, Benacus, roaring like a sea ? "</p>
          <p>VI. If any one gave you a few acres, you would say that <lb/>
            you had received a benefit; can you deny that the boundless <lb/>
            extent of the earth is a benefit? If any one gave you <lb/>
            money, and filled your chest, since you think that so im­ <lb/>
            portant, you would call that a benefit. God has buried <lb/>
            countless mines in the earth, has poured out from the earth <lb/>
            countless rivers, rolling sands of gold; He has concealed <lb/>
            in every place huge masses of silver, copper and iron, and <lb/>
            has bestowed upon you the means of discovering them, plac­ <lb/>
            ing upon the surface of the earth signs of the treasures <lb/>
            hidden below; and yet do you say that you have received no <lb/>
            benefit ? If a house were given you, bright with marble, <lb/>
            its roof beautifully painted with colours and gilding, you <lb/>
            would call it no small benefit. God has built for you a <lb/>
            huge mansion that fears no fire or ruin, in which you see <lb/>
            no flimsy veneers, thinner than the very saw with which <lb/>
            they are cut, but vast blocks of most precious stone, all <lb/>
            composed of those various and different substances whose <lb/>
            paltriest fragments you admire so much; he has built a <lb/>
            roof which glitters in one fashion by day, and in ano­ <lb/>
            ther by night; and yet do you say that you have received <lb/>
            no benefit ? When you so greatly prize what you possess, <lb/>
            do you act the part of an ungrateful man, and think that <lb/>
            there is no one to whom you are indebted for them? <lb/>
            Whence comes the breath which you draw ? the light by <lb/>
            which you arrange and perform all the actions of your <lb/>
            life ? the blood by whose circulation your vital warmth is <lb/>
            maintained ? those meats which excite your palate by their <lb/>
            delicate flavour after your hunger is appeased ? those pro­ <pb n="91"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. VII.] </note><lb/>
            vocatives which rouse you when wearied with pleasure? <lb/>
            that repose in which you are rotting and mouldering? Will <lb/>
            you not, if you are grateful, say­ <lb/>
            “’Tis to a god that this repose I owe, <lb/>
            For him I worship, as a god below. <lb/>
            Oft on his altar shall my firstlings bleed, <lb/>
            See, by his bounty here with rustic reed <lb/>
            I play the airs I love the livelong day, <lb/>
            The while my oxen round about me stray." <lb/>
            The true God is he who has placed, not a few oxen, but all <lb/>
            the herds on their pastures throughout the world ; who <lb/>
            furnishes food to the flocks wherever they wander; who <lb/>
            has ordained the alternation of summer and winter pas­ <lb/>
            turage, and has taught us not merely to play upon a reed, <lb/>
            and to reduce to some order a rustic and artless song, but <lb/>
            who has invented so many arts and varieties of voice, so <lb/>
            many notes to make music, some with our own breath, <lb/>
            some with instruments. You cannot call our inventions <lb/>
            our own any more than you call our growth our own, or <lb/>
            the various bodily functions which correspond to each <lb/>
            stage of our lives; at one time comes the loss of child­ <lb/>
            hood's teeth, at another, when our age is advancing and <lb/>
            growing into robuster manhood, puberty and the last <lb/>
            wisdom-tooth marks the end of our youth. We have im­ <lb/>
            planted in us the seeds of all ages, of all arts, and God our <lb/>
            master brings forth our intellects from obscurity.</p>
          <p>VIT. " Nature," says my opponent, " gives me all this." <lb/>
            Do you not perceive when you say this that you merely <lb/>
            speak of God under another name ? for what is nature <lb/>
            but God and divine reason, which pervades the universe <lb/>
            and all its parts? You may address the author of our <lb/>
            world by as many different titles as you please; you may <lb/>
            rightly call him Jupiter, Best and Greatest, and the Thun­ <lb/>
            derer, or the Stayer, so called, not because, as the histo­ <lb/>
            rians tell us, he stayed the flight of the Roman army in <pb n="92"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. IV.</note><lb/>
            answer to the prayer of Romulus, but because all things <lb/>
            continue in their stay through his goodness. If you were to <lb/>
            call this same personage Fate, you would not lie; for since <lb/>
            fate is nothing more than a connected chain of causes, he <lb/>
            is the first cause of all, upon which all the rest depend. <lb/>
            You will also be right in applying to him any names that <lb/>
            you please which express supernatural strength and power: <lb/>
            he may have as many titles as he has attributes.</p>
          <p>VIII. Our school regards him as Father Liber, and Her­ <lb/>
            cules. and Mercurius : he is Father Liber because he is the <lb/>
            parent of all, who first discovered the power of seed, and <lb/>
            our being led by pleasure to plant it; he is Hercules, <lb/>
            because his might is unconquered, and when it is wearied <lb/>
            after completing its labours, will retire into fire ; he is Mer­ <lb/>
            curius, because in him is reasoning, and numbers, and <lb/>
            system, and knowledge. Whither-soever you turn yourself <lb/>
            you will see him meeting you: nothing is void of him, he <lb/>
            himself fills his own work. Therefore, most ungrateful of <lb/>
            mortals, it is in vain that you declare yourself indebted, <lb/>
            not to God, but to nature, because there can be no God <lb/>
            without nature, nor any nature without God; they are <lb/>
            both the same thing, differing only in their functions. If <lb/>
            you were to say that you owe to Annaeus or to Lucius what <lb/>
            you received from Seneca, you would not change your creditor, <lb/>
            but only his name, because he remains the same man whe­ <lb/>
            ther you use his first, second, or third name. So whether <lb/>
            you speak of nature, fate, or fortune, these are all names of <lb/>
            the same God, using his power in different ways. So likewise <lb/>
            justice, honesty, discretion, courage, frugality, are all the <lb/>
            good qualities of one and the same mind; if you are pleased <lb/>
            with any one of these, you are pleased with that mind.</p>
          <p>IX. However, not to drift aside into a distinct con­ <lb/>
            troversy, God bestows upon us very many and very great <lb/>
            benefits without hope of receiving any return, since he <lb/>
            does not require any offering from us, and we are not <pb n="93"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. X.]</note><lb/>
            capable of bestowing anything upon him: wherefore, a <lb/>
            benefit is desirable in itself. In it the advantage of the <lb/>
            receiver is all that is taken into consideration: we study <lb/>
            this without regarding our own interests. " Yet," argues <lb/>
            our opponent, " you say that we ought to choose with care <lb/>
            the persons upon whom we bestow benefits, because neither <lb/>
            do husbandmen sow seed in the sand : now if this be true, <lb/>
            we follow our own interest in bestowing benefits, just as <lb/>
            much as in ploughing and sowing: for sowing is not <lb/>
            desirable in itself. Besides this you inquire where and <lb/>
            how you ought to bestow a benefit, which would not need <lb/>
            to be done if the bestowal of a benefit was desirable in <lb/>
            itself: because in whatever place and whatever manner it <lb/>
            might be bestowed, it still would be a benefit." We seek <lb/>
            to do honourable acts, solely because they are honourable; <lb/>
            yet even though we need think of nothing else, we consider <lb/>
            to whom we shall do them, and when, and how; for in these <lb/>
            points the act has its being. In like manner, when I <lb/>
            choose upon whom I shall bestow a benefit, and when, I <lb/>
            aim at making it a benefit; because if it were bestowed <lb/>
            upon a base person, it could neither be a benefit nor an <lb/>
            honourable action.</p>
          <p>X. To restore what has been entrusted to one is de­ <lb/>
            sirable in itself; yet I shall not always restore it, nor <lb/>
            shall I do so in any place or at any time you please. <lb/>
            Sometimes it makes no difference whether I deny that I <lb/>
            have received it, or return it openly. I shall consider the <lb/>
            interests of the person to whom I am to return it, and shall <lb/>
            deny that I have received a deposit which would injure him <lb/>
            if returned. I shall act in the same manner in bestowing a <lb/>
            benefit: I shall consider when to give it, to whom, in what <lb/>
            manner, and on what grounds. Nothing ought to be done <lb/>
            without a reason: a benefit is not truly so, if it be bestowed <lb/>
            without a reason, since reason accompanies all honourable <lb/>
            action. How often do we heal men reproaching themselves <pb n="94"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. IV.</note><lb/>
            for some thoughtless gift, and saying, " I had rather have <lb/>
            thrown it away than have given it to him!" What is <lb/>
            thoughtlessly given away is lost in the most discreditable <lb/>
            manner, and it is much worse to have bestowed a benefit <lb/>
            badly than to have received no return for it; that we <lb/>
            receive no return is the fault of another; that we did not <lb/>
            choose upon whom we should bestow it, is our own. In <lb/>
            choosing a fit person, I shall not, as you expect, pay the <lb/>
            least attention to whether I am likely to get any return <lb/>
            from him, for I choose one who will be grateful, not one <lb/>
            who will return my goodness, and it often happens that <lb/>
            the man who makes no return is grateful, while he who <lb/>
            returns a benefit is ungrateful for it. I value men by <lb/>
            . their hearts alone, and, therefore, I shall pass over a rich <lb/>
            man if he be unworthy, and give to a good man though he <lb/>
            be poor; for he will be grateful however destitute he may <lb/>
            be, since whatever he may lose, his heart will still be <lb/>
            left him.</p>
          <p>XI. I do not fish for gain, for pleasure, or for credit, by <lb/>
            bestowing benefits : satisfied in doing so with pleasing one <lb/>
            man alone, I shall give in order to do my duty. Duty, <lb/>
            however, leaves one some choice; do you ask me, how I am <lb/>
            to choose? I shall choose an honest, plain, man, with a good <lb/>
            memory, and grateful for kindness; one who keeps his <lb/>
            hands off other men's goods, yet does not greedily hold to <lb/>
            his own, and who is kind to others; when I have chosen <lb/>
            such a man, I shall have acted to my mind, although <lb/>
            fortune may have bestowed upon him no means of return­ <lb/>
            ing my kindness. If my own advantage and mean calcu­ <lb/>
            lation made me liberal, if I did no one any service except <lb/>
            in order that he might in turn do a service to me, I should <lb/>
            never bestow a benefit upon one who was setting out for <lb/>
            distant and foreign countries, never to return; I should not <lb/>
            bestow a benefit upon one who was so ill as to be past hope <lb/>
            of recovery, nor should I do so when I myself was failing, <pb n="95"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XII.] </note><lb/>
            because I should not live long enough to receive any return. <lb/>
            Yet, that you may know that to do good is desirable in <lb/>
            itself, we afford help to strangers who put into our harbour <lb/>
            only to leave it straightway; we give a ship and fit it out <lb/>
            for a shipwrecked stranger to sail back in to his own <lb/>
            country. He leaves us hardly knowing who it was who <lb/>
            saved him, and, as he will never return to our presence, he <lb/>
            hands over his debt of gratitude to the gods, and beseeches <lb/>
            them to fulfil it for him: in the meanwhile we rejoice in <lb/>
            the barren knowledge that we have done a good action. <lb/>
            What ? when we stand upon the extreme verge of life, and <lb/>
            make our wills, do we not assign to others benefits from <lb/>
            which we ourselves shall receive no advantage? How much <lb/>
            time we waste, how long we consider in secret how much <lb/>
            property we are to leave, and to whom! What then ? <lb/>
            does it make any difference to us to whom we leave our <lb/>
            property, seeing that we cannot expect any return from <lb/>
            any one ? Yet we never give anything with more care, we <lb/>
            never take such pains in deciding upon our verdict, as when, <lb/>
            without any views of personal advantage, we think only of <lb/>
            what is honourable, for we are bad judges of our duty as <lb/>
            long as our view of it is distorted by hope and fear, and <lb/>
            that most indolent of vices, pleasure: but when death has <lb/>
            shut off all these, and brought us as incorrupt judges to <lb/>
            pronounce sentence, we seek for the most worthy men to <lb/>
            leave our property to, and we never take more scrupulous <lb/>
            care than in deciding what is to be done with what does <lb/>
            not concern us. Yet, by Hercules, then there steals over <lb/>
            us a great satisfaction as we think, "I shall make this <lb/>
            man richer, and by bestowing wealth upon that man I <lb/>
            shall add lustre to his high position." Indeed, if we never <lb/>
            give without expecting some return, we must all die <lb/>
            without making our wills.</p>
          <p>XII. It may be said, " You define a benefit as a loan <lb/>
            which cannot be repaid: now a loan is not a desirable <pb n="96"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. IV.</note><lb/>
            thing in itself." When we speak of a loan, we make use <lb/>
            of a figure, or comparison, just as we speak of law as <lb/>
            the standard of right and wrong, although a standard <lb/>
            is not a thing to be desired for its own sake. I have <lb/>
            adopted this phrase in order to illustrate my subject: <lb/>
            when I speak of a loan, I must be understood to mean <lb/>
            something resembling a loan. Do you wish to know how <lb/>
            it differs from one ? I add the words " which cannot be <lb/>
            repaid," whereas every loan both can and ought to be <lb/>
            repaid. It is so far from being right to bestow a benefit <lb/>
            for one's own advantage, that often, as I have explained, <lb/>
            it is one's duty to bestow it when it involves one's own loss <lb/>
            and risk: for instance, if I assist a man when beset by <lb/>
            robbers, so that he gets away from them safely, or help <lb/>
            some victim of power, and bring upon myself the party <lb/>
            spite of a body of influential men, very probably incurring <lb/>
            myself the same disgrace from which I saved him, although <lb/>
            I might have taken the other side, and looked on with safety <lb/>
            at struggles with which I have nothing to do: if I were to <lb/>
            give bail for one who has been condemned, and when my <lb/>
            friend's goods were advertised for sale I were to give a bond <lb/>
            to the effect that I would make restitution to the creditors, <lb/>
            if, in order to save a proscribed person I myself run the risk <lb/>
            of being proscribed. No one, when about to buy a villa at <lb/>
            Tusculum or Tibur, for a summer retreat, because of the <lb/>
            health of the locality, considers how many years' purchase <lb/>
            he gives for it; this must be looked to by the man who makes <lb/>
            a profit by it. The same is true with benefits; when you <lb/>
            ask what return I get for them, I answer, the consciousness <lb/>
            of a good action. " What return does one get for benefits ? " <lb/>
            Pray tell me what return one gets for righteousness, in­ <lb/>
            nocence, magnanimity, chastity, temperance ? If you wish <lb/>
            for anything beyond these virtues, you do not wish for the <lb/>
            virtues themselves. For what does the order of the uni­ <lb/>
            verse bring round the seasons ? for what does the sun <pb n="97"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XIII.] </note><lb/>
            make the day now longer and now shorter ? all these things <lb/>
            are benefits, for they take place for our good. As it is <lb/>
            the duty of the universe to maintain the round of the <lb/>
            seasons, as it is the duty of the sun to vary the points of <lb/>
            his rising and setting, and to do all these things by which <lb/>
            we profit, without any reward, so is it the duty of man, <lb/>
            amongst other things, to bestow benefits. Wherefore then <lb/>
            does he give ? He gives for fear that he should not give, <lb/>
            lest he might lose an opportunity of doing a good action.</p>
          <p>XIII. You Epicureans take pleasure in making a study <lb/>
            of dull torpidity, in seeking for a repose which differs little <lb/>
            from sound sleep, in lurking beneath the thickest shade, in <lb/>
            amusing with the feeblest possible trains of thought that <lb/>
            sluggish condition of your languid minds which you term <lb/>
            tranquil contemplation, and in stuffing with food and <lb/>
            drink, in the recesses of your gardens, your bodies which are <lb/>
            pallid with want of exercise; we Stoics, on the other <lb/>
            hand, take pleasure in bestowing benefits, even though <lb/>
            they cost us labour, provided that they lighten the labours <lb/>
            of others; though they lead us into danger, provided that <lb/>
            they save others, though they straiten our means, if they <lb/>
            alleviate the poverty and distresses of others. What diffe­ <lb/>
            rence does it make to me whether I receive benefits or not ? <lb/>
            even if I receive them, it is still my duty to bestow them. A <lb/>
            benefit has in view the advantage of him upon whom we <lb/>
            bestow it, not our own; otherwise we merely bestow it <lb/>
            upon ourselves. Many things, therefore, which are of the <lb/>
            greatest possible use to others lose all claim to gratitude <lb/>
            by being paid for. Merchants are of use to cities, phy­ <lb/>
            sicians to invalids, dealers to slaves; yet all these have <lb/>
            no claim to the gratitude of those whom they benefit, <lb/>
            because they seek their own advantage through that of <lb/>
            others. That which is bestowed with a view to profit is <lb/>
            not a benefit. " I will give this in order that I may get a <lb/>
            return for it" is the language of a broker. <note type="footnote"> H </note> <pb n="98"/>

          <p><note type="margin">[BK. IV.</note>XIV. I should not call a woman modest, if she rebuffed <lb/>
            her lover in order to increase his passion, or because she <lb/>
            feared the law or her husband; as Ovid says: <lb/>
            " She that denies, because she does Dot dare <lb/>
            To yield, in spirit grants her lovers prayer," <lb/>
            Indeed, the woman who owes her chastity, not to her own <lb/>
            virtue, but to fear, may rightly be classed as a sinner. In <lb/>
            the same manner, he who merely gave in order that he <lb/>
            might receive, cannot be said to have given. Pray, do we <lb/>
            oestow benefits upon animals when we feed them for our <lb/>
            use or for our table? do we bestow benefits upon trees <lb/>
            when we tend them that they may not suffer from drought <lb/>
            or from hardness of ground ? No one is moved by righteous­ <lb/>
            ness and goodness of heart to cultivate an estate, or to do <lb/>
            any act in which the reward is something apart from the <lb/>
            act itself ; but he is moved to bestow benefits, not by low <lb/>
            and grasping motives, but by a kind and generous mind, <lb/>
            which even after it has given is willing to give again, to <lb/>
            renew its former bounties by fresh ones, which thinks only <lb/>
            of how much good it can do the man to whom it gives; <lb/>
            whereas to do any one a service because it is our interest <lb/>
            to do so is a mean action, which deserves no praise, no <lb/>
            credit. What grandeur is there in loving oneself, sparing <lb/>
            oneself, gaining profit for oneself? The true love of <lb/>
            giving calls us away from all this, forcibly leads us to <lb/>
            put up with loss, and foregoes its own interest, deriving its <lb/>
            greatest pleasure from the mere act of doing good.</p>
          <p>XV. Can we doubt that the converse of a benefit is an <lb/>
            injury? As the infliction of injuries is a thing to be <lb/>
            avoided, so is the bestowal of benefits to be desired for its <lb/>
            own sake. In the former, the disgrace of crime outweighs <lb/>
            all the advantages which incite us to commit it; while we <lb/>
            are urged to the latter course by the appearance of honour, <lb/>
            in itself a powerful incentive to action, which attends it. <pb n="99"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XVI.] </note><lb/>
            I should not lie if I were to affirm that every one takes <lb/>
            pleasure in the benefits which he has bestowed, that every­ <lb/>
            one loves best to see the man whom he has most largely <lb/>
            benefited. Who does not thinks that to have bestowed one <lb/>
            benefit is a reason for bestowing a second ? and would this <lb/>
            be so, if the act of giving did not itself give us pleasure ? <lb/>
            How often you may hear a man say," I cannot bear to desert <lb/>
            one whose life I have preserved, whom I have saved from <lb/>
            danger. True, he asks me to plead his cause against men <lb/>
            of great influence. I do not wish to do so, yet what am I <lb/>
            to do ? I have already helped him once, nay twice." Do <lb/>
            you not perceive how very powerful this instinct must be, <lb/>
            if it leads us to bestow benefits first because it is right to <lb/>
            do so, and afterwards because we have already bestowed <lb/>
            somewhat ? Though at the outset a man may have had no <lb/>
            claim upon us, we yet continue to give to him because we <lb/>
            have already given to him. So untrue is it that we are <lb/>
            urged to bestow benefits by our own interest, that even <lb/>
            when our benefits prove failures we continue to nurse them <lb/>
            and encourage them out of sheer love of benefiting, which <lb/>
            has a natural weakness even for what has been ill-bestowed, <lb/>
            like that which we feel for our vicious children.</p>
          <p>XVI. These same adversaries of ours admit that they <lb/>
            are grateful, yet not because it is honourable, but because it <lb/>
            is profitable to be so. This can be proved to be untrue all <lb/>
            the more easily, because it can be established by the same <lb/>
            arguments by which we have established that to bestow a <lb/>
            benefit is desirable for its own sake. All our arguments <lb/>
            start from this settled point, that honour is pursued for <lb/>
            no reason except because it is honour. Now, who will <lb/>
            venture to raise the question whether it be honourable to <lb/>
            be grateful? who does not loathe the ungrateful man, useless <lb/>
            as he is even to himself ? How do you feel when any one <lb/>
            is spoken of as being ungrateful for great benefits conferred <lb/>
            upon him by a friend ? Is it as though he had done some­ <pb n="100"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. IV.</note><lb/>
            thing base, or had merely neglected to do something useful <lb/>
            and likely to be profitable to himself ? I imagine that you <lb/>
            think him a bad man, and one who deserves punishment, <lb/>
            not one who needs a guardian; and this would not be the <lb/>
            case, unless gratitude were desirable in itself and honour­ <lb/>
            able. Other qualities, it may be, manifest their importance <lb/>
            less clearly, and require an explanation to prove whether <lb/>
            they be honourable or no ; this is openly proved to be so in <lb/>
            the sight of all, and is too beautiful for anything to obscure <lb/>
            or dim its glory. What is more praiseworthy, upon what <lb/>
            are all men more universally agreed, than to return grati­ <lb/>
            tude for good offices ?</p>
          <p>XVII. Pray tell me, what is it that urges us to do so? Is <lb/>
            it profit? Why, unless a man despises profit, he is not <lb/>
            grateful. Is it ambition ? why, what is there to boast of <lb/>
            in having paid what you owe ? Is it fear ? The ungrateful <lb/>
            man feels none, for against this one crime we have provided <lb/>
            no law, as though nature had taken sufficient precautions <lb/>
            against it. Just as there is no law which bids parents <lb/>
            love and indulge their children, seeing that it is superfluous <lb/>
            to force us into the path which we naturally take, just as <lb/>
            no one needs to be urged to love himself, since self-love <lb/>
            begins to act upon him as soon as he is born, so there is no <lb/>
            law bidding us to seek that which is honourable in itself; for <lb/>
            such things please us by their very nature, and so attractive <lb/>
            is virtue that the disposition even of bad men leads them <lb/>
            to approve of good rather than of evil. Who is there who <lb/>
            does not wish to appear beneficent, who does not even <lb/>
            when steeped in crime and wrong-doing strive after the <lb/>
            appearance of goodness, does not put some show of justice <lb/>
            upon even his most intemperate acts, and endeavour to <lb/>
            seem to have conferred a benefit even upon those whom <lb/>
            he has injured? Consequently, men allow themselves to be <lb/>
            thanked by those whom they have ruined, and pretend <lb/>
            to be good and generous, because they cannot prove them­ <pb n="101"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XVIII.] </note><lb/>
            selves so ; and this they never would do were it not that a <lb/>
            love of honour for its own sake forces them to seek a <lb/>
            reputation quite at variance with their real character, and <lb/>
            to conceal their baseness, a quality whose fruits we covet, <lb/>
            though we regard it itself with dislike and shame. No <lb/>
            one has ever so far rebelled against the laws of nature <lb/>
            and put off human feeling as to act basely for mere <lb/>
            amusement. Ask any of those who live by robbery <lb/>
            whether he would not rather obtain what he steals and <lb/>
            plunders by honest means; the man whose trade is high­ <lb/>
            way robbery and the murder of travellers would rather find <lb/>
            his booty than take it by force; you will find no one who <lb/>
            would not prefer to enjoy the fruits of wickedness without <lb/>
            acting wickedly. Nature bestows upon us all this immense <lb/>
            advantage, that the light of virtue shines into the minds of <lb/>
            all alike; even those who do not follow her, behold her.</p>
          <p>XVIII. A proof that gratitude is desirable for itself lies <lb/>
            in the fact that ingratitude is to be avoided for itself, <lb/>
            because no vice more powerfully rends asunder and de­ <lb/>
            stroys the union of the human race. To what do we <lb/>
            trust for safety, if not in mutual good offices one to <lb/>
            another ? It is by the interchange of benefits alone that <lb/>
            we gain some measure of protection for our lives, and of <lb/>
            safety against sudden disasters. Taken singly, what should <lb/>
            we be ? a prey and quarry for wild beasts,' a luscious and <lb/>
            easy banquet; for while all other animals, have sufficient <lb/>
            strength to protect themselves, and those which are born <lb/>
            to a wandering solitary life are armed, man is covered by a <lb/>
            soft skin, has no powerful teeth or claws with which to ter­ <lb/>
            rify other creatures, but weak and naked by himself is <lb/>
            made strong by union.</p>
          <p>'God has bestowed upon him two gifts, reason and union, <lb/>
            which raise him from weakness to the highest power ; and <lb/>
            so he, who if taken alone would be inferior to every other <lb/>
            creature, possesses supreme dominion. Union has given <pb n="102"/>
            <note type="margin">[BK. IV.</note><lb/>
            him sovereignty over all animals; union has enabled a <lb/>
            being born upon the earth to assume power over a foreign <lb/>
            element, and bids him be lord of the sea also; it is union <lb/>
            which has checked the inroads of disease, provided sup­ <lb/>
            ports for our old age, and given us relief from pain; it is <lb/>
            union which makes us strong, and to which we look for <lb/>
            protection against the caprices of fortune. Take away <lb/>
            union, and you will rend asunder the association by which <lb/>
            the human race preserves its existence ; yet you will take <lb/>
            it away if you succeed in proving that ingratitude is not <lb/>
            to be avoided for itself, but because something is to be <lb/>
            feared for it; for how many are there who can with <lb/>
            safety be ungrateful? In fine, I call every man un­ <lb/>
            grateful who is merely made grateful by fear.</p>
          <p>XIX. No sane man fears the gods; for it is madness to <lb/>
            fear what is beneficial, and no man loves those whom he <lb/>
            fears. You, Epicurus, ended by making God unarmed; <lb/>
            you stripped him of all weapons, of all power, and, lest <lb/>
            anyone should fear him, you banished him out of the <lb/>
            world. There is no reason why you should fear this being, <lb/>
            cut off as he is, and separated from the sight and touch of <lb/>
            mortals by a vast and impassable wall; he has no power <lb/>
            either of rewarding or of injuring us ; he dwells alone half­ <lb/>
            way between our heaven and that of another world, without <lb/>
            the society either of animals, of men, or of matter, avoid­ <lb/>
            ing the crash of worlds as they fall in ruins above and <lb/>
            around him, but neither hearing our prayers nor interested <lb/>
            in us. Yet you wish to seem to worship this being just as <lb/>
            a father, with a mind, I suppose, full of gratitude; or, if <lb/>
            you do not wish to seem grateful, why should you wor­ <lb/>
            ship him, since you have received no benefit from him, but <lb/>
            have been put together entirely at random and by chance <lb/>
            by those atoms and mites of yours? "I worship him," you <lb/>
            answer, " because of his glorious majesty and his unique <lb/>
            nature." Granting that you do this, you clearly do it with­ <pb n="103"/>
             
            <milestone unit="PLSection" n="CH. XX.]"/><lb/>
            out the attraction of any reward, or any hope; there is <lb/>
            therefore something which is desirable for itself, whose <lb/>
            own worth attracts you, that is, honour. Now what is <lb/>
            more honourable than gratitude ? the means of practising <lb/>
            this virtue are as extensive as life itself.</p>
          <p>XX. " Yet," argues he, " there is also a certain amount <lb/>
            of profit inherent in this virtue.,, In what virtue is there <lb/>
            not ? But that which we speak of as desirable for itself is <lb/>
            such, that although it may possess some attendant advan­ <lb/>
            tages, yet it would be desirable even if stripped of all these. <lb/>
            It is profitable to be grateful; yet I will be grateful even <lb/>
            though it harm me. What is the aim of the grateful <lb/>
            man? is it that his gratitude may win for him more <lb/>
            friends and more benefits? What then? If a man is <lb/>
            likely to meet with affronts by showing his gratitude, if <lb/>
            he knows that far from gaining anything by it, he must lose <lb/>
            much even of what he has already acquired, will he not <lb/>
            cheerfully act to his own disadvantage ? That man is un­ <lb/>
            grateful who, in returning a kindness, looks forward to. a <lb/>
            second gift-who hopes while he repays. I call him un­ <lb/>
            grateful who sits at the bedside of a sick man because he is <lb/>
            about to make a will, when he is at leisure to think of inheri­ <lb/>
            tances and legacies. Though he may do everything which <lb/>
            a good and dutiful friend ought to do, yet, if any hope of <lb/>
            gain be floating in his mind, he is a mere legacy-hunter, <lb/>
            and is angling for an inheritance. Like the birds which <lb/>
            feed upon careases, which come close to animals weakened <lb/>
            by disease, and watch till they fall, so these men are <lb/>
            attracted by death and hover around a corpse.</p>
          <p>XXL A grateful mind is attracted only by a sense <lb/>
            of the beauty of its purpose. Do you wish to know this <lb/>
            to be so, and that it is not bribed by ideas of profit? <lb/>
            There are two classes of grateful men: a man is called <lb/>
            grateful who has made some return for what he received; <lb/>
            this man may very possibly display himself in this <pb n="104"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. IV.</note><lb/>
            character, he has something to boast of, to refer to. We <lb/>
            also call a man grateful who receives a benefit with good­ <lb/>
            will, and owes it to his benefactor with goodwill; yet this <lb/>
            man's gratitude lies concealed within his own mind. What <lb/>
            profit can accrue to him from this latent feeling ? yet this <lb/>
            man, even though he is not able to do anything more than <lb/>
            this, is grateful; he loves his benefactor, he feels his debt <lb/>
            to him, he longs to repay his kindness; whatever else you <lb/>
            may find wanting, there is nothing wanting in the man. <lb/>
            He is like a workman who has not the tools necessary for <lb/>
            the practice of his craft, or like a trained singer whose <lb/>
            voice cannot be heard through the noise of those who in­ <lb/>
            terrupt him. I wish to repay a kindness : after this there <lb/>
            still remains something for me to do, not in order that I <lb/>
            may become grateful, but that I may discharge my debt; <lb/>
            for, in many cases, he who returns a kindness is ungrate­ <lb/>
            ful for it, and he who does not return it is grateful. Like <lb/>
            all other virtues, the whole value of gratitude lies in the <lb/>
            spirit in which it is done ; so, if this man's purpose be loyal, <lb/>
            any shortcomings on his part are clue not to himself, but to <lb/>
            fortune. A man who is silent may, nevertheless, be eloquent; <lb/>
            his hands may be folded or even bound, and he may yet be <lb/>
            strong; just as a, pilot is a pilot even when upon dry land, <lb/>
            because his knowledge is complete, and there is nothing <lb/>
            wanting to it, though there may be obstacles which prevent <lb/>
            his making use of it. In the same way, a man is grateful <lb/>
            who only wishes to be so, and who has no one but himself <lb/>
            who can bear witness to his frame of mind. I will go even <lb/>
            further than this: a man sometimes is grateful when he <lb/>
            appears to be ungrateful, when ill-judging report has de­ <lb/>
            clared him to be so. Such a man can look to nothing but <lb/>
            his own conscience, which can please him even when over­ <lb/>
            whelmed by calumny, which contradicts the mob and <lb/>
            common rumour, relies only upon itself, and though it <lb/>
            beholds a yast crowd of the other way of thinking opposed <pb n="105"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXII.] </note><lb/>
            to it, does not count heads, but wins by its own vote alone. <lb/>
            Should it see its own good faith meet with the punishment <lb/>
            due to treachery, it will not descend from its pedestal, <lb/>
            and will remain superior to its punishment. " I have," <lb/>
            it says, " what I wished, what I strove for. I do not regret <lb/>
            it, nor shall I do so; nor shall fortune, however unjust she <lb/>
            may be, ever hear me say, ' What did I want ? What now <lb/>
            is the use of having meant well ? ’ ” A good conscience is <lb/>
            of value on the rack, or in the fire ; though fire be applied <lb/>
            to each of our limbs, gradually encircle our living bodies, <lb/>
            and burst our heart, yet if our heart be filled with a good <lb/>
            conscience, it will rejoice in the fire which will make its <lb/>
            good faith shine before the world.</p>
          <p>XXII. Now let that question also which has been already <lb/>
            stated be again brought forward; Why is it that we should <lb/>
            wish to be grateful when we are dying, that we should care­ <lb/>
            fully weigh the various services rendered us by different indi­ <lb/>
            viduals, and carefully review our whole life, that we may <lb/>
            not seem to have forgotten any kindness ? Nothing then <lb/>
            remains for us to hope for; yet when on the very threshold, <lb/>
            we wish to depart from human life as full of gratitude as <lb/>
            possible. There is in truth an immense reward for this thing <lb/>
            merely in doing it, and what is honourable has great power <lb/>
            to attract men's minds, which are overwhelmed by its beauty <lb/>
            and carried off their balance, enchanted by its brilliancy <lb/>
            and splendour. "Yet," argues our adversary, "from it <lb/>
            many advantages take their rise, and good men obtain a <lb/>
            safer life and love, and the good opinion of the better class, <lb/>
            while their days are spent in greater security when accom­ <lb/>
            panied by innocence and gratitude."</p>
          <p>Indeed, nature would have been most unjust had she <lb/>
            rendered this great blessing miserable, uncertain, and fruit­ <lb/>
            less. But consider this point, whether you would make <lb/>
            your way to that virtue, to which it is generally safe <lb/>
            and easy to attain, even though the path lay over rocks <pb n="106"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. IV.</note><lb/>
            and precipices, and were beset with fierce beasts and veno­ <lb/>
            mous serpents. A virtue is none the less to be desired <lb/>
            for its own sake, because it has some adventitious profit <lb/>
            connected with it: indeed, in most cases the no blest virtues <lb/>
            are accompanied by many extraneous advantages, but it <lb/>
            is the virtues that lead the way, and these merely follow <lb/>
            in their train.</p>
          <p>XXIII. Can we doubt that the climate of this abode of <lb/>
            the human race is regulated by the motion of the sun and <lb/>
            moon in their orbits ? that our bodies are sustained, the <lb/>
            hard earth loosened, excessive moisture reduced, and the <lb/>
            surly bonds of winter broken by the heat of the one, and <lb/>
            that crops are brought to ripeness by the effectual all­ <lb/>
            pervading warmth of the other ? that the fertility of the <lb/>
            human race corresponds to the courses of the moon ? that <lb/>
            the sun by its revolution marks out the year, and that the <lb/>
            moon, moving in a smaller orbit, marks out the months ? <lb/>
            Yet, setting aside all this, would not the sun be a sight <lb/>
            worthy to be contemplated and worshipped, if he did no <lb/>
            more than rise and set? would not the moon be worth <lb/>
            looking at, even if it passed uselessly through the heavens ? <lb/>
            Whose attention is not arrested by the universe itself, <lb/>
            when by night it pours forth its fires and glitters with <lb/>
            innumerable stars ? Who, while he admires them, thinks <lb/>
            of their being of use to him ? Look at that great company <lb/>
            gliding over our heads, how they conceal their swift motion <lb/>
            under the semblance of a fixed and immovable work. <lb/>
            How much takes place in that night which you make use <lb/>
            of merely to mark and count your days! What a mass of <lb/>
            events is being prepared in that silence! What a chain of <lb/>
            destiny their unerring path is forming! Those which you <lb/>
            imagine to be merely strewn about for ornament are really <lb/>
            one and all at work. Nor is there any ground for your <lb/>
            belief that only seven stars revolve, and that the rest re­ <lb/>
            main still: we understand the orbits of a few, but count­ <pb n="107"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXIV.] </note><lb/>
            less divinities, further removed from our sight, come and <lb/>
            go; while the greater part of those whom our sight reaches <lb/>
            move in a mysterious manner and by an unknown path.</p>
          <p>XXIV. What then? would you not be captivated by <lb/>
            the sight of such a stupendous work, even though it did <lb/>
            not cover you, protect you, cherish you, bring you into <lb/>
            existence and penetrate you with its spirit ? Though these <lb/>
            heavenly bodies are of the very first importance to us, and <lb/>
            are, indeed, essential to our life, yet we can think of no­ <lb/>
            thing but their glorious majesty, and similarly all virtue, <lb/>
            especially that of gratitude, though it confers great advan­ <lb/>
            tages upon us, does not wish to be loved for that reason; it <lb/>
            has something more in it than this, and he who merely <lb/>
            reckons it among useful things does not perfectly compre­ <lb/>
            hend it. A man, you say, is grateful because it is to his ad­ <lb/>
            vantage to be so. If this be the case, then his advantage will <lb/>
            be the measure of his gratitude. Virtue will not admit a <lb/>
            covetous lover; men must approach her with open purse. <lb/>
            The ungrateful man thinks, 11 I did wish to be grateful, but <lb/>
            I fear the expense and danger and insults to which I should <lb/>
            expose myself: I will rather consult my own interest." <lb/>
            Men cannot be rendered grateful and ungrateful by the <lb/>
            same line of reasoning: their actions are as distinct as <lb/>
            their purposes. The one is ungrateful, although it is wrong, <lb/>
            because it is his interest; the other is grateful, although <lb/>
            it is not his interest, because it is right.</p>
          <p>XXV. It is our aim to live in harmony with the scheme <lb/>
            of the universe, and to follow the example of the gods. <lb/>
            Yet in all their acts the gods have no object in view other <lb/>
            than the act itself, unless you suppose that they obtain a <lb/>
            reward for their work in the smoke of burnt sacrifices and <lb/>
            the scent of incense. See what great things they do every <lb/>
            day, how much they divide amongst us, with how great <lb/>
            crops they fill the earth, how they move the seas with <lb/>
            convenient winds to carry us to all shores, how by the fall <pb n="108"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. IV.</note><lb/>
            of sudden showers they soften the ground, renew the dried­ <lb/>
            up springs of fountains, and call them into new life by <lb/>
            unseen supplies of water. All this they do without reward, <lb/>
            without any advantage accruing to themselves. Let our <lb/>
            line of conduct, if it would not depart from its model, pre­ <lb/>
            serve this direction, and let us not act honourably because <lb/>
            we are hired to do so. We ought to feel ashamed that any <lb/>
            benefit should have a price: we pay nothing for the gods.</p>
          <p>XXVI. "If," our adversary may say, "you wish to <lb/>
            imitate the gods, then bestow benefits upon the ungrateful <lb/>
            as well as the grateful; for the sun rises upon the wicked <lb/>
            as well as the good, the seas are open even to pirates." By <lb/>
            this question he really asks whether a good man would <lb/>
            bestow a benefit upon an ungrateful person, knowing him <lb/>
            to be ungrateful. Allow me here to introduce a short <lb/>
            explanation, that we may not be taken in by a deceitful <lb/>
            question. Understand that according to the system of <lb/>
            the Stoics there are two classes of ungrateful persons. <lb/>
            One man is ungrateful because he is a fool; a fool is a <lb/>
            bad man; a man who is bad possesses every vice: there­ <lb/>
            fore he is ungrateful. In the same way we speak of all <lb/>
            bad men as dissolute, avaricious, luxurious, and spiteful, <lb/>
            not because each man has all these vices in any great or <lb/>
            remarkable degree, but because he might have them; they <lb/>
            are in him, even though they be not seen. The second <lb/>
            form of ungrateful person is he who is commonly meant <lb/>
            by the term, one who is inclined by nature to this vice. <lb/>
            In the case of him who has the vice of ingratitude just as <lb/>
            he has every other, a wise man will bestow a benefit, <lb/>
            because if he sets aside all such men there will be no one <lb/>
            left for him to bestow it on. As for the ungrateful man <lb/>
            who habitually misapplies benefits and acts so by choice, <lb/>
            he will no more bestow a benefit upon him than he would <lb/>
            lend money to a spendthrift, or place a deposit in the <lb/>
            hands of one who had already often refused to many per­ <pb n="109"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXVII.] </note><lb/>
            sons to give up the property with which they had entrusted <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>XXVII. We call some men timid because they are fools: <lb/>
            in this they are like the bad men who are steeped in all <lb/>
            vices without distinction. Strictly speaking, we call those <lb/>
            persons timid who are alarmed even at unmeaning noises. <lb/>
            A fool possesses all vices, but he is not equally inclined by <lb/>
            nature to all; one is prone to avarice, another to luxury, and <lb/>
            another to insolence. Those persons, therefore, are mistaken, <lb/>
            who ask the Stoics, "What do you say, then? is Achilles <lb/>
            timid? Aristides, who received a name for justice, is he <lb/>
            unjust ? Fabius, who I by delays retrieved the day,' is he <lb/>
            rash ? Does Decius fear death ? Is Mucius a traitor ? <lb/>
            Camillus a betrayer? " We do not mean that all vices are <lb/>
            inherent in all men in the same way in which some <lb/>
            especial ones are noticeable in certain men, but we declare <lb/>
            that the bad man and the fool possess all vices ; we do not <lb/>
            even acquit them of fear when they are rash, or of avarice <lb/>
            when they are extravagant. Just as a man has all his <lb/>
            senses, yet all men have not on that account as keen a <lb/>
            sight as Lynceus, so a man that is a fool has not all vices <lb/>
            in so active and vigorous a form as some persons have <lb/>
            some of them, yet he has them all. All vices exist in all of <lb/>
            them, yet all are not prominent in each individual. One <lb/>
            man is naturally prone to avarice, another is the slave of <lb/>
            wine, a third of lust; or, if not yet enslaved by these pas­ <lb/>
            sions, he is so fashioned by nature that this is the direction <lb/>
            in which his character would probably lead him. Therefore, <lb/>
            to return to my original proposition, every bad man is un­ <lb/>
            grateful, because he has the seeds of every villainy in him; <lb/>
            but he alone is rightly so called who is naturally inclined <lb/>
            to this vice. Upon such a person as this, therefore, I shall <lb/>
            not bestow a benefit. One who betrothed his daughter to <lb/>
            an ill-tempered man from whom many women had sought <lb/>
            a divorce, would be held to have neglected her interests; <pb n="110"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. IV.</note><lb/>
            a man would be thought a bad father if he entrusted the <lb/>
            care of his patrimony to one who had lost his own family <lb/>
            estate, and it would be the act of a madman to make a will <lb/>
            naming as the guardian of one's son a man who had already <lb/>
            defrauded other wards. So will that man be said to bestow <lb/>
            benefits as badly as possible, who chooses ungrateful per. <lb/>
            sons, in whose hands they will perish.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. " The gods," it may be said, " bestow much, <lb/>
            even upon the ungrateful." But what they bestow they <lb/>
            had prepared for the good, and the bad have their share <lb/>
            as well, because they cannot be separated. It is better <lb/>
            to benefit the bad as well, for the sake of benefiting the <lb/>
            good, than to stint the good for fear of benefiting the bad. <lb/>
            Therefore the gods have created all that you speak of, the <lb/>
            day, the sun, the alternations of winter and summer, the <lb/>
            transitions through spring and autumn from one extreme <lb/>
            to the other, showers, drinking fountains, and regularly <lb/>
            blowing winds for the use of all alike; they could not <lb/>
            except individuals from the enjoyment of them. A king <lb/>
            bestows honours upon those who deserve them, but he gives <lb/>
            largesse to the undeserving as well. The thief, the bearer <lb/>
            of false witness, and the adulterer, alike receive the public <lb/>
            grant of corn, and all are placed on the register without any <lb/>
            examination as to character; good and bad men share alike <lb/>
            in all the other privileges which a man receives, because he <lb/>
            is a citizen, not because he is a good man. God likewise has <lb/>
            bestowed certain gifts upon the entire human race, from <lb/>
            which no one is shut out. Indeed, it could not be arranged <lb/>
            that the wind which was fair for good men should be foul <lb/>
            for bad ones, while it is for the good of all men that the seas <lb/>
            should be open for traffic and the kingdom of mankind be <lb/>
            enlarged ; nor could any law be appointed for the showers, <lb/>
            so that they should not fall upon the fields of wicked and <lb/>
            evil men. Some things are given to all alike: cities are <lb/>
            founded for good and bad men alike; works of genius <pb n="111"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXIX.] </note><lb/>
            reach, by publication, even unworthy men; medicine points <lb/>
            out the means of health even to the wicked; no one has <lb/>
            checked the making up of wholesome remedies for fear <lb/>
            that the undeserving should be healed. You must seek <lb/>
            for examination and preference of individuals in such <lb/>
            things as are bestowed separately upon those who are <lb/>
            thought to deserve them; not in these, which admit the <lb/>
            mob to share them without distinction. There is a great <lb/>
            difference between not shutting a man out and choosing <lb/>
            him. Even a thief receives justice ; even murderers enjoy <lb/>
            the blessings of peace; even those who have plundered <lb/>
            others can recover their own property; assassins and <lb/>
            private bravoes are defended against the common enemy by <lb/>
            the city wall; the laws protect even those who have sinned <lb/>
            most deeply against them. There are some things which <lb/>
            no man could obtain unless they were given to all; you <lb/>
            need not, therefore, cavil about those matters in which <lb/>
            all mankind is invited to share. As for things which men <lb/>
            receive or not at my discretion, I shall not bestow them <lb/>
            upon one whom I know to be ungrateful.</p>
          <p>XXIX. “ Shall we, then," argues he, “ not give our <lb/>
            advice to an ungrateful man when he is at a loss, or <lb/>
            refuse him a drink of water when he is thirsty, or not show <lb/>
            him the path when he has lost his way ? or would you do <lb/>
            him these services and yet not give him anything ? " Here I <lb/>
            will draw a distinction, or at any rate endeavour to do so. <lb/>
            A benefit is a useful service, yet all useful service is not a <lb/>
            benefit; for some are so trifling as not to claim the title of <lb/>
            benefits. To produce a benefit two conditions must concur. <lb/>
            First, the importance of the thing given; for some things <lb/>
            fall short of the dignity of a benefit. Who ever called a <lb/>
            hunch of bread a benefit, or a farthing dole tossed to <lb/>
            a beggar, or the means of lighting a fire ? yet sometimes <lb/>
            these are of more value than the most costly benefits; still <lb/>
            their cheapness detracts from their value even when, by the <pb n="112"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. IV.</note><lb/>
            exigency of time, they are rendered essential. The next con­ <lb/>
            dition, which is the most important of all, must necessarily <lb/>
            be present, namely, that I should confer the benefit for the <lb/>
            sake of him whom I wish to receive it, that I should judge <lb/>
            him worthy of it, bestow it of my own free will, and receive <lb/>
            pleasure from my own gift, none of which conditions are <lb/>
            present in the cases of which we have just now spoken; <lb/>
            for we do not bestow such things as those upon these who <lb/>
            are worthy of them, but we give them carelessly, as trifles, <lb/>
            and do not give them so much to a man as to humanity.</p>
          <p>XXX. I shall not deny that sometimes I would give <lb/>
            even to the unworthy, out of respect for others; as, for in­ <lb/>
            stance, in competition for public offices, some of the basest <lb/>
            of men are preferred on account of their noble birth, to <lb/>
            industrious men of no family, and that for good reasons; <lb/>
            for the memory of great virtues is sacred, and more men <lb/>
            will take pleasure in being good, if the respect felt for <lb/>
            good men does not cease with their lives. What made <lb/>
            Cicero's son a consul, except his father? What lately <lb/>
            brought Cinna I out of the camp of the enemy and raised <lb/>
            him to the consulate ? What made Sextus Pompeius and <lb/>
            the other Pompeii consuls, unless it was the greatness of <lb/>
            one man, who once was raised so high that, by his very fall, <lb/>
            he sufficiently exalted all his relatives. What lately made <lb/>
            Fabius Persicus a member of more than one college of <lb/>
            priests, though even profligates avoided his kiss ? Was it <lb/>
            not Verrucosus, and Allobrogicus, and the three hundred <lb/>
            who to serve their country blocked the invader's path with <lb/>
            the force of a single family ? It is our duty to respect the <lb/>
            virtuous, not only when present with us, but also when re­ <lb/>
            moved from our sight: as they have made it their study not <lb/>
            to bestow their benefits upon one age alone, but to leave <lb/>
            them existing after they themselves have passed away, so <lb/>
            let us not confine our gratitude to a single age. If a man <note type="footnote"> 1 See Seneca on " Clemency," book i., ch. ix. </note> <pb n="113"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXXI.] </note><lb/>
            has begotten great men, he deserves to receive benefits, <lb/>
            whatever he himself may be: he has given us worthy men. <lb/>
            If a man descends from glorious ancestors, whatever he <lb/>
            himself may be, let him find refuge under the shadow of <lb/>
            his ancestry. As mean places are lighted up by the rays <lb/>
            of the sun, so let the degenerate shine in the light of their <lb/>
            forefathers.</p>
          <p>XXXI. In this place, my Liberalis, I wish to speak in <lb/>
            defence of the gods. We sometimes say, " What could <lb/>
            Providence mean by placing an Arrhidaeus upon the <lb/>
            throne ? " Do you suppose that the crown was given to <lb/>
            Arrhidaeus ? nay, it was given to his father and his brother. <lb/>
            Why did Heaven bestow the empire of the world upon <lb/>
            Caius Caesar, the most bloodthirsty of mankind, who was <lb/>
            wont to order blood to be shed in his presence as freely as <lb/>
            if he wished to drink of it ? Why, do you suppose that it <lb/>
            was given to him ? It was given to his father, Germanicus, <lb/>
            to his grandfather, his great grandfather, and to others <lb/>
            before them, no less illustrious men, though they lived <lb/>
            as private citizens on a footing of equality with others. <lb/>
            Why, when you yourself were making Mamercus Scaurus <lb/>
            consul, were you ignorant of his vices ? did he himself con­ <lb/>
            ceal them ? did he wish to appear decent ? <lb/>
            Did you admit a man who was so openly filthy to the fasces <lb/>
            and the tribunal ? Yes, it was because you were thinking <lb/>
            of the great old Scaurus, the chief of the Senate, and were <lb/>
            unwilling that his descendant should be despised.</p>
          <p>XXXII. It is probable that the gods act in the same <lb/>
            manner, that they show greater indulgence to some for the <lb/>
            sake of their parents and their ancestry, and to others for <lb/>
            the sake of their children and grandchildren, and a long <lb/>
            line of descendants beyond them; for they know the whole <lb/>
            course of their works, and have constant access to the <note type="footnote"> I </note> <pb n="114"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. IV.</note><lb/>
            knowledge of all that shall hereafter pass through their <lb/>
            hands. These things come upon us from the unknown <lb/>
            future, and the gods have foreseen and are familiar with <lb/>
            the events by which we are startled. " Let these men," <lb/>
            says Providence, " be kings, because their ancestors were <lb/>
            good kings, because they regarded righteousness and tem­ <lb/>
            perance as the highest rule of life, because they did not <lb/>
            devote the state to themselves, but devoted themselves to <lb/>
            the state. Let these others reign, because some one of <lb/>
            their ancestors before them was a good man, who bore a <lb/>
            soul superior to fortune, who preferred to be conquered <lb/>
            rather than to conquer in civil strife, because it was more <lb/>
            to the advantage of the stated It was not possible to make <lb/>
            a sufficient return to him for this during so long a time; <lb/>
            let this other, therefore, out of regard for him, be chief of <lb/>
            the people, not because he knows how, or is capable, but <lb/>
            because the other has earned it for him. This man is mis­ <lb/>
            shapen, loathsome to look upon, and will disgrace the <lb/>
            insignia of his office. Men will presently blame me, calling <lb/>
            me blind and reckless, not knowing upon whom I am con­ <lb/>
            ferring, what ought to be given to the greatest and noblest <lb/>
            of men; but I know that, in giving this dignity to one man, <lb/>
            I am paying an old debt to another. How should the men <lb/>
            of to-day know that ancient hero, who so resolutely avoided <lb/>
            the glory which pressed upon him, who went into danger <lb/>
            with the same look which other men wear when they have <lb/>
            escaped from danger, who never regarded his own interest <lb/>
            as apart from that of the commonwealth ? " " Where," <lb/>
            you ask, " or who is he ? whence does he come ? " " You <lb/>
            know him not; it lies with me to balance the debit and <lb/>
            credit account in such cases as these; I know how much I <lb/>
            owe to each man; I repay some after a long interval, others <lb/>
            beforehand, according as my opportunities and the exigen­ <lb/>
            cies of my social system permit." I shall, therefore, some- <note type="footnote"> 1 Gertz, " Stud. Crit.," p. 159, note. </note> <pb n="115"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXXIII.] </note><lb/>
            times bestow somewhat upon an ungrateful man, though <lb/>
            not for his own sake.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. "What," argues he, "if you do not know <lb/>
            whether your man be ungrateful or grateful-will you wait <lb/>
            until you know, or will you not lose the opportunity of <lb/>
            bestowing a benefit ? To wait is a long business-for, as <lb/>
            Plato says, it is hard to form an opinion about the human <lb/>
            mind,-not to wait, is rash." To this objector we shall <lb/>
            answer, that we never should wait for absolute knowledge <lb/>
            of the whole case, since the discovery of truth is an arduous <lb/>
            task; but should proceed in the direction in which truth <lb/>
            appeared to direct us. All our actions proceed in this <lb/>
            direction: it is thus that we sow seed, that we sail upon <lb/>
            the sea, that we serve in the army, marry, and bring up <lb/>
            children. The result of all these actions is uncertain, so <lb/>
            we take that course from which we believe that good <lb/>
            results may be hoped for. Who can guarantee a harvest <lb/>
            to the sower, a harbour to the sailor, victory to the soldier, <lb/>
            a modest wife to the husband, dutiful children to the <lb/>
            father? We proceed in the way in which reason, not <lb/>
            absolute truth, directs us. Wait, do nothing that will <lb/>
            not turn out well, form no opinion until you have searched <lb/>
            out the truth, and your life will pass in absolute in­ <lb/>
            action. Since it is only the appearance of truth, not truth <lb/>
            itself, which leads me hither or thither, I shall confer <lb/>
            benefits upon the man who apparently will be grateful.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. " Many circumstances," argues he, 11 may arise <lb/>
            which may enable a bad man to steal into the place of a <lb/>
            good one, or may cause a good man to be disliked as though <lb/>
            he were a bad one; for appearances, to which we trust, are <lb/>
            deceptive." Who denies it ? Yet I can find nothing else <lb/>
            by which to guide my opinion. I must follow these tracks <lb/>
            in my search after truth, for I have none more trustworthy <lb/>
            than these; I will take pains to weigh the value of these <lb/>
            with all possible care, and will not hastily give my assent <pb n="116"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. IV.</note><lb/>
            to them. For instance, in a battle, it may happen that my <lb/>
            hand may be deceived by some mistake into turning my <lb/>
            weapon against my comrade, and sparing my enemy as <lb/>
            though he were on my side; but this will not often take <lb/>
            place, and will not take place through any fault of mine, <lb/>
            for my object is to strike the enemy, and defend my <lb/>
            countryman. If I know a man to be ungrateful, I shall <lb/>
            not bestow a benefit upon him. But the man has passed <lb/>
            himself off as a good man by some trick, and has im­ <lb/>
            posed upon me. Well, this is not at all the fault of <lb/>
            the giver, who gave under the impression that his friend <lb/>
            was grateful. 11 Suppose," asks he, " that you were to <lb/>
            promise to bestow a benefit, and afterwards were to learn <lb/>
            that your man was ungrateful, would you bestow it or not? <lb/>
            If you do, you do wrong knowingly, for you give to one to <lb/>
            whom you ought not; if you refuse, you do wrong like­ <lb/>
            wise, for you do not give to him to whom you promised to <lb/>
            give. This case upsets your consistency, and that proud <lb/>
            assurance of yours that the wise man never regrets his <lb/>
            actions, or amends what he has done, or alters his plans." <lb/>
            The wise man never changes his plans while the conditions <lb/>
            under which he formed them remain the same; therefore, <lb/>
            he never feels regret, because at the time nothing better <lb/>
            than what he did could have been done, nor could any <lb/>
            better decision have been arrived at than that which was <lb/>
            made; yet he begins everything with the saving clause, <lb/>
            " If nothing shall occur to the contrary." This is the <lb/>
            reason why we say that all goes well with him, and that <lb/>
            nothing happens contrary to his expectation, because he <lb/>
            bears in mind the possibility of something happening to <lb/>
            prevent the realization of his projects. It is an imprudent <lb/>
            confidence to trust that fortune will be on our side. The <lb/>
            wise man considers both sides: he knows how great is the <lb/>
            power of errors, how uncertain human affairs are, how <lb/>
            many obstacles there are to the success of plans. Without <pb n="117"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXXV.] </note><lb/>
            committing himself, he awaits the doubtful and capricious <lb/>
            issue of events, and weighs certainty of purpose against <lb/>
            uncertainty of result. Here also, however, he is protected <lb/>
            by that saving clause, without which he decides upon <lb/>
            nothing, and begins nothing.</p>
          <p>XXXV. When I promise to bestow a benefit, I promise <lb/>
            it, unless something occurs which makes it my duty not to <lb/>
            do so. What if, for example, my country orders me to <lb/>
            give to her what I had promised to my friend ? or if a law <lb/>
            be passed forbidding any one to do what I had promised to <lb/>
            do for him? Suppose that I have promised you my <lb/>
            daughter in marriage, that then you turn out to be a <lb/>
            foreigner, and that I have no right of intermarriage with <lb/>
            foreigners; in this ease, the Jaw, by which I am forbidden <lb/>
            to fulfil my promise, forms my defence. I shall be <lb/>
            treacherous, and hear myself blamed for inconsistency, <lb/>
            only if I do not fulfil my promise when all conditions re­ <lb/>
            main the same as when I made it; otherwise, any change <lb/>
            makes me free to reconsider the entire case, and absolves <lb/>
            me from my promise. I- may have promised to plead a <lb/>
            cause; afterwards it appears that this cause is designed to <lb/>
            form a precedent for an attack upon my father. I may <lb/>
            have promised to leave my country, and travel abroad; <lb/>
            then news comes that the road is beset with robbers. I <lb/>
            was going to an appointment at some particular place; <lb/>
            but my son's illness, or my wife's confinement, prevented <lb/>
            me. All conditions must be the same as they were when <lb/>
            I made the promise, if you mean to hold me bound in <lb/>
            honour to fulfil it. Now what greater change can take <lb/>
            place than that I should discover you to be a bad and un­ <lb/>
            grateful man ? I shall refuse to an unworthy man that <lb/>
            which I had intended to give him supposing him to be <lb/>
            worthy, and I shall also have reason to be angry with him <lb/>
            for the trick which he has put upon me.</p>
          <p>XXXVL I shall nevertheless look into the matter, and <pb n="118"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. IV.</note><lb/>
            consider what the value of the thing promised may be. If <lb/>
            it be trifling, I shall give it, not because you are worthy of <lb/>
            it, but because I promised it, and I shall not give it as a <lb/>
            present, but merely in order to make good my words and <lb/>
            give myself a twitch of the ear. I will punish my own <lb/>
            rashness in promising by the loss of what I gave. " See <lb/>
            how grieved you are; mind you take more care what you <lb/>
            say in future." As the saying is, I will take tongue money <lb/>
            from you. If the matter be important, I will not, as <lb/>
            Maecenas said, let ten million sesterces reproach me. I <lb/>
            will weigh the two sides of the question one against the <lb/>
            other: there is something in abiding by what you have <lb/>
            promised; on the other hand, there is a great deal in not <lb/>
            bestowing a benefit upon one who is unworthy of it. Now, <lb/>
            how great is this benefit? If it is a trifling one, let us <lb/>
            wink and let it pass; but if it will cause me much loss or <lb/>
            much shame to give it, I had rather excuse myself once for <lb/>
            refusing it than have to do so ever after for giving it. The <lb/>
            whole point, I repeat, depends upon how much the thing <lb/>
            given is worth: let the terms of my promise be appraised. <lb/>
            Not only shall I refuse to give what I may have promised <lb/>
            rashly, but I shall also demand back again what I may <lb/>
            have wrongly bestowed: a man must be mad who keeps a <lb/>
            promise made under a mistake.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. Philip, king of the Macedonians, had a hardy <lb/>
            soldier whose services he had found useful in many cam­ <lb/>
            paigns. From time to time he made this man presents of <lb/>
            part of the plunder as the reward of -his valour, and used <lb/>
            to excite his greedy spirit by his frequent gifts. This man <lb/>
            was cast by shipwreck upon the estate of a certain Mace­ <lb/>
            donian, who as soon as he heard the news hastened to him, <lb/>
            restored his breath, removed him to his own farmhouse, <lb/>
            gave up his own bed to him, nursed him out of his <lb/>
            weakened and half-dead condition, took care of him at his <lb/>
            own expense for thirty days, restored him to health and <pb n="119"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXXVIII.] </note><lb/>
            gave him a sum of money for his journey, as the man kept <lb/>
            constantly saying, " If only I can see my chief, I will repay <lb/>
            your kindness." He told Philip of his shipwreck, said <lb/>
            nothing about the help which he had received, and at once <lb/>
            demanded that a certain man's estate should be given to <lb/>
            him. The man was a friend of his: it was that very man <lb/>
            by whom he had been rescued and restored to health. <lb/>
            Sometimes, especially in time of war, kings bestow many <lb/>
            gifts with their eyes shut. One just man cannot deal with <lb/>
            such a mass of armed selfishness. It is not possible for any <lb/>
            one to be at the same time a good man and a good general. <lb/>
            How are so many thou sands of insatiable men to be satiated? <lb/>
            What would they have, if every man had his own ? Thus <lb/>
            Philip reasoned with himself while he ordered the man to <lb/>
            be put in possession of the property which he asked for. <lb/>
            However, the other, when driven out of his estate, did not, <lb/>
            like a peasant, endure his wrongs in silence, thankful that <lb/>
            he himself was not given away also, but sent a sharp and <lb/>
            outspoken letter to Philip, who, on reading it, was so much <lb/>
            enraged that he straightway ordered Pausanias to restore <lb/>
            the property to its former owner, and to brand that <lb/>
            wickedest of soldiers, that most ungrateful of guests, that <lb/>
            greediest of shipwrecked men, with letters bearing witness <lb/>
            to his ingratitude. He, indeed, deserved to have the letters <lb/>
            not merely branded but carved in his flesh, for having <lb/>
            reduced his host to the condition in which he himself had <lb/>
            been when he lay naked and shipwrecked upon the beach; <lb/>
            still, let us see within what limits one ought to keep in <lb/>
            punishing him. Of course what he had so villainously <lb/>
            seized ought to be taken from him. But who would be <lb/>
            affected by the spectacle of his punishment? The crime <lb/>
            which he had committed would prevent his being pitied <lb/>
            even by any humane person.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. Will Philip then give you a thing because he <lb/>
            has promised to give it, even though he ought not to do so, <pb n="120"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. IV.</note><lb/>
            even though lie will commit a wrong by doing so, nay, a <lb/>
            crime, even though by this one act he will make it impossible <lb/>
            for shipwrecked men to reach the shore ? There is no incon­ <lb/>
            sistency in giving up an intention which we have discovered <lb/>
            to be wrong and have condemned as wrong; we ought <lb/>
            candidly to admit, "I thought that it was something <lb/>
            different; I have been deceived." It is mere pride and <lb/>
            folly to persist, " what I once have said, be it what it may, <lb/>
            shall remain unaltered and settled." There is no disgrace in <lb/>
            altering one's plans according to circumstances. Now, if <lb/>
            Philip had left this man in possession of that seashore <lb/>
            which he obtained by his shipwreck, would he not have <lb/>
            practically pronounced sentence of banishment against all <lb/>
            unfortunates for the future ? 11 Rather," says Philip, “ do <lb/>
            thou carry upon thy forehead of brass those letters, that <lb/>
            they may be impressed upon the eyes of all throughout <lb/>
            my kingdom. Go, let men see how sacred a thing is the <lb/>
            table of hospitality; show them your face, that upon it <lb/>
            they may read the decree which prevents its being a <lb/>
            capital crime to give refuge to the unfortunate under one's <lb/>
            roof. The order will be more certainly respected by this <lb/>
            means than if I had inscribed it upon tablets of brass."</p>
          <p>XXXIX. "Why then," argues our adversary, "did <lb/>
            your Stoic philosopher Zeno, when he had promised a <lb/>
            loan of five hundred denarii to some person, whom he <lb/>
            afterwards discovered to be of doubtful character, persist in <lb/>
            lending it, because of his promise, though his friends dis­ <lb/>
            suaded him from doing so? " In the first place a loan is <lb/>
            on a different footing to a benefit. Even when we have <lb/>
            lent money to an undesirable person we can recall it; I <lb/>
            can demand payment upon a certain day, and if he be­ <lb/>
            comes bankrupt, I can obtain my share of his property; <lb/>
            but a benefit is lost utterly and instantly. Besides, the <lb/>
            one is the act of a bad man, the other that of a bad father <lb/>
            of a family. In the next place, if the sum had been a <pb n="121"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XL.] </note><lb/>
            larger one, not even Zeno would have persisted in lending <lb/>
            it. It was five hundred denarii; the sort of sum of which <lb/>
            one says, 11 May he spend it in sickness," and it was worth <lb/>
            paying so much to avoid breaking his promise. I shall go <lb/>
            out to supper, even though the weather be cold, because I <lb/>
            have promised to go; but I shall not if snow be falling. <lb/>
            I shall leave my bed to go to a betrothal feast, although I <lb/>
            may be suffering from indigestion; but I shall not do so <lb/>
            if I am feverish. I will become bail for you, because I <lb/>
            promised; but not if you wish me to become bail in some <lb/>
            transaction of uncertain issue, if you expose me to forfeit­ <lb/>
            ing my money to the state. There runs through all <lb/>
            these cases, I argue, an implied exception; if I am able, <lb/>
            provided it is right for me to do so, if these things be so <lb/>
            and so. Make the position the same when you ask me to <lb/>
            fulfil my promise, as it was when I gave it, and it will be <lb/>
            mere fickleness to disappoint you; but if something new has <lb/>
            taken place in the meanwhile, why should you wonder at <lb/>
            my intentions being changed when the conditions under <lb/>
            which I gave the promise are changed ? Put everything <lb/>
            back as it was, and I shall be the same as I was. We enter <lb/>
            into recognizances to appear, yet if we fail to do so an <lb/>
            action will not in all cases lie against us, for we are excused <lb/>
            for making default if forced to do so by a power which we <lb/>
            cannot resist.</p>
          <p>XL. You may take the same answer to the question as <lb/>
            to whether we ought in all cases to show gratitude for <lb/>
            kindness, and whether a benefit ought in all cases to be <lb/>
            repaid. It is my duty to show a grateful mind, but in <lb/>
            some cases my own poverty, in others the prosperity of the <lb/>
            friend to whom I owe some return, will not permit me to <lb/>
            give it. What, for instance, am I, a poor man, to give to a <lb/>
            king or a rich man in return for his kindness, especially as <lb/>
            some men regard it as a wrong to have their benefits re­ <lb/>
            paid, and are wont to pile one benefit upon another? In <pb n="122"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. IV.</note><lb/>
            dealing with such persons, what more can I do than wish <lb/>
            to repay them? Yet I ought not to refuse to receive a <lb/>
            new benefit, because I have not repaid the former one. I <lb/>
            shall take it as freely as it is given, and will offer myself <lb/>
            to my friend as a wide field for the exercise of his good <lb/>
            nature: he who is unwilling to receive new benefits must <lb/>
            be dissatisfied with what he has already received. Do you <lb/>
            say, "I shall not be able to return them?” What is that <lb/>
            to the purpose ? I am willing enough to do so if oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity or means were given me. He gave it to me, of course, <lb/>
            having both opportunity and means: is he a good man or <lb/>
            a bad one ? if he is a good man, I have a good case against <lb/>
            him, and I will not plead if he be a bad one. Neither do I <lb/>
            think it right to insist on making repayment, even though <lb/>
            it be against the will of those whom we repay, and to press it <lb/>
            upon them however reluctant they may be; it is not repay­ <lb/>
            ment to force an unwilling man to resume what you were <lb/>
            once willing to take. Some people, if any trifling present <lb/>
            be sent to them, afterwards send back something else for <lb/>
            no particular reason, and then declare that they are under <lb/>
            no obligation; to send something back at once, and balance <lb/>
            one present by another, is the next thing to refusing to <lb/>
            receive it. On some occasions I shall not return a bene­ <lb/>
            fit, even though I be able to do so. When ? When by so <lb/>
            doing I shall myself lose more than he will gain, or if he <lb/>
            would not notice any advantage to himself in receiving that <lb/>
            which it would be a great loss to me to return. The man <lb/>
            who is always eager to repay under all circumstances, has <lb/>
            not the feeling of a grateful man, but of a debtor; and, to <lb/>
            put it shortly, he who is too eager to repay, is unwilling <lb/>
            to be in his friend's debt; he who is unwilling, and yet is <lb/>
            in his friend's debt, is ungrateful.</p><pb n="123"/>

          <p>I <lb/>
            N the preceding books I seem to have accomplished <lb/>
            the object which I proposed to myself, since in them <lb/>
            I have discussed how a benefit ought to be bestowed, and <lb/>
            how it ought to be received. These are the limits of <lb/>
            this action; when I dwell upon it further I am not <lb/>
            obeying the orders, but the caprices of my subject which <lb/>
            ought to be followed whither it leads, not whither it <lb/>
            allures us to wander; for now and then something will <lb/>
            arise, which, although it is all but unconnected with the <lb/>
            subject, instead of being a necessary part of it, still thrills <lb/>
            the mind with a certain charm. However, since you wish <lb/>
            it to be so, let us go on, after having completed our discus­ <lb/>
            sion of the heads of the subject itself, to investigate those <lb/>
            matters which, if you wish for truth, I must call adjacent <lb/>
            to it, not actually connected with it; to examine which <lb/>
            carefully is not one worth one's while, and yet is not labour <lb/>
            in vain. No praise, however, which I can give to benefits <lb/>
            does justice to you, Æbutius Liberalis, a man of excellent <lb/>
            disposition and naturally inclined to bestow them. Never <lb/>
            have I seen any one esteem even the most trifling services <lb/>
            more kindly; indeed, your good-nature goes so far as to <lb/>
            regard whatever benefit is bestowed upon anyone as be­ <lb/>
            stowed upon yourself; you are prepared to pay even what <lb/>
            is owed by the ungrateful, that no one may regret having <lb/>
            bestowed benefits. You yourself are so far from any <lb/>
            boastfulness, you are so eager at once to free those whom <pb n="124"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. V.</note><lb/>
            you serve from any feeling of obligation to you, that you <lb/>
            like, when giving anything to any one, to seem not so <lb/>
            much to be giving a present as returning one ; and there­ <lb/>
            fore what you give in this manner will all the more fully <lb/>
            be repaid to you: for, as a rule, benefits come to one who <lb/>
            does not demand repayment of them; and just as glory <lb/>
            follows those who avoid it, so men receive a more plentiful <lb/>
            harvest in return for benefits bestowed upon those who had <lb/>
            it in their power to be ungrateful. With you there is no <lb/>
            reason why those who have received benefits from you <lb/>
            should not ask for fresh ones; nor would you refuse to <lb/>
            bestow others, to overlook and conceal what you have given, <lb/>
            and to add to it more and greater gifts, since it is the aim <lb/>
            of all the best men and the no blest dispositions to bear <lb/>
            with an ungrateful man until you make him grateful. Be <lb/>
            not deceived in pursuing this plan; vice, if you do not too <lb/>
            soon begin to hate it, will yield to virtue.</p>
          <p>II. Thus it is that you are especially pleased with what <lb/>
            you think the grandly-sounding phrase, “ It is disgraceful <lb/>
            to be worsted in a contest of benefits." Whether this be <lb/>
            true or not deserves to be investigated, and it means some­ <lb/>
            thing quite different from what you imagine; for it is never <lb/>
            disgraceful to be worsted in any honourable contest, pro­ <lb/>
            vided that you do not throw down your arms, and that even <lb/>
            when conquered you wish to conquer. All men do not strive <lb/>
            for a good object with the same strength, resources, and <lb/>
            good fortune, upon which depend at all events the issues <lb/>
            of the most admirable projects, though we ought to praise <lb/>
            the will itself which makes an effort in the right direction. <lb/>
            Even though another passes it by with swifter pace, yet <lb/>
            the palm of victory does not, as in publicly-exhibited races, <lb/>
            declare which is the better man; though even in the games <lb/>
            chance frequently brings an inferior man to the front. As <lb/>
            far as loyalty of feeling goes, which each man wishes to be <lb/>
            possessed in the fullest measure oil his own tide, if one of <pb n="125"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. III.] </note><lb/>
            the two be the more powerful, if he have at his disposal all <lb/>
            the resources which he wishes to use, and be favoured by for­ <lb/>
            tune in his most ambitious efforts, while the other, although <lb/>
            equally willing, can only return less than he receives, or <lb/>
            perhaps can make no return at all, but still wishes to do <lb/>
            so and is entirely devoted to this object; then the latter is <lb/>
            no more conquered than he who dies in arms, whom the <lb/>
            enemy found it easier to slay than to turn back. To be <lb/>
            conquered, which you consider disgraceful, cannot happen <lb/>
            to a good man ; for he will never surrender, never give up <lb/>
            the contest, to the last day of his life he will stand prepared <lb/>
            and in that posture he will die, testifying that though he <lb/>
            has received much, yet that he had the will to repay as <lb/>
            much as he had received.</p>
          <p>HI. The Lacedaemonians forbid their young men to con­ <lb/>
            tend in the pancratium, or with the caestus, in which <lb/>
            games the defeated party has to acknowledge himself <lb/>
            beaten. The winner of a race is he who first reaches the <lb/>
            goal; he outstrips the others in swiftness, but not in <lb/>
            courage. The wrestler who has been thrown three times <lb/>
            loses the palm of victory, but does not yield it up. Since <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians thought it of great importance that <lb/>
            their countrymen should be invincible, they kept them <lb/>
            away from those contests in which victory is assigned, not <lb/>
            by the judge, or by the issue of the contest itself, but by <lb/>
            the voice of the vanquished begging the victor to spare <lb/>
            him as he falls. This attribute of never being conquered, <lb/>
            which they so jealously guard among their citizens, can be <lb/>
            attained by all men through virtue and goodwill, because <lb/>
            even when all else is vanquished, the mind remains un­ <lb/>
            conquered. For this cause no one speaks of the three <lb/>
            hundred Fabii as conquered, but slaughtered. Regulus <lb/>
            was taken captive by the Carthaginians, not conquered; and <lb/>
            so were all other men who have not yielded in spirit when <lb/>
            overwhelmed by the strength and weight of angry fortune. <pb n="126"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. V.</note><lb/>
            So is it with benefits. A man may have received more <lb/>
            than he gave, more valuable ones, more frequently be­ <lb/>
            stowed ; yet is he not vanquished. It may be that, if you <lb/>
            compare the benefits with one another, those which he has <lb/>
            received will outweigh those which he has bestowed; but <lb/>
            if you compare the giver and the receiver, whose intentions <lb/>
            also ought to be considered apart, neither will prove the <lb/>
            victor. It often happens that even when one combatant is <lb/>
            pierced with many wounds, while the other is only slightly <lb/>
            injured, yet they are said to have fought a drawn battle, <lb/>
            although the former may appear to be the worse man.</p>
          <p>IV. No one, therefore, can be conquered in a contest of <lb/>
            benefits, if he knows how to owe a debt, if he wishes to <lb/>
            make a return for what he has received, and raises himself <lb/>
            to the same level with his friend in spirit, though he can­ <lb/>
            not do so in material gifts. As long as he remains in this <lb/>
            temper of mind, as long as he has the wish to declare by <lb/>
            proofs that he has a grateful mind, what difference does it <lb/>
            make upon which side we can count the greater number of <lb/>
            presents ? You are able to give much; I can do nothing <lb/>
            but receive. Fortune abides with you, goodwill alone with <lb/>
            me; yet I am as much on an equality with you as naked <lb/>
            or lightly armed men are with a large body armed to the <lb/>
            teeth. No one, therefore, is worsted by benefits, because <lb/>
            each man's gratitude is to be measured by his will. If it <lb/>
            be disgraceful to be worsted in a contest of benefits, you <lb/>
            ought not to receive a benefit from very powerful men <lb/>
            whose kindness you cannot return, I mean such as princes <lb/>
            and kings, whom fortune has placed in such a station that <lb/>
            they can give away much, and can only receive very little <lb/>
            and quite inadequate returns for what they give. I have <lb/>
            spoken of kings and princes, who alone can cause works to <lb/>
            be accomplished, and whose superlative power depends <lb/>
            upon the obedience and services of inferiors; but some <lb/>
            there are, free from all earthly lusts, who are scarcely <pb n="127"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. V.] </note><lb/>
            affected by any human objects of desire, upon whom for­ <lb/>
            tune herself could bestow nothing. I must be worsted in <lb/>
            a contest of benefits with Socrates, or with Diogenes, who <lb/>
            walked naked through the treasures of Macedonia, treading <lb/>
            the king's wealth under his feet. In good sooth, he must <lb/>
            then rightly have seemed, both to himself and to all others <lb/>
            whose eyes were keen enough to perceive the real truth, to <lb/>
            be superior even to him at whose feet all the world lay. He <lb/>
            was far more powerful, far richer even than Alexander, who <lb/>
            then possessed everything; for there was more that Diogenes <lb/>
            could refuse to receive than that Alexander was able to give.</p>
          <p>V. It is not disgraceful to be worsted by these men, for <lb/>
            I am rot the less brave because you pit me against an in­ <lb/>
            vulnerable enemy, nor does fire not burn because you <lb/>
            throw into it something over which flames have no power, <lb/>
            nor does iron lose its power of cutting, though you may <lb/>
            wish to cut up a stone which is hard, impervious to blows, <lb/>
            and of such a nature that hard tools are blunted upon it. <lb/>
            I give you the same answer about gratitude. A man is <lb/>
            not disgracefully worsted in a contest of benefits if he <lb/>
            lays himself under an obligation to such persons as these, <lb/>
            whose enormous wealth or admirable virtue shut out <lb/>
            all possibility of their benefits being returned. As a rule <lb/>
            we are worsted by our parents; for while we have them <lb/>
            with us, we regard them as severe, and do not understand <lb/>
            what they do for us. When our age begins to bring us a <lb/>
            little sense, and we gradually perceive that they deserve <lb/>
            our love for those very things which used to prevent our <lb/>
            loving them, their advice, their punishments, and the <lb/>
            careful watch which they used to keep over our youthful <lb/>
            recklessness, they are taken from us. Few live to reap any <lb/>
            real fruit from children; most men feel their sons only as <lb/>
            a burden. Yet there is no disgrace in being worsted by <lb/>
            one's parent in bestowing benefits; how should there be, <lb/>
            seeing that there is no disgrace in being worsted by any­ <pb n="128"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. V.</note><lb/>
            one. We are equal to some men, and yet not equal; equal <lb/>
            in intention, which is all that they care for, which is all <lb/>
            that we promise to be, but unequal in fortune. And if <lb/>
            fortune prevents any one from repaying a kindness, he <lb/>
            need not, therefore, blush, as though he were vanquished; <lb/>
            there is no disgrace in failing to reach your object, pro­ <lb/>
            vided you attempt to reach it. It often is necessary, that <lb/>
            before making any return for the benefits which we have <lb/>
            received, we should ask for new ones; yet, if so, we shall <lb/>
            not refrain from asking for them, nor shall we do so as <lb/>
            though disgraced by so doing, because, even if we do not <lb/>
            repay the debt, we shall owe it; because, even if something <lb/>
            from without befalls us to prevent our repaying it, it will <lb/>
            not be our fault if we are not grateful. We can neither <lb/>
            be conquered in intention, nor can we be disgraced by <lb/>
            yielding to what is beyond our strength to contend with.</p>
          <p>VI. Alexander, the king of the Macedonians, used to <lb/>
            boast that he had never been worsted by anybody in a <lb/>
            contest of benefits. If so, it was no reason why, in the <lb/>
            fulness of his pride, he should despise the Macedonians, <lb/>
            Greeks, Carians, Persians, and other tribes of whom his <lb/>
            army was composed, nor need he imagine that it was this <lb/>
            that gave him an empire reaching from a corner of Thrace <lb/>
            to the shore of the unknown sea. Socrates could make <lb/>
            the same boast, and so could Diogenes, by whom Alexander <lb/>
            was certainly surpassed; for was he not surpassed on the <lb/>
            day when, swelling as he was beyond the limits of merely <lb/>
            human pride, he beheld one to whom he could give nothing, <lb/>
            from whom he could take nothing ? King Archelaus in­ <lb/>
            vited Socrates to come to him. Socrates is reported to <lb/>
            have answered that he should be sorry to go to one who <lb/>
            would bestow benefits upon him, since he should not be <lb/>
            able to make him an adequate return for them. In the <lb/>
            first place, Socrates was at liberty not to receive them; <lb/>
            next, Socrates himself would h ave been the first to bestow a <pb n="129"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. VI.] </note><lb/>
            benefit, for he would have come when invited, and would <lb/>
            have given to Archelaus that for which Archelaus could <lb/>
            have made no return to Socrates. Even if Archelaus were <lb/>
            to give Socrates gold and silver, if he learned in return for <lb/>
            them to despise gold and silver, would not Socrates be able <lb/>
            to repay Archelaus ? Could Socrates receive from him as <lb/>
            much value as he gave, in displaying to him a man skilled <lb/>
            in the knowledge of life and of death, comprehending the <lb/>
            true purpose of each? Suppose that he had found this <lb/>
            king, as it were, groping his way in the clear sunlight, and <lb/>
            had taught him the secrets of nature, of which he was so <lb/>
            ignorant, that when there was an eclipse of the sun, he <lb/>
            shut up his palace, and shaved his son's head, 1 which men <lb/>
            are wont to do in times of mourning and distress. What <lb/>
            a benefit it would have been if he had dragged the terror- <lb/>
            stricken king out of his hiding-place, and bidden him be of <lb/>
            good cheer, saying, " This is not a disappearance of the <lb/>
            sun, but a conjunction of two heavenly bodies; for the <lb/>
            moon, which proceeds along a lower path, has placed her <lb/>
            disk beneath the sun, and hidden it by the interposition of <lb/>
            her own mass. Sometimes she only hides a small portion <lb/>
            of the sun's disk, because she only grazes it in passing; <lb/>
            sometimes she hides more, by placing more of herself <lb/>
            before it; and sometimes she shuts it out from our sight <lb/>
            altogether, if she passes in an exactly even course between <lb/>
            the sun and the earth. Soon, however, their own swift <lb/>
            motion will draw these two bodies apart; soon the earth <lb/>
            will receive back again the light of day. And this system <lb/>
            will continue throughout centuries, having certain days, <lb/>
            known beforehand, upon which the sun cannot display all <lb/>
            his rays, because of the intervention of the moon. Wait <lb/>
            only for a short time; he will soon emerge, he will soon <lb/>
            leave that seeming cloud, and freely shed abroad his light <note type="footnote">1 Gertz very reasonably conjectures that he shaved his own head <lb/>
            which reading would require a very trifling alteration of the text.- </note><note type="footnote"> K </note> <pb n="130"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. V.</note><lb/>
            without any hindrances." Could Socrates not have made <lb/>
            an adequate return to Archelaus, if he had taught him to <lb/>
            reign? as though Socrates would not benefit him sum­ <lb/>
            ciently, merely by enabling him to bestow a benefit upon <lb/>
            Socrates. Why, then, did Socrates say this? Being a <lb/>
            joker and a speaker in parables-a man who turned all, <lb/>
            especially the great, into ridicule-he preferred giving <lb/>
            him a satirical refusal, rather than an obstinate or haughty <lb/>
            one, and therefore said that he did not wish to receive <lb/>
            benefits from one to whom he could not return as much as <lb/>
            he received. He feared, perhaps, that he might be forced <lb/>
            to receive something which he did not wish, he feared that <lb/>
            it might be something unfit for Socrates to receive. Some <lb/>
            one may say, " He ought to have said that he did not wish <lb/>
            to go." But by so doing he would have excited against him­ <lb/>
            self the anger of an arrogant king, who wished everything <lb/>
            connected with himself to be highly valued. It makes no <lb/>
            difference to a king whether you be unwilling to give any­ <lb/>
            thing to him or to accept anything from him; he is equally <lb/>
            incensed at either rebuff, and to be treated with disdain is <lb/>
            more bitter to a proud spirit than not to be feared. Do <lb/>
            you wish to know what Socrates really meant ? He, whose <lb/>
            freedom of speech could not be borne even by a free state, <lb/>
            was not willing of his own choice to become a slave.</p>
          <p>VII. I think that we have sufficiently discussed this <lb/>
            part of the subject, whether it be disgraceful to be worsted <lb/>
            in a contest of benefits. Whoever asks this question <lb/>
            must know that men are not wont to bestow benefits upon <lb/>
            themselves, for evidently it could not be disgraceful to <lb/>
            be worsted by oneself. Yet some of the Stoics debate this <lb/>
            question, whether any one can confer a benefit upon him­ <lb/>
            self, and whether one ought to return one's own kindness <lb/>
            to oneself. This discussion has been raised in consequence <lb/>
            of our habit of saying, 11 I am thankful to myself," " I can <lb/>
            complain of no one but myself," "I am angry with my­ <pb n="131"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. VII.] </note><lb/>
            self," " I will punish myself," " I hate myself," and many <lb/>
            other phrases of the same sort, in which one speaks of one­ <lb/>
            self as one would of some other person. " If," they argue, <lb/>
            " I can injure myself, why should I not be able also to be­ <lb/>
            stow a benefit upon myself ? Besides this, why are those <lb/>
            things not called benefits when I bestow them upon myself <lb/>
            which would be called benefits if I bestowed them upon <lb/>
            another ? If to receive a certain thing from another would <lb/>
            lay me under an obligation to him, how is it that if I give <lb/>
            it to myself, I do not contract an obligation to myself? <lb/>
            why should I be ungrateful to my own self, which is no <lb/>
            less disgraceful than it is to be mean to oneself, or hard <lb/>
            and cruel to oneself, or neglectful of oneself ? The pro­ <lb/>
            curer is equally odious whether he prostitutes others or <lb/>
            himself. We blame a flatterer, and one who imitates an­ <lb/>
            other man's mode of speech, or is prepared to give praise <lb/>
            whether it be deserved or not; we ought equally to blame <lb/>
            one who humours himself and looks up to himself, and so <lb/>
            to speak is his own flatterer. Vices are not only hateful <lb/>
            when outwardly practised, but also when they are repressed <lb/>
            within the mind. Whom would you admire more than he <lb/>
            who governs himself and has himself under command ? It <lb/>
            is easier to rule savage nations, impatient of foreign con­ <lb/>
            trol, than to restrain one's own mind and keep it under <lb/>
            one's own control. Plato, it is argued, was grateful to <lb/>
            Socrates for having been taught by him; why should not <lb/>
            Socrates be grateful to himself for having taught himself ? <lb/>
            Marcus Cato said, "Borrow from yourself whatever you <lb/>
            lack;" why, then, if I can lend myself anything, should I be <lb/>
            unable to give myself anything ? The instances in which <lb/>
            usage divides us into two persons are innumerable; we are <lb/>
            wont to say, " Let me converse with myself," and, " I will <lb/>
            give myself a twitch of the ear; ”1 and if it be true that <note type="footnote">1 See book iv. ch. XXXVI. </note> <pb n="132"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. V.</note><lb/>
            one can do so, then a man ought to be grateful to himself, <lb/>
            just as he is angry with himself; as he blames himself, so <lb/>
            he ought to praise himself; since he can impoverish him­ <lb/>
            self, he can also enrich himself. Injuries and benefits are <lb/>
            the converse of one another: if we say of a man,‛he has done <lb/>
            himself an injury,' we can also say ' he has bestowed upon <lb/>
            himself a benefit ?'</p>
          <p>VIII. It is natural that a man should first incur an <lb/>
            obligation, and then that he should return gratitude for it; <lb/>
            a debtor cannot exist without a creditor, any more than a <lb/>
            husband without a wife, or a son without a father; some­ <lb/>
            one must give in order that some one may receive. Just <lb/>
            as no one carries himself, although he moves his body and <lb/>
            transports it from place to place; as no one, though he <lb/>
            may have made a speech in his own defence, is said to have <lb/>
            stood by himself, or erects a statue to himself as his <lb/>
            own patron; as no sick man, when by his own care he has <lb/>
            regained his health, asks himself for a fee; so in no trans­ <lb/>
            action, even when a man does what is useful to himself, need <lb/>
            he return thanks to himself, because there is no one to whom <lb/>
            he can return them. Though I grant that a man can be­ <lb/>
            stow a benefit upon himself, yet at the same time that he <lb/>
            gives it, he also receives it; though I grant that a man <lb/>
            may receive a benefit from himself, yet he receives it at the <lb/>
            same time that he gives it. The exchange takes place <lb/>
            within doors, as they say, and the transfer is made at once, <lb/>
            as though the debt were a fictitious one; for he who gives <lb/>
            is not a different person to he who receives, but one and <lb/>
            the same. The word " to owe " has no meaning except as <lb/>
            between two persons; how then can it apply to one man <lb/>
            who incurs an obligation, and by the same act frees himself <lb/>
            from it ? In a disk or a ball there is no top or bottom, no <lb/>
            beginning or end, because the relation of the parts is <lb/>
            changed when it moves, what was behind coming before, <lb/>
            and what went down on one side coming up on the other, <pb n="133"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. VIII.] </note><lb/>
            so that all the parts, in whatever direction they may move, <lb/>
            come back to the same position. Imagine that the same <lb/>
            thing takes place in a man; into however many pieces you <lb/>
            may divide him, he remains one. If he strikes himself, he <lb/>
            has no one to call to account for the insult; if he binds him­ <lb/>
            self and locks himself up, he cannot demand damages; if <lb/>
            he bestows a benefit upon himself, he straightway returns <lb/>
            it to the giver. It is said that there is no waste in nature, <lb/>
            because everything which is taken from nature returns to her <lb/>
            again, and nothing can perish, because it cannot fall out of <lb/>
            nature, but goes round again to the point from whence it <lb/>
            started. You ask, " What connection has this illustration <lb/>
            with the subject?" I will tell you. Imagine yourself to be un­ <lb/>
            grateful, the benefit bestowed upon you is not lost, he who <lb/>
            gave it has it; suppose that you are unwilling to receive it, <lb/>
            it still belongs to you before it is returned. You cannot lose <lb/>
            anything, because what you take away from yourself, you <lb/>
            nevertheless gain yourself. The matter revolves in a circle <lb/>
            within yourself; by receiving you give, by giving you receive.</p>
          <p>TX. 11 It is our duty," argues our adversary, " to bestow <lb/>
            benefits upon ourselves, therefore we ought also to be <lb/>
            grateful to ourselves." The original axiom, upon which the <lb/>
            inference depends, is untrue, for no one bestows benefits <lb/>
            upon himself, but obeys the dictates of his nature, which <lb/>
            disposes him to affection for himself, and which makes <lb/>
            him take the greatest pains to avoid hurtful things, and to <lb/>
            follow after those things which are profitable to him. <lb/>
            Consequently, the man who gives to himself is not generous, <lb/>
            nor is he who pardons himself forgiving, nor is he who is <lb/>
            touched by his own misfortunes tender-hearted; it is natural <lb/>
            to do those things to oneself which when done to others <lb/>
            become generosity, clemency, and tenderness of heart. A <lb/>
            benefit is a voluntary act, but to do good to oneself is an <lb/>
            instinctive one. The more benefits a man bestows, the more <lb/>
            beneficent he is, yet who ever was praised for having been <pb n="134"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. V.</note><lb/>
            of service to himself ? or for having rescued himself from <lb/>
            brigands? No one bestows a benefit upon himself any <lb/>
            more than he bestows hospitality upon himself; no one <lb/>
            gives himself anything, any more than he lends himself <lb/>
            anything. If each man bestows benefits upon himself, <lb/>
            is always bestowing them, and bestows them without any <lb/>
            cessation, then it is impossible for him to make any cal­ <lb/>
            culation of the number of his benefits; when then can he <lb/>
            show his gratitude, seeing that by the very act of doing so <lb/>
            he would bestow a benefit ? for what distinction can you <lb/>
            draw between giving himself a benefit or receiving a bene­ <lb/>
            fit for himself, when the whole transaction takes place in <lb/>
            the mind of the same man ? Suppose that I have freed my­ <lb/>
            self from danger, then I have bestowed a benefit upon my­ <lb/>
            self ; suppose I free myself a second time, by so doing do <lb/>
            I bestow or repay a benefit ? In the next place, even if I <lb/>
            grant the primary axiom, that we can bestow benefits upon <lb/>
            ourselves, I do not admit that which follows; for even if <lb/>
            we can do so, we ought not to do so. Wherefore ? Because <lb/>
            we receive a return for them at once. It is right for me to <lb/>
            receive a benefit, then to lie under an obligation, then to <lb/>
            repay it; now here there is no time for remaining under <lb/>
            an obligation, because we receive the return without any <lb/>
            delay. No one really gives except to another, no one owes <lb/>
            except to another, no one repays except to another. An <lb/>
            act which always requires two persons cannot take place <lb/>
            within the mind of one.</p>
          <p>X. A benefit means the affording of something useful, <lb/>
            and the word affording implies other persons. Would not <lb/>
            a man be thought mad if he said that he had sold some­ <lb/>
            thing to himself, because selling means alienation, and <lb/>
            the transferring of a thing and of one's rights in that thing <lb/>
            to another person ? Yet giving, like selling anything, con­ <lb/>
            sists in making it pass away from you, handing over what <lb/>
            you yourself once owned into the keeping of some one else. <pb n="135"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XI.] </note><lb/>
            If this be so, no one ever gave himself a benefit, because no <lb/>
            one gives to himself; if not, two opposites coalesce, so that <lb/>
            it becomes the same thing to give and to receive. Yet <lb/>
            there is a great difference between giving and receiving; <lb/>
            how should there not be, seeing that these words are the <lb/>
            converse of one another ? Still, if any one can give himself <lb/>
            a benefit, there can be no difference between giving and <lb/>
            receiving. I said a little before that some words apply <lb/>
            only to other persons, and are so constituted that their <lb/>
            whole meaning lies apart from ourselves; for instance, I <lb/>
            am a brother, but a brother of some other man, for no one <lb/>
            is his own brother; I am an equal, but equal to somebody <lb/>
            else, for who is equal to himself ? A thing which is com­ <lb/>
            pared to another thing is unintelligible without that other <lb/>
            thing; a thing which is joined to something else does not <lb/>
            exist apart from it; so that which is given does not exist <lb/>
            without the other person, nor can a benefit have any exis­ <lb/>
            tence without another person. This is clear from the very <lb/>
            phrase which describes it, to do good,’ yet no one does good <lb/>
            to himself, any more than he favours himself or is on his <lb/>
            own side. I might enlarge further upon this subject and <lb/>
            give many examples. Why should benefits not be included <lb/>
            among those acts which require two persons to perform <lb/>
            them ? Many honourable, most admirable and highly vir­ <lb/>
            tuous acts cannot take place without a second person. <lb/>
            Fidelity is praised and held to be one of the chief blessings <lb/>
            known among men, yet was any one ever on that account <lb/>
            said to have kept faith with himself ?</p>
          <p>XI. I come now to the last part of this subject. The <lb/>
            man who returns a kindness ought to expend something, <lb/>
            just as he who repays expends money; but the man who <lb/>
            returns a kindness to himself expends nothing, just as he <lb/>
            who receives a benefit from himself gains nothing. A <lb/>
            benefit and gratitude for it must pass to and fro between <lb/>
            two persons; their interchange cannot take place within <pb n="136"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. V.</note><lb/>
            one man. He who returns a kindness does good in his <lb/>
            turn to him from whom he has received something; but <lb/>
            the man who returns his own kindness, to whom does he <lb/>
            do good ? To himself ? Is there any one who does not <lb/>
            regard the returning of a kindness, and the bestowal <lb/>
            of a benefit, as distinct acts ? I He who returns a kindness <lb/>
            to himself does good to himself.' Was any man ever un­ <lb/>
            willing to do this, even though he were ungrateful ? nay, <lb/>
            who ever was ungrateful from any other motive than this ? <lb/>
            " If," it is argued, " we are right in thanking ourselves, we <lb/>
            ought to return our own kindness;" yet we say, " I am <lb/>
            thankful to myself for having refused to marry that <lb/>
            woman," or " for having refused to join a partnership with <lb/>
            that man." When we speak thus, we are really praising <lb/>
            ourselves, and make use of the language of those who re­ <lb/>
            turn thanks to approve our own acts. A benefit is something <lb/>
            which, when given, may or may not be returned. Now, he <lb/>
            who gives a benefit to himself must needs receive what he <lb/>
            gives; therefore, this is not a benefit. A benefit is re­ <lb/>
            ceived at one time, and is returned at another; (but when <lb/>
            a man bestows a benefit upon himself, he both receives it <lb/>
            and returns it at the same time). In a benefit, too, what we <lb/>
            commend and admire is, that a man has for the time being <lb/>
            forgotten his own interests, in order that he may do good <lb/>
            to another; that he has deprived himself of something, in <lb/>
            order to bestow it upon another. Now, he who bestows a <lb/>
            benefit upon himself does not do this. The bestowal of a <lb/>
            benefit is an act of companionship-it wins some man's <lb/>
            friendship, and lays some man under an obligation; but <lb/>
            to bestow it upon oneself is no act of companionship-it <lb/>
            wins no man's friendship, lays no man under an obliga­ <lb/>
            tion, raises no man's hopes, or leads him to say, "This man <lb/>
            must be courted ; he bestowed a benefit upon that person, <lb/>
            perhaps he will bestow one upon me also." A benefit is a thing <lb/>
            which one gives not for one's own sake, but for the sake of <pb n="137"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XII.] </note><lb/>
            him to whom it is given; but he who bestows a benefit upon <lb/>
            himself, does so for his own sake; therefore, it is not a benefit.</p>
          <p>XII. Now I seem to you not to have made good what I <lb/>
            said at the beginning of this book. You say that I am far <lb/>
            from doing what is worth any one's while; nay, that in real <lb/>
            fact I have thrown away all my trouble. Wait, and soon <lb/>
            you will be able to say this more truly, for I shall lead <lb/>
            you into covert lurking-places, from which when you <lb/>
            have escaped, you will have gained nothing except <lb/>
            that you will have freed yourself from difficulties with <lb/>
            which you need never have hampered yourself. What is <lb/>
            the use of laboriously untying knots which you yourself <lb/>
            have tied, in order that you might untie them ? Yet, just <lb/>
            as some knots are tied in fun and for amusement, so <lb/>
            that a tyro may find difficulty in untying them, which <lb/>
            knots he who tied them can loose without any trouble, <lb/>
            because he knows the joinings and the difficulties of them, <lb/>
            and these nevertheless afford us some pleasure, because <lb/>
            they test the sharpness of our wits, and engross our atten­ <lb/>
            tion ; so also these questions, which seem subtle and tricky, <lb/>
            prevent our intellects becoming careless and lazy, for they <lb/>
            ought at one time to have a field given them to level, in <lb/>
            order that they may wander about it, and at another to <lb/>
            have some dark and rough passage thrown in their way for <lb/>
            them to creep through, and make their way with caution. <lb/>
            It is said by our opponent that no one is ungrateful; and <lb/>
            this is supported by the following arguments: " A benefit <lb/>
            is that which does good; but, as you Stoics say, no one can <lb/>
            do good to a bad man ; therefore, a, bad man does not re­ <lb/>
            ceive a benefit. (If he does not receive it, he need not <lb/>
            return it; therefore, no bad man is ungrateful.) Further­ <lb/>
            more, a benefit is an honourable and commendable thing. <lb/>
            No honourable or commendable thing can find any place <lb/>
            with a bad man; therefore, neither can a benefit. If <lb/>
            he cannot receive one, he need not repay one; therefore, he <pb n="138"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. V.</note><lb/>
            does not become ungrateful. Moreover, as you say, a good <lb/>
            man does everything rightly; if he does everything rightly, <lb/>
            he cannot be ungrateful. A good man returns a benefit, a <lb/>
            bad man does not receive one. If this be so, no man, good <lb/>
            or bad, can be ungrateful. Therefore, there is no such <lb/>
            thing in nature as an ungrateful man : the word is mean­ <lb/>
            ingless." We Stoics have only one kind of good, that which <lb/>
            is honourable. This cannot come to a bad man, for he <lb/>
            would cease to be bad if virtue entered into him ; but as <lb/>
            long as he is bad, no one can bestow a benefit upon him, <lb/>
            because good and bad are contraries, and cannot exist <lb/>
            together. Therefore, no one can do good to such a man, <lb/>
            because whatever he receives is corrupted by his vicious <lb/>
            way of using it. Just as the stomach, when disordered by <lb/>
            disease and secreting bile, changes all the food which it <lb/>
            receives, and turns every kind of sustenance into a source <lb/>
            of pain, so whatever you entrust to an ill-regulated mind <lb/>
            becomes to it a burden, an annoyance, and a source of <lb/>
            misery. Thus the most prosperous and the richest men <lb/>
            have the most trouble; and the more property they have <lb/>
            to perplex them, the less likely they are to find out what <lb/>
            they really are. Nothing, therefore, can reach bad men <lb/>
            which would do them good; nay, nothing which would not <lb/>
            do them harm. They change whatever falls to their lot <lb/>
            into their own evil nature; and things which elsewhere <lb/>
            would, if given to better men, be both beautiful and pro­ <lb/>
            stable, are ruinous to them. They cannot, therefore, <lb/>
            bestow benefits, because no one can give what he does not <lb/>
            possess, and, therefore, they lack the pleasure of doing <lb/>
            good to others.</p>
          <p>XIII. But, though this be so, yet even a bad man can <lb/>
            receive some things which resemble benefits, and he will be <lb/>
            ungrateful if he does not return them. There are good <lb/>
            things belonging to the mind, to the body, and to fortune. <lb/>
            A fool or a bad man is debarred from the first—those, <pb n="139"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XIV.] </note><lb/>
            that is, of the mind; but he is admitted to a share in the <lb/>
            two latter, and, if he does not return them, he is ungrate­ <lb/>
            ful. Nor does this follow from our (Stoic) system alone <lb/>
            the Peripatetics, also, who widely extend the boundaries of <lb/>
            human happiness, declare that trifling benefits reach bad <lb/>
            men, and that he who does not return them is ungrateful. <lb/>
            We therefore do not agree that things which do not tend <lb/>
            to improve the mind should be called benefits, yet do not <lb/>
            deny that these things are convenient and desirable. Such <lb/>
            things as these a bad man may bestow upon a good man, <lb/>
            or may receive from him-such, for example, as money, <lb/>
            clothes, public office, or life; and, if he makes no return <lb/>
            for these, he will come under the denomination of un­ <lb/>
            grateful. " But how can you call a man ungrateful for <lb/>
            not returning that which you say is not a benefit ? " Some <lb/>
            things, on account of their similarity, are included under <lb/>
            the same designation, although they do not really deserve <lb/>
            it. Thus we speak of a silver or golden box; 1 thus we call <lb/>
            a man illiterate, although he may not be utterly ignorant, <lb/>
            but only not acquainted with the higher branches of litera­ <lb/>
            ture ; thus, seeing a badly-dressed ragged man we say that <lb/>
            we have seen a naked man. These things of which we <lb/>
            spoke are not benefits, but they possess the appearance of <lb/>
            benefits. 11 Then, just as they are quasi-benefits, so your <lb/>
            man is quasi-ungrateful, not really ungrateful." This is <lb/>
            untrue, because both he who gives and he who receives <lb/>
            them speaks of them as benefits; so he who fails to return <lb/>
            the semblance of a real benefit is as much an ungrateful <lb/>
            man as he who mixes a sleeping draught, believing it to be <lb/>
            poison, is a poisoner.</p>
          <p>XIV. Cleanthes speaks more impetuously than this. <lb/>
            “ Granted," says he, ‛ ‛ that what he received was not a <lb/>
            benefit, yet he is ungrateful, because he would not have <note type="footnote"> 1 " The original word is I pyx,’ which means a box made of box­ <lb/>
            wood." </note> <pb n="140"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. V.</note><lb/>
            returned a benefit if he had received one." So he who <lb/>
            carries deadly weapons and has intentions of robbing and <lb/>
            murdering, is a brigand even before he has dipped his <lb/>
            hands in blood; his wickedness consists and is shown in <lb/>
            action, but does not begin thereby. Men are punished for <lb/>
            sacrilege, although no one's hands can reach to the gods. <lb/>
            "How," asks our opponent, "can any one be ungrateful <lb/>
            to a bad man, since a bad man cannot bestow a bene­ <lb/>
            fit?" In the same way, I answer, because that which <lb/>
            he received was not a benefit, but was called one; if any <lb/>
            one receives from a bad man any of those things which are <lb/>
            valued by the ignorant, and of which bad men often <lb/>
            possess great store, it becomes his duty to make a return <lb/>
            in the same kind, and to give back as though they were <lb/>
            truly good those things which he received as though they <lb/>
            were truly good. A man is said to be in debt, whether he <lb/>
            owes gold pieces or leather marked with a state stamp, <lb/>
            such as the Lacedaemonians used, which passes for coined <lb/>
            money. Pay your debts in that kind in which you incurred <lb/>
            them. You have nothing to do with the definition of <lb/>
            benefits, or with the question whether so great and noble a <lb/>
            name ought to be degraded by applying it to such vulgar <lb/>
            and mean matters as these, nor do we seek for truth that <lb/>
            we may use it to the disadvantage of others; do you adjust <lb/>
            your minds to the semblance of truth, and while you are <lb/>
            learning what is really honourable, respect everything to <lb/>
            which the name of honour is applied.</p>
          <p>XV. 11 In the same way," argues our adversary, " that <lb/>
            your school proves that no one is ungrateful, you afterwards <lb/>
            prove that all men are ungrateful. For, as you say, all <lb/>
            fools are bad men; he who has one vice has all vices ; all <lb/>
            men are both fools and bad men; therefore all men are <lb/>
            ungrateful." Well, what then? Are they not? Is not <lb/>
            this the universal reproach of the human race ? is there <lb/>
            not a general complaint that benefits are thrown away, and <pb n="141"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XV.] </note><lb/>
            that there are very few men who do not requite their <lb/>
            benefactors with the basest ingratitude? Nor need you <lb/>
            suppose that what we say is merely the grumbling of men <lb/>
            who think every act wicked and depraved which falls short <lb/>
            of an ideal standard of righteousness. Listen! I know <lb/>
            not who it is who speaks, yet the voice with which he con­ <lb/>
            demns mankind proceeds, not from the schools of philo­ <lb/>
            sophers, but from the midst of the crowd: <lb/>
            " Host is not safe from guest; <lb/>
            Father-in-law from son ; but seldom love <lb/>
            Exists 'twixt brothers; wives long to destroy <lb/>
            Their husbands ; husbands long to slay their wives." <lb/>
            This goes even further: according to this, crimes take the <lb/>
            place of benefits, and men do not shrink from shedding <lb/>
            the blood of those for whom they ought to shed their own; <lb/>
            we requite benefits by steel and poison. We call laying <lb/>
            violent hands upon our own country, and putting down its <lb/>
            resistance by the fasces of its own lictors, gaining power <lb/>
            and great place; every man thinks himself to be in a <lb/>
            mean and degr aded position if he has not raised himself <lb/>
            above the cons titution; the armies which are received from <lb/>
            the state are turned against her, and a general now says to <lb/>
            his men, " Fight against your wives, fight against your <lb/>
            children, march in arms against your altars, your hearths <lb/>
            and homes!" Yes,1 you, who even when about to triumph <lb/>
            ought not to enter the city at the command of the senate, <lb/>
            and who have often, when bringing home a victorious army, <lb/>
            been given an audience outside the walls, you now, after <lb/>
            slaughtering your countrymen, stained with the blood of <lb/>
            your kindred, march into the city with standards erect. <lb/>
            " Let liberty," say you, " be silent amidst the ensigns of <lb/>
            war, and now that wars are driven far away and no ground <note type="footnote"> 1 I believe, in spite of Gertz, that this is part of the speech of the <lb/>
            Roman general, and that the conjecture of Muretus, " without the com­ <lb/>

             <note type="margin">[BK. V.</note><lb/>
            for terror remains, let that people which conquered and <lb/>
            civilized all nations be beleaguered within its own walls, <lb/>
            and shudder at the sight of its own eagles."</p>
          <p>XVI. Coriolanus was ungrateful, and became dutiful <lb/>
            late, and after repenting of his crime; he did indeed lay <lb/>
            down his arms, but only in the midst of his unnatural <lb/>
            warfare. Catilina Was ungrateful; he was not satisfied <lb/>
            with taking his country captive without overturning it, <lb/>
            without despatching the hosts of the Allobroges against it, <lb/>
            without bringing an enemy from beyond the Alps to glut <lb/>
            his old inborn hatred, and to offer Roman generals as <lb/>
            sacrifices which had been long owing to the tombs of the <lb/>
            Gaulish dead. Caius Marius was ungrateful, when, after <lb/>
            being raised from the ranks to the consulship, he felt that <lb/>
            he would not have wreaked his vengeance upon fortune, <lb/>
            and would sink to his original obscurity, unless he slaugh­ <lb/>
            tered Romans as freely as he had slaughtered the Cimbri, <lb/>
            and not merely gave the signal, but was himself the <lb/>
            signal for civil disasters and butcheries. Lucius Sulla was <lb/>
            ungrateful, for he saved his country by using remedies <lb/>
            worse than the perils with which it was threatened, when <lb/>
            he marched through human blood all the way from the <lb/>
            citadel of Praeneste to the Colline Gate, fought more <lb/>
            battles and caused more slaughter afterwards within the city, <lb/>
            and most cruelly after the victory was won, most wickedly <lb/>
            after quarter had been promised them, drove two legions <lb/>
            into a corner and put them to the sword, and, great gods! <lb/>
            invented a proscription by which he who slew a Roman <lb/>
            citizen received indemnity, a sum of money, everything but <lb/>
            a civic crown ! Cnaeus Pompeius was ungrateful, for the <lb/>
            return which he made to his country for three consulships, <lb/>
            three triumphs, and the innumerable public offices into <lb/>
            most of which he thrust himself when under age, was to <lb/>
            lead others also to lay hands upon her under the pretext <lb/>
            of thus rendering his own power less odious; as though <pb n="143"/>
            <note type="margin">CH. XVI.] </note> what no one ought to do became right if more than one <lb/>
            person did it. Whilst he was coveting extraordinary <lb/>
            commands, arranging the provinces so as to have his own <lb/>
            choice of them, and dividing the whole state with a third <lb/>
            persona in such a manner as to leave two-thirds of it in the <lb/>
            possession of his own family,2 he reduced the Roman people <lb/>
            to such a condition that they could only save themselves by <lb/>
            submitting to slavery. The foe and conqueror 3 of Pompeius <lb/>
            was himself ungrateful; he brought war from Gaul and <lb/>
            Germany to Rome, and he, the friend of the populace, the <lb/>
            champion of the commons, pitched his camp in the Circus <lb/>
            Flaminius, nearer to the city than Porsena's camp had <lb/>
            been. He did, indeed, use the cruel privileges of victory <lb/>
            with moderation; as was said at the time, he protected his <lb/>
            countrymen, and put to death no man who was not in <lb/>
            arms. Yet what credit is there in this ? Others used their <lb/>
            arms more cruelly, but flung them away when glutted <lb/>
            with blood, while he, though he soon sheathed the sword, <lb/>
            never laid it aside. Antonius was ungrateful to his dic­ <lb/>
            tator, who he declared was rightly slain, and whose mur­ <lb/>
            derers he allowed to depart to their commands in the <lb/>
            provinces ; as for his country, after it had been torn to <lb/>
            pieces by so many proscriptions, invasions, and civil wars, <lb/>
            he intended to subject it to kings, not even of Roman <lb/>
            birth, and to force that very state to pay tribute to <lb/>
            eunuchs,4 which had itself restored sovereign rights, auto­ <lb/>
            nomy, and immunities, to the Achaeans, the Rhodians, and <lb/>
            the people of many other famous cities. <note type="footnote"> 1 Crassus. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Pompey was married to Caesar's daughter. Cf. Virg., " Aen.," vi., <lb/>

            enumerate those who have pushed their ingratitude so far <lb/>
            as to ruin their native land. It would be as vast a task to <lb/>
            mention how often the state has been ungrateful to its best <lb/>
            and most devoted lovers, although it has done no less wrong <lb/>
            than it has suffered. It sent Camillus and Scipio into <lb/>

            to Cato the Roman people refused the praetorship, and <lb/>
            persisted in refusing the consulship. We are ungrateful in <lb/>
            public matters; and if every man asks himself, you will find <lb/>
            that there is no one who has not some private ingratitude <lb/>
            to complain of. Yet it is impossible that all men should <lb/>
            complain, unless all were deserving of complaint, therefore <lb/>
            all men are ungrateful. Are they ungrateful alone ? nay, <lb/>
            they are also all covetous, all spiteful, and all cowardly, <lb/>
            especially those who appear daring; and, besides this, all <lb/>
            men fawn upon the great, and all are impious. Yet you <lb/>
            need not be angry with them; pardon them, for they are <lb/>
            all mad. I do not wish to recall you to what is not proved, <lb/>
            or to say,“ See how ungrateful is youth! what young man, <lb/>
            even if of innocent life, does not long for his father's <lb/>
            death ? even if moderate in his desires, does not look for­ <lb/>
            ward to it? even if dutiful, does not think about it? How <lb/>
            few there are who fear the death even of the best of wives, <lb/>
            who do not even calculate the probabilities of it. Pray, <lb/>
            what litigant, after having been successfully defended, re­ <lb/>
            tains any remembrance of so great a benefit for more than <lb/>
            a few days ? " All agree that no one dies without com­ <lb/>
            plaining. Who on his last day dares to say, <lb/>
            “I've lived, I've done the task which Fortune set me." <lb/>
            Who does not leave the world with reluctance, and with <pb n="145"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XVIII.] </note><lb/>
            lamentations ? Yet it is the part of an ungrateful man not <lb/>
            to be satisfied with the past. Your days will always be <lb/>
            few if you count them. Reflect that length of time is not <lb/>
            the greatest of blessings : make the best of your time, how­ <lb/>
            ever short it may be; even if the day of your death be <lb/>
            postponed, your happiness will not be increased, for life is <lb/>
            merely made longer, not pleasanter, by delay. How much <lb/>
            better is it to be thankful for the pleasures which one has <lb/>
            received, not to reckon up the years of others, but to set a <lb/>
            high value upon one's own, and score them to one's credit, <lb/>
            saying, " God thought me worthy of this; I am satisfied <lb/>
            with it; he might have given me more, but this, too, is a <lb/>
            benefit." Let us be grateful towards both gods and men, <lb/>
            grateful to those who have given us anything, and grateful <lb/>
            even to those who have given anything to our relatives.</p>
          <p>XVIII. "You render me liable to an infinite debt of <lb/>
            gratitude," says our opponent, " when you say ' even to <lb/>
            those who have given any thing to our relations,' so fix some <lb/>
            limit. He who bestows a benefit upon the son, according <lb/>
            to you, bestows it likewise upon the father: this is the <lb/>
            first question I wish to raise. In the next place I should <lb/>
            like to have a clear definition of whether a benefit, if it be <lb/>
            bestowed upon your friend's father as well as upon him­ <lb/>
            self, is bestowed also upon his brother ? or upon his uncle ? <lb/>
            or his grandfather? or his wife and his father-in-law? <lb/>
            tell me where I am to stop, how far I am to follow out the <lb/>
            pedigree of the family ? "</p>
          <p>SENECA. If I cultivate your land, I bestow a benefit <lb/>
            upon you; if I extinguish your house when burning, or <lb/>
            prop it so as to save it from falling, I shall bestow a benefit <lb/>
            upon you; if I heal your slave, I shall charge it to you; if <lb/>
            I save your son's life, will you not thereby receive a benefit <lb/>
            from me ?</p>
          <p>XIX. THE ADVERSARY. Your instances are not to the <lb/>
            purpose, for he who cultivates my land, does not benefit <note type="footnote"> it </note> <pb n="146"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. V.</note><lb/>
            the land, but me ; he who props my house so that it does <lb/>
            not fall, does this service to me, for the house itself is <lb/>
            without feeling, and as it has none, it is I who am in­ <lb/>
            debted to him; and he who cultivates my land does so <lb/>
            because he wishes to oblige me, not to oblige the land. I <lb/>
            should say the same of a slave; he is a chattel owned by. <lb/>
            me; he is saved for my advantage, therefore I am indebted <lb/>
            for him. My son is himself capable of receiving a bene­ <lb/>
            fit; so it is he who receives it; I am gratified at a benefit <lb/>
            which comes so near to myself, but am not laid under any <lb/>
            obligation.</p>
          <p>SEe Still I should like you, who say that you are under no <lb/>
            obligation, to answer me this. The good health, the happi­ <lb/>
            piness, and the inheritance of a son are connected with his <lb/>
            father; his father will be more happy if he keeps his son <lb/>
            safe, and more unhappy if he loses him. What follows, <lb/>
            then? when a man is made happier by me and is freed <lb/>
            from the greatest danger of unhappiness, does he not re­ <lb/>
            ceive a benefit ?</p>
          <p>AD. No, because there are some things which are be­ <lb/>
            stowed upon others, and yet flow from them so as to reach <lb/>
            ourselves; yet we must ask the person upon whom it was <lb/>
            bestowed for repayment; as for example, money, must be <lb/>
            sought from the man to whom it was lent, although it <lb/>
            may, by some means, have come into my hands. There is <lb/>
            no benefit whose advantages do not extend to the receiver's <lb/>
            nearest friends, and sometimes even to those less intimately <lb/>
            connected with him; yet we do not enquire whither the <lb/>
            benefit has proceeded from him to whom it was first given, <lb/>
            but where it was first placed. You must demand repay­ <lb/>
            ment from the defendant himself personally.</p>
          <p>SEe Well, but I pray you, do you not say, " you have <lb/>
            preserved my son for me; had he perished, I could not <lb/>
            have survived him ? " Do you not owe a benefit for the life <lb/>
            of one whose safety you value above your own ? Moreover, <pb n="147"/>
             <note type="margin">XH. XIX.] </note><lb/>
            should I save your son's life, you would fall down before <lb/>
            my knees, and would pay vows to heaven as though you <lb/>
            yourself had been saved; you would say, “ It makes no <lb/>
            difference whether you have saved mine or me ; you have <lb/>
            saved us both, yet me more than him." Why do you <lb/>
            say this, if you do not receive a benefit ?</p>
          <p>AD. Because, if my son were to contract a loan, I should <lb/>
            pay his creditor, yet I should not, therefore, be indebted to <lb/>
            him; or if my son were taken in adultery, I should blush, <lb/>
            yet I should not, therefore, be an adulterer. I say that I <lb/>
            am under an obligation to you for saving my son, not be­ <lb/>
            cause I really am, but because I am willing to constitute <lb/>
            myself your debtor of my own free will. On the other <lb/>
            hand I have derived from his safety the greatest possible <lb/>
            pleasure and advantage, and I have escaped that most <lb/>
            dreadful blow, the loss of my child. True, but we are not <lb/>
            now discussing whether you have done me any good or <lb/>
            not, but whether you have bestowed a benefit upon me; <lb/>
            for animals, stones, and herbs can do one good, but do not <lb/>
            bestow benefits, which can only be given by one who wishes <lb/>
            well to the receiver. Now you do not wish well to the <lb/>
            father, but only to the son; and sometimes you do not <lb/>
            even know the father. So when you have said, "Have I <lb/>
            not bestowed a benefit upon the father by saving the son?" <lb/>
            you ought to meet this with, " Have I, then, bestowed a <lb/>
            benefit upon a father whom I do not know, whom I never <lb/>
            thought of ? " And what will you say when, as is some­ <lb/>
            times the case, you hate the father, and yet save his son ? <lb/>
            Can you be thought to have bestowed a benefit upon one <lb/>
            whom you hated most bitterly while you were bestowing <lb/>
            it ?</p>
          <p>However, if I were to lay aside the bickering of dia­ <lb/>
            logue, and answer you as a lawyer, I should say that you <lb/>
            ought to consider the intention of the giver, you must <lb/>
            regard his benefit as bestowed upon the person upon whom <pb n="148"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. V.</note><lb/>
            he meant to bestow it. If he did it in honour of the father, <lb/>
            then the father received the benefit; if he thought only of <lb/>
            the son, then the father is not laid under any obligation by <lb/>
            the benefit which was conferred upon the son, even though <lb/>
            the father derives pleasure from it. Should he, however, <lb/>
            have an. opportunity, he will himself wish to give you <lb/>
            something, yet not as though he were forced to repay a <lb/>
            debt, but rather as if he had grounds for beginning an <lb/>
            exchange of favours. No return for a benefit ought to <lb/>
            be demanded from the father of the receiver; if he does <lb/>
            you any kindness in return for it, he should be regarded as <lb/>
            a righteous man, but not as a grateful one. For there is <lb/>
            no end to it; if I bestow a benefit on the receiver's father, <lb/>
            do I likewise bestow it upon his mother, his grandfather, <lb/>
            his maternal uncle, his children, relations, friends, slaves, <lb/>
            and country ? Where, then, does a benefit begin to stop ? <lb/>
            for there follows it this endless chain of people, to whom <lb/>
            it is hard to assign bounds, because they join it by degrees, <lb/>
            and are always creeping on towards it.</p>
          <p>XX. A common question is, " Two brothers are at <lb/>
            variance. If I save the life of one, do I confer a benefit <lb/>
            upon the other, who will be sorry that his hated brother <lb/>
            did not perish?" There can be no doubt that it is a <lb/>
            benefit to do good to a man, even against that man's will, <lb/>
            just as he, who against his own will does a man good, does <lb/>
            not bestow a benefit upon him. " Do you," asks our adver­ <lb/>
            sary, "call that by which he is displeased and hurt a <lb/>
            benefit ? " Yes ; many benefits have a harsh and forbidding <lb/>
            appearance, such as cutting or burning to cure disease, or <lb/>
            confining with chains. We must not consider whether a <lb/>
            man is grieved at receiving a benefit, but whether he ought <lb/>
            to rejoice: a coin is not bad because it is refused by a <lb/>
            savage who is unacquainted with its proper stamp. A man <lb/>
            receives a benefit even though he hates what is done, pro­ <lb/>
            vided that it does him good, and that the giver bestowed it <pb n="149"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XX.]</note><lb/>
            in order to do him good. It makes no difference if he <lb/>
            receives a good thing in a bad spirit. Consider the con­ <lb/>
            verse of this. Suppose that a man hates his brother, <lb/>
            though it is to his advantage to have a brother, and I kill <lb/>
            this brother, this is not a benefit, though he may say that <lb/>
            it is, and be glad of it. Our most artful enemies are those <lb/>
            whom we thank for the wrongs which they do us.</p>
          <p>" I understand; a thing which does good is a benefit, a <lb/>
            thing which does harm is not a benefit. Now I will suggest <lb/>
            to you an act which neither does good nor harm, and yet <lb/>
            is a benefit. Suppose that I find the corpse of some one's <lb/>
            father in a wilderness, and bury it, then I certainly have <lb/>
            done him no good, for what difference could it make to <lb/>
            him in what manner his body decayed ? Nor have I done <lb/>
            any good to his son, for what advantage does he gain by <lb/>
            my act ? " I will tell you what he gains. He has by my <lb/>
            means performed a solemn and necessary rite; I have per­ <lb/>
            formed a service for his father which he would have <lb/>
            wished, nay, which it would have been his duty to have <lb/>
            performed himself. Yet this act is not a benefit, if I <lb/>
            merely yielded to those feelings of pity and kindliness <lb/>
            which would make me bury any corpse whatever, but only <lb/>
            if I recognized this body, and buried it, with the thought <lb/>
            in my mind that I was doing this service to the son; but, <lb/>
            by merely throwing earth over a dead stranger, I lay no <lb/>
            one under an obligation for an act performed on general <lb/>
            principles of humanity.</p>
          <p>It may be asked, " Why are you so careful in inquiring <lb/>
            upon whom you bestow benefits, as though some day you <lb/>
            meant to demand repayment of them ? Some say that re­ <lb/>
            payment should never be demanded; and they give the <lb/>
            following reasons. An unworthy man will not repay the <lb/>
            benefit which he has received, even if it be demanded of <lb/>
            him, while a worthy man will do so of his own accord. <lb/>
            Consequently, if you have bestowed it upon a good man, <pb n="150"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. V.</note><lb/>
            wait; do not outrage him by asking him for it, as though <lb/>
            of his own accord he never would repay it. If you have <lb/>
            bestowed it upon a bad man, suffer for it, but do not spoil <lb/>
            your benefit by turning it into a loan. Moreover the law, <lb/>
            by not authorizing you, forbids you, by implication, to de­ <lb/>
            mand the repayment of a benefit." All this is nonsense. <lb/>
            As long as I am in no pressing need, as long as I am not <lb/>
            forced by poverty, I will lose my benefits rather than ask <lb/>
            for repayment; but if the lives of my children were at <lb/>
            stake, if my wife were in danger, if my regard for the wel­ <lb/>
            fare of my country and for my own liberty were to force <lb/>
            me to adopt a course which I disliked, I should overcome <lb/>
            my delicacy, and openly declare that I had done all that <lb/>
            I could to avoid the necessity of receiving help from an <lb/>
            ungrateful man; the necessity of obtaining repayment of <lb/>
            one's benefit will in the end overcome one's delicacy about <lb/>
            asking for it. In the next place, when I bestow a benefit <lb/>
            upon a good man, I do so with the intention of never de­ <lb/>
            manding repayment, except in case of absolute necessity.</p>
          <p>XXI. " But," argues he, " by not authorizing you, the <lb/>
            law forbids you to exact repayment." There are many <lb/>
            things which are not enforced by any law or process, but <lb/>
            which the conventions of society, which are stronger than <lb/>
            any law, compel us to observe. There is no law forbidding <lb/>
            us to divulge our friend's secrets; there is no law which <lb/>
            bids us keep faith even with an enemy; pray what law is <lb/>
            there which binds us to stand by what we have promised <lb/>
            There is none. Nevertheless I should remonstrate with one <lb/>
            who did not keep a secret, and I should be indignant with <lb/>
            one who pledged his word and broke it. " But," he argues, <lb/>
            "you are turning a benefit into a loan." By no means, <lb/>
            for I do not insist upon repayment, but only demand it; <lb/>
            nay, I do not even demand it, but remind my friend of it. <lb/>
            Even the direst need will not bring me to apply for help to <lb/>
            one with whom I should have to undergo a long struggle. <pb n="151"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXII.] </note><lb/>
            If there be any one so ungrateful that it is not sufficient to <lb/>
            remind him of his debt, I should pass him over, and think <lb/>
            that he did not deserve to be made grateful by force. A <lb/>
            money-lender does not demand repayment from his debtors <lb/>
            if he knows they have become bankrupt, and, to their <lb/>
            shame, have nothing but shame left to lose; and I, like <lb/>
            him, should pass over those who are openly and obstinately <lb/>
            ungrateful, and would demand repayment only from those <lb/>
            who were likely to give it me, not from those from whom I <lb/>
            should have to extort it by force.</p>
          <p>XXIT. There are many who cannot deny that they have <lb/>
            received a benefit, yet cannot return it—men who are not <lb/>
            good enough to be termed grateful, nor yet bad enough <lb/>
            to be termed ungrateful; but who are dull and sluggish, <lb/>
            backward debtors, though not defaulters. Such men as <lb/>
            these I should not ask for repayment, but forcibly remind <lb/>
            them of it, and, from a state of indifference, bring them <lb/>
            back to their duty. They would at once reply, "For­ <lb/>
            give me; I did not know, by Hercules, that you missed <lb/>
            this, or I would have offered it of my own accord. I <lb/>
            beg that you will not think me ungrateful; I remember <lb/>
            your goodness to me." Why need I hesitate to make <lb/>
            such men as these better to themselves and to me ? I <lb/>
            would prevent any one from doing wrong, if I were able; <lb/>
            much more would I prevent a friend, both lest he should <lb/>
            do wrong, and lest he should do wrong to me in particular. <lb/>
            I bestow a second benefit upon him by not permitting him <lb/>
            to be ungrateful; and I should not reproach him harshly <lb/>
            with what I had done for him, but should speak as gently <lb/>
            as I could. In order to afford him an opportunity of re­ <lb/>
            turning my kindness, I should refresh his remembrance of it, <lb/>
            and ask for a benefit: he would understand that I was ask­ <lb/>
            ing for repayment. Sometimes I would make use of some­ <lb/>
            what severe language, if I had any hope that by it he <lb/>
            might be amended; though I would not irritate a hope­ <pb n="152"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. V.</note><lb/>
            lessly ungrateful man, for fear that I might turn him into <lb/>
            an enemy. If we spare the ungrateful even the affront of <lb/>
            reminding them of their conduct, we shall render them <lb/>
            more backward in returning benefits; and although some <lb/>
            might be cured of their evil ways, and be made into good <lb/>
            men, if their consciences were stung by remorse, yet we <lb/>
            shall allow them to perish for want of a word of warning, <lb/>
            with which a father sometimes corrects his son, a wife <lb/>
            brings back to herself an erring husband, or a man stimu­ <lb/>
            lates the wavering fidelity of his friend.</p>
          <p>XXIII. To awaken some men, it is only necessary to stir <lb/>
            them, not to strike them ; in like manner, with some men, <lb/>
            the feeling of honour about returning a benefit is not <lb/>
            extinct, but slumbering. Let us rouse it. “ Do not," they <lb/>
            will say, " make the kindness you have done me into a <lb/>
            wrong: for it is a wrong, if you do not demand some <lb/>
            return from me, and so make me ungrateful. What if I <lb/>
            do not know what sort of repayment you wish for ? if I am <lb/>
            so occupied by business, and my attention is so much <lb/>
            diverted to other subjects that I have not been able to <lb/>
            watch for an opportunity of serving you ? Point out to me <lb/>
            what I can do for you, what you wish me to do. Why do. <lb/>
            you despair, before making a trial of me ? Why are you <lb/>
            in such haste to lose both your benefit and your friend ? <lb/>
            How can you tell whether I do not wish, or whether I do <lb/>
            not know how to repay you : whether it be in intention or <lb/>
            in opportunity that I am wanting ? Make a trial of me." <lb/>
            I would therefore remind him of what I had done, without <lb/>
            bitterness, not in public, or in a reproachful manner, but <lb/>
            so that he may think that he himself has remembered it <lb/>
            rather than that it has been recalled to him.</p>
          <p>XXIV. One of Julius Caesar's veterans was once plead­ <lb/>
            ing before him against his neighbours, and the cause was <lb/>
            going against him. "Do you remember, general," said he, <lb/>
            " that in Spain you dislocated your ankle near the river <pb n="153"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXV.] </note><lb/>
            Sucro ? " 1 When Caesar said that he remembered it, he <lb/>
            continued, " Do you remember that when, during the ex­ <lb/>
            cessive heat, you wished to rest under a tree which afforded <lb/>
            very little shade, as the ground in which that solitary tree <lb/>
            grew was rough and rocky, one of your comrades spread <lb/>
            his cloak under you ? " Caesar answered, " Of course, I <lb/>
            remember; indeed, I was perishing with thirst; and since <lb/>
            I was unable to walk to the nearest spring, I would have <lb/>
            crawled thither on my hands and knees, had not my com­ <lb/>
            rade, a brave and active man, brought me water in his <lb/>
            helmet." " Could you, then, my general, recognize that <lb/>
            man or that helmet ? " Caesar replied that he could not <lb/>
            remember the helmet, but that he could remember the <lb/>
            man well; and he added, I fancy in anger at being led <lb/>
            away to this old story in the midst of a judicial enquiry, <lb/>
            11 At any rate, you are not he." " I do not blame you, <lb/>
            Caesar," answered the man, “ for not recognizing me; for <lb/>
            when this took place, I was unwounded; but afterwards, <lb/>
            at the battle of Munda, my eye was struck out, and the <lb/>
            bones of my skull crushed. Nor would you recognize that <lb/>
            helmet if you saw it, for it was split by a Spanish sword." <lb/>
            Caesar would not permit this man to be troubled with law­ <lb/>
            suits, and presented his old soldier with the fields through <lb/>
            which a village right of way had given rise to the dispute.</p>
          <p>XXV. In this case, what ought he to have done ? Be­ <lb/>
            cause his commander's memory was confused by a multi­ <lb/>
            tude of incidents, and because his position as the leader of <lb/>
            vast armies did not permit him to notice individual sol­ <lb/>
            diers, ought the man not to have asked for a return for the <lb/>
            benefit which he had conferred ? To act as he did is not so <lb/>
            much to ask for a return as to take it when it lies in a con­ <lb/>
            venient position ready for us, although we have to stretch <lb/>
            out our hands in order to receive it. I shall therefore ask <lb/>
            for the return of a benefit, whenever I am either reduced <note type="footnote">I Xucar. </note> <pb n="154"/>
            <note type="margin">[BK. V.</note><lb/>
            to great straits, or where by doing so I shall act to the ad­ <lb/>
            vantage of him from whom I ask it. Tiberius Caesar, <lb/>
            when some one addressed him with the words, " Do you <lb/>
            remember . . . . ? ” answered, before the man could men­ <lb/>
            tion any further proofs of former acquaintance, 11 I do not <lb/>
            remember what I was." Why should it not be forbidden <lb/>
            to demand of this man repayment of former favours ? He <lb/>
            had a motive for forgetting them: he denied all knowledge <lb/>
            of his friends and comrades, and wished men only to see, to <lb/>
            think, and to speak of him as emperor. He regarded his old <lb/>
            friend as an impertinent meddler.</p>
          <p>We ought to be even more careful to choose a favorable <lb/>
            opportunity when we ask for a benefit to be repaid to us <lb/>
            than when we ask for one to be bestowed upon us. We <lb/>
            must be temperate in our language, so that the grateful may <lb/>
            not take offence, or the ungrateful pretend to do so. If we <lb/>
            lived among wise men, it would be our duty to wait in <lb/>
            silence until our benefits were returned. Yet even to wise <lb/>
            men it would be better to give some hint of what our <lb/>
            position required. We ask for help even from the gods <lb/>
            themselves, from whose knowledge nothing is hid, although <lb/>
            our prayers cannot alter their intentions towards us, but <lb/>
            can only recall them to their minds. Homer's priest,1 I <lb/>
            say, recounts even to the gods his duteous conduct and his <lb/>
            pious care of their altars. The second best form of virtue <lb/>
            is to be willing and able to take advice.2 A horse who is <lb/>
            docile and prompt to obey can be guided hither and thither <lb/>
            by the slightest movement of the reins. Very few men are <lb/>
            led by their own reason: those who come next to the <lb/>
            best are those who return to the right path in consequence <lb/>
            of advice; and these we must not deprive of their guide. <lb/>
            When our eyes are covered they still possess sight; but it is <lb/>
            the light of day which, when admitted to them, summons <lb/>
            them to perform their duty: tools lie idle, unless the work. <note type="footnote"> 1 II. i. 39 sqq. 2 Hes. Op. 291. </note> <pb n="155"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXV.] </note><lb/>
            man uses them to take part in his work. Similarly men's <lb/>
            minds contain a good feeling, which, however, lies torpid, <lb/>
            either through luxury and disuse, or through ignorance of <lb/>
            its duties. This we ought to render useful, and not to get <lb/>
            into a passion with it, and leave it in its wrong doing, but <lb/>
            bear with it patiently, just as schoolmasters bear patiently <lb/>
            with the blunders of forgetful scholars; for as by the <lb/>
            prompting of a word or two their memory is often recalled <lb/>
            to the text of the speech which they have to repeat, so <lb/>
            men's goodwill can be brought to return kindness by re­ <lb/>
            minding them of it.</p><pb n="156"/>

          <p>T <lb/>
            HERE are some things, my most excellent Liberalis, <lb/>
            which lie completely outside of our actual life, and <lb/>
            which we only inquire into in order to exercise our intel­ <lb/>
            lects, while others both give us pleasure while we are dis­ <lb/>
            covering them, and are of use when discovered. I will <lb/>
            place all these in your hands ; you, at your own discretion, <lb/>
            may order them either to be investigated thoroughly, or to <lb/>
            be reserved, and be used as agreeable interludes. Something <lb/>
            will be gained even by those which you dismiss at once, for <lb/>
            it is advantageous even to know what subjects are not <lb/>
            worth learning. I shall be guided, therefore, by your face: <lb/>
            according to its expression, I shall deal with some questions <lb/>
            at greater length, and drive others out of court, and put an <lb/>
            end to them at once.</p>
          <p>II. It is a question whether a benefit can be taken <lb/>
            away from one by force. Some say that it cannot, be­ <lb/>
            cause it is not a thing, but an act. A gift is not the same <lb/>
            as the act of giving, any more than a sailor is the same as <lb/>
            the act of sailing. A sick man and a disease are not the <lb/>
            same thing, although no one can be ill without disease; <lb/>
            and, similarly, a benefit itself is one thing, and what any <lb/>
            of us receive through a benefit is another. The benefit <lb/>
            itself is incorporeal, and never becomes invalid; but its <lb/>
            subject-matter changes owners, and passes from hand to <lb/>
            hand. So, when you take away from anyone what you <lb/>
            have given him, you take away the subject-matter only of <pb n="157"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. III.] </note><lb/>
            the benefit, not the benefit itself. Nature herself cannot <lb/>
            recall what she has given. She may cease to bestow bene­ <lb/>
            fits, but cannot take them away : a man who dies, yet has <lb/>
            lived; a man who becomes blind, nevertheless has seen. <lb/>
            She can cut off her blessings from us in the future, but she <lb/>
            cannot prevent our having enjoyed them in the past. We <lb/>
            are frequently not able to enjoy a benefit for long, but the <lb/>
            benefit is not thereby destroyed. Let Nature struggle as <lb/>
            hard as she please, she cannot give herself retrospective <lb/>
            action. A man may lose his house, his money, his pro­ <lb/>
            perty—everything to which the name of benefit can be <lb/>
            given-yet the benefit itself will remain firm and unmoved; <lb/>
            no power can prevent his benefactor's having bestowed <lb/>
            them, or his having received them.</p>
          <p>III. I think that a fine passage in Rabirius's poem, <lb/>
            where M. Antonius, seeing his fortune deserting him, <lb/>
            nothing left him except the privilege of dying, and even <lb/>
            that only on condition that he used it promptly, exclaims, <lb/>
            " What I have given, that I now possess! ” <lb/>
            How much he might have possessed, had he chosen! These <lb/>
            are riches to be depended upon, which through all the <lb/>
            turmoil of human life will remain steadfast; and the <lb/>
            greater they are, the less envy they will attract. Why are <lb/>
            you sparing of your property, as though it were your own ? <lb/>
            You are but the manager of it. All those treasures, which <lb/>
            make you swell with pride, and soar above mere mortals, <lb/>
            till you forget the weakness of your nature; all that which <lb/>
            you lock up in iron-grated treasuries, and guard in arms, <lb/>
            which you win from other men with their lives, and defend <lb/>
            at the risk of your own; for which you launch fleets to <lb/>
            dye the sea with blood, and shake the walls of cities, <lb/>
            not knowing what arrows fortune may be preparing for <lb/>
            you behind your back; to gain which you have so often <lb/>
            violated all the ties of relationship, of friendship, and of <pb n="158"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VI.</note><lb/>
            colleagueship, till the whole world lies crushed between <lb/>
            the two combatants: all these are not yours; they are a <lb/>
            kind of deposit, which is on the point of passing into other <lb/>
            hands: your enemies, or your heirs, who are little better, <lb/>
            will seize upon them. "How," do you ask, "can you make <lb/>
            them your own?" "By giving them away." Do, then, <lb/>
            what is best for your own interests, and gain a sure <lb/>
            enjoyment of them, which cannot be taken from you, <lb/>
            making them at once more certainly yours, and more <lb/>
            honorable to you. That which you esteem so highly, that <lb/>
            by which you think that you are made rich and powerful, <lb/>
            owns but the shabby title of "house," "slave," or " money; <lb/>
            but when you have given it away, it becomes a benefit.</p>
          <p>IV. " You admit," says our adversary, " that we some­ <lb/>
            times are under no obligation to him from whom we have <lb/>
            received a benefit. In that case it has been taken by force." <lb/>
            Nay, there are many things which would cause us to cease <lb/>
            to feel gratitude for a benefit, not because the benefit has <lb/>
            been taken from me, but because it has been spoiled. <lb/>
            Suppose that a man has defended me in a lawsuit, but has <lb/>
            forcibly outraged my wife; he has not taken away the <lb/>
            benefit which he conferred upon me, but by balancing it <lb/>
            with an equivalent wrong, he has set me free from my <lb/>
            debt; indeed, if he has injured me more than he had pre­ <lb/>
            viously benefited me, he not only puts an end to my <lb/>
            gratitude, but makes me free to revenge myself upon him, <lb/>
            and to complain of him, when the wrong outweighs the <lb/>
            benefit; in such a case the benefit is not taken away, but is <lb/>
            overcome. Why, are not some fathers so cruel and so wicked <lb/>
            that it is right and proper for their sons to turn away from <lb/>
            them, and disown them ? Yet, pray, have they taken away <lb/>
            the life which they gave? No, but their unnatural conduct <lb/>
            in later years has destroyed all the gratitude which was <lb/>
            due to them for their original benefit. In these cases it is <lb/>
            not a benefit itself, but the gratitude owing for a benefit <pb n="159"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. IV.] </note><lb/>
            which is taken away, and the result is, not that one does <lb/>
            not possess the benefit, but that one is not laid under any <lb/>
            obligation by it. It is as though a man were to lend me <lb/>
            money, and then burn my house down; the advantage of <lb/>
            the loan is balanced by the damage which he has caused : <lb/>
            I do not repay him, and yet I am not in his debt. In like <lb/>
            manner any one who may have acted kindly and generously <lb/>
            to me, and who afterwards has shown himself haughty, <lb/>
            insulting, and cruel, places me in just the same position <lb/>
            as though I never had received anything from him: he has <lb/>
            murdered his own benefits. Though the lease may remain <lb/>
            in force, still a man does not continue to be a tenant if his <lb/>
            landlord tramples down his crops, or cuts down his <lb/>
            orchard ; their contract is at an end, not because the land. <lb/>
            lord has received the rent which was agreed upon, but be­ <lb/>
            cause he has made it impossible that he should receive it. <lb/>
            So, too, a creditor often has to pay money to his debtor, <lb/>
            should he have taken more property from him in other <lb/>
            transactions than he claims as having lent him. The judge <lb/>
            does not sit merely to decide between debtor and creditor, <lb/>
            when he says, " You did lend the man money; but then, <lb/>
            what followed ? You have driven away his cattle, you have <lb/>
            murdered his slave, you have in your possession plate which <lb/>
            you have not paid for. After valuing what each has received, <lb/>
            I order you, who came to this court as a creditor, to leave it <lb/>
            as a debtor." In like manner a balance is struck between <lb/>
            benefits and injuries. In many cases, I repeat, a benefit is <lb/>
            not taken away from him who receives it, and yet it lays <lb/>
            him under no obligation, if the giver has repented of giving <lb/>
            it, called himself unhappy because he gave it, sighed or <lb/>
            made a wry face while he gave it; if he thought that he <lb/>
            was throwing it away rather than giving it, if he gave it to <lb/>
            please himself, or to please any one except me, the receiver; <lb/>
            if he persistently makes himself offensive by boasting of <lb/>
            what he has done, if he brags of his gift everywhere, and <pb n="160"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VI.</note><lb/>
            makes it a misery to me, then indeed the benefit remains <lb/>
            in my hands, but I owe him nothing for it, just as sums <lb/>
            of money to which a creditor has no legal right are owed <lb/>
            to him, but cannot be claimed by him.</p>
          <p>V. Though you have bestowed a benefit upon me, yet <lb/>
            you have since done me a wrong; the benefit demanded <lb/>
            gratitude, the wrong required vengeance: the result is that <lb/>
            I do not owe you gratitude, nor do you owe me compensa­ <lb/>
            tion—each is cancelled by the other. When we say, " I <lb/>
            returned him his benefit," we do not mean that we restored <lb/>
            to him the very thing which we had received, but some­ <lb/>
            thing else in its place. To return is to give back one thing <lb/>
            instead of another, because, of course, in all repayment it <lb/>
            is not the thing itself, but its equivalent which is returned. <lb/>
            We are said to have returned money even though we count <lb/>
            out gold pieces instead of silver ones, or even if no money <lb/>
            passes between us, but the transaction be effected verbally <lb/>
            by the assignment of a debt.</p>
          <p>I think I see you say, " You are wasting your time; of <lb/>
            what use is it to me to know whether what I do not owe to <lb/>
            another still remains in my hands or not? These are like <lb/>
            the ingenious subtleties of the lawyers, who declare that <lb/>
            one cannot acquire an inheritance by prescription, but can <lb/>
            only acquire those things of which the inheritance con­ <lb/>
            sists, as though there were any difference between the <lb/>
            heritage and the things of which it consists. Rather decide <lb/>
            this point for me, which may be of use. If the same man <lb/>
            confers a benefit upon me, and afterwards does me a <lb/>
            wrong, is it my duty to return the benefit to him, and <lb/>
            nevertheless to avenge myself upon him, having, as it were, <lb/>
            two distinct accounts open with him, or to mix them both <lb/>
            together, and do nothing, leaving the benefit to be wiped <lb/>
            out by the injury, the injury by the benefit? I see that <lb/>
            the former course is adopted by the law of the land; you <lb/>
            know best what the law may be among you Stoic philoso­ <pb n="161"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. VI.] </note><lb/>
            pliers in such a case. I suppose that you keep the action <lb/>
            which I bring against another distinct from that which he <lb/>
            brings against me, and the two processes are not merged <lb/>
            into one ? For instance, if a man entrusts me with money, <lb/>
            and afterwards robs me, I shall bring an action against <lb/>
            him for theft, and he will bring one against me for unlaw­ <lb/>
            fully detaining his property ? "</p>
          <p>VI. The cases which you have mentioned, my Liberalis, <lb/>
            come under well-established laws, which it is necessary for <lb/>
            us to follow. One law cannot be merged in another : each <lb/>
            one proceeds its own way. There is a particular action <lb/>
            which deals with deposits just as there is one which deals <lb/>
            with theft. A benefit is subject to no law; it depends <lb/>
            upon my own arbitration. I am at liberty to contrast the <lb/>
            amount of good or harm which any one may have done me, <lb/>
            and then to decide which of us is indebted to the <lb/>
            other. In legal processes we ourselves have no power, we <lb/>
            must go whither they lead us; in the case of a benefit the <lb/>
            supreme power is mine, I pronounce sentence. Consequently <lb/>
            I do not separate or distinguish between benefits and <lb/>
            wrongs, but send them before the same judge. Unless I <lb/>
            did so, you would bid me love and hate, give thanks and <lb/>
            make complaints at the same time, which human nature <lb/>
            does not admit of. I would rather compare the benefit and <lb/>
            the injury with one another, and see whether there were <lb/>
            any balance in my favour. If anybody puts lines of other <lb/>
            writing upon my manuscript he conceals, though he does <lb/>
            not take away, the letters which were there before, and in <lb/>
            like manner a wrong coming after a benefit does not allow <lb/>
            it to be seen.</p>
          <p>VII. Your face, by which I have agreed to be guided, <lb/>
            now becomes wrinkled with frowns, as though I were stray­ <lb/>
            ing too widely from the subject. You seem to say to me: <lb/>
            “ Why steer to seaward ? Hither bend thy course, <lb/>
            Hug close the shore . . .” <note type="footnote"> M </note> <pb n="162"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VI.</note><lb/>
            I do hug it as close as possible. So now, if you think that <lb/>
            we have dwelt sufficiently upon this point, let us proceed to <lb/>
            the consideration of the next-that is, whether we are at all <lb/>
            indebted to any one who does us good without wishing to <lb/>
            do so. I might have expressed this more clearly, if it were <lb/>
            not right that the question should be somewhat obscurely <lb/>
            stated, in order that by the distinction immediately follow­ <lb/>
            ing it may be shown that we mean to investigate the case <lb/>
            both of him who does us good against his will, and that of <lb/>
            him who does us good without knowing it. That a man <lb/>
            who does us good by acting under compulsion does not <lb/>
            thereby lay us under any obligation, is so clear, that no <lb/>
            words are needed to prove it. Both this question, and any <lb/>
            other of the like character which may be raised, can easily <lb/>
            be settled if in each case we bear in mind that, for any­ <lb/>
            thing to be a benefit, it must reach us in the first place <lb/>
            through some thought, and secondly through the thought <lb/>
            of a friend and well-wisher. Therefore we do not feel any <lb/>
            gratitude towards rivers, albeit they may bear large ships, <lb/>
            afford an ample and unvarying stream for the convey­ <lb/>
            ance of merchandise, or flow beauteously and full of fish <lb/>
            through fertile fields. No one conceives himself to be in­ <lb/>
            debted for a benefit to the Nile, any more than he would <lb/>
            owe it a grudge if its waters flooded his fields to excess, <lb/>
            and retired more slowly than usual; the wind does not <lb/>
            bestow benefits, gentle and favorable though it may be, <lb/>
            nor does wholesome and useful food; for he who would <lb/>
            bestow a benefit upon me, must not only do me good, but <lb/>
            must wish to do so. No obligation can therefore be incurred <lb/>
            towards dumb animals; yet how many men have been <lb/>
            saved from peril by the swiftness of a horse!-nor yet <lb/>
            towards trees-yet how many sufferers from summer heat <lb/>
            have been sheltered by the thick foliage of a tree! What <lb/>
            difference can it make, whether I have profited by the act <lb/>
            of one who did not know that lie was doing me good, or <pb n="163"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. VIII.] </note><lb/>
            one who could not know it, when in each case the will to <lb/>
            do me good was wanting ? You might as well bid me be <lb/>
            grateful to a ship, a carriage, or a lance for saving me from <lb/>
            danger, as bid me be grateful to a man who may have done <lb/>
            me good by chance, but with no more intention of doing me <lb/>
            good than those things could have.</p>
          <p>VIII. Some men may receive benefits without knowing <lb/>
            it, but no man can bestow them without knowing it. <lb/>
            Many sick persons have been cured by chance circum­ <lb/>
            stances, which do not therefore become specific remedies ; <lb/>
            as, for instance, one man was restored to health by falling <lb/>
            into a river during very cold weather, as another was set <lb/>
            free from a quartan fever by means of a flogging, because <lb/>
            the sudden terror turned his attention into a new channel, <lb/>
            so that the dangerous hours passed unnoticed. Yet none <lb/>
            of these are remedies, even though they may have been <lb/>
            successful; and in like manner some men do us good, <lb/>
            though they are unwilling-indeed, because they are un­ <lb/>
            willing to do so-yet we need not feel grateful to them as <lb/>
            though we had received a benefit from them, because for­ <lb/>
            tune has changed the evil which they intended into good. <lb/>
            Do you suppose that I am indebted to a man who strikes <lb/>
            my enemy with a blow which he aimed at me, who would <lb/>
            have injured me had he not missed his mark? It often <lb/>
            happens that by openly perjuring himself a man makes <lb/>
            even trustworthy witnesses disbelieved, and renders his in­ <lb/>
            tended victim an object of compassion, as though he were <lb/>
            being ruined by a conspiracy. Some have been saved by <lb/>
            the very power which was exerted to crush them, and <lb/>
            judges who would have condemned a man by law, have re­ <lb/>
            fused to condemn him by favour. Yet they did not confer <lb/>
            a benefit upon the accused, although they rendered him a <lb/>
            service, because we must consider at what the dart was <lb/>
            aimed, not what it hits, and a benefit is distinguished from <lb/>
            an injury not by its result, but by the spirit in which it was <pb n="164"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VI.</note><lb/>
            meant. By contradicting himself, by irritating the judge <lb/>
            by his arrogance, or by rashly allowing his whole case to <lb/>
            depend upon the testimony of one witness, my opponent <lb/>
            may have saved my cause. I do not consider whether his <lb/>
            mistakes benefited me or not, for he wished me ill.</p>
          <p>IX. In order that I may be grateful, I must wish to do <lb/>
            what my benefactor must have wished in order that he <lb/>
            might bestow a benefit. Can anything be more unjust <lb/>
            than to bear a grudge against a person who may have <lb/>
            trodden upon one's foot in a crowd, or splashed one, or <lb/>
            pushed one the way which one did not wish to go? Yet <lb/>
            it was by his act that we were injured, and we only refrain <lb/>
            from complaining of him, because he did not know what he <lb/>
            was doing. The same reason makes it possible for men to <lb/>
            do us good without conferring benefits upon us, or to harm <lb/>
            us without doing us wrong, because it is intention which <lb/>
            distinguishes our friends from our enemies. How many <lb/>
            have been saved from service in the army by sickness! <lb/>
            Some men have been saved from sharing the fall of their <lb/>
            house, by being brought up upon their recognizances to a <lb/>
            court of law by their enemies; some have been saved by ship­ <lb/>
            wreck from falling into the hands of pirates; yet we do not <lb/>
            feel grateful to such things, because chance has. no feeling <lb/>
            of the service it renders, nor are we grateful to our enemy, <lb/>
            though his lawsuit, while it harassed and detained us, still <lb/>
            saved our lives. Nothing can be a benefit which does not <lb/>
            proceed from good will, and which is not meant as such by <lb/>
            the giver. If any one does me a service, without knowing <lb/>
            it, I am under no obligation to him; should he do so, <lb/>
            meaning to injure me, I shall imitate his conduct.</p>
          <p>X. Let us turn our attention to the first of these. Can <lb/>
            you desire me to do anything to express my gratitude to a <lb/>
            man who did nothing in order to confer a benefit upon me ? <lb/>
            Passing on to the next, do you wish me to show my grati­ <lb/>
            tude to such a man, and of my own will to return to him <pb n="165"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XI.] </note><lb/>
            what I received from him against his will ? What am I to <lb/>
            say of the third, he who, meaning to do an injury, blunders <lb/>
            into bestowing a benefit ? That you should have wished <lb/>
            to confer a benefit upon me is not sufficient to render me - <lb/>
            grateful; but that you should have wished not to do so is <lb/>
            enough to set me free from any obligation to you. A mere <lb/>
            wish does not constitute a benefit; and just as the best and <lb/>
            heartiest wish is not a benefit when fortune prevents its <lb/>
            being carried into effect, neither is what fortune bestows <lb/>
            upon us a benefit, unless good wishes preceded it. In order <lb/>
            to lay me under an obligation, you must not merely do me <lb/>
            a service, but you must do so intentionally.</p>
          <p>XI. Cleanthes makes use of the following example :—“ I <lb/>
            sent," says he, " two slaves to look for Plato and bring him <lb/>
            to me from the Academy. One of them searched through <lb/>
            the whole of the colonnade, and every other place in which <lb/>
            he thought that he was likely to be found, and returned <lb/>
            home alike weary and unsuccessful; the other sat down <lb/>
            among the audience of a mountebank close by, and, while <lb/>
            amusing himself in the society of other slaves like a care­ <lb/>
            less vagabond as he was, found Plato, without seeking for <lb/>
            him, as he happened to pass that way. We ought," says <lb/>
            he, " to praise that slave who, as far as lay in his power, did <lb/>
            what he was ordered, and we ought to punish the other <lb/>
            whose laziness turned out so fortunate." It is goodwill <lb/>
            alone which does one real service; let us then consider <lb/>
            under what conditions it lays us under obligations. It is <lb/>
            not enough to wish a man well, without doing him good; <lb/>
            nor is it enough to do him good without wishing him well. <lb/>
            Suppose that some one wished to give me a present, but <lb/>
            did not give it; I have his good will, but I do not have his <lb/>
            benefit, which consists of subject matter and goodwill to­ <lb/>
            gether. I owe nothing to one who wished to lend me <lb/>
            money but did not do so, and in like manner I shall be the <lb/>
            friend of one who wished but was not able to bestow a <pb n="166"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VI.</note><lb/>
            benefit upon me, but I shall not be under any obligation to <lb/>
            him. I also shall wish to bestow something upon him, <lb/>
            even as he did upon me; but if fortune be more favor­ <lb/>
            able to me than to him, and I succeed in bestowing some­ <lb/>
            thing upon him, my doing so will be a benefit bestowed <lb/>
            upon him, not a repayment out of gratitude for what he <lb/>
            did for me. It will become his duty to be grateful to me ; <lb/>
            I shall have begun the interchange of benefits ; the series <lb/>
            must be counted from my act.</p>
          <p>XII. I already understand what you wish to ask ; there <lb/>
            is no need for you to say anything, your countenance <lb/>
            speaks for you. "If any one does us good for his own <lb/>
            sake, are we," you ask, 11 under an obligation to him ? I <lb/>
            often hear you complain that there are some things which <lb/>
            men make use of themselves, but which they put down to <lb/>
            the account of others." I will tell you, my Liberalis; but first <lb/>
            let me distinguish between the two parts of your question, <lb/>
            and separate what is fair from what is unfair. It makes a <lb/>
            great difference whether any one bestows a benefit upon us <lb/>
            for his own sake, or whether he does so partly for his own <lb/>
            sake and partly for ours. He who looks only to his own <lb/>
            interests, and who does us good because he cannot other­ <lb/>
            wise make a profit for himself, seems to me to be like the <lb/>
            farmer who provides winter and summer fodder for his <lb/>
            flocks, or like the man who feeds up the captives whom he <lb/>
            has bought in order that they may fetch a better price in <lb/>
            the slave market, or who crams and curry-combs fat oxen <lb/>
            for sale; or like the keeper of a school of arms, who takes <lb/>
            great pains in exercising and equipping his gladiators. As <lb/>
            Cleanthes says, there is a great difference between benefits <lb/>
            and trade.</p>
          <p>XIII. On the other hand, I am not so unjust as to feel <lb/>
            no gratitude to a man, because, while helping me, he helped <lb/>
            himself also; for I do not insist upon his consulting my <lb/>
            interests to the exclusion of his own—nay, I should prefer <pb n="167"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XIII.] </note><lb/>
            that the benefit which I receive may be of even greater <lb/>
            advantage to the giver, provided that he thought of us both <lb/>
            when giving it, and meant to divide it between me and <lb/>
            himself. Even should he possess the larger portion of it, <lb/>
            still, if he admits me to a share, if he meant it for both of <lb/>
            us, I am not only unjust but ungrateful, if I do not rejoice <lb/>
            in what has benefited me benefiting him also. It is the <lb/>
            essence of spitefulness to say that nothing can be a benefit <lb/>
            which does not cause some inconvenience to the giver.</p>
          <p>As for him who bestows a benefit for his own sake, I <lb/>
            should say to him, 11 You have made use of me, and how <lb/>
            can you say that you have bestowed a benefit upon me, <lb/>
            rather than I upon you ?99 “ Suppose," answers he, " that <lb/>
            I cannot obtain a public office except by ransoming ten <lb/>
            citizens out of a great number of captives, will you owe me <lb/>
            nothing for setting you free from slavery and bondage ? <lb/>
            Yet I shall do so for my own sake." To this I should <lb/>
            answer, " You do this partly for my sake, partly for your <lb/>
            own. It is for your own sake that you ransom captives, <lb/>
            but it is for my sake that you ransom me; for to serve <lb/>
            your purpose it would be enough for you to ransom any <lb/>
            one. I am therefore your debtor, not for ransoming me, <lb/>
            but for choosing me, since you might have attained the <lb/>
            same result by ransoming some one else instead of me. <lb/>
            You divide the advantages of the act between yourself and <lb/>
            me, and you confer upon me a benefit by which both of us <lb/>
            profit. What you do entirely for my sake is, that you <lb/>
            choose me in preference to others. If therefore you were <lb/>
            to be made prætor for ransoming ten captives, and there <lb/>
            were only ten of us captives, none of us would be under <lb/>
            any obligation to you, because there is nothing for which <lb/>
            you can ask any one of us to give you credit apart from <lb/>
            your own advantage. I do not regard a benefit jealously <lb/>
            and wish it to be given to myself alone, but I wish to have <lb/>
            a share in it."</p><pb n="168"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin">[BK. VI.</note>XIV. a Well, then," says he, " suppose that I were to order all your names to be put into a ballot-box, and that <lb/>
            your name was drawn among those who were to be ran­ <lb/>
            somed, would you owe me nothing ? " Yes, I should owe <lb/>
            you something, but very little: how little, I will explain to <lb/>
            you. By so doing you do something for my sake, in that <lb/>
            you grant me the chance of being ransomed; I owe to <lb/>
            fortune that my name was drawn, all I owe to you is that <lb/>
            my name could be drawn. You have given me the means <lb/>
            of obtaining your benefit. For the greater part of that <lb/>
            benefit I aID indebted to fortune; that I could be so in­ <lb/>
            debted, I owe to you.</p>
          <p>I shall take no notice whatever of those whose benefits <lb/>
            are bestowed in a mercenary spirit, who do not consider to <lb/>
            whom, but upon what terms they give, whose benefits are <lb/>
            entirely selfish. Suppose that some one sells me corn ; I <lb/>
            cannot live unless I buy it; yet I do not owe my life to <lb/>
            him because I have bought it. I do not consider how <lb/>
            essential it was to me, and that I could not live without it; <lb/>
            but how little thanks are due for it, since I could not have <lb/>
            had it without paying for it. and since the merchant who <lb/>
            imported it did not consider how much good he would do <lb/>
            me, but how much be would gain for himself. I owe <lb/>
            nothing for what I have bought and paid for.</p>
          <p>XV. " According to this reasoning," says my opponent, <lb/>
            "you would say that you owe nothing to a physician <lb/>
            beyond his paltry fee, nor to your teacher, because you <lb/>
            have paid him some money; yet these persons are all held <lb/>
            very dear, and are very much respected." In answer to <lb/>
            this I should urge that some things are of greater value <lb/>
            than the price which we pay for them. You buy of a phy­ <lb/>
            sician life and good health, the value of which cannot be <lb/>
            estimated in money; from a teacher of the liberal sciences <lb/>
            you buy the education of a gentleman and mental culture ; <lb/>
            therefore you pay these persons the price, not of what they <pb n="169"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XV.] </note><lb/>
            give us, but of their trouble in giving it; you pay them for <lb/>
            devoting their attention to us, for disregarding their own <lb/>
            affairs to attend to us: they receive the price, not of their <lb/>
            services, but of the expenditure of their time. Yet this <lb/>
            may be more truly stated in another way, which I will at <lb/>
            once lay before you, having first pointed out how the above <lb/>
            may be confuted. Our adversary would say, " If some <lb/>
            things are of greater value than the price which we pay for <lb/>
            them, then, though you may have bought them, you still <lb/>
            owe me something more for them." I answer, in the first <lb/>
            place, what does their real value matter, since the buyer and <lb/>
            seller have settled the price between them ? Next, I did not <lb/>
            buy it at its own price, but at yours. " It is," you say, it worth <lb/>
            more than its sale price." True, but it cannot be sold for <lb/>
            more. The price of everything varies according to circum­ <lb/>
            stances ; after you have well praised your wares, they are <lb/>
            worth only the highest price at which you can sell them ; <lb/>
            a man who buys things cheap is not on that account under <lb/>
            any obligation to the seller. In the next place, even if <lb/>
            they are worth more, there is no generosity in your letting <lb/>
            them go for less, since the price is settled by custom and <lb/>
            the rate of the market, not by the uses and powers of the <lb/>
            merchandise. What would you state to be the proper <lb/>
            payment of a man who crosses the seas, holding a true <lb/>
            course through the midst of the waves after the land has <lb/>
            sunk out of sight, who foresees coming storms, and sud­ <lb/>
            denly, when no one expects danger, orders sails to be furled, <lb/>
            yards to be lowered, and the crew to stand at their posts <lb/>
            ready to meet the fury of the unexpected gale P and yet the <lb/>
            price of such great skill is fully paid for by the passage <lb/>
            money. At what sum can you estimate the value of a <lb/>
            lodging in a wilderness, of a shelter in the rain, of a bath <lb/>
            or fire in cold weather ? Yet I know on what terms I shall <lb/>
            be supplied with these when I enter an inn. How much <lb/>
            the man does for us who props our house when it is about <pb n="170"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VI.</note><lb/>
            to fall, and who, with a skill beyond belief, suspends in the <lb/>
            air a block of building which has begun to crack at the <lb/>
            foundation; yet we can contract for underpinning at a <lb/>
            fixed and cheap rate. The city wall keeps us safe from our <lb/>
            enemies, and from sudden inroads of brigands; yet it is <lb/>
            well known how much a day a smith would earn for erect­ <lb/>
            ing towers and scaffoldings1 to provide for the public <lb/>
            safety.</p>
          <p>XVI. I might go on for ever collecting instances to <lb/>
            prove that valuable things are sold at a low price. What <lb/>
            then ? why is it that I owe something extra both to my <lb/>
            physician and to my teacher, and that I do not acquit my­ <lb/>
            self of all obligation to them by paying them their fee ? It <lb/>
            is because they pass from physicians and teachers into <lb/>
            friends, and 'lay us under obligations, not by the skill <lb/>
            which they sell to us, but by kindly and familiar good will. <lb/>
            If my physician does no more than feel my pulse and class <lb/>
            me among those whom he sees in his daily rounds, pointing <lb/>
            out what I ought to do or to avoid without any personal <lb/>
            interest, then I owe him no more than his fee, because he <lb/>
            views me with the eye not of a friend, but of a commander.2 <lb/>
            Neither have I any reason for loving my teacher, if he has <lb/>
            regarded me merely as one of the mass of his scholars, and <lb/>
            has not thought me worthy of taking especial pains with by <lb/>
            myself, if he has never fixed his attention upon me, and if <lb/>
            when he discharged his knowledge on the public, I might <lb/>
            be said rather to have picked it up than to have learnt it <lb/>
            from him. What then is our reason for owing them much ? <lb/>
            It is, not that what they have sold us is worth more than <lb/>
            we paid for it, but that they have given something to us <lb/>
            personally. Suppose that my physician has spent more <note type="footnote"> 1 See Viollet-le-Duc's " Dictionnaire d'Architecture,” articles 11 Archi­ <lb/>
            tecture Militaire " and " Hourds," for the probable meaning of " Pro­ <lb/>
            pugnacula." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 I read 11 Non tamquam amicus videt sed tamquam imperator." </note> <pb n="171"/>

            consideration upon my case than was professionally neces­ <lb/>
            sary ; that it was for me, not for his own credit, that he <lb/>
            feared: that he was not satisfied with pointing out reme­ <lb/>
            dies, but himself applied them, that he sat by my bed­ <lb/>
            side among my anxious friends, and came to see me at <lb/>
            the crises of my disorder ; that no service was too trouble­ <lb/>
            some or too disgusting for him to perform ; that he did <lb/>
            not hear my groans unmoved; that among the numbers <lb/>
            who called for him I was his favourite case; and that he <lb/>
            gave the others only so much time as his care of my <lb/>
            health permitted him: I should feel obliged to such a <lb/>
            man not as to a physician, but as to a friend. Suppose again <lb/>
            that my teacher endured labour and weariness in instruct­ <lb/>
            ing me; that he taught me something more than is taught <lb/>
            by all masters alike; that he roused my better feelings by <lb/>
            his encouragement, and that at one time he would raise <lb/>
            my spirits by praise, and at another warn me to shake <lb/>
            off slothfulness: that he laid his hand, as it were, upon my <lb/>
            latent and torpid powers of intellect and drew them out <lb/>
            into the light of day; that he did not stingily dole out to <lb/>
            me what he knew, in order that he might be wanted for a <lb/>
            longer time, but was eager, if possible, to pour all his <lb/>
            learning into me; then I am ungrateful, if I do not love <lb/>
            him as much as I love my nearest relatives and my dearest <lb/>
            friends.</p>
          <p>XVII. We give something additional even to those who <lb/>
            teach the meanest trades, if their efforts appear to be <lb/>
            extraordinary; we bestow a gratuity upon pilots, upon <lb/>
            workmen who deal with the commonest materials and <lb/>
            hire themselves out by the day. In the noblest arts, how­ <lb/>
            ever, those which either preserve or beautify our lives, a <lb/>
            man would be ungrateful who thinks he owes the artist no <lb/>
            more than he bargained for. Besides this, the teaching of <lb/>
            such learning as we have spoken of blends mind with <lb/>
            mind; now when this takes place, both in the case of <pb n="172"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VI.</note><lb/>
            the physician and of the teacher the price of his work is <lb/>
            paid, but that of his mind remains owing.</p>
          <p>XVIII. Plato once crossed a river, and as the ferryman <lb/>
            did not ask him for anything, he supposed that he had let <lb/>
            him pass free out of respect, and said that the ferryman <lb/>
            had laid Plato under an obligation. Shortly afterwards, <lb/>
            seeing the ferryman take one person after another across <lb/>
            the river with the same pains, and without charging <lb/>
            anything, Plato declared that the ferryman had not laid <lb/>
            him under an obligation. If you wish me to be grateful <lb/>
            for what you give, you must not merely give it to me, but <lb/>
            show that you mean it specially for me ; you cannot make <lb/>
            any claim upon one for having given him what you fling <lb/>
            away broad-cast among the crowd. What then ? shall I <lb/>
            owe you nothing for it ? Nothing, as an individual; I will <lb/>
            pay, when the rest of mankind do, what I owe no more than <lb/>
            they.</p>
          <p>XIX. "Do you say," inquires my opponent, "that he <lb/>
            who carries me gratis in a boat across the river Po, does <lb/>
            not bestow any benefit upon me ? " I do. He does me some <lb/>
            good, but he does not bestow a benefit upon me; for he <lb/>
            does it for his own sake, or at any rate not for mine; in <lb/>
            short, he himself does not imagine that he is bestowing a <lb/>
            benefit upon me, but does it for the credit of the State, or <lb/>
            of the neighbourhood, or of himself, and expects some re­ <lb/>
            turn for doing so, different from what he would receive <lb/>
            from individual passengers. “ Well,” asks my opponent, <lb/>
            " if the emperor were to grant the franchise to all the Gauls, <lb/>
            or exemption from taxes to all the Spaniards, would each <lb/>
            individual of them owe him nothing on that account ?" <lb/>
            Of course he would : but he would be indebted to him, not <lb/>
            as having personally received a benefit intended for himself <lb/>
            alone, but as a partaker in one conferred upon his nation. <lb/>
            He would argue, " The emperor had no thought of me at <lb/>
            the time when he benefited us all; he did not care to give <pb n="173"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XX.] </note><lb/>
            me the franchise separately, he did not fix his attention upon <lb/>
            me; why then should I be grateful to one who did not have <lb/>
            me in his mind when he was thinking of doing what he did ? <lb/>
            In answer to this, I say that when he thought of doing good <lb/>
            to all the Gauls, he thought of doing good to me also, for <lb/>
            I was a Gaul, and he included me under my national, if <lb/>
            not under my personal appellation. In like manner, I <lb/>
            should feel grateful to him, not as for a personal, but for <lb/>
            a general benefit; being only one of the people, I should <lb/>
            regard the debt of gratitude as incurred, not by myself, <lb/>
            but by my country, and should not pay it myself, but only <lb/>
            contribute my share towards doing so. I do not call a man <lb/>
            my creditor because he has lent money to my country, nor <lb/>
            should I include that money in a schedule of my debts <lb/>
            were I either a candidate for a public office, or a defendant <lb/>
            in the courts ; yet I would pay my share towards extinguish­ <lb/>
            ing such a debt. Similarly, I deny that I am laid under <lb/>
            an obligation by a gift bestowed upon my entire nation, <lb/>
            because although the giver gave it to me, yet he did not <lb/>
            do so for my sake, but gave it without knowing whether he <lb/>
            was giving it to me or not: nevertheless I should feel that <lb/>
            I owed something for the gift, because it did reach me, <lb/>
            though not directly. To lay me under an obligation, a <lb/>
            thing must be done for my sake alone.</p>
          <p>XX. " According to this," argues our opponent, " you <lb/>
            are under no obligation to the sun or the moon; for they <lb/>
            do not move for your sake alone." No, but since they <lb/>
            move with the object of preserving the balance of the uni­ <lb/>
            verse, they move for my sake also, seeing that I am a frac­ <lb/>
            tion of the universe. Besides, our position and theirs is <lb/>
            not the same, for he who does me good in order that he <lb/>
            may by my means do good to himself, does not bestow a <lb/>
            benefit upon me, because he merely makes use of me as an <lb/>
            instrument for his own advantage; whereas the sun and <lb/>
            the moon, even if they do us good for. their own sakes, still <pb n="174"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VI.</note><lb/>
            cannot do good to us in order that by our means they may <lb/>
            do good to themselves, for what is there which we can <lb/>
            bestow upon them ?</p>
          <p>XXI. " I should be sure," replies he, " that the sun and <lb/>
            the moon wished to do us good, if they were able to refuse <lb/>
            to do so; but they cannot help moving as they do. In <lb/>
            short, let them stop and discontinue their work."</p>
          <p>See now, in how many ways this argument may be refuted. <lb/>
            One who cannot refuse to do a thing may nevertheless <lb/>
            wish to do it; indeed there is no greater proof of a fixed <lb/>
            desire to do anything, than not to be able to alter one's <lb/>
            determination. A good man cannot leave undone what <lb/>
            he does: for unless he does it he will not be a good man. <lb/>
            Is a good man, then, not able to bestow a benefit, because <lb/>
            he does what he ought to do, and is not able not to do what <lb/>
            he ought to do ? Besides this, it makes a great difference <lb/>
            whether you say, 11 He is not able not to do this, because <lb/>
            he is forced to do it," or 11 He is not able to wish not to do <lb/>
            it ; " for, if he could not help doing it, then I am not indebted <lb/>
            for it to him, but to the person who forced him to do it; <lb/>
            if he could not help wishing for it because he had nothing <lb/>
            better to wish for, then it is he who forces himself to do it, <lb/>
            and in this case the debt which as acting under compulsion <lb/>
            he could not claim, is due to him as compelling himself.</p>
          <p>" Let the sun and moon cease to wish to benefit us," says <lb/>
            our adversary. I answer, " Remember what has been said. <lb/>
            Who can be so crazy as to refuse the name of free-will to <lb/>
            that which has no danger of ceasing to act, and of adopting <lb/>
            the opposite course, since, on the contrary, he whose will is <lb/>
            fixed for ever, must be thought to wish more earnestly than <lb/>
            any one else. Surely if he, who may at any moment change <lb/>
            his mind, can be said to wish, we must not deny the exis­ <lb/>
            tence of will in a being whose nature does not admit of <lb/>
            change of mind.</p>
          <p>XXII. " Well," says he " let them stop, if it be possible." <pb n="175"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXIII.] </note><lb/>
            What you say is this :-Let all those heavenly bodies, <lb/>
            placed as they are at vast distances from each other, and <lb/>
            arranged to preserve the balance of the universe, leave their <lb/>
            appointed posts: let sudden confusion arise, so that con­ <lb/>
            stellations may collide with constellations, that the esta­ <lb/>
            blished harmony of all things may be destroyed and the <lb/>
            works of God be shaken into ruin; let the whole frame of <lb/>
            the rapidly moving heavenly bodies abandon in mid career <lb/>
            those movements which we were assured would endure for <lb/>
            ages, and let those which now by their regular advance and <lb/>
            retreat keep the world at a moderate temperature, be in­ <lb/>
            stantly consumed by fire, so that instead of the infinite <lb/>
            variety of the seasons all may be reduced to one uniform <lb/>
            condition ; let fire rage everywhere, followed by dull night, <lb/>
            and let the bottomless abyss swallow up all the gods." Is it <lb/>
            worth while to destroy all this merely in order to refute you ? <lb/>
            Even though you do not wish it, they do you good, and <lb/>
            they wheel in their courses for your sake, though their <lb/>
            motion may be due to some earlier and more important <lb/>
            cause.</p>
          <p>XXIII. Besides this, the gods act under no external <lb/>
            constraint, but their own will is a law to them for all <lb/>
            time. They have established an order which is not to be <lb/>
            changed, and consequently it is impossible that they should <lb/>
            appear to be likely to do anything against their will, since <lb/>
            they wish to continue doing whatever they cannot cease <lb/>
            from doing, and they never regret their original decision. <lb/>
            No doubt it is impossible for them to stop short, or to <lb/>
            desert to the other side, but it is so for no other reason <lb/>
            than that their own force holds them to their purpose. <lb/>
            It is from no weakness that they persevere; no, they have <lb/>
            no mind to leave the best course, and by this it is fated <lb/>
            that they should proceed. When, at the time of the <lb/>
            original creation, they arranged the entire universe, they <lb/>
            paid attention to us as well as to the rest, and took <pb n="176"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VI.</note><lb/>
            thought about the human race; and for this reason we <lb/>
            cannot suppose that it is merely for their own pleasure <lb/>
            that they move in their orbits and display their work, <lb/>
            since we also are a part of that work. We are, therefore, <lb/>
            under an obligation to the sun and moon and the rest of <lb/>
            the heavenly host, because, although they may rise in <lb/>
            order to bestow more important benefits than those which <lb/>
            we receive from them, yet they do bestow these upon <lb/>
            us as they pass on their way to greater things. Besides <lb/>
            this, they assist us of set purpose, and, therefore, lay us <lb/>
            under an obligation, because we do not in their case <lb/>
            stumble by chance upon a benefit bestowed by one who <lb/>
            knew not what he was doing, but they knew that we should <lb/>
            receive from them the advantages which we do; so that, <lb/>
            though they may have some higher aim, though the result <lb/>
            of their movements may be something of greater import­ <lb/>
            ance than the preservation of the human race, yet from the <lb/>
            beginning thought has been directed to our comforts, and <lb/>
            the scheme of the world has been arranged in a fashion <lb/>
            which proves that our interests were neither their least <lb/>
            nor last concern. It is our duty to show filial love for our <lb/>
            parents, although many of them had no thought of children <lb/>
            when they married. Not so with the gods: they cannot <lb/>
            but have known what they were doing when they furnished <lb/>
            mankind with food and comforts. Those for whose advan­ <lb/>
            tage so much was created, could not have been created <lb/>
            without design. Nature conceived the idea of us before <lb/>
            she formed us, and, indeed, we are no such trifling piece of <lb/>
            work as could have fallen from her hands unheeded. See <lb/>
            how great privileges she has bestowed upon us, how far <lb/>
            beyond the human race the empire of mankind extends; <lb/>
            consider how widely she allows us to roam, not having <lb/>
            restricted us to the land alone, but permitted us to tra­ <lb/>
            verse every part of herself; consider, too, the audacity of <lb/>
            our intellect, the only one which knows of the gods or seeks <pb n="177"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXIV.] </note><lb/>
            for them, and how we can raise our mind high above the <lb/>
            earth, and commune with those divine influences: you <lb/>
            will perceive that man is not a hurriedly put together, <lb/>
            or an unstudied piece of work. Among her noblest pro­ <lb/>
            ducts nature has none of which she can boast more <lb/>
            than man, and assuredly no other which can compre­ <lb/>
            hend her boast. What madness is this, to call the gods <lb/>
            in question for their bounty? If a man declares that <lb/>
            he has received nothing when he is receiving all the while, <lb/>
            and from those who will always be giving without ever <lb/>
            receiving anything in return, how will he be grateful to <lb/>
            those whose kindness cannot be returned without expense ? <lb/>
            and how great a mistake is it not to be thankful to a <lb/>
            giver, because he is good even to him who disowns him, or <lb/>
            to use the fact of his bounty being poured upon us in an <lb/>
            uninterrupted stream, as an argument to prove that he <lb/>
            cannot help bestowing it. Suppose that such men as these <lb/>
            say, "I do not want it," "Let him keep it to himself," <lb/>
            " Who asks him for it ? " and so forth, with all the other <lb/>
            speeches of insolent minds: still, he whose bounty reaches <lb/>
            you, although you say that it does not, lays you under an <lb/>
            obligation nevertheless; indeed, perhaps the greatest part <lb/>
            of the benefit which he bestows is that he is ready to give <lb/>
            even when you are complaining against him.</p>
          <p>XXIV. Do you not see how parents force children during <lb/>
            their infancy to undergo what is useful for their health ? <lb/>
            Though the children cry and struggle, they swathe them <lb/>
            and bind their limbs straight lest premature liberty should <lb/>
            make them grow crooked, afterwards instill into them a <lb/>
            liberal education, threatening those who are unwilling to <lb/>
            learn, and finally, if spirited young men do not conduct <lb/>
            themselves frugally, modestly, and respectably, they compel <lb/>
            them to do so. Force and harsh measures are used even to <lb/>
            youths who have grown up and are their own masters, if <lb/>
            they, either from fear or from insolence, refuse to take <note type="footnote"> N </note> <pb n="178"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VI. </note><lb/>
            what is good for them. Thus the greatest benefits that we <lb/>
            receive, we receive either without knowing it, or against our <lb/>
            will, from our parents.</p>
          <p>XXV. Those persons who are ungrateful and repudiate <lb/>
            benefits, not because they do not wish to receive them, but <lb/>
            in order that they may not be laid under an obligation for <lb/>
            them, are like those who fall into the opposite extreme, and <lb/>
            are over grateful, who pray that some trouble or mis­ <lb/>
            fortune may befall their benefactors to give them an oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity of proving how gratefully they remember the benefit <lb/>
            which they have received. It is a question whether they <lb/>
            are right, and show a truly dutiful feeling; their state of <lb/>
            mind is morbid, like that of frantic lovers who long for <lb/>
            their mistress to be exiled, that they may accompany her <lb/>
            when she leaves her country forsaken by all her friends, or <lb/>
            that she may be poor in order that she may the more need <lb/>
            what they give her, or who long that she may be ill in <lb/>
            order that they may sit by her bedside, and who, in short, <lb/>
            out of sheer love form the same wishes as her enemies <lb/>
            would wish for her. Thus the results of hatred and of <lb/>
            frantic love are very nearly the same; and these lovers <lb/>
            are very like those who hope that their friends may meet <lb/>
            with difficulties which they may remove, and who thus <lb/>
            do a wrong that they may bestow a benefit, whereas it <lb/>
            would have been much better for them to do nothing, than <lb/>
            by a crime to gain an opportunity of doing good service. <lb/>
            What should we say of a pilot who prayed to the gods <lb/>
            for dreadful storms and tempests, in order that danger <lb/>
            might make his skill more highly esteemed? what of a <lb/>
            general who should pray that a vast number of the enemy <lb/>
            might surround his camp, fill the ditches by a sudden <lb/>
            charge, tear down the rampart round his panic-stricken <lb/>
            army, and plant its hostile standards at the very gates, in <lb/>
            order that he might gain more glory by restoring his <lb/>
            broken ranks and shattered fortunes? All such men <pb n="179"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXVI.] </note><lb/>
            confer their benefits upon us by odious means, for they <lb/>
            beg the gods to harm those whom they mean to help, and <lb/>
            wish them to be struck down before they raise them up; <lb/>
            it is a cruel feeling, brought about by a distorted sense of <lb/>
            gratitude, to wish evil to befall one whom one is bound <lb/>
            in honour to succour.</p>
          <p>XXVI. " My wish," argues our opponent, 11 does him no <lb/>
            harm, because when I wish for the danger I wish for the <lb/>
            rescue at the same time." What you mean by this is not <lb/>
            that you do no wrong, but that you do less than if you <lb/>
            wished that the danger might befall him, without wishing <lb/>
            for the rescue. It is wicked to throw a man into the water <lb/>
            in order that you may pull him out, to throw him down <lb/>
            that you may raise him up, or to shut him up that you may <lb/>
            release him. You do not bestow a benefit upon a man by <lb/>
            ceasing to wrong him, nor can it ever be a piece of good <lb/>
            service to anyone to remove from him a burden which you <lb/>
            yourself imposed on him. True, you may cure the hurt <lb/>
            which you inflict, but I had rather that you did not hurt me <lb/>
            at all. You may gain my gratitude by curing me because <lb/>
            I am wounded, but not by wounding me in order that you <lb/>
            may cure me : no man likes scars except as compared with <lb/>
            wounds, which he is glad to see thus healed, though he had <lb/>
            rather not have received them. It would be cruel to wish <lb/>
            such things to befall one from whom you had never received <lb/>
            a kindness; how much more cruel is it to wish that they <lb/>
            may befall one in whose debt you are.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. “ I pray,” replies he, " at the same time, that I <lb/>
            may be able to help him." In the first place, if I stop you <lb/>
            short in the middle of your prayer, it shows at once that <lb/>
            you are ungrateful: I have not yet heard what you wish <lb/>
            to do for him; I have heard what you wish him to suffer. <lb/>
            You pray that anxiety and fear and even worse evil than <lb/>
            this may come upon him. You desire that he may need <lb/>
            aid: this is to his disadvantage; you desire that he may <pb n="180"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VI.</note><lb/>
            need your aid: this is to your advantage. You do not <lb/>
            wish to help him, but to be set free from your obligation <lb/>
            to him : for when you are eager to repay your debt in such <lb/>
            a way as this, you merely wish to be set free from the debt, <lb/>
            not to repay it. So the only part of your wish that could <lb/>
            be thought honourable proves to be the base and ungrateful <lb/>
            feeling of unwillingness to lie under an obligation: for <lb/>
            what you wish for is, not that you may have an opportunity <lb/>
            of repaying his kindness, but that he may be forced to beg <lb/>
            you to do him a kindness. You make yourself the superior, <lb/>
            and you wickedly degrade beneath your feet the man who <lb/>
            has done you good service. How much better would it be <lb/>
            to remain in his debt in an honourable and friendly manner, <lb/>
            than to seek to discharge the debt by these evil means! <lb/>
            You would be less to blame if you denied that you had re­ <lb/>
            ceived it, for your benefactor would then lose nothing more <lb/>
            than what he gave you, whereas now you wish him to be ren­ <lb/>
            dered inferior to you, and brought by the loss of his pro­ <lb/>
            perty and social position into a condition below his own <lb/>
            benefits. Do you think yourself grateful ? Just utter your <lb/>
            wishes in the hearing of him to whom vou wish to do good. <lb/>
            Do you call that a prayer for his worfare which can be <lb/>
            divided between his friend and his enemy, which, if the last <lb/>
            part were omitted, you would not doubt was pronounced by <lb/>
            one who opposed and hated him? Enemies in war have <lb/>
            sometimes wished to capture certain towns in order to <lb/>
            spare them, or to conquer certain persons in order to pardon <lb/>
            them, yet these were the wishes of enemies, and what was <lb/>
            the kindest part of them began by cruelty. Finally, what <lb/>
            sort of prayers do you think those can be which he, on <lb/>
            whose behalf they are made, hopes more earnestly than <lb/>
            any one else may not be granted ? In hoping that the gods <lb/>
            may injure a man, and that you may help him, you deal <lb/>
            most dishonourably with him, and you do not treat the <lb/>
            gods themselves fairly, for you give them the odious part <pb n="181"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXVIII.] </note><lb/>
            to play, and reserve the generous one for yourself: the gods <lb/>
            must do him wrong in order that you may do him a ser­ <lb/>
            vice. If you were to suborn an informer to accuse a man, <lb/>
            and afterwards withdrew him, if you engaged a man in a <lb/>
            law suit and afterwards gave it up, no one would hesitate <lb/>
            to call you a villain: what difference does it make, whether <lb/>
            you attempt to do this by chicanery or by prayer, unless it <lb/>
            be that by prayer you raise up more powerful enemies to <lb/>
            him than by the other means ? You cannot say “ Why, <lb/>
            what harm do I do him ? " your prayer is either futile or <lb/>
            harmful, indeed it is harmful even though nothing comes <lb/>
            of it. You do your friend wrong by wishing him harm: <lb/>
            you must thank the gods that you do him no harm. The <lb/>
            fact of your wishing it is enough: we ought to be just as <lb/>
            angry with you as if you had effected it.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. " If," argues our adversary, " my prayers had <lb/>
            any efficacy, they would also have been efficacious to save <lb/>
            him from danger." In the first place, I reply, the danger <lb/>
            into which you wish me to fall is certain, the help which I <lb/>
            should receive is uncertain. Or call them both certain ; it <lb/>
            is that which injures me that comes first. Besides, you <lb/>
            understand the terms of your wish ; I shall be tossed by <lb/>
            the storm without being sure that I have a haven of rest at <lb/>
            hand.</p>
          <p>Think what torture it must have been to me, even if I <lb/>
            receive your help, to have stood in need of it: if I escape <lb/>
            safely, to have trembled for myself; if I be acquitted, to <lb/>
            have had to plead my cause. To escape from fear, however <lb/>
            great it may be, can never be so pleasant as to live in <lb/>
            sound unassailable safety. Pray that you may return my <lb/>
            kindnesses when I need their return, but do not pray that <lb/>
            I may need them. You would have done what you prayed <lb/>
            for, had it been in your power.</p>
          <p>XXIX. How far more honourable would a prayer of this <lb/>
            sort be : "I pray that he may remain in such a position as <pb n="182"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VI.</note><lb/>
            that he may always bestow benefits and never need them : <lb/>
            may he be attended by the means of giving and helping, of <lb/>
            which he makes such a bountiful use ; may he never want <lb/>
            benefits to bestow, or be sorry for any which he has be­ <lb/>
            stowed ; may his nature, fitted as it is for acts of pity, <lb/>
            goodness, and clemency, be stimulated and brought out by <lb/>
            numbers of grateful persons, whom I trust he will find with­ <lb/>
            out needing to make trial of their gratitude; may he refuse <lb/>
            to be reconciled to no one, and may no one require to be <lb/>
            reconciled to him: may fortune so uniformly continue to <lb/>
            favour him that no one may be able to return his kindness <lb/>
            in any way except by feeling grateful to him."</p>
          <p>How far more proper are such prayers as these, which do <lb/>
            not put you off to some distant opportunity, but express <lb/>
            your gratitude at once? What is there to prevent your <lb/>
            returning your benefactor's kindness, even while he is in <lb/>
            prosperity ? How many ways are there by which we can <lb/>
            repay what we owe even to the affluent—for instance, by <lb/>
            honest advice, by constant intercourse, by courteous con­ <lb/>
            versation, pleasing him without flattering him, by listening <lb/>
            attentively to any subject which he may wish to discuss, by <lb/>
            keeping safe any secret that he may impart to us, and by <lb/>
            social intercourse. There is no one so highly placed by <lb/>
            fortune as not to want a friend all the more because he <lb/>
            wants nothing.</p>
          <p>XXX. The other is a melancholy opportunity, and one <lb/>
            which we ought always to pray may be kept far from us: <lb/>
            must the gods be angry with a man in order that you may <lb/>
            prove your gratitude to him? Do you not perceive that <lb/>
            you are doing wrong, from the very fact that those to <lb/>
            whom you are ungrateful fare better? Call up before <lb/>
            your mind dungeons, chains, wretchedness, slavery, war, <lb/>
            poverty: these are the opportunities for which you pray; <lb/>
            if any one has any dealings with you, it is by means of <lb/>
            these that you square your account. Why not rather <pb n="183"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXX.] </note><lb/>
            wish that he to whom you owe most may be powerful <lb/>
            and happy? for, as I have just said, what is there to <lb/>
            prevent your returning the kindness even of those who <lb/>
            enjoy the greatest prosperity? to do which, ample and <lb/>
            various opportunities will present themselves to you. What! <lb/>
            do you not know that a debt can be paid even to a rich man ? <lb/>
            Nor will I trouble you with many instances of what you <lb/>
            may do. Though a man's riches and prosperity may prevent <lb/>
            your making him any other repayment, I will show you <lb/>
            what the highest in the land stand in need of, what is <lb/>
            wanting to those who possess everything. They want a <lb/>
            man to speak the truth, to save them from the organized <lb/>
            mass of falsehood by which they are beset, which so bewil­ <lb/>
            ders them with lies that the habit of hearing only what is <lb/>
            pleasant instead of what is true, prevents their knowing <lb/>
            what truth really is. Do you not see how such persons are <lb/>
            driven to ruin by the want of candour among their friends, <lb/>
            whose loyalty has degenerated into slavish obsequiousness ? <lb/>
            No one, when giving them his advice, tells them what he <lb/>
            really thinks, but each vies with the other in flattery; and <lb/>
            while the man's friends make it their only object to see who <lb/>
            can most pleasantly deceive him, he himself is ignorant of <lb/>
            his real powers, and, believing himself to be as great a man <lb/>
            as he is told that he is, plunges the State in useless wars, <lb/>
            which bring disasters upon it, breaks off a useful and <lb/>
            necessary peace, and, through a passion of anger which <lb/>
            no one checks, spills the blood of numbers of people, and at <lb/>
            last sheds his own. Such persons assert what has never <lb/>
            been investigated as certain facts, consider that to modify <lb/>
            their opinion is as dishonourable as to be conquered, believe <lb/>
            that institutions which are just flickering out of existence <lb/>
            will last for ever, and, thus overturn great States, to the de­ <lb/>
            struction of themselves and all who are connected with <lb/>
            them. Living as they do in a fool's paradise, resplendent <lb/>
            with unreal and short-lived advantages, they forget that, as <pb n="184"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VI.</note><lb/>
            soon as they put it out of their power to hear the truth, <lb/>
            there is no limit to the misfortunes which they may expect.</p>
          <p>XXXI. When Xerxes declared war against Greece, all <lb/>
            his courtiers encouraged his boastful temper, which forgot <lb/>
            how unsubstantial his grounds for confidence were. One <lb/>
            declared that the Greeks would not endure to hear the <lb/>
            news of the declaration of war, and would take to flight at <lb/>
            the first rumour of his approach ; another, that with such <lb/>
            a vast army Greece could not only be conquered, but <lb/>
            utterly overwhelmed, and that it was rather to be feared <lb/>
            that they would find the Greek cities empty and aban­ <lb/>
            doned, and that the panic flight of the enemy would <lb/>
            leave them only vast deserts, where no use could be made <lb/>
            of their enormous forces. Another told him that the world <lb/>
            was hardly large enough to contain him, that the seas were <lb/>
            too narrow for his fleets, the camps would not take in his <lb/>
            armies, the plains were not wide enough to deploy his <lb/>
            cavalry in, and that the sky itself was scarcely large enough <lb/>
            to enable all his troops to hurl their darts at once. While <lb/>
            much boasting of this sort was going on around him, <lb/>
            raising his already overweening self-confidence to a frantic <lb/>
            pitch, Demaratus, the Lacedaemonian, alone told him that <lb/>
            the disorganized and unwieldy multitude in which he trusted, <lb/>
            was in itself a danger to its chief, because it possessed only <lb/>
            weight without strength; for an army which is too large <lb/>
            cannot be governed, and one which cannot be governed, can­ <lb/>
            not long exist. " The Lacedaemonians,” said he," will meet <lb/>
            you upon the first mountain in Greece, and will give you a <lb/>
            taste of their quality. All these thousands of nations of <lb/>
            yours will be held in check by three hundred men: they will <lb/>
            stand firm at their posts, they will defend the passes entrusted <lb/>
            to them with their weapons, and block them up with their <lb/>
            bodies: all Asia will not force them to give way; few as <lb/>
            they are, they will stop all this terrible invasion, attempted <lb/>
            though it be by nearly the whole human race. Though the <pb n="185"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXXI.] </note><lb/>
            laws of nature may give way to you, and enable you to <lb/>
            pass from Europe to Asia, yet you will stop short in a by­ <lb/>
            path ; consider what your losses will be afterwards, when <lb/>
            you have reckoned up the price which you have to pay <lb/>
            for the pass of Thermopylae; when you learn that your <lb/>
            march can be stayed, you will discover that you may be put <lb/>
            to flight. The Greeks will yield up many parts of their <lb/>
            country to you, as if they were swept out of them by the <lb/>
            first terrible rush of a mountain torrent; afterwards they <lb/>
            will rise against you from all quarters and will crush you <lb/>
            by means of your own strength. What people say, that <lb/>
            your warlike preparations are too great to be contained in <lb/>
            the countries which you intend to attack, is quite true; but <lb/>
            this is to our disadvantage. Greece will conquer you for <lb/>
            this very reason, that she cannot contain you ; you cannot <lb/>
            make use of the whole of your force. Besides this, you will <lb/>
            not be able to do what is essential to victory-that is, to <lb/>
            meet the manoeuvres of the enemy at once, to support your <lb/>
            own men if they give way, or to confirm and strengthen <lb/>
            them when their ranks are wavering; long before you <lb/>
            know it, you will be defeated. Moreover, you should not <lb/>
            think that because your army is so large that its own chief <lb/>
            does not know its numbers, it is therefore irresistible: <lb/>
            there is nothing so great that it cannot perish ; nay, with­ <lb/>
            out any other cause, its own excessive size may prove its <lb/>
            ruin." What Demaratus predicted came to pass. He <lb/>
            whose power gods and men obeyed, and who swept away <lb/>
            all that opposed him, was bidden to halt by three hundred <lb/>
            men, and the Persians, defeated in every part of Greece, <lb/>
            learned how great a difference there is between a mob and <lb/>
            an army. Thus it came to pass that Xerxes, who suf­ <lb/>
            fered more from the shame of his failure than from the <lb/>
            losses which he sustained, thanked Demaratus for having <lb/>
            been the only man who told him the truth, and permitted <lb/>
            him to ask what boon he pleased. He asked to be allowed <pb n="186"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VI.</note><lb/>
            to drive a chariot into Sardis, the largest city in Asia, wear­ <lb/>
            ing a tiara erect upon his head, a privilege which was en­ <lb/>
            joyed by kings alone. He deserved his reward before he asked <lb/>
            for it, but how wretched must the nation have been, in <lb/>
            which there was no one who would speak the truth to the <lb/>
            king except one man, who did not speak it to himself.</p>
          <p>XXXII. The late Emperor Augustus banished his <lb/>
            daughter, whose conduct went beyond the shame of ordinary <lb/>
            immodesty, and made public the scandals of the imperial <lb/>
            house ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ <lb/>
            ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ <lb/>
            Led away by his passion, he divulged all these crimes <lb/>
            which, as emperor, he ought to have kept secret with as much <lb/>
            care as he punished them, because the shame of some deeds <lb/>
            asperses even him who avenges them. Afterwards, when <lb/>
            by lapse of time shame took the place of anger in his mind, <lb/>
            he lamented that he had not kept silence about matters which <lb/>
            he had not learned until it was disgraceful to speak of them, <lb/>
            and often used to exclaim, " None of these things would have <lb/>
            happened to me, if either Agrippa or Maecenas had lived!" <lb/>
            So hard was it for the master of so many thousands of men <lb/>
            to repair the loss of two. When his legions were slaugh­ <lb/>
            tered, new ones were at once enrolled; when his fleet was <lb/>
            wrecked, within a few days another was afloat; when <lb/>
            the public buildings were consumed by fire, finer ones arose <lb/>
            in their stead; but the places of Agrippa and Maecenas <lb/>
            remained unfilled throughout his life. What am I to <lb/>
            imagine ? that there were not any men like these, who <lb/>
            could take their place, or that it was the fault of Augustus <lb/>
            himself, who preferred mourning for them to seeking for <lb/>
            their likes ? We have no reason for supposing that it was <lb/>
            the habit of Agrippa or Maecenas to speak the truth to him; <lb/>
            indeed, if they had lived they would have been as great <lb/>
            dissemblers as the rest. It is one of the habits of kings to <lb/>
            insult their present servants by praising those whom they <pb n="187"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXXIII.] </note><lb/>
            have lost, and to attribute the virtue of truthful speaking <lb/>
            to those from whom there is no further risk of hearing it.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. However, to return to my subject, you see <lb/>
            how easy it is to return the kindness of the prosperous, <lb/>
            and even of those who occupy the highest places of all man­ <lb/>
            kind. Tell them, not what they wish to hear, but what <lb/>
            they will wish that they always had heard; though their <lb/>
            ears be stopped by flatteries, yet sometimes truth may pene­ <lb/>
            trate them; give them useful advice. Do you ask what <lb/>
            service you can render to a prosperous man ? Teach him <lb/>
            not to rely upon his prosperity, and to understand that it <lb/>
            ought to be supported by the hands of many trusty friends. <lb/>
            Will you not have done much for him, if you take away <lb/>
            his foolish belief that his influence will endure for ever, <lb/>
            and teach him that what we gain by chance passes away <lb/>
            soon, and at a quicker rate than it came; that we cannot <lb/>
            fall by the same stages by which we rose to the height of <lb/>
            good fortune, but that frequently between it and ruin there <lb/>
            is but one step ? You do not know how great is the value. <lb/>
            of friendship, if you do not understand how much you give <lb/>
            to him to whom you give a friend, a commodity which is <lb/>
            scarce not only in men's houses, but in whole centuries, <lb/>
            and which is nowhere scarcer than in the places where it is <lb/>
            thought to be most plentiful. Pray, do you suppose that <lb/>
            those books of names, which your nomenclator1 can hardly <lb/>
            carry or remember, are those of friends ? It is not your <lb/>
            friends who crowd to knock at your door, and who are <lb/>
            admitted to your greater or lesser levees.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. To divide one's friends into classes is an old <lb/>
            trick of kings and their imitators ; it shows great arrogance <lb/>
            to think that to touch or to pass one's threshold can be a <lb/>
            valuable privilege, or to grant as an honour that you <note type="footnote"> 1 The nomenclator was a slave who attended his master in canvassing <lb/>
            and on similar occasions, for the purpose of telling him the names of <lb/>
            those whom he met in the street. </note> <pb n="188"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VI.</note><lb/>
            should sit nearer one's front door than others, or enter the <lb/>
            house before them, although within the house there are <lb/>
            many more doors, which shut out even those who have been <lb/>
            admitted so far. With us Gaius Gracchus, and shortly <lb/>
            after him Livius Drusus, were the first to keep themselves <lb/>
            apart from the mass of their adherents, and to admit some <lb/>
            to their privacy, some to their more select, and others to <lb/>
            their general receptions. These men consequently had <lb/>
            friends of the first and second rank, and so on, but in none <lb/>
            had they true friends. Can you apply the name of friend <lb/>
            to one who is admitted in his regular order to pay his <lb/>
            respects to you? or can you expect perfect loyalty from <lb/>
            one who is forced to slip into your presence through a <lb/>
            grudgingly-opened door ? How can a man arrive at using <lb/>
            bold freedom of speech with you, if he is only allowed in <lb/>
            his proper turn to make use of the common phrase, " Hail <lb/>
            to you," which is used by perfect strangers? Whenever <lb/>
            you go to any of these great men, whose levees interest the <lb/>
            whole city, though you find all the streets beset with <lb/>
            throngs of people, and the passers-by hardly able to make <lb/>
            their way through the crowd, you may be sure that .you <lb/>
            have come to a place where there are many men, but no <lb/>
            friends of their patron. We must not seek our friends in <lb/>
            our entrance hall, but in our own breast; it is there that he <lb/>
            ought to be received, there retained, and hoarded up in our <lb/>
            minds. Teach this, and you will have repaid your debt of <lb/>
            gratitude.</p>
          <p>XXXV. If you are useful to your friend only when he is <lb/>
            in distress, and are superfluous when all goes well with him, <lb/>
            you form a mean estimate of your own value. As you can <lb/>
            bear yourself wisely both in doubtful, in prosperous, and in <lb/>
            adverse circumstances, by showing prudence in doubtful <lb/>
            cases, courage in misfortune, and self-restraint in good for­ <lb/>
            tune, so in all circumstances you can make yourself useful to <lb/>
            your friend. Do not desert him in adversity, but do not wish <pb n="189"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXXV.] </note><lb/>
            that it may befall him: the various incidents of human life <lb/>
            will afford you many opportunities of proving your loyalty to <lb/>
            him without wishing him evil. He who prays that another <lb/>
            may become rich, in order that he may share his riches, really <lb/>
            has a view to his own advantage, although his prayers are <lb/>
            ostensibly offered in behalf of his friend ; and similarly he <lb/>
            who wishes that his friend may get into some trouble from <lb/>
            which his own friendly assistance may extricate him—a <lb/>
            most ungrateful wish-prefers himself to his friend, and <lb/>
            thinks it worth while that his friend should be unhappy, in <lb/>
            order that he may prove his gratitude. This very wish <lb/>
            makes him ungrateful, for he wishes to rid himself of his <lb/>
            gratitude as though it were a heavy burden. In returning <lb/>
            a kindness it makes a great difference whether you are <lb/>
            eager to bestow a benefit, or merely to free yourself from a <lb/>
            debt. He who wishes to return a benefit will study his <lb/>
            friend's interests, and will hope that a suitable occasion will <lb/>
            arise; he who only wishes to free himself from an obliga­ <lb/>
            tion will be eager to do so by any means whatever, which <lb/>
            shows very bad feeling. “ Do you say," we may be asked, <lb/>
            "that eagerness to repay kindness belongs to a morbid <lb/>
            feeling of gratitude ? " I cannot explain my meaning more <lb/>
            clearly than by repeating what I have already said. You do <lb/>
            not want to repay, but to escape from the benefit which you <lb/>
            have received. You seem to say, 11 When shall I get free <lb/>
            from this obligation ? I must strive by any means in my <lb/>
            power to extinguish my debt to him." You would be <lb/>
            thought to be far from grateful, if you wished to pay a <lb/>
            debt to him with his own money ; yet this wish of yours is <lb/>
            even more unjust; for you invoke curses upon him, and <lb/>
            call down terrible imprecations upon the head of one who <lb/>
            ought to be held sacred by you. No one, I suppose, would <lb/>
            have any doubt of your wickedness if you were openly to <lb/>
            pray that he might suffer poverty, captivity, hunger, or <lb/>
            fear; yet what is the difference between openly praying <pb n="190"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VI.</note><lb/>
            for some of these things, and silently wishing for them ? for <lb/>
            you do wish for some of these. Go, and enjoy your belief <lb/>
            that this is gratitude, to do what not even an ungrateful <lb/>
            man would do, supposing he confined himself to repudiating <lb/>
            the benefit, and did not go so far as to hate his benefactor.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. Who would call Æneas pious, if he wished that <lb/>
            his native city might be captured, in order that he might <lb/>
            save his father from captivity ? Who would point to the <lb/>
            Sicilian youths as good examples for his children, if they <lb/>
            had prayed that Ætna might flame with unusual heat and <lb/>
            pour forth a vast mass of fire in order to afford them an <lb/>
            opportunity of displaying their filial affection by rescuing <lb/>
            their parents from the midst of the conflagration ? Rome <lb/>
            owes Scipio nothing if he kept the Punic War alive in <lb/>
            order that he might have the glory of finishing it; she <lb/>
            owes nothing to the Decii if they prayed for public <lb/>
            disasters, to give themselves an opportunity of displaying <lb/>
            their brave self-devotion. It is the greatest scandal for a <lb/>
            physician to make work for himself ; and many who have <lb/>
            aggravated the diseases of their patients that they may <lb/>
            have the greater credit for curing them, have either failed <lb/>
            to cure them at all, or have done so at the cost of the most <lb/>
            terrible suffering to their victims.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. It is said (at any rate Hecaton tells us) that <lb/>
            when Callistratus with many others was driven into exile <lb/>
            by his factious and licentiously free country, some one <lb/>
            prayed that such trouble might befall the Athenians that <lb/>
            they would be forced to recall the exiles, on hearing which, <lb/>
            he prayed that God might forbid his return upon such <lb/>
            terms. When some one tried to console our own country­ <lb/>
            man, Rutilius, for his exile, pointing out that civil war <lb/>
            was at hand, and that all exiles would soon be restored to <lb/>
            Rome, he answered with even greater spirit, " What harm <lb/>
            nave I done you, that you should wish that I may return to <lb/>
            my country more unhappily than I quit it ? My wish is, <pb n="191"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXXVIII.] </note><lb/>
            that my country should blush at my being banished, rather <lb/>
            than that she should mourn at my having returned." An <lb/>
            exile, of which every one is more ashamed than the sufferer, <lb/>
            is not exile at all. These two persons, who did not wish to <lb/>
            be restored to their homes at the cost of a public disaster, <lb/>
            but preferred that two should suffer unjustly than that all <lb/>
            should suffer alike, are thought to have acted like good <lb/>
            citizens; and in like manner it does not accord with the <lb/>
            character of a grateful man, to wish that his benefactor <lb/>
            may fall into troubles which he may dispel; because, even <lb/>
            though he may mean well to him, yet he wishes him evil. <lb/>
            To put out a fire which you yourself have lighted, will not <lb/>
            even gain acquittal for you, let alone credit.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. In some states an evil wish was regarded as <lb/>
            a crime. It is certain that at Athens Demades obtained a <lb/>
            verdict against one who sold furniture for funerals, by <lb/>
            proving that he had prayed for great gains, which he could <lb/>
            not obtain without the death of many persons. Yet it is a <lb/>
            stock question whether he was rightly found guilty. Per­ <lb/>
            haps he prayed, not that he might sell his wares to many per­ <lb/>
            sons, but that he might sell them dear, or that he might pro­ <lb/>
            cure what he was going to sell, cheaply. Since his business <lb/>
            consisted of buying and selling, why should you consider <lb/>
            his prayer to apply to one branch of it only, although he <lb/>
            made profit from both? Besides this, you might find <lb/>
            every one of his trade guilty, for they all wish, that is, <lb/>
            secretly pray, as he did. You might, moreover, find a <lb/>
            great part of the human race guilty, for who is there who <lb/>
            does not profit by his neighbour's wants ? A soldier, if he <lb/>
            wishes for glory, must wish for war; the farmer profits by <lb/>
            corn being dear; a large number of litigants raises the <lb/>
            price of forensic eloquence; physicians make money by a <lb/>
            sickly season; dealers in luxuries are made rich by the <lb/>
            effeminacy of youth ; suppose that no storms and no con­ <lb/>
            flagrations injured our dwellings, the builder's trade would <pb n="192"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VI.</note><lb/>
            be at a standstill. The prayer of one man was detected, <lb/>
            but it was just like the prayers of all other men. Do <lb/>
            you imagine that Arruntius and Haterius, and all other <lb/>
            professional legacy-hunters do not put up the same prayers <lb/>
            as undertakers and grave-diggers ? though the latter know <lb/>
            not whose death it is that they wish for, while the former <lb/>
            wish for the death of their dearest friends, from whom, on <lb/>
            account of their intimacy, they have most hopes of inherit­ <lb/>
            ing a fortune. No one's life does the undertaker any <lb/>
            harm, whereas these men starve if their friends are long <lb/>
            about dying; they do not, therefore, merely wish for their <lb/>
            deaths in order that they may receive what they have <lb/>
            earned by a disgraceful servitude, but in order that they <lb/>
            may be set free from a heavy tax. There can, therefore, <lb/>
            be no doubt that such persons repeat with even greater <lb/>
            earnestness the prayer for which the undertaker was con­ <lb/>
            demned, for whoever is likely to profit such men by dying, <lb/>
            does them an injury by living. Yet the wishes of all these <lb/>
            are alike well known and unpunished. Lastly, let every man <lb/>
            examine his own self, let him look into the secret thoughts <lb/>
            of his heart and consider what it is that he silently hopes <lb/>
            for; how many of his prayers he would blush to acknow­ <lb/>
            ledge, even to himself; how few there are which we could <lb/>
            repeat in the presence of witnesses !</p>
          <p>XXXIX. Yet we must not condemn every thing which <lb/>
            we find worthy of blame, as, for instance, this wish about, <lb/>
            our friends which we have been discussing, arises from a <lb/>
            misdirected feeling of affection, and falls into the very <lb/>
            error which it strives to avoid, for the man is ungrateful <lb/>
            at the very time when he hurries to prove his gratitude. <lb/>
            He prays aloud, " May he fall into my power, may he need <lb/>
            my influence, may not be able to be safe and respectable <lb/>
            without my aid, may he be so unfortunate that whatever <lb/>
            return I make to him may be regarded as a benefit." T( <lb/>
            the gods alone he adds, " May domestic treasons encompass <pb n="193"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XL.] </note><lb/>
            him, which can be quelled by me alone ; may some power­ <lb/>
            ful and virulent enemy, some excited and armed mob, assail <lb/>
            him; may he be set upon by a creditor or an informer."</p>
          <p>XL. See, how just you are; you would never have <lb/>
            wished any of these misfortunes to befall him, if he had not <lb/>
            bestowed a benefit upon you. Not to speak of the graver <lb/>
            guilt which you incur by returning evil for good, you dis­ <lb/>
            tinctly do wrong in not waiting for the fitting time for <lb/>
            each action, for it is as wrong to anticipate this as it is not <lb/>
            to take it when it comes. A benefit ought not always to <lb/>
            be accepted, and ought not in all cases to be returned. If <lb/>
            you were to return it to me against my will, you would be <lb/>
            ungrateful, how much more ungrateful are you, if you <lb/>
            force me to wish for it? Wait patiently; why are you <lb/>
            unwilling to let my bounty abide with you ? Why do you <lb/>
            chafe at being laid under an obligation ? why, as though <lb/>
            you were dealing with a harsh usurer, are you in such a <lb/>
            hurry to sign and seal an equivalent bond ? Why do you <lb/>
            wish me to get into trouble? Why do you call upon the <lb/>
            gods to ruin me? If this is your way of returning a <lb/>
            kindness, what would you do if you were exacting repay­ <lb/>
            ment of a debt ?</p>
          <p>XLI. Above all, therefore, my Liberalis, let us learn to <lb/>
            live calmly under an obligation to others, and watch for <lb/>
            opportunities of repaying our debt without manufacturing <lb/>
            them. Let us remember that this anxiety to seize the first <lb/>
            opportunity of setting ourselves free shows ingratitude; for <lb/>
            no one repays with good will that which he is unwilling to <lb/>
            owe, and his eagerness to get it out of his hands shows that <lb/>
            he regards it as a burden rather than as a favour. How much <lb/>
            better and more righteous is it to bear in mind what we owe <lb/>
            to our friends, and to offer repayment, not to obtrude it, nor <lb/>
            to think ourselves too much indebted; because a benefit is a <lb/>
            common bond which connects two persons. Say " I do not <lb/>
            delay to repay your kindness to me; I hope that you will <note type="footnote"> o </note> <pb n="194"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VI.</note><lb/>
            accept my gratitude cheerfully. If irresistible fate hangs <lb/>
            over either of us, and destiny rules either that you must <lb/>
            receive your benefit back again, or that I must receive a <lb/>
            second benefit, why then, of us two, let him give that was <lb/>
            wont to give. I am ready to receive it. <lb/>
            " 'Tis not the part of Turnus to delay." <lb/>
            That is the spirit which I shall show whenever the time <lb/>
            comes ; in the meanwhile the gods shall be my witnesses.</p>
          <p>XLII. I have noted in you, my Liberalis, and as it were <lb/>
            touched with my hand a feeling of fussy anxiety not to be <lb/>
            behindhand in doing what is your duty. This anxiety is <lb/>
            not suitable to a grateful mind, which, on the contrary, pro­ <lb/>
            duces the utmost confidence in oneself, and which drives <lb/>
            away all trouble by the consciousness of real affection to­ <lb/>
            wards one's benefactor. To say " Take back what you gave <lb/>
            me," is no less a reproach than to say "You are in my <lb/>
            debt." Let this be the first privilege of a benefit, that he <lb/>
            who bestowed it may choose the time when he will have it <lb/>
            returned. " But I fear that men may speak ill of me." <lb/>
            You do wrong if you are grateful only for the sake of your <lb/>
            reputation, and not to satisfy your conscience. You have <lb/>
            in this matter two judges, your benefactor, whom you <lb/>
            ought not, and yourself, whom you cannot deceive. " But," <lb/>
            say you, " if no occasion of repayment offers, am I always <lb/>
            to remain in his debt ?" Yes; but you should do so <lb/>
            openly, and willingly, and should view with great pleasure <lb/>
            what he has entrusted to you. If you are vexed at not <lb/>
            having yet returned a benefit, you must be sorry that you <lb/>
            ever received it; but if he deserved that you should receive <lb/>
            a benefit from him, why should he not deserve that you <lb/>
            should long remain in his debt ?</p>
          <p>XLIII. Those persons are much mistaken who regard it <lb/>
            as a proof of a great mind to make offers to give, and to <lb/>
            fill many men's pockets and houses with their presents, for <pb n="195"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XLIII.] </note><lb/>
            sometimes these are due not to a great mind, but to a great <lb/>
            fortune; they do not know how far more great and more <lb/>
            difficult it sometimes is to receive than to lavish gifts. I <lb/>
            must disparage neither act; it is as proper to a noble <lb/>
            heart to owe as to receive, for both are of equal value when <lb/>
            done virtuously; indeed, to owe is the more difficult, be­ <lb/>
            cause it requires more pains to keep a thing safe than to <lb/>
            give it away. We ought not therefore to be in a hurry to <lb/>
            repay, nor need we seek to do so out of due season, for to <lb/>
            hasten to make repayment at the wrong time is as bad as <lb/>
            to be slow to do so at the right time. My benefactor has <lb/>
            entrusted his bounty to me: I ought not to have any fears <lb/>
            either on his behalf or on my own. He has a sufficient <lb/>
            security; he cannot lose it except he loses me—nay, not <lb/>
            even if he loses me. I have returned thanks to him for it <lb/>
            -that is, I have requited him. He who thinks too much <lb/>
            about repaying a benefit must suppose that his friend <lb/>
            thinks too much about receiving repayment. Make no dif­ <lb/>
            ficulty about either course. If he wishes to receive his <lb/>
            benefit back again, let us return it cheerfully; if he prefers <lb/>
            to leave it in our hands, why should we dig up his treasure ? <lb/>
            why should we decline to be its guardians ? he deserves to <lb/>
            be allowed to do whichever he pleases. As for fame and <lb/>
            reputation, let us regard them as matters which ought to <lb/>
            accompany, but which ought not to direct our actions.</p><pb n="196"/>

          <p>B <lb/>
            E of good cheer, my Liberalis: <lb/>
            " Our port is close, and I will not delay, <lb/>
            Nor by digressions wander from the way." <lb/>
            This book collects together all that has been omitted, and in <lb/>
            it, having exhausted my subject, I shall consider not what <lb/>
            I am to say, but what there is which I have not yet said. If <lb/>
            there be anything superfluous in it, I pray you take it in good <lb/>
            part, since it is for you that it is superfluous. Had I wished <lb/>
            to set off my work to the best advantage, I ought to have <lb/>
            added to it by degrees, and to have kept for the last that <lb/>
            part which would be eagerly perused even by a sated <lb/>
            reader. However, instead of this, I have collected together <lb/>
            all that was essential in the beginning; I am now collecting <lb/>
            together whatever then escaped me; nor, by Hercules, if <lb/>
            you ask me, do I think that, after the rules which govern <lb/>
            our conduct have been stated, it is very much to the pur­ <lb/>
            pose to discuss the other questions which have been raised <lb/>
            more for the exercise of our intellects than for the health of <lb/>
            our minds. The cynic Demetrius, who in my opinion was <lb/>
            a great man even if compared with the greatest philoso­ <lb/>
            phers, had an admirable saying about this, that one gained <lb/>
            more by having a few wise precepts ready and in common <lb/>
            use than by learning many without having them at hand. <lb/>
            "The best wrestler," he would say, "is not he who has <lb/>
            learned thoroughly all the tricks and twists of the art, <lb/>
            which are seldom met with in actual wrestling, but he who <pb n="197"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. I.] </note><lb/>
            has well and carefully trained himself in one or two of <lb/>
            them, and watches keenly for an opportunity of practising <lb/>
            them. It does not matter how many of them he knows, if <lb/>
            he knows enough to give him the victory; and so in this <lb/>
            subject of ours there are many points of interest, but few <lb/>
            of importance. You need not know what is the system of <lb/>
            the ocean tides, why each seventh year leaves its mark upon <lb/>
            the human body, why the more distant parts of a long <lb/>
            portico do not keep their true proportion, but seem to <lb/>
            approach one another until at last the spaces between the <lb/>
            columns disappear, how it can be that twins are conceived <lb/>
            separately, though they are born together, whether both re­ <lb/>
            sult from one, or each from a separate act, why those whose <lb/>
            birth was the same should have such different fates in life, <lb/>
            and dwell at the greatest possible distance from one <lb/>
            another, although they were born touching one another; <lb/>
            it will not do you much harm to pass over matters which <lb/>
            we are not permitted to know, and which we should not <lb/>
            profit by knowing. Truths so obscure may be neglected <lb/>
            with impunity.1 Nor can we complain that nature deals <lb/>
            hardly with us, for there is nothing which is hard to dis­ <lb/>
            cover except those things by which we gain nothing beyond <lb/>
            the credit of having discovered them ; whatever things tend <lb/>
            to make us better or happier are either obvious or easily <lb/>
            discovered. Your mind can rise superior to the accidents of <lb/>
            life, if it can raise itself above fears and not greedily covet <lb/>
            boundless wealth, but has learned to seek for riches within <lb/>
            itself; if it has cast out the fear of men and gods, and has <lb/>
            learned that it has not much to fear from man, and nothing <lb/>
            to fear from God; if by scorning all those things which <lb/>
            make life miserable while they adorn it, the mind can soar <lb/>
            to such a height as to see clearly that death cannot be the <lb/>
            beginning of any trouble, though it is the end of many; if <lb/>
            it can dedicate itself to righteousness and think any path <note type="footnote"> 1 The old saying, 4 Truth lurks deep in a well (or abyss).' </note> <pb n="198"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VII.</note><lb/>
            easy which leads to it; if, being a gregarious creature, <lb/>
            and born for the common good, it regards the world as the <lb/>
            universal home, if it keeps its conscience clear towards God <lb/>
            and lives always as though in public, fearing itself more <lb/>
            than other men, then it avoids all storms, it stands on firm <lb/>
            ground in fair daylight, and has brought to perfection its <lb/>
            knowledge of all that is useful and essential. All that <lb/>
            remains serves merely to amuse our leisure ; yet, when <lb/>
            once anchored in safety, the mind may consider these matters <lb/>
            also, though it can derive no strength, but only culture from <lb/>
            their discussion."</p>
          <p>II. The above are the rules which my friend Demetrius <lb/>
            bids him who would make progress in philosophy to clutch <lb/>
            with both hands, never to let go, but to cling to them, and <lb/>
            make them a part of himself, and by daily meditation upon <lb/>
            them to bring himself into such a state of mind, that these <lb/>
            wholesome maxima occur to him of their own accord, that <lb/>
            wherever he may be, they may straightway be ready for <lb/>
            use when required, and that the criterion of right and <lb/>
            wrong may present itself to him without delay. Let <lb/>
            him know that nothing is evil except what is base, and <lb/>
            nothing good except what is honourable: let him guide his <lb/>
            life by this rule: let him both act and expect others to act <lb/>
            in accordance with this law, and let him regard those whose <lb/>
            minds are steeped in indolence, and who are given up to lust <lb/>
            and gluttony, as the most pitiable of mankind, no matter how <lb/>
            splendid their fortunes may be. Let him say to himself, <lb/>
            " Pleasure is uncertain, short, apt to pall upon us, and the <lb/>
            more eagerly we indulge in it, the sooner we bring on a re­ <lb/>
            action of feeling against it; we must necessarily afterwards <lb/>
            blush for it, or be sorry for it, there is nothing grand about it, <lb/>
            nothing worthy of man's nature, little lower as it is than <lb/>
            that of the gods ; pleasure is a low act, brought about by the <lb/>
            agency of our inferior and baser members, and shameful in <lb/>
            its result. True pleasure, worthy of a human being and of <pb n="199"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. III.] </note><lb/>
            a man, is, not to stuff or swell his body with food and drink, <lb/>
            nor to excite lusts which are least hurtful when they are most <lb/>
            quiet, but to be free from all forms of mental disturbance, <lb/>
            both those which arise from men's ambitious struggles with <lb/>
            one another, and those which come from on high and are <lb/>
            more difficult to deal with, which flow from our taking the <lb/>
            traditional view of the gods, and estimating them by the <lb/>
            analogy of our own vices." This equable, secure, uncloying <lb/>
            pleasure is enjoyed by the man now described; a man <lb/>
            skilled, so to say, in the laws of gods and men alike. Such <lb/>
            a man enjoys the present without anxiety for the future: <lb/>
            for he who depends upon what is uncertain can rely con­ <lb/>
            fidently upon nothing. Thus he is free from all those <lb/>
            great troubles which unhinge the mind, he neither hopes <lb/>
            for, nor covets anything, and engages in no uncertain ad­ <lb/>
            ventures, being satisfied with what he has. Do not suppose <lb/>
            that he is satisfied with a little; for everything is his, and <lb/>
            that not in the sense in which all was Alexander's, who, <lb/>
            though he reached the shore of the Red Sea, yet wanted <lb/>
            more territory than that through which he had come. He <lb/>
            did not even own those countries which he held or had <lb/>
            conquered, while Onesicritus, whom he had sent on before <lb/>
            him to discover new countries, was wandering about the <lb/>
            ocean and engaging in war in unknown seas. Is it not <lb/>
            clear that he who pushed his armies beyond the bounds of <lb/>
            the universe, who with reckless greed dashed headlong into <lb/>
            a boundless and unexplored sea, must in reality have been <lb/>
            full of wants ? It matters not how many kingdoms he may <lb/>
            have seized or given away, or how great a part of the world <lb/>
            may pay him tribute; such a man must be in need of as <lb/>
            much as he desires.</p>
          <p>HI. This was not the vice of Alexander alone, who followed <lb/>
            with a fortunate audacity in the footsteps of Bacchus and <lb/>
            Hercules, but it is common to all those whose covetousness <lb/>
            is whetted rather than appeased by good fortune. Look at <pb n="200"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VII.</note><lb/>
            Cyrus and Cambyses and all the royal house of Persia: can <lb/>
            you find one among them who thought his empire large <lb/>
            enough, or was not at the last gasp still aspiring after fur­ <lb/>
            ther conquests ? We need not wonder at this, for whatever <lb/>
            is obtained by covetousness is simply swallowed up and lost, <lb/>
            nor does it matter how much is poured into its insatiable <lb/>
            maw. Only the wise man possesses everything without <lb/>
            having to struggle to retain it; he alone does not need to <lb/>
            send ambassadors across the seas, measure out camps upon <lb/>
            hostile shores, place garrisons in commanding forts, or <lb/>
            manoeuvre legions and squadrons of cavalry. Like the <lb/>
            immortal gods, who govern their realm without recourse <lb/>
            to arms, and from their serene and lofty heights protect <lb/>
            their own, so the wise man fulfils his duties, however far­ <lb/>
            reaching they may be, without disorder, and looks down <lb/>
            upon the whole human race, because he himself is the <lb/>
            greatest and most powerful member thereof. You may <lb/>
            laugh at him, but if you in your mind survey the east <lb/>
            and the west, reaching even to the regions separated from <lb/>
            us by vast wildernesses, if you think of all the creatures <lb/>
            of the earth, all the riches which the bounty of nature <lb/>
            lavishes, it shows a great spirit to be able to say, as though <lb/>
            you were a god, "All these are mine." Thus it is that <lb/>
            he covets nothing, for there is nothing which is not con­ <lb/>
            tained in everything, and everything is his.</p>
          <p>IV. " This," say you, “ is the very thing that I wanted <lb/>
            I have caught you! I shall be glad to see how you will <lb/>
            extricate yourself from the toils into which you have fallen <lb/>
            of your own accord. Tell me, if the wise man possesses <lb/>
            everything, how can one give anything to a wise man ? for <lb/>
            even what you give him is his already. It is impossible, <lb/>
            therefore, to bestow a benefit upon a wise man, if whatever <lb/>
            is given him comes from his own store; yet you Stoics <lb/>
            declare that it is possible to give to a wise man. I make <lb/>
            the same inquiry about friends as well: for you say that <pb n="201"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. IV.] </note><lb/>
            friends own everything in common, and if so, no one can <lb/>
            give anything to his friend, for he gives what his friend <lb/>
            owned already in common with himself."</p>
          <p>There is nothing to prevent a thing belonging to a wise <lb/>
            man, and yet being the property of its legal owner. Accord­ <lb/>
            ing to law everything in a state belongs to the king, yet all <lb/>
            that property over which the king has rights of possession <lb/>
            is parcelled out among individual owners, and each separate <lb/>
            thing belongs to somebody: and so one can give the king a <lb/>
            house, a slave, or a sum of money without being said to <lb/>
            give him what was his already; for the king has rights <lb/>
            over all these things, while each citizen has the ownership <lb/>
            of them. We speak of the country of the Athenians, or of <lb/>
            the Campanians, though the inhabitants divide them <lb/>
            amongst themselves into separate estates; the whole region <lb/>
            belongs to one state or another, but each part of it belongs <lb/>
            to its own individual proprietor; so that we are able to <lb/>
            give our lands to the state, although they are reckoned <lb/>
            as belonging to the state, because we and the state own <lb/>
            them in different ways. Can there be any doubt that all <lb/>
            the private savings of a slave belong to his master as well as <lb/>
            he himself ? yet he makes his master presents. The slave <lb/>
            does not therefore possess nothing, because if his master <lb/>
            chose he might possess nothing; nor does what he gives of <lb/>
            his own free will cease to be a present, because it might have <lb/>
            been wrung from him against his will. As for how we are <lb/>
            to prove that the wise man possesses all things, we shall see <lb/>
            afterwards; for the present we are both agreed to regard <lb/>
            this as true; we must gather together something to answer <lb/>
            the question before us, which is, how any means remain <lb/>
            of acting generously towards one who already possesses <lb/>
            all things? All things that a son has belong to his father, <lb/>
            yet who does not know that in spite of this a son can <lb/>
            make presents to his father? All things belong to the <lb/>
            gods; yet we make presents and bestow alms even upon <pb n="202"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VII.</note><lb/>
            the gods. What I have is not necessarily not mine be­ <lb/>
            cause it belongs to you; for the same thing may belong <lb/>
            both to me and to you.</p>
          <p>" He to whom courtezans belong," argues our adversary, <lb/>
            “ must be a procurer: now courtezans are included in all <lb/>
            things, therefore courtezans belong to the wise man. But <lb/>
            he to whom courtezans belong is a procurer; therefore the <lb/>
            wise man is a procurer." Yes ! by the same reasoning, our <lb/>
            opponents would forbid him to buy anything, arguing, <lb/>
            " No man buys his own property. Now all things are the <lb/>
            property of the wise man; therefore the wise man buys <lb/>
            nothing." By the same reasoning they object to his borrow­ <lb/>
            ing, because no one pays interest for the use of his own <lb/>
            money. They raise endless quibbles, although they per­ <lb/>
            fectly well understand what we say.</p>
          <p>V. For, when I say that the wise man possesses every­ <lb/>
            thing, I mean that he does so without thereby impairing <lb/>
            each man's individual rights in his own property, in the <lb/>
            same way as in a country ruled by a good king, everything <lb/>
            belongs to the king, by the right of his authority, and to <lb/>
            the people by their several rights of ownership. This I <lb/>
            shall prove in its proper place; in the mean time it is a <lb/>
            sufficient answer to the question to declare that I am able <lb/>
            to give to the wise man that which is in one way mine, <lb/>
            and in another way his. Nor is it strange that I should <lb/>
            be able to give anything to one who possesses everything. <lb/>
            Suppose I have hired a house from you : some part of that <lb/>
            house is mine, some is yours ; the house itself is yours, the <lb/>
            use of your house belongs to me. Crops may ripen upon <lb/>
            your land, but you cannot touch them against the will of <lb/>
            your tenant; and if corn be dear, or at famine price, you <lb/>
            will <lb/>
            " In vain another's mighty store behold," <lb/>
            grown upon your land, lying upon your land, and to be de­ <pb n="203"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. VII.] </note><lb/>
            posited in your own barns. Though you be the landlord, <lb/>
            you must not enter my hired house, nor may you take <lb/>
            away your own slave from me if I have contracted for his <lb/>
            services; nay, if I hire a carriage from you, I bestow a <lb/>
            benefit by allowing you to take your seat in it, although it <lb/>
            is your own. You see, therefore, that it is possible for a <lb/>
            man to receive a present by accepting what is his own.</p>
          <p>VI. In all the cases which I have mentioned, each party <lb/>
            is the owner of the same thing. How is this ? It is be­ <lb/>
            cause the one owns the thing, the other owns the use of the <lb/>
            thing. We speak of the books of Cicero. Dorus, the book­ <lb/>
            seller, calls these same books his own ; the one claims them <lb/>
            because he wrote them, the other because he bought them ; <lb/>
            so that they may quite correctly be spoken of as belonging <lb/>
            to either of the two, for they do belong to each, though in <lb/>
            a different manner. Thus Titus Livius may receive as a <lb/>
            present, or may buy his own books from Dorus. Although <lb/>
            the wise man possesses everything, yet I can give him what <lb/>
            I individually possess; for though, king-like, he in his <lb/>
            mind possesses everything, yet the ownership of all things <lb/>
            is divided among various individuals, so that he can both <lb/>
            receive a present and owe one; can buy, or hire things. <lb/>
            Everything belongs to Caesar ; yet he has no private pro­ <lb/>
            perty beyond his own privy purse; as Emperor all things <lb/>
            are his, but nothing is his own except what he inherits. It <lb/>
            is possible, without treason, to discuss what is and what is <lb/>
            not his; for even what the court may decide not to be his, <lb/>
            from another point of view is his. In the same way the <lb/>
            wise man in his mind possesses everything, in actual right <lb/>
            and ownership he possesses only his own property.</p>
          <p>VII. Bion is able to prove by argument at one time that <lb/>
            everyone is sacrilegious, at another that no one is. When <lb/>
            he is in a mood for casting all men down the Tarpeian rock, <lb/>
            he says, " Whosoever touches that which belongs to the <lb/>
            gods, and consumes it or converts it to his own uses, is sacri­ <pb n="204"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VII.</note><lb/>
            legious; but all things belong to the gods, so that what­ <lb/>
            ever thing any one touches belongs to them to whom all <lb/>
            belongs; whoever, therefore, touches anything is sacri­ <lb/>
            legious." Again, when he bids men break open temples <lb/>
            and pillage the Capitol without fear of the wrath of heaven, <lb/>
            he declares that no one can be sacrilegious ; because, what­ <lb/>
            ever a man takes away, he takes from one place which be­ <lb/>
            longs to the gods into another place which belongs to the <lb/>
            gods. The answer to this is that all places do indeed be­ <lb/>
            long to the gods, but all are not consecrated to them, and <lb/>
            that sacrilege can only be done in places solemnly dedicated <lb/>
            to heaven. Thus, also, the whole world is a temple of the <lb/>
            immortal gods, and, indeed, the only one worthy of their <lb/>
            greatness and splendour, and yet there is a distinction <lb/>
            between things sacred and profane; all things which it is <lb/>
            lawful to do under the sky and the stars are not lawful to <lb/>
            do within consecrated walls. The sacrilegious man cannot <lb/>
            do God any harm, for He is placed beyond his reach by His <lb/>
            divine nature ; yet he is punished because he seems to have <lb/>
            done Him harm: his punishment is demanded by our feel­ <lb/>
            ing on the matter, and even by his own. In the same way, <lb/>
            therefore, as he who carries off any sacred things is re­ <lb/>
            garded as sacrilegious, although that which he stole is <lb/>
            nevertheless within the limits of the world, so it is possible <lb/>
            to steal from a wise man : for in that case it will be some, <lb/>
            not of that universe which he possesses, but some of those <lb/>
            things of which he is the acknowledged owner, and which are <lb/>
            severally his own property, which will be stolen from him. <lb/>
            The former of these possessions he will recognize as his <lb/>
            own, the latter he will be unwilling, even if he be able to <lb/>
            possess ; he will say, as that Roman commander said, when, <lb/>
            to reward his courage and good service to the state, he was <lb/>
            assigned as much land as he could inclose in one day's <lb/>
            ploughing. " You do not," said he, " want a citizen who <lb/>
            wants more than is enough for one citizen." Do you not <pb n="205"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. VIII.] </note><lb/>
            think that it required a much greater man to refuse this <lb/>
            reward than to earn it? for many have taken away the <lb/>
            landmarks of other men's property, but no one sets up <lb/>
            limits to his own.</p>
          <p>VIII. When, then, we consider that the mind of the <lb/>
            truly wise man has power over all things and pervades all <lb/>
            things, we cannot help declaring that everything is his, <lb/>
            although, in the estimation of our common law, it may <lb/>
            chance that he may be rated as possessing no property what­ <lb/>
            ever. It makes a great difference whether we estimate what <lb/>
            he owns by the greatness of his mind, or by the public re­ <lb/>
            gister. He would pray to be delivered from that possession <lb/>
            of everything of which you speak. I will not remind you of <lb/>
            Socrates, Chrysippus, Zeno, and other great men, all the <lb/>
            greater, however, because envy prevents no one from <lb/>
            praising the ancients. But a short time ago I mentioned <lb/>
            Demetrius, who seems to have been placed by nature in <lb/>
            our times that he might prove that we could neither cor­ <lb/>
            rupt him nor be corrected by him ; a man of consummate <lb/>
            wisdom, though he himself disclaimed it, constant to the <lb/>
            principles which he professed, of an eloquence worthy to <lb/>
            deal with the mightiest subjects, scorning mere prettinesses <lb/>
            and verbal niceties, but expressing with infinite spirit the <lb/>
            ideas which inspired it. I doubt not that he was endowed <lb/>
            by divine providence with so pure a life and such power of <lb/>
            speech in order that our age might neither be without a <lb/>
            model nor a reproach. Had some god wished to give all <lb/>
            our wealth to Demetrius on the fixed condition that he <lb/>
            should not be permitted to give it away, I am sure that <lb/>
            he would have refused to accept it, and would have said,</p>
          <p>IX. "I do not intend to fasten upon my back a bur­ <lb/>
            den like this, of which I never can rid myself, nor do I, <lb/>
            nimble and lightly equipped as I am, mean to hinder my <lb/>
            progress by plunging into the deep morass of business <lb/>
            transactions. Why do you offer to me what is the bane of <pb n="206"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VII.</note><lb/>
            all nations ? I would not accept it even if I meant to give <lb/>
            it away, for I see many things which it would not be­ <lb/>
            come me to give. I should like to place before my eyes the <lb/>
            things which fascinate both kings and peoples, I wish to <lb/>
            behold the price of your blood and your lives. First bring <lb/>
            before me the trophies of Luxury, exhibiting them as you <lb/>
            please, either in succession, or, which is better, in one mass. <lb/>
            I see the shell of the tortoise, a foul and slothful brute, <lb/>
            bought for immense sums and ornamented with the most <lb/>
            elaborate care, the contrast of colours which is admired in <lb/>
            it being obtained by the use of dyes resembling the natural <lb/>
            tints. I see tables and pieces of wood valued at the price <lb/>
            of a senator's estate, which are all the more precious, the <lb/>
            more knots the tree has been twisted into by disease. I see <lb/>
            crystal vessels, whose price is enhanced by their fragility, for <lb/>
            among the ignorant the risk of losing things increases their <lb/>
            value instead of lowering it, as it ought. I see murrhine <lb/>
            cups, for luxury would be too cheap if men did not drink to <lb/>
            one another out of hollow gems the wine to be afterwards <lb/>
            thrown up again. I see more than one large pearl placed in <lb/>
            each ear; for now our ears are trained to carry burdens, <lb/>
            pearls are hung from them in pairs, and each pair has other <lb/>
            single ones fastened above it. This womanish folly is not <lb/>
            exaggerated enough for the men of our time, unless they <lb/>
            hang two or three estates upon each ear. I see ladies' silk <lb/>
            dresses, if those deserve to be called dresses which can <lb/>
            neither cover their body or their shame; when wearing <lb/>
            which, they can scarcely, with a good conscience, swear that <lb/>
            they are not naked. These are imported at a vast expense <lb/>
            from nations unknown even to trade, in order that our <lb/>
            matrons may show as much of their persons in public as <lb/>
            they do to their lovers in private."</p>
          <p>X. What are you doing, Avarice ? see how many things <lb/>
            there are whose price exceeds that of your beloved gold: all <lb/>
            those which I have mentioned are more highly esteeemed <pb n="207"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. X.] </note><lb/>
            and valued. I now wish to review your wealth, those plates <lb/>
            of gold and silver which dazzle our covetousness. By <lb/>
            Hercules, the very earth, while she brings forth upon the <lb/>
            surface every thing that is of use to us, has buried these, <lb/>
            sunk them deep, and rests upon them with her whole weight, <lb/>
            regarding them as pernicious substances, and likely to <lb/>
            prove the ruin of mankind if brought into the light of day. <lb/>
            I see that iron is brought out of the same dark pits as gold <lb/>
            and silver, in order that we may lack neither the means nor <lb/>
            the reward of murder. Thus far we have dealt with actual <lb/>
            substances; but some forms of wealth deceive our eyes and <lb/>
            minds alike. I see there letters of credit, promissory notes, <lb/>
            and bonds, empty phantoms of property, ghosts of sick <lb/>
            Avarice, with which she deceives our minds, which delight <lb/>
            in unreal fancies ; for what are these things, and what are <lb/>
            interest, and account books, and usury, except the names <lb/>
            of unnatural developments of human covetousness? I <lb/>
            might complain of nature for not having hidden gold and <lb/>
            silver deeper, for not having laid over it a weight too heavy <lb/>
            to be removed: but what are your documents, your sale of <lb/>
            time, your blood-sucking twelve per cent. interest? these <lb/>
            are evils which we owe to our own will, which flow merely <lb/>
            from our perverted habit, having nothing about them which <lb/>
            can be seen or handled, mere dreams of empty avarice. <lb/>
            Wretched is he who can take pleasure in the size of the <lb/>
            audit book of his estate, in great tracts of land cultivated <lb/>
            by slaves in chains, in huge flocks and herds which require <lb/>
            provinces and kingdoms for their pasture ground, in a <lb/>
            household of servants, more in number than some of the <lb/>
            most warlike nations, or in a private house whose extent sur­ <lb/>
            passes that of a large city! After he has carefully reviewed <lb/>
            all his wealth, in what it is invested, and on what it is <lb/>
            spent, and has rendered himself proud by the thoughts of <lb/>
            it, let him compare what he has with what he wants: he <lb/>
            becomes a poor man at once. Let me go : restore me to <pb n="208"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VII.</note><lb/>
            those riches of mine. I know the kingdom of wisdom, <lb/>
            which is great and stable: I possess every thing, and in <lb/>
            such a manner that it belongs to all men nevertheless."</p>
          <p>XI. When, therefore, Gaius Caesar offered him two hun­ <lb/>
            dred thousand sesterces, he laughingly refused it, thinking it <lb/>
            unworthy of himself to boast of having refused so small a <lb/>
            sum. Ye gods and goddesses, what a mean mind must the <lb/>
            emperor have had, if he hoped either to honour or to cor­ <lb/>
            rupt him. I must here repeat a proof of his magnanimity. <lb/>
            I have heard that when he was expressing his wonder at <lb/>
            the folly of Gaius at supposing that he could be influenced <lb/>
            by such a bribe, he said, " If he meant to tempt me, he <lb/>
            ought to have tried to do so by offering his entire king­ <lb/>
            dom."</p>
          <p>XII. It is possible, then, to give something to the wise <lb/>
            man, although all things belong to the wise man. Simi­ <lb/>
            larly, though we declare that friends have all things in <lb/>
            common, it is nevertheless possible to give something to <lb/>
            a friend: for I have not everything in common with a <lb/>
            friend in the same manner as with a partner, where one <lb/>
            part belongs to him, and another to me, but rather as a <lb/>
            father and a mother possess their children in common <lb/>
            when they have two, not each parent possessing one child, <lb/>
            but each possessing both. First of all I will prove that <lb/>
            any chance would-be partner of mine has nothing in com­ <lb/>
            mon with me: and why ? Because this community of goods <lb/>
            can only exist between wise men, who are alone capable of <lb/>
            friendship: other men can neither be friends nor partners <lb/>
            one to another. In the next place, things may be owned <lb/>
            in common in various ways. The knights’ seats in the <lb/>
            theatre belong to all the Roman knights; yet of these the <lb/>
            seat which I occupy becomes my own, and if I yield it <lb/>
            up to any one, although I only yield him a thing which we <lb/>
            own in common, still I appear to have given him some­ <lb/>
            thing. Some things belong to certain persons under par­ <pb n="209"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XIII.</note><lb/>
            ticular conditions. I have a place among the knights, not <lb/>
            to sell, or to let, or to dwell in, but simply to see the spec­ <lb/>
            tacle from, wherefore I do not tell an untruth when I say <lb/>
            that I have a place among the knights’ seats. Yet if, <lb/>
            when I come into the theatre, the knights’ seats are full, <lb/>
            I both have a seat there by right, because I have the privi­ <lb/>
            lege of sitting there, and I have not a seat there, because my <lb/>
            seat is occupied by those who share my right to those places. <lb/>
            Suppose that the same thing takes place between friends; <lb/>
            whatever our friend possesses, is common to us, but is the <lb/>
            property of him who owns it; I cannot make use of it <lb/>
            against his will. " You are laughing at me," say you; 11 if <lb/>
            what belongs to my friend is mine, I am able to sell it." <lb/>
            You are not able; for you are not able to sell your place <lb/>
            among the knights’ seats, and yet they are in common be­ <lb/>
            tween you and the other knights. Consequently, the fact <lb/>
            that you cannot sell a thing, or consume it, or exchange it <lb/>
            for the better or the worse does not prove that it is not <lb/>
            yours; for that which is yours under certain conditions is <lb/>
            yours nevertheless.</p>
          <p>XIII. * * * I have received, but certainly not less. Not <lb/>
            to detain you longer than is necessary, a benefit can be no <lb/>
            more than a benefit; but the means employed to convey <lb/>
            benefits may be both greater and more numerous. I mean <lb/>
            those things by which kindness expresses and gives vent to <lb/>
            itself, like lovers, whose many kisses and close embraces do <lb/>
            not increase their love but give it play.</p>
          <p>XIV. The next question which arises has been thoroughly <lb/>
            threshed out in the former books, so here it shall only be <lb/>
            touched on shortly; for the arguments which have been <lb/>
            used for other cases can be transferred to it.</p>
          <p>The question is, whether one who has done everything in <lb/>
            his power to return a benefit, has returned it. " You may <lb/>
            know," says our adversary, " that he has not returned it, <lb/>
            because he did everything in his power to return it; it is <note type="footnote"> p </note> <pb n="210"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VII.</note><lb/>
            evident, therefore, that he did not not do that which he <lb/>
            did not have an opportunity of doing. A man who <lb/>
            searches everywhere for his creditor without finding him <lb/>
            does not thereby pay him what he owes." Some are in <lb/>
            such a position that it is their duty to effect something <lb/>
            material; in the case of others to have done all in their <lb/>
            power to effect it is as good as effecting it. If a physician <lb/>
            has done all in his power to heal his patient he has per­ <lb/>
            formed his duty; an advocate who employs his whole <lb/>
            powers of eloquence on his client's behalf, performs his <lb/>
            duty even though his client be convicted; the generalship <lb/>
            even of a beaten commander is praised if he has prudently, <lb/>
            laboriously, and courageously exercised his functions. Your <lb/>
            friend has done all in his power to return your kindness, <lb/>
            but your good fortune stood in his way; no adversity <lb/>
            befell you in which he could prove the truth of his friend­ <lb/>
            ship ; he could not give you money when you were rich, or <lb/>
            nurse you when you were in health, or help you when <lb/>
            you were succeeding; yet he repaid your kindness, even <lb/>
            though you did not receive a benefit from him. More­ <lb/>
            over, this man, being always eager, and on the watch for <lb/>
            an opportunity of doing this, as he has expended much <lb/>
            anxiety and much trouble upon it, has really done more <lb/>
            than he who quickly had an opportunity of repaying your <lb/>
            kindness. The case of a debtor is not the same, for it is <lb/>
            not enough for him to have tried to find the money unless <lb/>
            he pays it; in his case a harsh creditor stands over him <lb/>
            who will not let a single day pass without charging him <lb/>
            interest; in yours there is a most kind friend, who seeing <lb/>
            you busy, troubled, and anxious would say. <lb/>
            “ ‛ Dismiss this trouble from thy breast; ’ <lb/>
            leave off disturbing yourself; I have received from you all <lb/>
            that I wish; you wrong me, if you suppose that I want <lb/>
            anything further; you have fully repaid me in intention." <pb n="211"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XV.] </note><lb/>
            " Tell me," says our adversary, " if he had repaid the <lb/>
            benefit you would say that he had returned your kindness: <lb/>
            is, then, he who repays it in the same position as he who <lb/>
            does not repay it ? "</p>
          <p>On the other hand, consider this: if he had forgotten <lb/>
            the benefit which he had received, if he had not even <lb/>
            attempted to be grateful, you would say that he had not <lb/>
            returned the kindness; but this man has laboured day and <lb/>
            night to the neglect of all his other duties in his devoted <lb/>
            care to let no opportunity of proving his gratitude escape <lb/>
            him ; is then he who took no pains to return a kindness to <lb/>
            be classed with this man who never ceased to take pains ? <lb/>
            you are unjust, if you require a material payment from me <lb/>
            when you see that I am not wanting in intention.</p>
          <p>XV. In short, suppose that when you are taken captive, <lb/>
            I have borrowed money, made over my property as security <lb/>
            to my creditor, that I have sailed in a stormy winter season <lb/>
            along coasts swarming with pirates, that I have braved all <lb/>
            the perils which necessarily attend a voyage even on a <lb/>
            peaceful sea, that I have wandered through all wildernesses <lb/>
            seeking for those men whom all others flee from, and that <lb/>
            when I have at length reached the pirates, someone else <lb/>
            has already ransomed you: will you say that I have not <lb/>
            returned your kindness? Even if during this voyage I <lb/>
            have lost by shipwreck the money that I had raised to save <lb/>
            you, even if I myself have fallen into the prison from <lb/>
            which I sought to release you, will you say that I have not <lb/>
            returned your kindness ? No, by Hercules! the Athenians <lb/>
            call Harmodius and Aristogiton, tyrannicides; the hand of <lb/>
            Mucius which he left on the enemy's altar was equivalent <lb/>
            to the death of Porsena, and valour struggling against <lb/>
            fortune is always illustrious, even if it falls short of accom­ <lb/>
            plishing its design. He who watches each opportunity as <lb/>
            it passes, and tries to avail himself of one after another, <lb/>
            does more to show his gratitude than he whom the first <pb n="212"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VII.</note><lb/>
            opportunity enabled to be grateful without any trouble <lb/>
            whatever. “ But," says our adversary, " he gave you two <lb/>
            things, material help and kindly feeling; you, therefore, <lb/>
            owe him two." You might justly say this to one who <lb/>
            returns your kindly feeling without troubling himself <lb/>
            further; this man is really in your debt; but you cannot <lb/>
            say so of one who wishes to repay you, who struggles and <lb/>
            leaves no stone unturned to do so; for, as far as in <lb/>
            him lies, he repays .you in both kinds; in the next place, <lb/>
            counting is not always a true test, sometimes one thing is <lb/>
            equivalent to two; consequently so intense and ardent a <lb/>
            wish to repay takes the place of a material repayment. <lb/>
            Indeed, if a feeling of gratitude has no value in repaying a <lb/>
            kindness without giving something material, then no one <lb/>
            can be grateful to the gods, whom we can repay by grati­ <lb/>
            tude alone. " We cannot," says our adversary, " give the <lb/>
            gods anything else." Well, but if I am not able to give <lb/>
            this man, whose kindness I am bound to return, anything <lb/>
            beside my gratitude, why should that which is all that I <lb/>
            can bestow on a god be insufficient to prove my gratitude <lb/>
            towards a man ?</p>
          <p>XVI. If, however, you ask me what I really think, and <lb/>
            wish me to give a definite answer, I should say that the <lb/>
            one party ought to consider his benefit to have been re­ <lb/>
            turned, while the other ought to feel that he has not <lb/>
            returned it; the one should release his friend from the <lb/>
            debt, the other should hold himself bound to pay it; the <lb/>
            one should say, " I have received;" the other should <lb/>
            answer, " I owe." In our whole investigation, we ought to <lb/>
            look entirely to the public good; we ought to prevent the <lb/>
            ungrateful having any excuses in which they can take <lb/>
            refuge, and under cover of which they can disown their <lb/>
            debts. " I have done all in my power," say you. Well, <lb/>
            keep on doing so still. Do you suppose that our ancestors <lb/>
            were so foolish, as not to understand that. it is most unjust <pb n="213"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XVI.] </note><lb/>
            that the man who has wasted the money which he received <lb/>
            from his creditor on debauchery, or gambling, should be <lb/>
            classed with one who has lost his own property as well as <lb/>
            that of others in a fire, by robbery, or some sadder <lb/>
            mischance ? They would take no excuse, that men might <lb/>
            understand that they were always bound to keep their <lb/>
            word; it was thought better that even a good excuse <lb/>
            should not be accepted from a few persons, than that all <lb/>
            men should be led to try to make excuses. You say that <lb/>
            you have done all in your power to repay your debt; this <lb/>
            ought to be enough for your friend, but not enough for <lb/>
            you. He to whom you owe a kindness, is unworthy of <lb/>
            gratitude if he lets all your anxious care and trouble to <lb/>
            repay it go for nothing; and so, too, if your friend takes <lb/>
            your good will as a repayment, you are ungrateful if you <lb/>
            are not all the more eager to feel the obligation of the debt <lb/>
            which he has forgiven you. Do not snap up his receipt, or <lb/>
            call witnesses to prove it; rather seek opportunities for <lb/>
            repaying not less than before; repay the one man because <lb/>
            he asks for repayment, the other because he forgives you <lb/>
            your debt; the one because he is good, the other because <lb/>
            he is bad. You need not, therefore, think that you have <lb/>
            anything to do with the question whether a man be bound <lb/>
            to repay the benefit which he has received from a wise <lb/>
            man, if that man has ceased to be wise and has turned <lb/>
            into a bad man. You would return a deposit which you <lb/>
            had received from a wise man; you would return a loan <lb/>
            even to a bad man; what grounds have you for not re­ <lb/>
            turning a benefit also ? Because he has changed, ought he <lb/>
            to change you ? What ? if you had received anything from <lb/>
            a man when healthy, would you not return it to him when <lb/>
            he was sick, though we always are more bound to treat <lb/>
            our friends with more kindness when they are ailing ? So, <lb/>
            too, this man is sick in his mind; we ought to help him, <lb/>
            and bear with him ; folly is a disease of the mind.</p><pb n="214"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin">[BK. VII.</note>XVII. I think here we ought to make a distinction, in <lb/>
            order to render this point more intelligible. Benefits are <lb/>
            of two kinds: one, the perfect and true benefit, which can <lb/>
            only be bestowed by one wise man upon another; the other, <lb/>
            the common vulgar form which ignorant men like ourselves <lb/>
            interchange. With regard to the latter, there is no doubt <lb/>
            that it is my duty to repay it whether my friend turns out <lb/>
            to be a murderer, a thief, or an adulterer. Crimes have <lb/>
            laws to punish them; criminals are better reformed by <lb/>
            judges than by ingratitude; a man ought not to make you <lb/>
            bad by being so himself. I will fling a benefit back to a bad <lb/>
            man, I will return it to a good man; I do so to the latter, <lb/>
            because I owe it to him; to the former, that I may not be <lb/>
            in his debt.</p>
          <p>XVIII. With regard to the other class of benefit, the <lb/>
            question arises whether if I was not able to take it <lb/>
            without being a wise man, I am able to return it, except to <lb/>
            a wise man. For suppose I do return it to him, he cannot <lb/>
            receive it, he is not any longer able to receive such a thing, <lb/>
            he has lost the knowledge of how to use it. You would <lb/>
            not bid me throw back a ball to a man who has lost his <lb/>
            hand ; it is folly to give any one what he cannot receive. <lb/>
            If I am to begin to reply to the last argument, I say <lb/>
            that I should not give him what he is unable to take; but <lb/>
            I would return it, even though he is not able to receive it. <lb/>
            I cannot lay him under an obligation unless he takes my <lb/>
            bounty; but by returning it I can free myself from my <lb/>
            obligations to him. You say," he will Dot be able to use it." <lb/>
            Let him see to that; the fault will lie with him, not with me.</p>
          <p>XIX. " To return a thing," says our adversary, " is to <lb/>
            hand it over to one who can receive it. Why, if you owed <lb/>
            some wine to any man, and he bade you pour it into a net <lb/>
            or a sieve, would you say that you had returned it ? or <lb/>
            would you be willing to return it in such a way that in the <note type="footnote"> 1 i.e. in the game of ball. </note> <pb n="215"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XIX.] </note><lb/>
            act of returning it was lost between you ? " To return is <lb/>
            to give that which you owe back to its owner when he <lb/>
            wishes for it. It is not my duty to perform more than <lb/>
            this; that he should possess what he has received from <lb/>
            me is a matter for further consideration; I do not owe <lb/>
            him the safe-keeping of his property, but the honourable <lb/>
            payment of my debt, and it is much better that he should <lb/>
            not have it, than that I should not return it to him. I would <lb/>
            repay my creditor, even though he would at once take what <lb/>
            I paid him to the market; even if he deputed an adulteress <lb/>
            to receive the money from me, I would pay it to her; even <lb/>
            if he were to pour the coins which he receives into a loose <lb/>
            fold of his cloak, I would pay it. It is my business to <lb/>
            return it to him, not to keep it and save it for him after I <lb/>
            have returned it; I am bound to take care of his bounty <lb/>
            when I have received it, but not when I have returned it <lb/>
            to him. While it remains with me, it must be kept safe; <lb/>
            but when he asks for it again I must give it to him, even <lb/>
            though it slips out of his hands as he takes it. I will <lb/>
            repay a good man when it is convenient; I will repay a <lb/>
            bad man when he asks me to do so.</p>
          <p>"You cannot," argues our adversary, “ return him a <lb/>
            benefit of the same kind as that which you received; for <lb/>
            you received it from a wise man, and you are returning it <lb/>
            to a fool" Do I not return to him such a benefit, as he is <lb/>
            now able to receive ? It is not my fault if I return it to <lb/>
            him worse than I received it, the fault lies with him, and <lb/>
            so, unless he regains his former wisdom, I shall return it <lb/>
            in such a form as he in his fallen condition is able to <lb/>
            receive. "But what," asks he, "if he become not only <lb/>
            bad, but savage and ferocious, like Apollodorus or Phalaris, <lb/>
            would you return even to such a man as this a benefit <lb/>
            which you had received from him?" I answer, Nature <lb/>
            does not admit of so great a change in a wise man. Men <lb/>
            do not change from the best to the worst; even in becoming <pb n="216"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VII.</note><lb/>
            bad, he would necessarily retain some traces of goodness; <lb/>
            virtue is never so utterly quenched as not to imprint on <lb/>
            the mind marks which no degradation can efface. If wild <lb/>
            animals bred in captivity escape into the woods, they still <lb/>
            retain something of their original tameness, and are as re­ <lb/>
            mote from the gentlest in the one extreme as they are in <lb/>
            the other from those which have always been wild, and have <lb/>
            never endured to be touched by man's hand. No one who has <lb/>
            ever applied himself to philosophy ever becomes completely <lb/>
            wicked; his mind becomes so deeply coloured with it, that <lb/>
            its tints can never be entirely spoiled and blackened. In <lb/>
            the next place, I ask whether this man of yours be ferocious <lb/>
            merely in intent, or whether he breaks out into actual out­ <lb/>
            rages upon mankind? You have instanced the tyrants <lb/>
            Apollodorua and Phalaris; if the bad man restrains their <lb/>
            evil likeness within himself, why should I not return his bene­ <lb/>
            fit to him, in order to set myself free from any further dealings <lb/>
            with him ? If, however, he not only delights in human blood, <lb/>
            but feeds upon it; if he exercises his insatiable cruelty in <lb/>
            the torture of persons of all ages, and his fury is not <lb/>
            prompted by anger, but by a sort of delight in cruelty, if <lb/>
            he cuts the throats of children before the eyes of their <lb/>
            parents ; if, not satisfied with merely killing his vic­ <lb/>
            tims, he tortures them, and not only burns but actually <lb/>
            roasts them ; if his castle is always wet with freshly shed <lb/>
            blood; then it is not enough not to return his benefits. All <lb/>
            connexion between me and such a man has been broken <lb/>
            off by his destruction of the bonds of human society. If <lb/>
            he had bestowed something upon me, but were to invade <lb/>
            my native country, he would have lost all claim to my <lb/>
            gratitude, and it would be counted a crime to make him any <lb/>
            return ; if he does not attack my country, but is the scourge <lb/>
            of his own; if he has nothing to do with my nation, <lb/>
            but torments and cuts to pieces his own, then in the same <lb/>
            manner such depravity, though it does not render him my <pb n="217"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XX.] </note><lb/>
            personal enemy, yet renders him hateful to me, and the <lb/>
            duty which I owe to the human race is anterior to and <lb/>
            more important than that which I owe to him as an <lb/>
            individual.</p>
          <p>XX. However, although this be so, and although I am <lb/>
            freed from all obligation towards him, from the moment <lb/>
            when, by outraging all laws, he rendered it impossible for <lb/>
            any man to do him a wrong, nevertheless, I think I ought <lb/>
            to make the following distinction in dealing with him. <lb/>
            If my repayment of his benefit will neither increase nor <lb/>
            maintain his powers of doing mischief to mankind, and is <lb/>
            of such a character that I can return it to him without <lb/>
            disadvantage to the public, I would return it: for instance, <lb/>
            I would save the life of his infant child; for what harm <lb/>
            can this benefit do to any of those who suffer from his <lb/>
            cruelty? But I would not furnish him with money to <lb/>
            pay his bodyguard. If he wishes for marbles, or fine <lb/>
            clothes, the trappings of his luxury will harm no one; <lb/>
            but with soldiers and arms I would not furnish him. <lb/>
            If he demands, as a great boon, actors and courtesans <lb/>
            and such things as will soften his savage nature, I would <lb/>
            willingly bestow them upon him. I would not furnish <lb/>
            him with triremes and brass-beaked ships of war, but I <lb/>
            would send him fast sailing and luxuriously-fitted vessels, <lb/>
            and all the toys of kings who take their pleasure on the <lb/>
            sea. If his health was altogether despaired of, I would <lb/>
            by the same act bestow a benefit on all men and return <lb/>
            one to him; seeing that for such characters death is the <lb/>
            only remedy, and that he who never will return to himself, <lb/>
            had best leave himself. However, such wickedness as this <lb/>
            is uncommon, and is always regarded as a portent, as when <lb/>
            the earth opens, or when fires break forth from caves <lb/>
            under the sea; so let us leave it, and speak of those <lb/>
            vices which we can hate without shuddering at them. As <lb/>
            for the ordinary bad man, whom I can find in the market- <pb n="218"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VII.</note><lb/>
            place of any town, who is feared only by individuals, I <lb/>
            would return to him a benefit which I had received from <lb/>
            him. It is not right that I should profit by his wicked­ <lb/>
            ness ; let me return what is not mine to its owner. Whether <lb/>
            he be good or bad makes no difference; but I would con­ <lb/>
            sider the matter most carefully, if I were not returning but <lb/>
            bestowing it.</p>
          <p>XXI. This point requires to be illustrated by a story. A <lb/>
            certain Pythagoraean bought a fine pair of shoes from a <lb/>
            shoemaker; and as they were an expensive piece of work, <lb/>
            he did not pay ready money for them. Some time after­ <lb/>
            wards he came to the shop to pay for them, and after he <lb/>
            had long been knocking at the closed door, some one said <lb/>
            to him, " Why do you waste your time ? The shoemaker <lb/>
            whom you seek has been carried out of his house and <lb/>
            buried; this is a grief to us who lose our friends for ever, <lb/>
            but by no means so to you, who know that he will be born <lb/>
            again," jeering at the Pythagoraean. Upon this our phi­ <lb/>
            losopher not unwillingly carried his three or four denarii <lb/>
            home again, shaking them every now and then; afterwards, <lb/>
            blaming himself for the pleasure which he had secretly felt at <lb/>
            not paying his debt, and perceiving that he enjoyed having <lb/>
            made this trifling gain, he returned to the shop, and saying, <lb/>
            “ the man lives for you, pay him what you owe," he passed <lb/>
            four denarii into the shop through the crack of the closed <lb/>
            door, and let them fall inside, punishing himself for his <lb/>
            unconscionable greediness that he might not form the habit <lb/>
            of appropriating that which is not his own.</p>
          <p>XXII. If you owe anything, seek for some one to whom <lb/>
            you may repay it, and if no one demands it, dun your own <lb/>
            self; whether the man be good or bad is no concern of <lb/>
            yours; repay him and then blame him. You have for­ <lb/>
            gotten, how your several duties are divided: it is right for <lb/>
            him to forget it, but we have bidden you bear it in mind. <lb/>
            When, however, we say that he who bestows a benefit ought <pb n="219"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXIII.] </note><lb/>
            to forget it, it is a mistake to suppose that we rob him of all <lb/>
            recollection of the business, though it is most creditable to <lb/>
            him ; some of our precepts are stated over strictly in order to <lb/>
            reduce them to their true proportions. When We say that he <lb/>
            ought not to remember it, we mean he ought not to speak <lb/>
            publicly, or boast of it offensively. There are some who, <lb/>
            when they have bestowed a benefit, tell it in all societies, <lb/>
            talk of it when sober, cannot be silent about it when drunk, <lb/>
            force it upon strangers, and communicate it to friends; it <lb/>
            is to quell this excessive and reproachful consciousness that <lb/>
            we bid him who gave it f( get it, and by commanding him <lb/>
            to do this, which is more than he is able, encourage him to <lb/>
            keep silence.</p>
          <p>XXIII. When you distrust those whom you order to do <lb/>
            anything, you ought to command them to do more than <lb/>
            enough in order that they may do what is enough. The <lb/>
            purpose of all exaggeration is to arrive at the truth by false­ <lb/>
            hood. Consequently, he who spoke of horses as being : <lb/>
            " Whiter than snows and swifter than the winds," <lb/>
            said what could not possibly be in order that they might be <lb/>
            thought to be as much so as possible. And he who said: <lb/>
            " More firm than crags, more headlong than the stream," <lb/>
            did not suppose that he should make any one believe that a <lb/>
            man could ever be as firm as a crag. Exaggeration never hopes <lb/>
            all its daring flights to be believed, but affirms what is in­ <lb/>
            credible, that thereby it may convey what is credible. When <lb/>
            we say, " let the man who has bestowed a benefit, forget it," <lb/>
            what we mean is, " let him be as though he had forgotten it; <lb/>
            let not his remembrance of it appear or be seen." When we <lb/>
            say that repayment of a benefit ought not to be demanded, <lb/>
            we do not utterly forbid its being demanded; for repayment <lb/>
            must often be extorted from bad men, and even good men <lb/>
            require to be reminded of it. Am I not to point out a <lb/>
            means of repayment to one who does not perceive it? Am <pb n="220"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VII.</note><lb/>
            I not to explain my wants to one does not know them ? <lb/>
            Why should he (if a bad man) have the excuse, or (if a <lb/>
            good man) have the sorrow of not knowing them ? Men <lb/>
            ought sometimes to be reminded of their debts, though with <lb/>
            modesty, not in the tone of one demanding a legal right.</p>
          <p>XXIV. Socrates once said in the hearing of his friends: <lb/>
            " I would have bought a cloak, if I had had the money for <lb/>
            it." He asked no one for money, but he reminded them all <lb/>
            to give it. There was a rivalry between them, as to who <lb/>
            should give it; and how should there not be ? Was it not a <lb/>
            small thing which Socrates received ? Yes, but it was a great <lb/>
            thing to be the man from whom Socrates received it. <lb/>
            Could he blame them more gently? “I would," said he, <lb/>
            "have bought a cloak if I had had the money for it." <lb/>
            After this, however eager any one was to give, he gave too <lb/>
            late; for he had already been wanting in his duty to <lb/>
            Socrates. Because some men harshly demand repayment <lb/>
            of debts, we forbid it, not in order that it may never be <lb/>
            done, but that it may be done sparingly.</p>
          <p>XXV. Aristippus once, when enjoying a perfume, said: <lb/>
            Bad luck to those effeminate persons who have brought <lb/>
            so nice a thing into disrepute." We also may say, " Bad <lb/>
            luck to those base extortioners who pester us for a fourfold <lb/>
            return of their benefits, and have brought into disrepute <lb/>
            so nice a thing as reminding our friends of their duty." I <lb/>
            shall nevertheless make use of this right of friendship, and <lb/>
            I shall demand the return of a benefit from any man from <lb/>
            whom I would not have scrupled to ask for one, such a man <lb/>
            as would regard the power of returning a benefit as equiva­ <lb/>
            lent to receiving a second one. Never, not even when <lb/>
            complaining of him, would I say, <lb/>
            “ A wretch forlorn upon the shore he lay, <lb/>
            His ship, his comrades, all were swept away; <lb/>
            Fool that I was, I pitied his despair, <lb/>
            And even gave him of my realm a share." <pb n="221"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXVI.] </note><lb/>
            This is not to remind, but to reproach; this is to make <lb/>
            one's benefits odious to enable him, or even to make him <lb/>
            wish to be ungrateful. It is enough, and more than <lb/>
            enough, to remind him of it gently and familiarly: <lb/>
            " If aught of mine hath e'er deserved thy thanks." <lb/>
            To this his answer would be, " Of course you have deserved <lb/>
            my thanks; you took me up, ' a wretch forlorn upon the <lb/>
            shore.' "</p>
          <p>XXVI. " But," says our adversary, " suppose that we <lb/>
            gain nothing by this; suppose that he pretends that he <lb/>
            has forgotten it, what ought I to do ? " You now ask a <lb/>
            very necessary question, and one which fitly concludes this <lb/>
            branch of the subject, how, namely, one ought to bear with <lb/>
            the ungrateful. I answer, calmly, gently, magnanimously. <lb/>
            Never let any one's discourtesy, forgetfulness, or ingrati­ <lb/>
            tude, enrage you so much that you do not feel any pleasure <lb/>
            at having bestowed a benefit upon him; never let your <lb/>
            wrongs drive you into saying, " I wish I had not done it." <lb/>
            You ought to take pleasure even in the ill-success of your bene­ <lb/>
            fit; he will always be sorry for it, even though you are not <lb/>
            even now sorry for it. You ought not to be indignant, as if <lb/>
            something strange had happened ; you ought rather to be <lb/>
            surprised if it had not happened. Some are prevented by <lb/>
            difficulties, some by expense, and some by danger from <lb/>
            returning your bounty; some are hindered by a false <lb/>
            shame, because by returning it, they would confess that <lb/>
            they had received it; with others ignorance of their duty, <lb/>
            indolence, or excess of business, stands in the way. Reflect <lb/>
            upon the insatiability of men's desires. You need not be <lb/>
            surprised if no one repays you in a world in which no one <lb/>
            ever gains enough. What man is there of so firm and <lb/>
            trustworthy a mind that you can safely invest your bene­ <lb/>
            fits in him ? One man is crazed with lust, another is the <lb/>
            slave of his belly, another gives his whole soul to gain, <pb n="222"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VII.</note><lb/>
            caring nothing for the means by which he amasses it; <lb/>
            some men's minds are disturbed by envy, some blinded by <lb/>
            ambition till they are ready to fling themselves on the <lb/>
            sword's point. In addition to this, one must reckon <lb/>
            sluggishness of mind and old age ; and also the opposites <lb/>
            of these, restlessness and disturbance of mind, also exces­ <lb/>
            sive self-esteem and pride in the very things for which a <lb/>
            man ought to be despised. I need not mention obstinate <lb/>
            persistence in wrong-doing, or frivolity which cannot <lb/>
            remain constant to one point; besides all this, there is <lb/>
            headlong rashness, there is timidity which never gives us <lb/>
            trustworthy counsel, and the numberless errors with which <lb/>
            we struggle, the rashness of the most cowardly, the quar­ <lb/>
            rels of our best friends, and that most common evil of <lb/>
            trusting in what is most uncertain, and of undervaluing, <lb/>
            when we have obtained it, that which we once never hoped <lb/>
            to possess. Amidst all these restless passions, how can <lb/>
            you hope to find a thing so full of rest as good faith ?</p>
          <p>XXVII. If a true picture of our life were to rise before <lb/>
            your mental vision, you would, I think, behold a scene like <lb/>
            that of a town just taken by storm, where decency and righ­ <lb/>
            teousness were no longer regarded, and no advice is heard <lb/>
            but that of force, as if universal confusion were the word of <lb/>
            command. Neither fire nor sword are spared; crime is <lb/>
            unpunished by the laws; even religion, which saves the lives <lb/>
            of suppliants in the very midst of armed enemies, does not <lb/>
            check those who are rushing to secure plunder. Some men <lb/>
            rQb private houses, some public buildings; all places, sacred <lb/>
            or profane, are alike stripped; some burst their way in, <lb/>
            others climb over; some open a wider path for them­ <lb/>
            selves by overthrowing the walls that keep them out, <lb/>
            and make their way to their booty over ruins; some <lb/>
            ravage without murdering, others brandish spoils dripping <lb/>
            with their owner's blood; everyone carries off his neigh­ <lb/>
            bours' goods. In this greedy struggle of the human race <pb n="223"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXVIII.] </note><lb/>
            surely you forget the common lot of all mankind, if you <lb/>
            seek among these robbers for one who will return what he <lb/>
            has got. If you are indignant at men being ungrateful, <lb/>
            you ought also to be indignant at their being luxurious, <lb/>
            avaricious and lustful; you might as well be indignant <lb/>
            with sick men for being ugly, or with old men for being <lb/>
            pale. It is, indeed, a serious vice, it is not to be borne, and <lb/>
            sets men at variance with one another; nay, it rends and <lb/>
            destroys that union by which alone our human weakness can <lb/>
            be supported; yet it is so absolutely universal, that even <lb/>
            those who complain of it most are not themselves free from it.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. Consider within yourself, whether you have <lb/>
            always shown gratitude to those to whom you owe it, <lb/>
            whether no one's kindness has ever been wasted upon you, <lb/>
            whether you constantly bear in mind all the benefits which <lb/>
            you have received. You will find that those which you <lb/>
            received as a boy were forgotten before you became a man; <lb/>
            that those bestowed upon you as a young man slipped from <lb/>
            your memory when you became an old one. Some we <lb/>
            have lost, some we have thrown away, some have by <lb/>
            degrees passed out of our sight, to some we have wilfully <lb/>
            shut our eyes. If I am to make excuses for your weakness, <lb/>
            I must say in the first place that human memory is a frail <lb/>
            vessel, and is not large enough to contain the mass of <lb/>
            things placed in it; the more it receives, the more it must <lb/>
            necessarily lose; the oldest things in it give way to the <lb/>
            newest. Thus it comes to pass that your nurse has hardly <lb/>
            any influence with you, because the lapse of time has set <lb/>
            the kindness which you received from her at so great a <lb/>
            distance; thus it is that you no longer look upon your <lb/>
            teacher with respect; and that now when you are busy <lb/>
            about your candidature for the consulate or the priesthood, <lb/>
            you forget those who supported you in your election to the <lb/>
            quaestorship. If you carefully examine yourself, perhaps <lb/>
            you will find the vice of which you complain in your own <pb n="224"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VII.</note><lb/>
            bosom; you are wrong in being angry with a universal <lb/>
            failing, and foolish also, for it is your own as well; you <lb/>
            must pardon others, that you may yourself be acquitted. <lb/>
            You will make your friend a better man by bearing with <lb/>
            him, you will in all cases make him a worse one by re­ <lb/>
            preaching him. You can have no reason for rendering him <lb/>
            shameless; let him preserve any remnants of modesty <lb/>
            which he may have. Too loud reproaches have often dis­ <lb/>
            pelled a modesty which might have borne good fruit. No <lb/>
            man fears to be that which all men see that he is; when <lb/>
            his fault is made public, he loses his sense of shame.</p>
          <p>XXIX. You say, " I have lost the benefit which I be­ <lb/>
            stowed." Yet do we say that we have lost what we conse­ <lb/>
            crate to heaven, and a benefit well bestowed, even though <lb/>
            we get an ill return for it, is to be reckoned among things <lb/>
            .consecrated. Our friend is not such a man as we hoped he <lb/>
            was; still, let us, unlike him, remain the same as we were. <lb/>
            The loss did not take place when he proved himself so; his <lb/>
            ingratitude cannot be made public without reflecting some <lb/>
            shame upon us, since to complain of the lossof a benefit is <lb/>
            a sign that it was not well bestowed. As far as we are able <lb/>
            we ought to plead with ourselves on his behalf: " Perhaps <lb/>
            he was not able to return it, perhaps he did not know of it, <lb/>
            perhaps he will still do so." A wise and forbearing creditor <lb/>
            prevents the loss of some debts by encouraging his debtor <lb/>
            and giving him time. We ought to do the same, we ought <lb/>
            to deal tenderly with a weakly sense of honour.</p>
          <p>XXX. " I have lost," say you, " the benefit which I be. <lb/>
            stowed." You are a fool, and do not understand when <lb/>
            your loss took place; you have indeed lost it, but you did <lb/>
            so when you gave it, the fact has only now come to light. <lb/>
            Even in the case of those benefits which appear to be lost, <lb/>
            gentleness will do much good; the wounds of the mind <lb/>
            ought to be handled as tenderly as those of the body. The <lb/>
            string, which might be disentangled by patience, is often <pb n="225"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXXI.] </note><lb/>
            broken by a rough pull. What is the use of abuse, or of <lb/>
            complaints ? why do you overwhelm him with reproaches ? <lb/>
            why do you set him free from his obligation ? even if he be <lb/>
            ungrateful he owes you nothing after this. What sense is <lb/>
            there in exasperating a man on whom you have conferred <lb/>
            great favours, so as out of a doubtful friend to make a <lb/>
            certain enemy, and one, too, who will seek to support his <lb/>
            own cause by defaming you, or to make men say, " I do <lb/>
            not know what the reason is that he cannot endure a <lb/>
            man to whom he owes so much; there must be some­ <lb/>
            thing in the background ? " Any man can asperse, even if <lb/>
            he does not permanently stain the reputation of his betters <lb/>
            by complaining of them; nor will any one be satisfied <lb/>
            with imputing small crimes to them, when it is only by <lb/>
            the enormity of his falsehood that he can hope to be <lb/>
            believed.</p>
          <p>XXXI. What a much better way is that by which the <lb/>
            semblance of friendship, and, indeed, if the other regains to <lb/>
            his right mind, friendship itself is preserved ! Bad men are <lb/>
            overcome by unwearying goodness, nor does any one receive <lb/>
            kindness in so harsh and hostile a spirit as not to love good <lb/>
            men even while he does them wrong, when they lay him <lb/>
            under the additional obligation of requiring no return <lb/>
            for their kindness. Reflect, then, upon this: you say, <lb/>
            " My kindness has met with no return, what am I to <lb/>
            do ? I ought to imitate the gods, those noblest disposers <lb/>
            of all events, who begin to bestow their benefits on those <lb/>
            who know them not, and persist in bestowing them on <lb/>
            those who are ungrateful for them. Some reproach them <lb/>
            with neglect of us, some with injustice towards us ; others <lb/>
            place them outside of their own world, in sloth and in­ <lb/>
            difference, without light, and without any functions ; others <lb/>
            declare that the sun itself, to whom we owe the division of <lb/>
            our times of labour and of rest, by whose means we are <note type="footnote"> Q </note> <pb n="226"/>
             <note type="margin">[BK. VII.</note><lb/>
            saved from being plunged in the darkness of eternal night; <lb/>
            who by his circuit orders the seasons of the year, gives <lb/>
            strength to our bodies, brings forth our crops and ripens <lb/>
            our fruits, is merely a mass of stone, or a fortuitous collec­ <lb/>
            tion of fiery particles, or anything rather than a god. Yet, <lb/>
            nevertheless, like the kindest of parents, who only smile at <lb/>
            the spiteful words of their children, the gods do not cease <lb/>
            to heap benefits upon those who doubt from what source <lb/>
            their benefits are derived, but continue impartially distri­ <lb/>
            buting their bounty among all the peoples and nations of <lb/>
            the earth. Possessing only the power of doing good, they <lb/>
            moisten the land with seasonable showers, they put the <lb/>
            seas in movement by the winds, they mark time by the <lb/>
            course of the constellations, they temper the extremes of <lb/>
            heat and cold, of summer and winter, by breathing a <lb/>
            milder air upon us; and they graciously and serenely bear <lb/>
            with the faults of our erring spirits. Let us follow their <lb/>
            example ; let us give, even if much be given to no purpose, <lb/>
            let us, in spite of this, give to others ; nay, even to those <lb/>
            upon whom our bounty has been wasted. No one is pre­ <lb/>
            vented by the fall of a house from building another ; when <lb/>
            one home has been destroyed by fire, we lay the foundations <lb/>
            of another before the site has had time to cool; we rebuild <lb/>
            ruined cities more than once upon the same spots, so un­ <lb/>
            tiring are our hopes of success. Men would undertake no <lb/>
            works either on land or sea if they were not willing to try <lb/>
            again what they have failed in once.</p>
          <p>XXXII. Suppose a man is ungrateful, he does not in­ <lb/>
            jure me, but himself; I had the enjoyment of my benefit <lb/>
            when I bestowed it upon him. Because he is ungrateful, I <lb/>
            shall not be slower to give but more careful; what I have <lb/>
            lost with him, I shall receive back from others. But I will <lb/>
            bestow a second benefit upon this man himself, and will <lb/>
            overcome him even as a good husbandman overcomes the <pb n="227"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. XXXII.] </note><lb/>
            sterility of the soil by care and culture; if I do not do so <lb/>
            my benefit is lost to me, and he is lost to mankind. It is <lb/>
            no proof of a great mind to give and to throw away one's <lb/>
            bounty; the true test of a great mind is to throw away <lb/>
            one's bounty and still to give."</p><pb n="228"/>
