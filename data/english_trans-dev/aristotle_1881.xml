          </head>
          <p>THE present translation of Aristotle's Politics is based on <lb/>
            the well-known version of Ellis, in the revision of which the <lb/>
            translation of Taylor, and the polished paraphrase of Gillies, <lb/>
            have been consulted. The text of Bekker has been followed, <lb/>
            and only departed from where the emendations of Goettling <lb/>
            and others appeared preferable. Analyses of both the Po­ <lb/>
            litics and Economics have been prefixed, which, it is hoped, <lb/>
            will be found of service to the student. The valuable In­ <lb/>
            troduction to the Politics by Dr. Gillies is reprinted entire, <lb/>
            as giving, on the whole, the clearest general view of the <lb/>
            subject.</p>

          <p>IT is my design in the present work to give a more distinct, <lb/>
            and, I flatter myself, a juster view, than has yet been exhibit­ <lb/>
            ed, of the learning of an age, the most illustrious in history for <lb/>
            great events and extraordinary revolutions, yet still more pre- <lb/>
            eminent in speculation than it is renowned in action. A cen­ <lb/>
            tury before the reign of Alexander the Great, there sprang <lb/>
            up and flourished in Greece a species of learning, or science, <lb/>
            totally unlike to any thing before known in the world. This <lb/>
            science was carried to its highest perfection by Aristotle: it <lb/>
            decayed with the loss of his writings, and revived with their <lb/>
            recovery. But the imperfect and corrupt state of those writ­ <lb/>
            ings rendered them peculiarly liable to be misinterpreted by <lb/>
            ignorance, and misrepresented by envy; his philosophy, there­ <lb/>
            fore, has been less frequently inculcated or explained, than <lb/>
            disguised, perverted, and calumniated. It has not, certainly, <lb/>
            since his own time, received any material improvement. To <lb/>
            the philosophical works of Cicero, though that illustrious Ro­ <lb/>
            mar professes to follow other guides, the world at large is <lb/>
            more indebted for a familiar notion of several of Aristotle's <lb/>
            most important doctrines, than to the labours of all his com­ <note type="footnote"> b </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="ii"/>
            mentators1 collectively. But how loose and feeble, and often <lb/>
            how erroneous, is the Roman transcript, when compared with <lb/>
            the energetic precision of the Greek original! Yet the works <lb/>
            of Cicero are known universally to the whole literary world, <lb/>
            while those of Aristotle (with the exception of a few short <lb/>
            and popular treatises) are allowed to moulder away in the <lb/>
            dust of our libraries, and condemned to a treatment little less <lb/>
            ignominious than that which, as we shall have occasion to re­ <lb/>
            late, befell them soon after their composition, when they were <lb/>
            immured in a dungeon, and remained for near two centuries <lb/>
            a prey to dampness and to worms. It is time once more to <lb/>
            release them from their second unmerited captivity; to revive, <lb/>
            and, if possible, to brighten the well-earned fame of an author, <lb/>
            sometimes as preposterously admired, as at others unaccount­ <lb/>
            ably neglected; and whose fate with posterity is most sin- <note type="footnote"> I All these commentators lived many centuries after Aristotle. They <lb/>
            are Greek, Arabic, and Latin. The first began in the age of the Antonines, <lb/>
            in Alexander Aphrodisiensis at Rome, and Ammonius Sacchus in Alex­ <lb/>
            andria ; they continued to flourish through the whole succession of Ro­ <lb/>
            man emperors, under the once revered names of Aspasius, Plotinus, Por­ <lb/>
            phyry, Proclus, the second Ammonius, Simplicius, and Philoponus. <lb/>
            Aristotle was ardently studied, or rather superstitiously adored, by the <lb/>
            Saracens, during upwards of four centuries of their proud domination, <lb/>
            till the taking of Bagdat by the Tartars in 1258. The names of the <lb/>
            Arabian commentators, Alfarabius, Avicenna, and Averroes, long re­ <lb/>
            sounded even in the schools of Europe. But the Aristotelian philosophy, <lb/>
            or rather logic, had early assumed a Latin dress in the translation of <lb/>
            Boethius Severinus, the last illustrious consul of Rome, in the beginning <lb/>
            of the sixth century. After a long interval of more than six hundred <lb/>
            years, Latin translations and commentaries began to abound, through the <lb/>
            industry of Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, and the succeeding <lb/>
            scholastics; and multiplied to such a pitch, that, towards the close of the <lb/>
            sixteenth century, Patricius reckons twelve thousand commentators on <lb/>
            different works of the Stagirite. (Discuss. Peripatet.) This vast and <lb/>
            cold mass of Gothic and Saracenic dulness is now consigned to just ob­ <lb/>
            livion. But even to the best of Aristotle's commentators there are two <lb/>
            unanswerable objections: first, they universally confound his solid sense <lb/>
            with the fanciful visions of Plato, thus endeavouring to reconcile things <lb/>
            totally incongruous: secondly, they ascribe to their great master innu­ <lb/>
            merable opinions which he did not hold, by making him continuat dog­ <lb/>
            matize, where he only means to discuss. To the same objections those <lb/>
            more modern writers are liable, who have drawn their knowledge of Aris­ <lb/>
            totle's philosophy from any other than the original fountain. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="iii"/>
            gular in this, not that his authority should have been most <lb/>
            respected in the ages least qualified to appreciate his merit, <lb/>
            but that philosophers should have despised his name almost <lb/>
            exactly in proportion as they adopted his opinions. The mul­ <lb/>
            tiplied proofs of this assertion, which I shall have occasion to <lb/>
            produce in examining his works, will not, it is presumed, ap­ <lb/>
            pear uninteresting to men of letters. Those who know some­ <lb/>
            thing of Aristotle, must naturally be desirous of knowing all <lb/>
            that can be told; and of seeing, comprised within a narrow <lb/>
            compass, the life and writings of a man, whose intellectual <lb/>
            magnitude ought to have preserved and shown him in his <lb/>
            proper shape to the impartial eye of history, but whose pic­ <lb/>
            ture, beyond that of all other great characters, has been most <lb/>
            miserably mangled.</p>
          <p>Aristotle, who flourished in Athens when Athens was the <lb/>
            ornament of Greece, and Greece, under Alexander, the first <lb/>
            country on earth, was born at Stagira towards the beginning <lb/>
            of the 99th Olympiad, eighty-five years after the birth <lb/>
            of Socrates,1 and three hundred and eighty-four before the <lb/>
            birth of Christ. The city of Stagira2 stood on the coast of <lb/>
            Thrace, in a district called the Chalcidic region, and near to <lb/>
            the innermost recess of the Strymonic Gulf.3 It was origin­ <lb/>
            ally built by the Andrians,4 afterwards enlarged by a colony <note type="footnote"> 1 Socrates drank the hemlock, according to most authors, the first year <lb/>
            of the 95th Olympiad; and, according to Diodorus Siculus, the first year <lb/>
            of the 97th. Socrates therefore died at least eight years before Aristotle <lb/>
            was born. The latter was one year older than Philip, and three years <lb/>
            older than Demosthenes. Vide Dionys. Halicarn. Epist. ad Ammæum. <lb/>
            This chronology is clearly ascertained by various critics. See Bayle's <lb/>
            Dictionary, article " Aristotle." I know not therefore why Lord Mon­ <lb/>
            boddo and the late Mr. Harris (two modern writers who have paid great <lb/>
            attention to Aristotle's works) should say, and frequently repeat, on no <lb/>
            better authority than that of the Life of Aristotle ascribed to Ammonius, <lb/>
            or Johannes Philoponus, that the Stagirite was three years a scholar of <lb/>
            Socrates. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Strabo Excerpt, ex lib. vii. p. 331. He calls the place Stageirus. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Ptolemei Geograph. According to his division, Stagira was in the <lb/>

            from Eubœan Chalcis,l and long numbered among the Greek <lb/>
            cities of Thrace, until the conquests of Philip of Macedon <lb/>
            extended the name of his country far beyond the river Stry­ <lb/>
            mon, to the confines of Mount Rhodope.2 Stagira, as well as <lb/>
            the neighbouring Greek cities, enjoyed the precarious dignity <lb/>
            of independent government; it was the ally of Athens in the <lb/>
            Peloponnesian war, and, like other nominal allies, experienced <lb/>
            the stern dominion of that tyrannical republic. It afterwards <lb/>
            became subject to the city and commonwealth of Olynthus; <lb/>
            which, having subdued Stagira and the whole region of Chal­ <lb/>
            cidice, was itself besieged by Philip of Macedon; and, with <lb/>
            all its dependencies, reduced by the arms or arts of that politic <lb/>
            prince, in the first year of the 108th Olympiad, and 348 <lb/>
            years before the Christian era.3 That the resistance of Sta­ <lb/>
            gira was obstinate, may be inferred from the severity of its <lb/>
            punishment; the conqueror rased it to the ground.4 Aris­ <lb/>
            totle, who was then in his thirty-seventh year, had been re­ <lb/>
            moved from Stagira almost in his childhood; and he appears <lb/>
            not, in that long interval, to have ever resided in it, and even <lb/>
            rarely to have visited it.5 But the misfortunes which fell on <lb/>
            that city gave him an opportunity of showing such ardent af­ <lb/>
            fection for his birth-place, as is the indubitable proof of a <lb/>
            feeling heart. Through his influence with Alexander the <lb/>
            Great, Stagira was rebuilt;6 both its useful defences and its <lb/>
            ornamental edifices were restored; its wandering citizens were <note type="footnote">1 Just-in. 1. vii. c. 13. </note><note type="footnote"> a Thence the frivolous dispute among modern biographers, whether <lb/>

            Alexander, their admired sovereign, and the patriotism of <lb/>
            Aristotle, their illustrious townsman.1</p>
          <p>The city of Stagira indeed owes its celebrity wholly to <lb/>
            Aristotle and his family; and, if its name is still familiar to <lb/>
            modem ears, this proceeds merely from its having communi­ <lb/>
            cated to our philosopher the appellation of Stagirite.2 His <lb/>
            father, Nicomachus, who was the physician and friend3 of <lb/>
            Amyntas, king of Macedon, is said to have derived his descent, <lb/>
            through a long line of medical ancestors, from Æsculapius, <lb/>
            the companion of the Argonauts, whose skill in the healing <lb/>
            art had raised him to a seat among the gods.4 Nicomachus <lb/>
            improved a branch of knowledge, which was the inheritance <lb/>
            of his family, by writing six books on natural philosophy and <lb/>
            medicine.5 To the same illustrious origin which distinguished <lb/>
            Nicomachus, the testimony of one ancient biographer 6 (but his <lb/>
            only) traces up the blood of Phæstis, Aristotle's mother; who, <lb/>
            whatever was her parentage, certainly acknowledged for her <lb/>
            country7 the middle district of Euboea, which lies within <lb/>
            twelve miles of the Attic coast. Aristotle was deprived of <lb/>
            his parents in early youth ;8 yet it is an agreeable, and not <lb/>
            altogether an unwarranted conjecture, that by his father, Ni­ <lb/>
            comachus, he was inspired with that ardent love for the study <lb/>
            of nature, which made him long be regarded as her best and <note type="footnote"> 1 Plutarch, advers. Colot. p. 1126; and Ammonius in Vit.

            chosen interpreter; 1 while from his mother, Phæstis, he first <lb/>
            imbibed that pure and sweet Atticism which every where <lb/>
            pervades his writings.</p>
          <p>Aristotle also inherited from his parents a large fortune; <lb/>
            and their early loss was supplied and compensated by the <lb/>
            kind attentions of Proxenus, a citizen of Atarneus in Mysia, <lb/>
            who received the young Stagirite into his family, and skilfully <lb/>
            directed his education. These important obligations our <lb/>
            philosopher, in whose character gratitude appears to have <lb/>
            been a prominent feature, amply repaid to Nicanor the son of <lb/>
            Proxenus, whom he adopted, educated, and enriched.3 At <lb/>
            the age of seventeen,4 the young Stagirite was attracted by <lb/>
            the love of learning to Athens, and particularly by the desire <lb/>
            of hearing Plato in the Academy, the best school of science as <lb/>
            well as of morals then existing in the world; and where the <lb/>
            most assiduous student might find competitors worthy of ex­ <lb/>
            citing his emulation and sharpening his diligence. Plato early <lb/>
            observed of him, that he required the rein rather than the <lb/>
            spur.5 His industry in perusing and copying manuscripts <lb/>
            was unexampled, and almost incredible ; he was named, by <lb/>
            way of excellence, "the student or reader."6 Plato often <lb/>
            called him the " soul of his school;" 7 and, when Aristotle <lb/>
            happened to be absent from his prelections, often complained <lb/>
            that he spoke to a deaf audience.8 As the student advanced <lb/>
            in years, his acuteness was as extraordinary in canvassing <lb/>
            opinions, as his industry had been unrivalled in collecting <lb/>
            them :9 his capacious mind embraced the whole circle of sci­ <lb/>
            ence ; and, notwithstanding his pertinacity in rejecting every <lb/>
            principle or tenet which he could not on reflection approve, <note type="footnote"> 1 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αϱιστοτέλης τη̃ς φσεως γραμματεὺς ἠν</foreign>. Anonym. apud Suid. in <lb/>

            his very singular merit failed not to recommend him to the <lb/>
            discerning admiration of Plato, with whom he continued to <lb/>
            reside twenty years, even to his master's death; alike careless <lb/>
            of the honours of a court, to which the rank and connexions <lb/>
            of his family might have opened to him the road in Macedon ; <lb/>
            and indifferent to the glory of a name, which his great abilities <lb/>
            might early have attained, by establishing a separate school, <lb/>
            and founding a new sect in philosophy.1</p>
          <p>At the same time that Aristotle applied so assiduously to <lb/>
            the embellishment of his mind, he was not neglectful, we are <lb/>
            told, of whatever might adorn his person. His figure was <lb/>
            not advantageous; he was of a short stature, his eyes were <lb/>
            remarkably small, his limbs were disproportion ably slender, <lb/>
            and he lisped or stammered in his speech.2 For his ungra­ <lb/>
            cious person Aristotle is said to have been anxious to com­ <lb/>
            pensate by the finery and elegance of his dress; his mantle <lb/>
            was splendid; he wore rings of great value ; and he was fop­ <lb/>
            pish enough (such is the language of antiquity) to shave both <lb/>
            his head and his face, while the other scholars of Plato kept <lb/>
            their long hair and beards. To some learned men, the omis­ <lb/>
            sion of such particulars might appear unpardonable ; yet, in a <lb/>
            life of Aristotle, such particulars are totally unworthy of be­ <lb/>
            ing told; since his love for ostentatious finery (probably much <lb/>
            exaggerated by his enemies) was in him merely an accessory, <lb/>
            which neither altered his character, nor weakened that ardent <lb/>
            passion for knowledge which reigned sole mistress of his soul. <lb/>
            In men born for great intellectual achievements, this passion, <lb/>
            must, at some period of their lives, suppress and stifle every <lb/>
            other; and, while it continues to do so, their real happiness <lb/>
            is probably at its highest pitch. The pursuit of science in­ <lb/>
            deed, not having any natural limitations, might be supposed <lb/>
            to invigorate with manhood, to confirm itself through custom, <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">ου̃τε σχολὴν ἡγούμενος, οὒτε ἰδίαν πεποιη</foreign>к<foreign xml:lang="grc">ω̃ς αἳρεσιν</foreign>. Dionys. <lb/>

            and to operate through life with unceasing or increasing <lb/>
            energy. But this delightful progress is liable to be inter­ <lb/>
            rupted by other causes than the decline of health and the <lb/>
            decay of curiosity; for great exertions are not more certainly <lb/>
            rewarded by celebrity, than celebrity is punished with envy, <lb/>
            which will sometimes rankle in secret malice, and sometimes <lb/>
            vent itself in open reproach ; wrongs will provoke resentment; <lb/>
            injuries will be offered and retorted; and, a state of hostility <lb/>
            being thus commenced, the philosopher, in defending his opi­ <lb/>
            nions and his fame, becomes a prey to the wretched anxieties <lb/>
            incident to the vulgar scrambles of sordid interest and sense­ <lb/>
            less ambition. Of this melancholy remark, both the life and <lb/>
            the death of Aristotle, as we shall see hereafter, will afford <lb/>
            very forcible illustrations.</p>
          <p>Plato died in the first year of the 108th Olympiad, and 338 <lb/>
            years before the Christian era. He was succeeded in the <lb/>
            Academy by Speusippus, the son of his sister Potona; a man <lb/>
            far inferior to the Stagirite in abilities ; and however well he <lb/>
            might be acquainted with the theory, not strongly confirmed <lb/>
            in the practice, of moral virtue, since he was too often and too <lb/>
            easily vanquished both by anger and pleasure.1 Aristotle <lb/>
            appears not to have taken offence that, in the succession to <lb/>
            his admired master, the strong claim of merit should have <lb/>
            been sacrificed to the partialities of blood. In some of the <lb/>
            latest of his writings, he speaks of Plato with a degree of re­ <lb/>
            spect approaching to reverence. Soon after that philosopher's <lb/>
            decease, Aristotle wrote verses in his praise, and erected <lb/>
            altars to his honour: 2 and the connexions which he himself <lb/>
            had already formed with some of the most illustrious as well­ <lb/>
            as the most extraordinary personages of his own or any age, <lb/>
            might naturally inspire him with the design of leaving <lb/>
            Athens, after he had lost the philosopher and friend whose <lb/>
            fame had first drawn him thither, and whose instructive <lb/>
            society had so long retained him in that celebrated city.</p>
          <p>One of the memorable characters with whom Aristotle <note type="footnote"> 1 Diogen. Laert. in Speusipp. 2 Idem; and Ammonius in Aristot. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="ix"/>
            maintained a close and uninterrupted correspondence, was <lb/>
            Hermeias, styled, in the language of those days, tyrant of <lb/>
            Assus and Atarneus ; a man whose life forcibly illustrates the <lb/>
            Strange vicissitudes of fortune. Hermeias is called a slave and <lb/>
            a eunuch; 1 but he was a slave whose spirit was not to be <lb/>
            broken, and a eunuch whose mind was not to be emasculated. <lb/>
            Through the bounty of a wealthy patron, he had been enabled <lb/>
            early to gratify his natural taste for philosophy; and, having <lb/>
            become a fellow-student with Aristotle at Athens, soon united <lb/>
            with him in the bands of affectionate esteem, which finally <lb/>
            cemented into firm and unalterable friendship. Aristotle <lb/>
            through life pursued the calm and secure paths of science, but <lb/>
            Hermeias ventured to climb the dangerous heights of ambi­ <lb/>
            tion. His enterprising spirit, seconded by good fortune, raised <lb/>
            him to the sovereignty of Assus and Atarneus, Greek cities <lb/>
            of Mysia, the former situate in the district of Troas, the <lb/>
            latter in that of AEolis, and both of them, like most Grecian <lb/>
            colonies on the Asiatic coast, but loosely dependent on the <lb/>
            Persian empire. Hermeias availed himself of the weakness <lb/>
            or distance of the armies of Artaxerxes, and of the resources <lb/>
            with which his own ambition was supplied by a wealthy <lb/>
            banker, to gain possession of those strong-holds, with all their <lb/>
            dependencies ; and endeavoured to justify this bold usurpation <lb/>
            of the sceptre, by the manly firmness with which he held it. 2 <lb/>
            Upon the invitation of his royal friend, Aristotle, almost im­ <lb/>
            mediately after Plato's death, revisited Atarneus,3 the same <lb/>
            city in which he had spent the happy years of his youth under <lb/>
            the kind protection of Proxenus; and might we indulge the <lb/>
            conjecture that this worthy Atarnean still lived, our philoso­ <lb/>
            pher's voyage to Æolis must have been strongly recommended <lb/>
            by his desire of repaying the favours of a man whom his <lb/>
            gratitude always regarded as a second father, and of thus <note type="footnote"> 1 'Euv<foreign xml:lang="grc">ου̃χοςω̂</foreign>v <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ δου̃λος'Ερμείας</foreign>.His master's name was <lb/>

            propping, by his friendly aid, the declining age of his early <lb/>
            guardian.</p>
          <p>Aristotle found at Atarneus the wish of Plato realized; he <lb/>
            beheld, in his friend Hermeias, philosophy seated on a throne. <lb/>
            In that city he resided near three years, enjoying the inex­ <lb/>
            pressible happiness of seeing his enlightened political maxims <lb/>
            illustrated in the virtuous reign of his fellow-student and sove­ <lb/>
            reign. But, to render his condition enviable, an essential requi­ <lb/>
            site was wanting, namely, that of security. Artaxerxes, whose <lb/>
            success against the rebels in Egypt had exceeded his most san­ <lb/>
            guine hopes, could no longer brook the dismemberment of the <lb/>
            fair coast of Mysia, through the usurpation of a slave and a <lb/>
            eunuch. Mentor, 1 a Greek, and kinsman of Memnon the <lb/>
            Rhodian, a general so famous in the Persian annals, had sig­ <lb/>
            nalized his zeal and valour in the Egyptian war. He was <lb/>
            one of those crafty and unprincipled Greeks, whom the am­ <lb/>
            bitious hopes of raising a splendid fortune often drew to a <lb/>
            standard naturally hostile to their country; and his recent <lb/>
            merit with Artaxerxes recommended him as the fittest instru­ <lb/>
            ment to be employed in chastising the Mysian usurper. This <lb/>
            employment he did not decline, although the man whom he <lb/>
            was commissioned to destroy had formerly been numbered <lb/>
            among his friends.2 Mentor marched with a powerful army <lb/>
            to the western coast. He might have effected his purpose by <lb/>
            open force; but to accomplish it by stratagem, was both more <lb/>
            easy in itself, and more suitable to his character. He had <lb/>
            been connected with Hermeias by the sacred ties of hospi- <note type="footnote"> I Aristotle himself brands with infamy this successful knave, by con­ <lb/>

            tality; the sanctity of this connexion was revered by the <lb/>
            greatest profligates of antiquity; but the impious Menter <lb/>
            knew no religion but obedience to his master's commands. <lb/>
            He employed his former intimacy with Hermeias as the means <lb/>
            of decoying that unwary prince to an interview: Mentor <lb/>
            seized his person, and sent him privately to Upper Asia, <lb/>
            where, by order of Artaxerxes, he was hanged as a traitor. 1 <lb/>
            The cruel artifices of Mentor ended not with this tragedy. <lb/>
            Having possessed himself of the ring which the unfortunate <lb/>
            Hermeias usually employed as his signet, he sealed with it his <lb/>
            own despatches, and immediately sent them to the cities that <lb/>
            acknowledged the sovereignty of a man, whose mild exercise <lb/>
            of power tended, in the minds of his subjects, to justify the <lb/>
            irregular means by which he had acquired it. In these de­ <lb/>
            spatches Mentor signified that, through his own intercession, <lb/>
            Hermeias had obtained peace and pardon from the great <lb/>
            king. The magistrates of the revolted cities easily gave <lb/>
            credit to intelligence most agreeable to their wishes ; they <lb/>
            opened their gates without suspicion to Mentor's soldiers, <lb/>
            who instantly made themselves masters both of those Mysian <lb/>

            sistance to the Persian arms, and of the powerful garrisons <lb/>
            by which they were defended.2 One further deception crowned <lb/>
            the successful perfidy of Mentor. He affected to treat the <lb/>
            conquered places with unexampled moderation. He was par­ <lb/>
            ticularly careful to keep in their offices the same collectors of <lb/>
            revenues and intendants who had been employed by Her­ <lb/>
            meias. Those officers, when they were first apprized of the <lb/>
            danger which threatened their master, concealed their trea­ <lb/>
            sures under ground, or deposited them with their friends; <lb/>
            but when they found themselves treated with so much unex­ <lb/>
            pected generosity by the invader, they resumed their wonted <note type="footnote"> 1 Diodor. ubi supra. Helladius apud Photo Biblioth. p. 866. Polyacn. <lb/>

             <pb n="xii"/>
            confidence, and conveyed back into their own coffers their <lb/>
            long accumulated wealth ; of which circumstance Mentor was <lb/>
            no sooner informed by his emissaries, than he seized both the <lb/>
            effects and the persons of those too credulous collectors. 1</p>
          <p>The veil of moderation which Mentor's policy had assumed <lb/>
            in his first transactions at Atarneus, enabled Aristotle to <lb/>
            avoid the punishment which too naturally fell on the ambi­ <lb/>
            tion of his friend. By a seasonable flight he escaped to Mity­ <lb/>
            lene in the isle of Lesbos, in company with Pythias, the <lb/>
            kinswoman and adopted heiress of the king of Assus and <lb/>
            Atarneus, but now miserably fallen from the lofty expecta­ <lb/>
            tions in which her youth had been educated. But this sad <lb/>
            reverse of fortune only endeared her the more to Aristotle, who <lb/>
            married the fair companion of his flight in his thirty-seventh <lb/>
            year ;2 which is precisely that age pointed out by himself as <lb/>
            the fittest, on the male side, for entering into wedlock.3 Py­ <lb/>
            thias died shortly afterwards, leaving an infant daughter, <lb/>
            whom Aristotle named after a wife tenderly beloved, and <lb/>
            who repaid his affection with the most tender sensibility. It <lb/>
            was her last request that, when Aristotle should die, her own <lb/>
            bones might be disinterred, and carefully enclosed within the <lb/>
            monument of her admired husband. 4</p>
          <p>The Stagirite passed but a short time in the soft island of <lb/>
            Lesbos, in the tender indulgence either of love or of melan­ <lb/>
            choly. During his residence in Athens, he had strengthened <lb/>
            his hereditary friendship with Philip of Macedon, a prince <lb/>
            one year younger than himself, who, having lived from the <lb/>
            age of fifteen to that of two-and-twenty in Thebes and the <lb/>
            neighbouring cities, ascended the throne of his ancestors in <lb/>
            the twenty-third year of his age. The busy scenes of war <lb/>

            accession engaged by necessity, and in which he continued to <lb/>
            be involved during his whole reign by ambition, seem never <lb/>
            to have interrupted his correspondence with the friends of his <lb/>
            youth; with those who either possessed his affection, or who <lb/>
            merited his admiration. 1 In the fifth year of his reign his <lb/>
            son Alexander was born ; an event which he notified to <lb/>
            Aristotle in terms implying much previous communication <lb/>
            between them: "Know that a son is born to us. We thank <lb/>
            the gods for their gift, but especially for bestowing it at the <lb/>
            time when Aristotle lives ; assuring ourselves that, educated <lb/>
            by you, he will be worthy of us, and worthy of inheriting our <lb/>
            kingdom."2 If this letter was written at the æra of Alexan­ <lb/>
            der's birth, it must have found Aristotle at Athens in his <lb/>
            twenty-ninth year, still a diligent student in the school of <lb/>
            Plato. But it is certain that the Stagirite did not assume the <lb/>
            office of preceptor to the son of Philip till fourteen years <lb/>
            afterwards, when the opening character of this young prince <lb/>
            seemed as greatly to merit, as peculiarly to require, the as­ <lb/>
            sistance of so able an instructor.3 In the second year of the <lb/>
            109th Olympiad, Aristotle, probably in consequence of a new <lb/>
            invitation from Philip, sailed from the isle of Lesbos, in which <lb/>
            he had resided near two years, escaped the dangers of the <lb/>
            Athenian fleet, which then carried on war against Macedon, <lb/>
            and arrived at the court of Pella,4 to undertake one of the <lb/>
            few employments not unworthy of an author qualified to in­ <lb/>
            struct and benefit the latest ages of the world.</p>
          <p>In the education of Alexander, the Stagirite spent near <note type="footnote"> I Gillies' History of Ancient Greece, vol. iv. c. 33. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Aulus Gellius, 1. ix. c. 3. </note><note type="footnote"> a The chronology is clearly ascertained by Dionysius of Halicarnassus's <lb/>

            eight years; 1 during which long period, in an office of much <lb/>
            delicacy, he enjoyed the rare advantage of giving the highest <lb/>
            satisfaction to his employers, while he excited the warmest <lb/>
            gratitude in his pupil.2 The temper of Alexander, prone to <lb/>
            every generous affection, loved and esteemed many; but <lb/>
            Aristotle is the only one of his friends whose superior genius <lb/>
            he appears unceasingly to have viewed with undiminished <lb/>
            admiration, and whom he seems to have treated through life <lb/>
            with uniform and unalterable respect. By Philip and his <lb/>
            proud queen Olympias, our philosopher was honoured with <lb/>
            every mark of distinction which greatness can bestow on <lb/>
            illustrious merit. Philip placed his statue near to his own : <lb/>
            he was admitted to the councils of his sovereign, where his <lb/>
            advice was often useful, always honourable; and where his <lb/>
            kind intercession benefited many individuals, and many com­ <lb/>
            munities.3 On one occasion the Athenians rewarded his good <lb/>
            services, by erecting his statue in the citadel ; 4 and his letters, <lb/>
            both to Philip and to Alexander, attested his unremitting ex­ <lb/>
            ertions in the cause of his friends and of the public, as well <lb/>
            as his manly freedom in admonishing kings of their duty.5 <lb/>
            But the ruling passions of Philip and Alexander, the interested <lb/>
            policy of the one, and the lofty ambition of the other, were <lb/>
            too strong and too ungovernable to be restrained by the <lb/>
            power of reason, speaking through the voice of their admired <lb/>
            philosopher. The ambition of Alexander had early taken <lb/>
            root; and the peculiarities of his character had displayed <note type="footnote"> 1 The author of the very able Life of Aristotle in the Dictionary of <lb/>
            Greek and Roman Biography, already quoted, says that " Aristotle spent <lb/>
            seven years in Macedonia, but Alexander enjoyed his instruction without <lb/>
            interruption for only four years." But the two statements are easily re­ <lb/>
            concilable ; for he states below that even after the beginning of Alex­ <lb/>
            ander's regency, Aristotle continued to be the young prince's instructor, <lb/>
            but that he probably " confined his instruction to advice and suggestion; <lb/>
            which may possibly have been carried on by means of epistolary corre­ <lb/>
            spondence." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Plutarch, in Alexand. torn. i. p. 668; and advers. Colot. torn. ii. p. <lb/>

            themselves, in a very public and very important transaction, <lb/>
            which happened several months before the Stagirite arrived <lb/>
            at the court of Pella. During Philip's Illyrian expedition, <lb/>
            Macedon was honoured with an embassy from the great <lb/>
            king. In the absence of his father, Alexander, at that time <lb/>
            scarcely fourteen years old, received the ambassadors; and <lb/>
            his conversation with those illustrious strangers, at a period <lb/>
            in history when the public conferences of great personages <lb/>
            consisted not merely in words of ceremony, afforded a just <lb/>
            subject of praise and wonder. Instead of admiring their ex­ <lb/>
            ternal appearance, or asking them such superficial questions <lb/>
            as corresponded with the unripeness of his years, he inquired <lb/>
            into the nature of the Persian government; the character of <lb/>
            Ochus, who then reigned; the strength and composition of <lb/>
            his armies; the distance of his place of residence from the <lb/>
            western coast; the state of the intermediate country, and <lb/>
            particularly of the high roads leading to the great capitals of <lb/>
            Susa and Babylon. 1To his premature love of aggrandize­ <lb/>
            ment, Alexander already added singular dexterity and unex­ <lb/>
            ampled boldness in his exercises, particularly in horsemanship; <lb/>
            the most fervid affections, invincible courage, and unbending <lb/>
            dignity.2</p>
          <p>In training such a youth, the Stagirite had a rich field to <lb/>
            cultivate ; but he could only hope to give a new direction to <lb/>
            passions, which it was too late to moderate or control. In his <lb/>
            treatise on Politics, he has carefully delineated the plan of <lb/>
            education best adapted to persons of the highest rank in <lb/>
            society; and in performing the task assigned to him by <lb/>
            Philip, this plan was to be skilfully modified, by adjusting it <lb/>
            to the peculiar circumstances and extraordinary character of <lb/>
            his pupil. Alexander's loftiness could not be conquered, but <lb/>
            it might be made to combat on the side of virtue : if he was <lb/>
            angry, it was proved to him that anger was the effect of in­ <lb/>
            sult, and the mark of inferiority.3 His love for military glory, <note type="footnote"> I Plutarch, in Alexand. </note><note type="footnote">* Idem ibid. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Ælian. Var. Hist. 1. xiL c. 54. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xvi"/>
            which, while it is the idol of the multitude, will always be <lb/>
            the passion of the great, could neither be restrained nor <lb/>
            moderated; but, to rival this tyrant of the breast, still more <lb/>
            exalted affections were inspired, which rendered Alexander <lb/>
            as much superior to conquerors, as conquerors deem them­ <lb/>
            selves superior to the lowest of the vulgar. Agreeably to a <lb/>
            maxim inculcated in that book of Aristotle's Politics which <lb/>
            relates to education, the two years immediately following <lb/>
            puberty constitute that important period of life, which is <lb/>
            peculiarly adapted for improving and strengthening the bodily <lb/>
            frame, and for acquiring that corporeal vigour which is one <lb/>
            mainspring of mental energy. During this interesting period <lb/>
            of youth, with the proper management of which the future <lb/>
            happiness of the whole of life is so intimately connected, <lb/>
            Aristotle observes that the intellectual powers ought indeed <lb/>
            to be kept in play, but not too strenuously exercised, since <lb/>
            powerful exertions of the mind and body cannot be made at <lb/>
            once, nor the habits of making them be simultaneously ac­ <lb/>
            quired. In conformity with this principle, Alexander was <lb/>
            encouraged to proceed with alacrity in his exercises, till he <lb/>
            acquired in them unrivalled proficiency; after which, the <lb/>
            whole bent of his mind was directed to the most profound <lb/>
            principles of science.</p>
          <p>It is the opinion of many, that a slight tincture of learning <lb/>
            is sufficient for accomplishing a prince. Both Philip and <lb/>
            Aristotle thought otherwise; and the ardent curiosity of</p>
          <p>Alexander himself was not to be satisfied with such superficial <lb/>
            and meagre instructions as have been sometimes triumphantly <lb/>
            published for the use of persons destined to reign. The <lb/>
            young Macedonian's mind was therefore to be sharpened by <lb/>
            whatever was most nice in distinction, and to be exalted by <lb/>
            whatever was most lofty in speculation ; 1that his faculties, <lb/>
            by expanding and invigorating amidst objects of the highest <lb/>
            intellection, might thereby be rendered capable of compre­ <lb/>
            hending ordinary matters the more readily and the more <note type="footnote"> I Plutarch, in Alexand. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xvii"/>
            perfectly. 1This recondite philosophy, which was delivered <lb/>
            by the Stagirite, first to his royal pupil, and afterwards to <lb/>
            his hearers in the Lyceum, received the epithet of acroatic; 2 <lb/>
            to distinguish those parts of his lectures which were confined <lb/>
            to a select audience, from other parts called exoteric, be­ <lb/>
            cause delivered to the public at large. It has been sup­ <lb/>
            posed that, in those two kinds of lectures, the Stagirite main­ <lb/>
            tained contradictory doctrines on the subjects of religion and <lb/>
            morality. But the fact is far otherwise: his practical tenets <lb/>
            were uniformly the same in both; but his exoteric or popular <lb/>
            treatises nearly resembled the philosophical dialogues of Plato <lb/>
            or Cicero; whereas his acroatic writings (which will be ex­ <lb/>
            plained in the following chapter) contained, in a concise, <lb/>
            energetic style peculiar to himself, those deep and broad prin­ <lb/>
            ciples on which all solid science is built, and, independently of <lb/>
            which, the most operose reasonings, and the most intricate com­ <lb/>
            binations, are but matters of coarse mechanical practice.3 The <lb/>
            sublimity of this abstract and recondite philosophy admirably <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristot. de Anima, 1. iii. c. 5, 6, and Ethic. Nicom. 1. x. c. 7 and 8. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This division of Aristotle's works into acroatic and exoteric, has given <lb/>
            rise to a variety of opinions and disputes; which all have their source in <lb/>
            the different accounts given by Plutarch and Aulus Gellius, on one hand; <lb/>
            and by Strabo, Cicero, and Ammonius, on the other. The former writers <lb/>
            (Plutarch. in Alexand.; and Aulus Gellius, 1. xx. c. 4,) maintain that <lb/>
            the acroatic, or, as they call them, the acroamatic works, differed from <lb/>
            the exoteric in the nature of their subjects, which consisted in natural <lb/>
            philosophy and logic ; whereas the subjects of the exoteric were rhetoric, <lb/>
            ethics, and politics. But the opinions of both Plutarch and Gellius (for <lb/>
            they do not entirely coincide) are refuted by Aristotle's references, as we <lb/>
            shall see hereafter, from his Ethical to his exoteric works. The latter <lb/>
            class of writers (Strabo 1. xiii. p. 608; Cicero ad Attic, xiii. 19; and <lb/>
            Ammonius Herm. ad Cateegor. Aristot.) maintain, that the acroatic works <lb/>
            were distinguished from the exoteric, not by the difference of the subjects, <lb/>
            but by the different manner of treating them ; the former being discourses, <lb/>
            the latter dialogues. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Simplicius and Philoponus allow other writings besides the dialogues <lb/>
            to have been exoteric, as historical disquisitions, and whatever else did <lb/>
            not require for understanding them intense thought in the reader. <lb/>
            Simplicius says that Aristotle was purposely obscure in his acroatic writ­ <lb/>
            ings : " ut segniores ab eorum studio repellerit et dehortaretur." Simplic. <lb/>
            ad Auscult. Physic, fol. ii. This would have have been a very unworthy <lb/>
            motive in the Stagirite : but the truth is, that the obscurity of Aristotle'a <lb/>
            works proceeds from a corrupt text. When the text is pure, his writings </note> <note type="footnote"> c </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xviii"/>
            accorded with the loftiness of Alexander's mind; and how <lb/>
            highly he continued to prize it, amidst the tumultuary occupa­ <lb/>
            tions of war and government, appears from the following <lb/>
            letter, written soon after the battle of Gaugamela, and while <lb/>
            he was yet in pursuit of Darius: " Alexander, wishing all <lb/>
            happiness to Aristotle. You have not done right in publish­ <lb/>
            ing your acrostic works. Wherein shall we be distinguished <lb/>
            above others, if the learning, in which we were instructed, be <lb/>
            communicated to the public. I would rather surpass other <lb/>
            men in knowledge than in power. Farewell." 1 Aristotle, <lb/>
            not considering this letter as merely complimental, answered <lb/>
            it as follows: " You wrote to me concerning my acroatic works, <lb/>
            that they ought not to have been published. Know that in <lb/>
            one sense this still is the case, since they can be fully under­ <lb/>
            stood by those only who have heard my lectures." 2 Of those <lb/>
            much valued writings, the theological part, if at all published, <lb/>
            was probably most involved in a sublime obscurity. To have <lb/>
            maintained, in plain and popular language, the unity and <lb/>
            perfections of the Deity, must have excited against the <lb/>
            Stagirite an earlier religious persecution than that which <lb/>
            really overtook him. Yet in this pure theology Alexander <lb/>
            was carefully instructed; as his preceptor reminded him in <lb/>
            the midst of his unexampled victories and unbounded con­ <lb/>
            quests, concluding a letter with this memorable admonition ; <lb/>
            that " those who entertain just notions of the Deity are better <lb/>
            entitled to be high-minded, than those who subdue kingdoms." a</p>
          <p>Aristotle's love of philosophy did not, like that of Plato, <lb/>
            set him at variance with poetry. He frequently cites the <lb/>
            poets, particularly Homer; and he prepared for his pupil a <lb/>
            correct copy of the Iliad, which that admirer of kindred heroes <lb/>
            always carried with him in a casket, whence this transcript <note type="footnote"> are as easily intelligible, as a mere syllabus of lectures on most abstruse <lb/>

            was called " the Iliad of the Casket." 1 The Stagirite was <lb/>
            not only the best critic in poetry, but himself a poet of the <lb/>
            first eminence. Few of his verses indeed have reached <lb/>
            modern times; but the few which remain prove him worthy <lb/>
            of sounding the lyre of Pindar ; 2 and it is not the least sin­ <lb/>
            gularity attending this extraordinary man, that with the <lb/>
            nicest and most suitable powers of discrimination and analysis, <lb/>
            he united a vigorous and rich vein of poetic fancy.</p>
          <p>Aristotle carefully instructed his pupil in ethics and politics. <lb/>
            He wrote to him, long afterwards, a treatise on government; <lb/>
            and exhorted him to adjust the measure of his authority to <lb/>
            the various character of his subjects ; agreeably to a doctrine <lb/>
            which he frequently maintains in his political works, that dif­ <lb/>
            ferent nations require different modes of government, respect­ <lb/>
            ively adapted to their various turns of mind, and different <lb/>
            habits of thinking.3 From the ethical writings of Aristotle <lb/>
            which still remain, and which are the most practically useful <lb/>
            of any that pagan antiquity can boast, it is easy to detect that <lb/>
            wicked calumny of his enemies, " that, for sordid and selfish <lb/>
            purposes, he accommodated the tenets of his philosophy to the <lb/>
            base morals of courts." 4 It may be safely affirmed, that if <lb/>
            Alexander is distinguished above other princes for the love of <lb/>
            knowledge5 and virtue, he was chiefly indebted for this ad­ <lb/>
            vantage to his preceptor: the seeds of his haughtiness and <lb/>
            ambition were sown before Aristotle was called to direct his <note type="footnote"> I Plutarch, in Alexand. vol. i. p. 688. </note><note type="footnote"> a Menag. Observat. in Diogen.

            Theophrastus and Phanias, Aristotle's disciples. In the midst of his ex­ <lb/>

            philosopher; 1 his imperfections to himself, to Philip, above <lb/>
            all to the intoxicating effects of unbounded prosperity. This <lb/>
            is the language of antiquity, and even of those writers who <lb/>
            are the least partial to the fame of the Stagirite.</p>
          <p>After the most intimate communication during the space of <lb/>
            eight years,2 the pupil and the preceptor separated for ever, <lb/>
            to pursue, in a career of almost equal length, the most oppo­ <lb/>
            site paths to the same immortal renown ; the one by arms, the <lb/>
            other by philosophy; the one by gratifying the most immo­ <lb/>
            derate lust of power, the other by teaching to despise this and <lb/>
            all similar gratifications. During his eastern triumphs, ter­ <lb/>
            minated in the course of ten years by his premature death, <lb/>
            Alexander (as we shall have occasion to relate) gave many <lb/>
            illustrious proofs of gratitude to the virtuous director of his <lb/>
            youth. One incident, and one only, seems to have occasioned <lb/>
            some disgust between them. At leaving the court of Pella, <lb/>
            Aristotle recommended, as worthy of accompanying Alex­ <lb/>
            ander in his Persian expedition, his own kinsman Callisthenes, <lb/>
            an Olynthian; a learned and certainly an honest man, but of <lb/>
            a morose, unaccommodating temper, pertinaciously attached to <lb/>
            the old system of republicanism, which the father of Alex­ <lb/>
            ander had overturned in Greece; equally daring and inflexi­ <lb/>
            ble in his purposes, and unseasonably bold in his speech.3 <lb/>
            Aristotle himself perceived and lamented his faults, and ad­ <lb/>
            monished him in a line of Homer, " that his unbridled tongue <lb/>
            might occasion his early death." 4 The prophecy was fulfilled. <lb/>
            Callisthenes, not reflecting that "he who has once conde­ <lb/>
            scended" (in the words of Arrian) "to be the attendant of a <lb/>
            king, ought never to be wanting in due deference to his will, " <lb/>

              exacting the same marks of homage from the Greeks which <lb/>
              were cheerfully paid to him by the Persians. 1 The manner <lb/>
              of Callisthenes's punishment and death is related more vari­ <lb/>
              ously2 than almost any historical event of such public noto­ <lb/>
              riety ; but most writers concur in opinion, that he met with <lb/>
              the just reward of his rashness and arrogance. This trans­ <lb/>
              action, it is asserted, much estranged Alexander from his an­ <lb/>
              cient preceptor. The assertion however is not accompanied <lb/>
              with any solid proof;3 and the absurd calumny, that Aris­ <lb/>
              totle not only regarded this pretended displeasure as an injury, <lb/>
              but even proceeded to the wickedness of joining in a con­ <lb/>

              history, but a hearsay preserved in Plutarch,4 and the affected <lb/>
              credit given to the monstrous report by the monster Caracalla, <lb/>
              for the unworthy purpose of justifying his own violence in <lb/>

          <p>Having taken leave of the Macedonian capital, Aristotle <lb/>
            returned to his beloved Athens; where he spent thirteen 6 <lb/>
            years, almost the whole remainder of his life, instructing his <lb/>
            disciples, and improving the various branches of his philoso­ <lb/>
            phy. His acreage lectures were given in the morning to <lb/>

            them is still preserved in his works, which form an abstract <lb/>
            or syllabus of treatises on the most important branches of <lb/>
            philosophy. His exoteric discourses were held after supper <lb/>
            with occasional visitors, and formed the amusement of his <lb/>
            evening walks; 1 for he thought " exercise peculiarly useful <lb/>
            after table for animating and invigorating the natural heat <lb/>
            and strength, which the too rapid succession of sleep to food <lb/>
            seem fitted to relax and encumber.2 Before his arrival at <lb/>
            Athens, Speusippus was dead; and Xenocrates, whose dull <lb/>
            gravity and rigid austerity a man of Aristotle's character <lb/>
            could not much admire, had taken possession of the Academy.3 <lb/>
            The Stagirite, therefore, settled in a gymnasium in the suburbs, <lb/>
            well shaded with trees, near to which the soldiers used to ex­ <lb/>
            ercise, and adorned by the temple of Lycian Apollo, from <lb/>
            whose peripaton, or walk, Aristotle and his followers were <lb/>
            called Peripatetics. 4 It is reported that he opened his school, <lb/>
            observing, " That it would be shameful for himself to be si­ <lb/>
            lent while Xenocrates publicly taught."5 Aristotle is not <lb/>
            likely to have uttered such a presumptuous boast; but if it <lb/>
            was really made, even this arrogant speech was certainly very <lb/>
            fully justified by the fame which the Lyceum speedily ac­ <lb/>
            quired, which the Stagirite himself maintained unimpaired <lb/>
            through life, and which was ably supported by his disciple <lb/>
            and successor Theophrastus.</p>
          <p>Such is the genuine history of Aristotle's life, in the most <lb/>
            important passages of which all the ancient writers,6 who <note type="footnote"> I Aulus Gellius, 1. xx. c. 5. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Plutarch. Conjug. Precept. p. 133. 3 Diogen.

          <p>The absurd reports that Aristotle first served in the army, <lb/>
            that he there dissipated his fortune by low profligacy, and <lb/>
            then followed for bread the trade of an apothecary,3 may be <lb/>
            confidently rejected by those who know, on unquestionable <lb/>
            authority, that he became, at the early age of seventeen, a <lb/>
            diligent student in the Academy at Athens, where he remained <lb/>
            during the long period of twenty years. The reader who has <lb/>
            seen the testimonies of his gratitude to Plato, will not easily <lb/>
            be persuaded that he could treat this revered master with the <lb/>
            grossest brutality;4 and let him who reads and meditates on <lb/>

            to the matters of fact above related, it is of more importance to <lb/>
            inquire whence such improbable tales could have originated; <lb/>
            especially as this inquiry will bring us to the events which <lb/>
            immediately preceded our philosopher's death.</p>
          <p>From innumerable passages in the moral and political works <lb/>
            of which we have presumed to offer the translation to the <lb/>
            public, it will appear that Aristotle regarded with equal con­ <lb/>
            tempt vain pretenders to real science, and real professors of <lb/>
            sciences which he deemed vain and frivolous. His theologi­ <lb/>
            cal opinions, also, were far too refined for the grossness of <lb/>
            paganism. He fought only for truth, and was careless of the <lb/>
            obstacles which stood in his way to attaining it, whether they <lb/>
            were found in the errors of philosophers, or in the prejudices <lb/>
            of the vulgar. Such a man, in such a city as Athens, where, <lb/>
            since the days of Socrates, the learned taught publicly and <lb/>
            conversed freely with all descriptions of persons, could not <lb/>
            fail to have many rivals and many enemies. Sophists and <lb/>
            sciolists, soothsayers and satirists, and that worst of banes <lb/>
            satirical historians, 1 heaped obloquy on a character, the orna­ <lb/>
            ment of his own age, and destined to be the great instructor <lb/>
            of posterity. But the name of Alexander, which then filled <lb/>
            the world, was duly respected, even in the turbulent demo­ <lb/>
            eracy of Athens; and it was not till the year following the <lb/>
            death of that incomparable prince, that the rancorous malig­ <lb/>
            nity, which had been long suppressed, burst forth against <lb/>
            Aristotle with irresistible violence. He was accused of ir­ <lb/>
            religion <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀσεβείας</foreign>) before the Areopagus by the hierophant <lb/>
            Eurymedon, abetted by Demophilus, a man of weight in the <lb/>
            republic; and both of them were instigated to this cruel <lb/>
            prosecution by our philosopher's declared enemies.2 The <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristocles (apud Eusebium) says, that Aristotle was attacked by a <lb/>
            host of writers, " whose books and memories have perished more com­ <lb/>
            pletely than their bodies." Even his fellow-student, Aristoxenus, who <lb/>
            had treated him most respectfully while he lived, heaped the most illiberal <lb/>
            reproaches on his memory, because he preferred to himself Theophrastus <lb/>
            for his successor. Suidas in Aristoxen. and Aristocles apud Eusebium. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Diogen. Laert. 1. v. sect. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxv"/>
            heads of the accusation were, " that Aristotle had commemo­ <lb/>
            rated the virtues both of his wife Pythias and of his friend <lb/>
            Hermeias, with such ceremonies and honours as the piety of <lb/>
            Athens justly reserved for the majesty of the gods." To <lb/>
            Hermeias, indeed, he erected a statue at Delphi; he also wrote <lb/>
            an ode in his praise. Both the inscription and the ode have <lb/>
            come down to modern times; the former simply relating "the <lb/>
            unworthy and treacherous death of Hermeias ; " and the latter <lb/>
            "extolling virtue above all earthly possessions ; and especially <lb/>
            that generous patriotism, for the sake of which the native of <lb/>
            Atarneus, rivalling the merit of Hercules and Achilles, had <lb/>
            willingly relinquished the light of the sun; whose fame there­ <lb/>
            fore would never be forgotten by the Muses, daughters of <lb/>
            memory ; and as often as it was sung would redound to the <lb/>
            glory of Hospitable Jove, and the honour of firm friendship." 1 <lb/>
            From the frivolousness of the accusation respecting Hermeias, <lb/>
            which was considered as the chief article of the impeachment, <lb/>
            we may warrantably conjecture that the reproach of worship­ <lb/>
            ping Pythias with honours due to Eleusinian Ceres, was al­ <lb/>
            together groundless: but in a philosopher, whose intellectual <lb/>
            rather than his moral virtues have been the object of panegy­ <lb/>
            ric, we may remark with pleasure both the strength of his <lb/>
            friendship, and the sincere tenderness of his love, since both <lb/>
            affections must have been expressed with an amiable enthu­ <lb/>
            siasm, to enable even the malice of his enemies to interpret <lb/>
            them into the crime of idolatry.</p>
          <p>It must not be dissembled that the accusation, and conse­ <lb/>
            quent condemnation, of Aristotle by the Areopagus, has been <lb/>
            ascribed to a different cause from that above assigned, and re­ <lb/>
            ferred merely to the impiety of his tenets. He is said by <lb/>
            those who have carelessly examined his works, to have de­ <lb/>
            nied a Providence, and thence to have inferred the inef­ <lb/>
            ficacy of prayers and sacrifices: doctrines, it is observed, which <note type="footnote"> 1 Laertius in Aristot. Athenæus, xv. p. 697. </note> <lb/>

            could not but enrage the priesthood, as totally subversive of <lb/>
            its functions, establishments, and revenues. 1But never was <lb/>
            any accusation urged more falsely or more ignorantly. Axis­ <lb/>

            among the functions or offices essentially requisite to the ex­ <lb/>
            istence of every community. In writing to Alexander he <lb/>
            says, that those are not entitled to be high-minded who con­ <lb/>
            quer kingdoms, but rather those who have learned to form just <lb/>
            notions of the gods ; 2 and in his life, as well as in his works, <lb/>
            he uniformly showed his veneration for religion in general, by <lb/>
            treating with great tenderness,3 even that distorted image of <lb/>
            it reflected from the puerile superstitions of his country.4</p>
          <p>He is said to have written his own defence,5 and to have <lb/>
            inveighed, in a strong metaphor, against the increasing dege­ <lb/>
            neracy of the Athenians.6 His discourse, of which the bold­ <lb/>
            ness would only have inflamed the blind zeal of his weak or <lb/>
            wicked judges, was not delivered in court: since he escaped <lb/>
            his trial by seasonably quitting Athens for Chalets in Eubœa, <lb/>
            saying, in allusion to the death of Socrates, that he was un­ <lb/>
            willing to afford the Athenians a second opportunity of sin­ <lb/>
            ning against philosophy.7 He survived his retreat to the <lb/>
            shores of the Euripus scarcely a twelvemonth; persecution and <lb/>
            banishment having probably shortened his days.8 <note type="footnote"> 1 Origines contra Celsum et Brukeri, Histor.

          <p>His testament, preserved in Diogenes Laertius, accords <lb/>
            with the circumstances related concerning his life, and prac­ <lb/>
            tically illustrates the liberal maxims of his philosophy. An­ <lb/>
            tipater, the confidential minister of Philip, regent of Macedon <lb/>
            both under Alexander and after his demise, is appointed the <lb/>
            executor of this testament, with an authority paramount, as it <lb/>
            should seem, to that of the other persons who are afterwards <lb/>
            conjoined with him in the same trust. To his wife Her­ <lb/>
            pyllis, (for he had married a second time,) Aristotle, besides <lb/>
            other property in money and slaves, leaves the choice of two <lb/>
            houses, the one in Chalcis, the other his paternal mansion at <lb/>
            Stagira; and desires, that whichever of them she might pre­ <lb/>
            fer, should be properly furnished for her reception. He com­ <lb/>
            mends her domestic virtues; and requests his friends that, <lb/>
            mindful of her behaviour towards him, they would distinguish <lb/>
            her by the kindest attention; and should she again think of <lb/>
            a husband, that they would be careful to provide for her a <lb/>
            suitable marriage. To Nicomachus, his son by this Herpyllis, <lb/>
            and to Pythias, the daughter of his first wife, he bequeathed <lb/>
            the remainder of his fortune, with the exception of his library <lb/>
            and writings, which he left to his favourite scholar Theo­ <lb/>
            phrastus. He desires that his daughter, when she attained <lb/>
            a marriageable age, should be given to Nicanor, the son of <lb/>
            his ancient benefactor Proxenus; and failing Nicanor, that <lb/>
            his esteemed disciple Theophrastus should accept her hand <lb/>
            and fortune. The bones of his first wife, Pythias, he ordered <lb/>
            to be disinterred, and again buried with his own, as she her­ <lb/>
            self had requested. None of his slaves are to be sold; they <lb/>
            are all of them either emancipated by his will, or ordered to <note type="footnote"> able to explain the cause of the tides of the Euripus; upon which au­ <lb/>
            thority the puerile story is ingrafted of his throwing himself into that arm <lb/>
            of the sea, saying, " You shall contain me, since I cannot comprehend <lb/>
            you." Others say that he ended his life by poison to escape the venge­ <lb/>
            ance of the Athenians. (Rapin's Comparaison de Platon et d'Aristote.) <lb/>
            Such unwarranted reports would not be worthy of mention, did they not <lb/>
            afford an opportunity of observing the extreme improbability that Aris­ <lb/>
            totle should have been guilty of suicide, since he always speaks of it as of <lb/>
            a shameful and cowardly crime. </note><note type="footnote">1 Strabo, xiii. 413. </note> <lb/>

            be manumitted by his heirs, whenever they seem worthy of <lb/>
            liberty; an injunction conformable to the maxims inculcated <lb/>
            in his Politics, that slaves of all descriptions ought to be set <lb/>
            free, whenever they merited freedom, and are qualified for <lb/>
            enjoying it. He concludes with a testimony of external de­ <lb/>
            ference at least for the religion of his country, by ordering <lb/>
            that the dedications which he had vowed for the safety of <lb/>
            Nicanor, should be presented at Stagira to Jupiter and Mi­ <lb/>
            nerva, the saviours.</p>
          <p>Thus lived, and thus died, in his 63rd year, Aristotle the <lb/>
            Stagirite. His enlightened humanity was often seasoned by <lb/>
            pleasantry. Many strokes of genuine humour, little suspected <lb/>
            by his commentators, will be found in his political writings. <lb/>
            His smart sayings and quick repartees were long remembered <lb/>
            and admired by those who were incapable of appreciating his <lb/>
            weightier merits. Some of these sayings, though apparently <lb/>
            not the most memorable, are preserved in Diogenes Laertius; <lb/>
            of which the following may serve for a specimen. Being <lb/>
            asked, What, of all things, soonest grows old ?-Gratitude. <lb/>
            What advantage have you reaped from study?- That of <lb/>
            doing through choice what others do through fear. What is <lb/>
            friendship ?-One soul in two bodies. Why do we never tire <lb/>
            of the company of the beautiful ?-The question of a blind <lb/>
            man ! Such apophthegms would be unworthy of mention, had <lb/>
            they not, by their perpetual recurrence in our philosopher's <lb/>
            conversation, shown a mind free and unencumbered amidst <lb/>
            the abstrusest studies ; and, together with the most intense <lb/>
            thought, a readiness of wit, which never failed to repe) <lb/>
            sneerers, and to abash arrogance. 1 He exhibited a character as <lb/>
            a man, worthy of his pre-eminence as a philosopher; inhabit­ <lb/>
            ing courts, without meanness and without selfishness; living <lb/>
            in schools, without pride and without austerity; 2 cultivating <lb/>
            with ardent affection every domestic and every social virtue, <lb/>
            while with indefatigable industry he reared that wonderful <note type="footnote"> 1 Diogen. Laert. in Aristot. et Diogen. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Plutarch, de Virtut. Moral, p 448. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxix"/>
            edifice of science, the plan of which we are still enabled to <lb/>
            delineate from his imperfect and mutilated writings.</p>
          <p>The extraordinary and unmerited fate of these writings, <lb/>
            while it excites the curiosity, must provoke the indignation of <lb/>
            every friend to science. Few of them were published in his <lb/>
            life-time; the greater part nearly perished through neglect; <lb/>
            and the remainder has been so grossly misapplied, that doubts <lb/>
            have arisen whether its preservation ought to be regarded as <lb/>
            a benefit. Aristotle's manuscripts and library were bequeathed <lb/>
            to Theophrastus, the most illustrious of his pupils. Theo­ <lb/>
            phrastus again bequeathed them to his own scholar Neleus, <lb/>
            who, carrying them to Scepsis, a city of the ancient Troas, <lb/>
            left them to his heirs in the undistinguished mass of his pro­ <lb/>
            perty. The heirs of Neleus, men ignorant of literature and <lb/>
            careless of books, 1 totally neglected the intellectual treasure <lb/>
            that had most unworthily devolved to them, until they heard <lb/>
            that the king of Pergamus, under whose dominion they <lb/>
            lived, was employing much attention and much research in <lb/>
            collecting a large library.2 With the caution incident to the <lb/>
            subjects of a despot, who often have recourse to concealment <lb/>
            in order to avoid robbery, they hid their books under ground ; <lb/>
            and the writings of Aristotle, as well as the vast collection of <lb/>
            materials from which they had been composed, thus remained <lb/>
            in a subterranean mansion for many generations, a prey to <lb/>
            dampness and to worms.3 At length they were released from <note type="footnote"> 1 Strabo, lib. xiii. p. 608 and 609. Bayle gives too strong a meaning <lb/>

            means one who confines his attention to the private affairs of life, in op­ <lb/>

            tricius (Discuss. Peripatet. t. i. p. 29) to reconcile this account with that <lb/>
            of Strabo, by supposing that Neleus indeed sold Aristotle's library and <lb/>
            works to king Ptolemy, but not before he had taken the precaution of <lb/>
            having the whole carefully copied. According to those writers, the books <lb/>
            thus copied, and not the originals, suffered the unworthy treatment men­ <lb/>
            tioned in the text. This supposition seems highly improbable; for, not <lb/>
            to mention the difficulty of copying, in a short time, many thousand <lb/>
            volumes, it cannot be believed that Ptolemy, had he been in possession of </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxx"/>
            their prison, or rather raised from the grave, and sold for a <lb/>
            large sum, together with the works of Theophrastus, to <lb/>
            Apellicon of Athens, a lover of books rather than a scholar; <lb/>
            through whose labour and expense the work of restoring <lb/>
            Aristotle's manuscripts, though performed in the same city in <lb/>
            which they had been originally written, was very imperfectly <lb/>
            executed. To this, not only the ignorance of the editors, but <lb/>
            both the condition and the nature of the writings themselves, <lb/>
            did not a little contribute. The most considerable part of his <lb/>
            acroatic works, which are almost the whole of those now re­ <lb/>
            maining, consist of little better than text books, containing <lb/>
            the detached heads of his discourses; and, through want of <lb/>
            connexion in the matter, peculiarly liable to corruption from <lb/>
            transcribers, and highly unsusceptible of conjectural emend­ <lb/>
            ation.</p>
          <p>What became of Aristotle's original manuscript we are <lb/>
            not informed; but the copy made for Apellicon was, together <lb/>
            with his whole library, seized by Sylla, the Roman conqueror <lb/>
            of Athens, and by him transmitted to Rome.2 Aristotle's <lb/>
            works excited the attention of Tyrannion, a native of Amysus <lb/>
            in Pontus, who had been taken prisoner by Lucullus in the <lb/>
            Mithridatic war, and insolently manumitted,3 as Plutarch says, <lb/>
            by Muræna, Lucullus's lieutenant. Tyrannion procured the <note type="footnote"> the genuine works of Aristotle, would have purchased at a high price <lb/>
            those counterfeits, which had no other connexion with that philosopher <lb/>
            than bearing his forged name on their title-page. (Ammonius ad Cate­ <lb/>
            gore sub init.) Had a correct copy of the Stagirite's works adorned the <lb/>
            library of Alexandria under the first Ptolemies, his genuine philosophy <lb/>
            would have struck deeper root, and made further progress than it ever <lb/>
            did, in that Egyptian capital. Vossius (de Sect. Philosoph. c. xvi. p. <lb/>
            89) endeavours to prove that Athenæus's words (which are certainly in­ <lb/>
            correct) imply that Neleus retained Aristotle's works when he sold all <lb/>
            the rest. </note><note type="footnote">1 Strabo says, " rather than a philosopher." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Plutarch, in Sylla. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Plutarch speaks with the dignity becoming a man of letters, who feels <lb/>

            manuscript by paying court to Sylla's librarian; and commu­ <lb/>
            nicated the use of it to Andronicus of Rhodes, who flourished <lb/>
            as a philosopher at Rome, in the time of Cicero and Pom­ <lb/>
            pey; and who, having undertaken the task of arranging and <lb/>
            correcting those long-injured writings, finally performed the <lb/>
            duty of a skilful editor.1</p>
          <p>Though the works which formed the object of Andronicus's <lb/>
            labours had suffered such injuries as the utmost diligence and <lb/>
            sagacity could not completely repair,2 yet in consequence of <lb/>
            those labours the Peripatetic philosophy began to resume the <lb/>
            lustre of which it had been deprived since the days of The­ <lb/>
            ophrastus; and the later adherents to that sect, as they became <lb/>

            <title type="main">INTRODUCTION, BY JOHN GILLIES, L. L.D.</title>
          </head>
          <p>THIS book embraces three subjects, the noblest and most <lb/>
            interesting that civil science can boast: the origin of society <lb/>
            and government; the distinction of ranks in a commonwealth; <lb/>
            and a comparison of the best plans of political economy. On <lb/>
            each of these topics I shall offer a few remarks, not with the <lb/>
            presumption of interposing my own judgment, but with the <lb/>
            hope of justifying or illustrating the decisions of my author.</p>
          <p>In explaining the origin of political society, Aristotle <lb/>
            writes neither the satire nor the panegyric of human nature ; <lb/>
            which, by writers of less wisdom than fancy, have been al­ <lb/>
            ternately substituted for plain history. In this, as in all other <lb/>
            inquiries, his first question is, what are the phenomena ? His <lb/>
            second, what is the analogy of nature ? Building on these <lb/>
            foundations, he concludes that both society and government <lb/>
            are as congenial to the nature of man, as it is natural for a <lb/>
            plant to fix its roots in the earth, to extend its branches, and <lb/>
            to scatter its seeds. Neither the cunning, cowardly princi­ <lb/>
            ples asserted by Hobbes and Mandeville, nor the benevolent <lb/>
            moral affections espoused by Shaftesbury and Hutcheson, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to our author's notions, ought to be involved in the <lb/>
            solution of the present question: since the first political so­ <lb/>
            cieties are as independent of human intelligence, and there­ <lb/>
            fore of moral determination, as the instinctive actions of plants <lb/>
            and insects, tending to the preservation of their respective <lb/>
            kinds, are independent of any intelligence of their own ; even <lb/>
            when they move and operate conformably to the laws of the <lb/>
            most consummate wisdom.</p>
          <p>Government, then, is coeval with society, and society with <note type="footnote"> d </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxiv"/>
            men. Both are the works of nature; and therefore, in ex­ <lb/>
            plaining their origin, there cannot be the smallest ground for <lb/>
            the fanciful supposition of engagements and contracts, inde­ <lb/>
            pendently of which the great modern antagonist of Aristotle <lb/>
            declares, in the following words, that no government can be <lb/>
            lawful or binding: "The original compact, which begins and <lb/>
            actually constitutes any political society, is nothing but the <lb/>
            consent of any number of freemen capable of a majority, to <lb/>
            unite and to incorporate into such a society. And this is that, <lb/>
            and that only, which could give beginning to any lawful go­ <lb/>
            vernment in the world." 1 From this maxim, which is per­ <lb/>
            petually inculcated in Lockers two treatises on government, is <lb/>
            fairly deducible the inalienable right of mankind to be self- <lb/>
            governed; that is, to be their own legislators, and their own <lb/>
            directors; or, if they find it inconvenient to assume the ad­ <lb/>
            ministration of affairs in their own persons, to appoint repre­ <lb/>
            sentatives who may exercise a delegated sovereignty, essen­ <lb/>
            tially and inalienably inherent in the people at large. Thence <lb/>
            results the new inalienable right of all mankind to be fairly <lb/>
            represented, a right with which each individual was invested <lb/>
            from the commencement of the world, but of which, until very <lb/>
            recently, no one knew the name, or had the least notion of the <lb/>
            thing.2 From this right to fair representation, there follows, <lb/>
            by necessary consequence, the right of universal suffrage, <lb/>
            universal eligibility, and the universal and just preponderancy <lb/>
            of majorities in all cases whatever.</p>
          <p>Such is the boasted and specious theory begun in the works <lb/>
            of our Locke and our Molyneux,3 continued in those of our <note type="footnote"> I Locke's Works, vol. ii. p. 185, edit. of 1714. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 According to the system of Locke and his followers, representatives <lb/>
            are appointed by the people to exercise, in their stead, political functions <lb/>
            which the people have a right to exercise in their own persons. They <lb/>
            are elected by the people, they derive their whole power from the peo­ <lb/>
            ple ; and to the people, their constituents, they always are responsible. <lb/>
            Of this doctrine, Mr. Locke is the first or principal author. But the <lb/>
            term representatives, in the usual and legal acceptation of the word in <lb/>
            the English constitution, meant, and still means, persons in virtue of <lb/>
            their election exercising political functions, which the people had not a <lb/>
            right to exercise in their own persons, and so little responsible to their <lb/>
            electors, that they are not even bound to follow their instructions. That <lb/>
            the ancients were not unacquainted with representation in the usual and <lb/>
            only practical sense of the word, will be shown hereafter. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See his Case of Ireland, reprinted by Almon, p. 113, and again, p. </note> <lb/>

            Price 1 and our Priestley,2 and carried to the utmost extrava­ <lb/>
            gance in those of (I wish not to say our) Rousseau,3 Paine,4 <lb/>
            and the innumerable pamphleteers whose writings occasioned <lb/>
            or accompanied the American and French revolutions.</p>
          <p>Such works, co-operating with the peculiar circumstances <lb/>
            of the times, have produced, and are still producing, the most <lb/>
            extraordinary effects; by arming the passions of the multitude <lb/>
            with a false principle, fortifying them by specious arguments, <lb/>
            and thereby stirring into action those discordant elements <lb/>
            which naturally lurk in the bosom of every community. It is <lb/>
            not consistent with my design, in defending the tenets of my <lb/>
            author, to answer his political adversaries with declamation <lb/>
            and obloquy,-( a rash and dangerous attempt! since the voice <lb/>
            of the multitude will always be the loudest and the strong­ <lb/>
            est,)—but merely to examine whether the fundamental maxim <lb/>
            of their great master, Locke, be itself founded in truth. To <lb/>
            prove that government is merely a matter of consent, he as­ <lb/>
            sumes for a reality a wild fiction of the fancy; what he calls <lb/>
            a state of nature, which he defines to be "men living to­ <lb/>
            gether according to reason, without a common superior on <lb/>
            earth with authority to Judge between them."5 But he him­ <lb/>
            self seems aware that this supposed natural state of man is a <lb/>
            state in which man never yet was found; and in which, if by <lb/>
            violence thrust into it, he could not remain for a single day. <lb/>
            Locke, I say, saw the difficulty, which, instead of meeting, he <lb/>
            only endeavours to elude. “Where are there," he asks, " or <lb/>
            ever were there, any men in such a state of nature?”6 He <lb/>
            answers, " that since all princes and rulers of independent <lb/>
            governments, all through the world, are in the state of nature, <lb/>
            it is plain the world never was, and never will be, without <lb/>
            numbers of men in that state." 7 But this, I affirm, is not to <lb/>
            answer the proposed question; for princes and rulers of inde­ <lb/>
            pendent states do not live together, nor associate and " herd," <lb/>
            as he himself expresses it, in the same society. If they did so, <lb/>
            they could not subsist without government: for government and <note type="footnote"> 169. “ I have no other notion of slavery, but being bound by a law to <lb/>

            society are things absolutely inseparable; they commence to. <lb/>
            gether; they grow up together; they are both of them equally <lb/>
            natural ; and so indissolubly united, that the destruction of <lb/>
            the one is necessarily accompanied by the destruction of the <lb/>
            other. This is the true sense of Aristotle, as understood and <lb/>
            expressed by an illustrious defender of just government and <lb/>
            genuine liberty. " As we use and exercise our bodily mem- \ <lb/>
            bers, before we understand the ends and purposes of this ex­ <lb/>
            ercise, so it is by nature herself that we are united and <lb/>
            associated into political society.”1</p>
          <p>Locke, who so severely, and, as I have endeavoured to <lb/>
            prove, so unjustly arraigns what is called Aristotle's Meta­ <lb/>
            physics, appears to have equally mistaken his Politics. Had <lb/>
            he understood2 the invaluable work to which he refers in <lb/>
            terms of commendation, this idol of modern philosophers, and <lb/>
            especially of modern politicians, would not probably (since <lb/>
            he was a man of great worth as well as of great wisdom) <lb/>
            have produced a theory of government totally impossible in <lb/>
            practice; a theory admirably fitted, indeed, for producing <lb/>
            revolutions and sedition, but according to which, as is evinced <lb/>
            by all history, no political fabric ever yet was reared; or if it <lb/>
            were to be reared, could ever possibly be preserved.3 The <lb/>
            neglect or misapprehension of some of the most important <lb/>
            parts of Aristotle's writings is indeed most deeply to be la­ <lb/>
            mented. Of the many thousand authors who have copied or <lb/>
            commented on his Logic, the far greater number omit his in­ <lb/>
            teresting chapters on language; deeming the consideration of <note type="footnote"> 1 Quemadmodum igitur membris utimur, priusquam didicimus cujus <lb/>

            inquiring into the ground and nature of civil society, and how it is formed <lb/>
            into different models of government, and what are the several species ot <lb/>

            consideration of government without reading his Politics." How honour­ <lb/>

            words below the dignity of philosophers. His profound ob <lb/>
            servations concerning the nature and constitution of a family <lb/>
            have been equally overlooked by his pretended followers in <lb/>
            politics. Yet as his analysis of language has been proved to <lb/>
            be the sole foundation of logic, so his analysis of a family, and <lb/>
            his explanation of the causes through which its elements na <lb/>
            turally and regularly combine, can alone enable us clearly to <lb/>
            discern the analogous principles—(principles continually in <lb/>
            sisted on by himself)—which have raised and upheld the <lb/>
            great edifice of civil society; which is not a mass, but a sys­ <lb/>
            tern, and which, like every system, implies a distinction of <lb/>
            parts; with many moral as well as physical differences, rela­ <lb/>
            tive and reciprocal; the powers and perfections of one part <lb/>
            supplying the incapacities and defects of another. To form <lb/>
            a commonwealth from elements of equal value, or of equal dig­ <lb/>
            nity, is an attempt not less absurd than that of composing a <lb/>
            piece of music from one and the same note.</p>
          <p>A difficult question follows, how far social inequality, whe­ <lb/>
            ther civil or domestic, may be allowed to extend ? It is with <lb/>
            a trembling hand that I touch the delicate subject of slavery; <lb/>
            an undertaking to which nothing could encourage me, but the <lb/>
            utmost confidence in the humanity, as well as in the judg­ <lb/>
            ment, of my author. First of all, Aristotle expressly con­ <lb/>
            demns the cruel practice, prevalent in his own days, of en­ <lb/>
            slaving prisoners of war;1 secondly, he declares, in the most <lb/>
            explicit terms, all slaves fairly entitled to freedom, whenever <lb/>
            it clearly appears that they are fitly qualified for enjoying it. <lb/>
            But the benefits conferred on men, he observes, must in all <lb/>
            cases be limited by their capacities for receiving them; and <lb/>
            these capacities are themselves limited by the exigencies and <lb/>
            necessities of our present imperfect condition. The helpless­ <lb/>
            ness of infancy and childhood, the infirmities of old age, and <note type="footnote"> * 1 Locke says on this subject, " There is another sort of servants, which <lb/>
            by a peculiar name we call slaves, who, being captives taken in a just <lb/>
            war, are by the rights of nature subjected to the absolute dominion and <lb/>
            arbitrary power of their masters. These men, having, as I say, forfeited <lb/>
            their lives, and with it their liberties, and lost their estates, and being in <lb/>
            a state of slavery, not capable of any property, cannot in that state be <lb/>
            considered as any part of civil society." Locke's Works, vol. ii. p. 181. <lb/>
            We should imagine that the liberal Locke and the slavish Aristotle had <lb/>
            interchanged their ages and countries as well as their maxims and prin­ <lb/>
            ciples. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxviii"/>
            the urgencies attending mankind in every stage of their exist­ <lb/>
            ence on earth, render it indispensably necessary that a great <lb/>
            proportion of the species should be habitually employed in <lb/>
            mere mechanical labour, in the strenuous exertions of pro­ <lb/>
            ductive industry, and the petty tasks of domestic drudgery <lb/>
            Nature, therefore, in whose plan and intention the system of <lb/>
            society precedes and takes place of the parts of which it is <lb/>
            composed, has variously organized and moulded the human <lb/>
            character as well as the human frame, without setting other <lb/>
            bounds to this variety, than are imposed by the good of the <lb/>
            whole system, of which individuals are not independent units, <lb/>
            but constituent elements. According to this plan or inten­ <lb/>
            tion, the Stagirite maintains, that there is room for the widest <lb/>
            of all discriminations, and the lowest of all occupations, do­ <lb/>
            mestic servitude, a species of labour not employed in produc­ <lb/>
            tion, but totally consumed in use; because solely, but not <lb/>
            unprofitably, spent in promoting the ease and accommodation <lb/>
            of life. In the relation of master and servant, the good of <lb/>
            the master may indeed be the primary object; but the benefit <lb/>
            of the servant or slave is also a necessary result, since he only <lb/>
            is naturally and justly a slave, whose powers are competent <lb/>
            to mere bodily labour; who is capable of listening to reason, <lb/>
            but incapable of exercising that sovereign faculty; and whose <lb/>
            weakness and short-sightedness are so great, that it is safer <lb/>
            for him to be guided or governed through life by the pru­ <lb/>
            dence of another. But, let it always be remembered, that <lb/>
            " one class of men ought to have the qualifications requisite <lb/>
            for masters, before another can either fitly or usefully be em­ <lb/>
            ployed as slaves." Government, then, not only civil but do­ <lb/>
            mestic, is a most serious duty, a most sacred trust; a trust, <lb/>
            the very nature of which is totally incompatible with the <lb/>
            supposed inalienable rights of all men to be self-governed.1 <note type="footnote"> 1 Politics would not be a science, unless it contained truths, absolute, <lb/>
            universal, and unalterable. One of these is that in the text; because it <lb/>
            essentially springs from the nature of society and of roan. Another uni­ <lb/>
            versal political truth is, that the good of the governed is the main end <lb/>
            and aim of every good government. From these two premisses, it neces­ <lb/>
            sarily follows, that the main object of political society never can be <lb/>
            effected on Mr. Locke's principles. But the good of the community <lb/>
            (without supposing all sovereign power derived from the people at large, <lb/>
            and of which each individual is entitled to participate) may, under many <lb/>
            given circumstances, be highly promoted by giving to the people at large </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xxxix"/>
            Those rights, and those only, are inalienable, which it is im­ <lb/>
            possible for one person to exercise for another: and to main \ <lb/>
            tain those to be natural and inalienable rights, which the <lb/>
            persons supposed to be invested with them can never possibly <lb/>
            exercise, consistently either with their own safety, or with <lb/>
            the good of the community, is to confound all notions of <lb/>
            things, and to invert the whole order of nature; I of which it <lb/>
            is the primary and unalterable law, that forecast should direct <lb/>
            improvidence, reason control passion, and wisdom command <lb/>
            folly.2 I now proceed to examine Aristotle's reflections on <lb/>
            political economy, which are not less adverse than his long <lb/>
            misunderstood and often mistated vindication of slavery itself, <lb/>
            both to the theories formerly prevalent, and to others which <lb/>
            have begun recently to prevail among the civilized nations of <lb/>
            modern Europe.</p>
          <p>The northern conquerors who invaded and desolated the <lb/>
            Roman empire, disdained to produce by slow industry, what <lb/>
            they gloried in ravishing by sudden violence. War was their <lb/>
            delight and their trade. They subsisted by rapine ; and <lb/>
            therefore cared not how far they were excelled by others in <lb/>
            peaceful and productive arts, while gold, and all that it could <lb/>
            purchase, might be conquered by iron. But the spoils of ra­ <lb/>
            pacity having supplied them with the instruments of luxury, <note type="footnote"> a control in the government. This control in all large communities can <lb/>
            only be conveniently exercised, either by particular magistrates, or by <lb/>
            representative assemblies. Things, therefore, that have not any necessary <lb/>
            connexion with the origin of government, (so far from being its only just <lb/>
            principle,) may be found admirable expedients for carrying it on. It will <lb/>
            be shown hereafter, that assemblies elected by the people to provide for <lb/>
            their interests, and thence called their representatives, are not so new in <lb/>
            the world as is commonly imagined. In some republics we shall see a <lb/>
            double row of delegates, representatives of representatives; in others, we <lb/>
            shall find representation and taxation regarded as correlatives; and even <lb/>
            in some democracies, we shall meet with persons elected by the people, <lb/>
            and representing them in the most useful sense of the word, " that of <lb/>
            acting for the people at large, as the people at large, if the majority of <lb/>
            them was wise and good, would act for themselves." </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Stat ratio contra, et secretam garrit in aurem, <lb/>

            they began to relish the pleasures of repose ; and instead of <lb/>
            courting new dangers abroad, to imitate at home those objects <lb/>
            and conveniences which, though they had not the genius to <lb/>
            invent, they gradually acquired the taste to approve, the vanity <lb/>
            to display, and the desire to accumulate. Manufactures then <lb/>
            were established: navigation was exercised for the purpose <lb/>
            not only of war, but of traffic: an extensive commerce was in­ <lb/>
            troduced; and colonies were planted. The avowed purpose <lb/>
            of all those operations was to augment in each country the <lb/>
            quantity of gold and silver; since, with those precious metals, <lb/>
            all other coveted objects might usually be procured. The <lb/>
            business of each individual merchant is to get money; and <lb/>
            commercial nations, it was thought, could not reasonably have <lb/>
            any other end in view. This false principle was regarded as <lb/>
            the basis of all sound political arithmetic ; and the most con­ <lb/>
            clusive reasoning of Aristotle, in the book now before us, <lb/>
            would not perhaps have sufficed to prove, that national wealth <lb/>
            consisted not in gold and silver, had not the ruined state of <lb/>
            Spain confirmed experimentally the same important truth.</p>
          <p>For many years back, political writers have acknowledged, <lb/>
            with our author, that the real wealth of nations consists in the <lb/>
            productive powers of their land and labour. They acknow­ <lb/>
            ledge also, with him, that the precious metals, in contradis­ <lb/>
            tinction to other useful commodities, have only the peculiar <lb/>
            advantage of serving as the fittest instruments of exchange, <lb/>
            and the most accurate measures of value ; but that the quantity <lb/>
            of number in which they ought to be desired or accumulated <lb/>
            is, like the quantity and number of all other measures or in­ <lb/>
            struments, naturally limited and fixed by the ends and oper­ <lb/>
            ations which they are employed to answer or effect.1 Yet, <lb/>
            while they reason thus justly respecting gold and silver, the <lb/>
            same writers have not sufficient enlargement of mind to ge­ <lb/>
            neralize their assertion, and to perceive with our author that <lb/>
            property itself is as much an instrument as money, though <note type="footnote"> 1 It is worthy of remark, that Locke is one of the most strenuous as­ <lb/>
            serters of the now exploded doctrine concerning money, which he con­ <lb/>
            siders " as the most solid and substantial kind of wealth, regarding the <lb/>
            multiplication of the precious metals as the great object of political <lb/>
            economy." See the passage quoted and refuted in Smith's Wealth of 1 <lb/>
            Nations, vol. ii. p. 140, 8vo edit. It is time that, with regard to subjects <lb/>
            still more important, men should return from the school of Locke to that <lb/>
            of Aristotle. </note> <lb/>

            serving for a far more complicated purpose; and therefore, if <lb/>
            it be collected in greater quantities than that purpose requires, <lb/>
            the surplus will be at best useless, most commonly pernicious; <lb/>
            will inflame desire, foment luxury, provoke rapacity, and pro­ <lb/>
            duce that long train of disorders, which made our philosopher <lb/>
            declare, " that the inhabitants of the Fortunate Isles, unless <lb/>
            their virtue kept pace with their external prosperity, must <lb/>
            inevitably become the most miserable of all mankind.”1 In <lb/>
            the fashionable systems of modern politicians, national wealth <lb/>
            is considered as synonymous with national prosperity. To the <lb/>
            increase of productive industry and the augmentation of pub­ <lb/>
            lic revenue, both health, education, and morals are sacrificed <lb/>
            without apology and without remorse; since that trade is uni­ <lb/>
            versally held to be the best, which produces most money with <lb/>
            the least labour. But according to Aristotle, it is not the <lb/>
            quantity or the value of the work produced, that ought to <lb/>
            form the main object of the statesman's care, but the effect <lb/>
            which the producing of that work naturally creates on the <lb/>
            mind and body of the workmen. In the praises of agricul­ <lb/>
            ture and a country life, our author's sentiments and expres­ <lb/>
            sions have been faithfully and generally copied by the most <lb/>
            judicious writers of antiquity; many of whom mark with as <lb/>
            .lauch reprobation as Aristotle himself, that species of traffic <lb/>
            which is cultivated, not for accommodation but for gain; since <lb/>
            such a traffic, universally diffused among a people, has a tend­ <lb/>
            ency to pervert their feelings, and to confound their princi­ <lb/>
            ples ; to make them value as ends, things only useful as <lb/>
            means; and to debase and corrupt every part of their charac­ <lb/>
            ter ; because wherever wealth is the primary object of pursuit, <lb/>
            luxury will naturally afford the principal source of enjoyment. <lb/>
            In agriculture and pasturage, the energy of nature co-operates <lb/>
            with the industry of man. They are, of all occupations, the <lb/>
            most beneficial and most necessary, as well as the most agree­ <lb/>
            able and most salutary; conducing, with peculiar efficacy, to <lb/>
            the firmest and happiest temperament of the mind and body: <lb/>
            and the property acquired by them is intrinsically more valu­ <lb/>
            able, because essentially more useful, than any other property <lb/>
            whatever. Our author likewise maintains, that those natural <lb/>
            and primeval pursuits are of all the least likely to engender <lb/>
            sloth, intemperance, avarice, and their concomitant vices; and <note type="footnote"> 1 Polit. book vii. ch. 15. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xlii"/>
            that nations of husbandmen, in particular, afford materials <lb/>
            susceptible of the best political form, and the least disposed <lb/>
            to disturb, by sedition, any moderately good government un­ <lb/>
            der which it is their lot to live. In consideration of so many <lb/>
            advantages attending it, he concludes that rural labour ought <lb/>
            to be the most favoured branch of national industry; an opi­ <lb/>
            nion which nothing but the intrepidity of ignorance, fortified <lb/>
            by false system, could venture to contradict. Yet, how far <lb/>
            other methods of accumulating stock, beside those proposed <lb/>
            by our author, ought to be admitted and encouraged, or dis­ <lb/>
            couraged and rejected, must depend on circumstances and <lb/>
            events, the force of which the philosopher's experience could <lb/>
            not supply him with the means exactly to appreciate. From <lb/>
            the artifices and shifts which'he eXplains,-( and he is the <lb/>
            only writer that explains them,)—as practised by the repub­ <lb/>
            lies and princes of his own and preceding times, for the <lb/>
            purpose of raising money, it was impossible for him to conjec­ <lb/>
            ture that, in a future age of the world, monarchical govern­ <lb/>
            ment should attain such stability as would render the public <lb/>
            revenues a safe mortgage to creditors; that the immense <lb/>
            debts contracted through the facility of borrowing, would <lb/>
            have a direct tendency, by interesting a great number of <lb/>
            powerful individuals in the permanence of constituted author­ <lb/>
            ities, to augment that facility itself, and thereby still further <lb/>
            to accumulate the national debt; for discharging the interest <lb/>
            of which, heavy taxes must necessarily, but not altogether <lb/>
            unprofitably, be levied, since they would in some measure re­ <lb/>
            pay, in public security, the burdens which they impose on <lb/>
            personal labour, or rather the sums which they withdraw from <lb/>
            private property. But taxes to a great amount cannot possi­ <lb/>
            bly be raised, except in countries flourishing in such resources <lb/>
            as agriculture and pasturage alone were never yet able to <lb/>
            afford; resources, which can only be acquired by war and <lb/>
            rapine on the one hand, or obtained on the other, by the <lb/>
            powers of national industry, assisted and multiplied by the <lb/>
            most complicated machinery, and an endless subdivision of <lb/>
            allotted tasks; each individual performing his part quickly <lb/>
            and dexterously, because each has but one, and that a small <lb/>
            part, to perform; while the diligence of all is perpetually <lb/>
            stimulated by the bait of gain, supplied from the exhaustless <lb/>
            fund of an enlightened commercial spirit, as extensive as the <lb/>
             <pb n="xliii"/>
            world, and as enterprising as those renowned adventurers <lb/>
            who discovered and explored its remotest regions. It is in <lb/>
            vain to inquire whether the plan of political economy pro­ <lb/>
            posed by Aristotle be in itself preferable to that which some <lb/>
            modern nations pursue. Nations, circumstanced as they are, <lb/>
            may derive armies chiefly from agriculture, but must princi­ <lb/>
            pally depend for supplies on manufactures and commerce. <lb/>
            The option of their own or a better system is now no longer <lb/>
            in their power: the question of expediency has ceased: they <lb/>
            must obey necessity.1</p>
          <p>This seems to me the only firm ground of defence for what <lb/>
            is called the commercial system of economy ; a system which <lb/>
            has often been defended by very inclusive arguments. " Pub­ <lb/>
            lic wealth and prosperity," Mr. Hume observes, " is the end <lb/>
            of all our wishes;" and this wealth or prosperity, both he and <lb/>
            his follower, Dr. Smith, maintain, is only to be promoted by <lb/>
            encouraging, with equal impartiality, all kinds of lawful in­ <lb/>
            dustry ; for though food be the great want of mankind, yet <lb/>
            one man may produce as much food as will maintain many.2 <note type="footnote"> 1 It is not difficult to explain why the doctrines of speculative poli­ <lb/>
            ticians, respecting the wealth and economy of nations, should also differ <lb/>
            so materially from the theory proposed by our author. Among the Gothic <lb/>
            nations who subdued the Roman empire, every thing most valuable and <lb/>
            most interesting is connected with the improvement of arts, and conse­ <lb/>
            quent extension of commerce; which were the only engines that could <lb/>
            counteract without violence their peculiar and unnatural arrangements <lb/>
            with regard to landed property. Previous to the refinement and luxury <lb/>
            introduced by commerce and the arts, the great landholders, who had <lb/>
            engrossed whole provinces, dissipated the superfluous produce of their <lb/>
            grounds in maintaining idle servants and worthless dependents, ever ready <lb/>
            to gratify the wildest and wickedest of their passions, to abet their inso­ <lb/>
            lence, to uphold their haughtiness, to encourage and second their violence <lb/>
            and rapacity; and the governments of Europe, ignorantly termed arise <lb/>
            tocracies, formed the worst species of oligarchy ; an oligarchy consisting, <lb/>
            not in the collective authority of the whole body of landholders, but in <lb/>
            the prerogatives and powers of each individual lord over his respective <lb/>
            vassals and retainers. In such a condition of society the expensive <lb/>
            allurements of luxury, produced by what Aristotle condemns as over­ <lb/>
            refinement in arts and manufactures, had the most direct tendency to <lb/>
            remedy evils greater than themselves, to undermine the exorbitant power <lb/>
            of the few, and to bestow consideration on the many. This particular <lb/>
            case has been, by a very usual fallacy in reasoning, converted into a <lb/>
            general political axiom. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Hume's Essays, vol. i., " Refinement of Arts;" and Smith's Wealth <lb/>

             <pb n="xliv"/>
            But this assertion is not true in the acceptation in which it <lb/>
            must be taken, in order to recommend the commercial system <lb/>
            above the agricultural. In agriculture, as we above observed, <lb/>
            nature operates in concert with man; and though one family <lb/>
            co-operating with nature, may, in a given piece of ground, <lb/>
            produce as much food as will serve six, yet six families la­ <lb/>
            bouring the same ground, will not reap a proportional in­ <lb/>
            crease ; and twenty families labouring the same ground, may <lb/>
            find it barely sufficient to supply their own nourishment. <lb/>
            The more that the land is laboured, it will be the more pro­ <lb/>
            ductive; and the more fitly and fairly it is divided,' (other <lb/>
            circumstances remaining the same,) it will be the more la­ <lb/>
            boured ; and the same country or island will thus maintain <lb/>
            the greater proportion of inhabitants employed in that kind <lb/>
            of work, which, according to Aristotle, is the most favourable <lb/>
            to health, morals, good government, the development of intel­ <lb/>
            lectual as well as corporeal powers, and the attainment of that <lb/>
            measure of happiness which the general mass of mankind can <lb/>
            ever in this world hope to reach. <note type="footnote"> I Does our author, therefore, propose an Agrarian law ? No; he knew <lb/>
            better. The second book of his Politics is, of all works ever written, the <lb/>
            best adapted to prove to levellers themselves, that the measures from <lb/>
            which they expect so much good, if carried into execution, would infalli­ <lb/>
            bly terminate in their own ruin and that of the community. </note></p>

          <p>INTRODUCTORY.—Aristotle, in conformity with his usual <lb/>
            custom, commences the first Book of his treatise with a prac­ <lb/>
            tical inquiry into the parts or elements of which the state <lb/>
            is composed; and having laid down a brief outline of the <lb/>
            first principles of man's social nature, and of domestic life <lb/>
            in its various relations, he shows how these relations na­ <lb/>
            turally combine into that form of social existence which is <lb/>
            called a state. But before entering theoretically into the <lb/>
            nature of the best state, he gives, in Book II., a brief account <lb/>
            of, and criticism upon, the various forms of government which <lb/>
            have been devised by philsosophers and politicians. In Book <lb/>
            III. he proceeds to discuss in detail the state, the citizen, and <lb/>
            the government, with its various forms, and their respective <lb/>
            perversions and corruptions. In Book IV. he gives a brief <lb/>
            outline of his " Polity," or perfect republic, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πολιτεία</foreign>,) with <lb/>
            an enumeration of the magistrates necessary for carrying it <lb/>
            out: while Book V. enters philosophically into the causes <lb/>
            which tend to overthrow it. In Book VI. he returns to the <lb/>
            subject of democracy and oligarchy; while in the two con­ <lb/>
            cluding books of his treatise—(which has evidently come <lb/>
            down to us in a mutilated condition )-he enters into an ela­ <lb/>
            borate discussion of the best regulations of government in <lb/>
            his ideal polity, descending to the comparatively minute par­ <lb/>
            ticulars of the sites necessary for towns and houses, and the <lb/>
            laws requisite for regulating matrimony and the education of <lb/>
            the young, with a special view to the interests of the com­ <lb/>
            munity. In Book VIII. he commences his inquiry into the <lb/>
            education of the young, which breaks off most abruptly just at <pb n="xlvi"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK I."/> <lb/>
            the point where we should most earnestly have desired to see <lb/>
            our author's opinions fully and fairly worked out, in the de­ <lb/>
            velopment and practical application of those principles which <lb/>
            he has so carefully laid down.</p>

          <p>INTRODUCTORY.- THE first book divides itself into three <lb/>
            parts. (1.) Chap. i. and ii., concerning the family (<foreign xml:lang="grc">οἲκος</foreign>) and <lb/>
            village (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κώμη̖</foreign>), as integral parts of the state (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πόλις</foreign>). (2.) <lb/>
            Chap. iii.—vii. and xii. xiii., concerning the three domestic <lb/>
            relations, the herile, conjugal, and paternal. (3.) Chap. viii. <lb/>
            —xi., concerning the getting of money (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ χρηματιϭτική</foreign>).</p>
          <p>CHAP. I.—All society aims at some good end; therefore its <lb/>
            best and highest form will aim at the best end.</p>
          <p>Monarchical and republican governments do not differ in <lb/>
            number alone, but also in kind.</p>
          <p>To ascertain the nature of a state, we must first con­ <lb/>
            template it in its component parts.</p>
          <p>CHAP. II.—The first of domestic relations is the conjugal: <lb/>
            this is both natural and necessary; the male being by nature <lb/>
            formed and fitted to rule, the female to obey.</p>
          <p>The second relation is the herile: the slave formed by <lb/>
            nature to obey.</p>
          <p>Yet the wife and the slave differ, (except among barba­ <lb/>
            rians).</p>
          <p>From the former of these relations springs the paternal tie:</p>
          <p>And the combination of these three ties forms the family <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">οἲκος</foreign>).</p>
          <p>The gradual development of the family described, and <lb/>
            the consequent formation of the village (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κώμη</foreign>), which is <lb/>
            defined.</p>
          <p>The antiquity of monarchical rule deduced from the fact <lb/>
            that families were originally under one head.</p>
          <p>The formation of the state (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πόλις</foreign>); and its definition ; <lb/>
            its test, <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτάρκεια</foreign>, (i. e. its power to supply its own wants).</p>
          <p>The facts adduced here prove man to be a social creature, <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πολιτικόν ζω̃ον</foreign>,) and the founder of political life to be the <lb/>
            greatest of benefactors to the human race.</p>
          <p>CHAP. III.—In domestic rule, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">οἰκονομία</foreign>,) the three relations of <pb n="xlvii"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. IV.—VI.]"/> <lb/>
            the head as master, husband, and father, give the three <lb/>
            kinds of government which it embraces.</p>
          <p>These three relations further considered.</p>
          <p>The art of getting money (4 <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρηματιστική</foreign>) comes partly <lb/>
            under <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἰκονομία</foreign>.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IV.—Possessions (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κτήματα</foreign>) are parts of a house; and <lb/>
            hence <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ κτητική</foreign> is part of the economic art.</p>
          <p>Possessions are either animate (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂψυχα</foreign>) or inanimate, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">υχα</foreign>,)and relate either to <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόιησις</foreign> or to <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρα̃ξις</foreign>.</p>
          <p>A slave (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δου̃λς</foreign>) is a living instrument for practical pur­ <lb/>
            poses, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἒμψυχον ὂργανον τω̃ν πρὸς τὴν πρα̃ξιν</foreign>,) and he is a <lb/>
            part of his master, though separable (<foreign xml:lang="grc">χωριϭτόν</foreign>).</p>
          <p>The description of the characteristics of a good slave.</p>
          <p>CHAP. V.—Some are slaves by nature and birth, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">φύϭει</foreign>,) as <lb/>
            others are free and born to rule.</p>
          <p>This point established by sundry analogies, from the soul <lb/>
            with regard to the body, from the male with regard to the <lb/>
            female, etc., and from inanimate things.</p>
          <p>We infer, then, that subjection is a law of nature; and as <lb/>
            some men are born wholly inferior to others in mental and <lb/>
            moral endowments, it is clear that it is not only expedient <lb/>
            but just that they should be slaves.</p>
          <p>Mental power and energy is the test of free birth; mere <lb/>
            bodily efficiency marks the slave, whose whole excellence <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρετὴ</foreign>) lies in mere bodily activity.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VI.—There is also a second kind of slavery, which is <lb/>
            not natural, but by compact and agreement, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμψ</foreign>,) as for <lb/>
            example, where prisoners taken in war are reduced to the <lb/>
            rank of slaves.</p>
          <p>Some persons think this slavery just, others unjust.</p>
          <p>Aristotle attempts to reconcile the conflicting opinions by <lb/>
            laying down, that while such slavery is abstractedly unjust, <lb/>
            still to a certain extent it is defensible, because sanctioned <lb/>
            by the common law of nations.</p>
          <p>But it must be always unjust, when the war from which <lb/>
            it results is unjust, or when persons of noble birth are <lb/>
            enslaved.</p>
          <p>Slaves and their masters can have an identity of interest, <lb/>
            if they are such <foreign xml:lang="grc">φύϭει</foreign>; but nothing of the kind can exist <pb n="xlviii"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK L"/> <lb/>
            between the conqueror and his captive, because that relation <lb/>
            does not exist between them <foreign xml:lang="grc">φύϭει</foreign>.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VII.—Despotic and civil (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πολιτική</foreign>) rule differ; the <lb/>
            former is over slaves, the latter over freemen.</p>
          <p>The ruler of a household has monarchical or despotic <lb/>
            power.</p>
          <p>The test of political government is the alternation of <lb/>
            power and office between the rulers and the ruled.</p>
          <p>The science of ruling a household, so far as it relates to <lb/>
            slaves, is of an inferior character.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VIII.—Domestic rule is over, (1.) Persons; as wife, <lb/>
            children, and slaves. (2.) Possessions.</p>
          <p>Having already explained the herile relation, Aristotle <lb/>
            postpones (to chap. xii.) the further discussion of the domes­ <lb/>
            tic rule over persons, and confines himself to that over pos­ <lb/>
            sessions.</p>
          <p>Money-getting (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ χρηματιστική</foreign>) differs from the economic <lb/>
            art, in that the work of the former is to provide, of the latter <lb/>
            to use what has been already procured.</p>
          <p>'H <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρηματιϭτική</foreign> is divided into natural and artificial.</p>
          <p>Its natural form divided " secundum vitae, genera, et <lb/>
            modos.”</p>
          <p>(1.) The pastoral life. (2.) The chase. (3.) Agriculture.</p>
          <p>[The art of war (h <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολεμική</foreign>) comes partially under the <lb/>
            second of these heads ; for it is just to hunt by war men <lb/>
            who are born to be slaves.]</p>
          <p>True wealth consists, not in money, but in the produc­ <lb/>
            tions of nature.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IX.—The artificial form of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ χρηματιστική</foreign> considered.</p>
          <p>Every possession has two possible uses: the one proper, <lb/>
            the other improper, as a shoe may be used either to cover <lb/>
            the feet or for exchange.</p>
          <p>In the family all things were held in common; but as <lb/>
            families and villages increased into states, a system of ex­ <lb/>
            change grew up of necessity; and money was devised as <lb/>
            the standard and common measure of this exchange.</p>
          <p>The artificial form of % <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρηματιστική</foreign> an&lt;1 the economic <lb/>
            art differ in the fact that the former has no limit in its work <lb/>
            of collecting money, whereas the latter is limited by the <lb/>
            wants and necessities of man.</p><pb n="xlix"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. X.—XIII.]"/>
          <p>CHAP. X.—The money-getting art is subservient to the eco­ <lb/>
            nomic art, though not strictly a part of it.</p>
          <p>But it is only in its natural form that this is true; for</p>
          <p>Its artificial form (which is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ καπηλική</foreign>, traffic) does <lb/>
            not directly contribute to the ends of nature; and besides,</p>
          <p>In its furthest development, usury, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τοκισμός</foreign>,) it is to be <lb/>
            abominated, as being entirely unnatural (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ φύσιν</foreign>).</p>
          <p>CHAP. XI.—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ χρηματιϭτικὴ</foreign> practically divided into <lb/>
            (1.) Natural, embracing (a.) agriculture and (/3.) cattle. <lb/>
            (2.) <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεταβλητητική</foreign> or mercatorial, embracing three kinds, <lb/>
            a. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμπορία</foreign>, commerce. <lb/>
            /3. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοκιϭμός</foreign>, usury. <lb/>
            y. <foreign xml:lang="grc">μισθαρνία</foreign>, hiring, or contracting.</p>
          <p>Besides these two divisions, there is a third or mixed <lb/>
            kind, which is concerned with mining (h <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεταλλευτική</foreign>).</p>
          <p>Division of labours into servile and noble.</p>
          <p>The advantage of a practical knowledge of these matters <lb/>

            and paternal relations.</p>
          <p>In the former relation, the husband exercises political <lb/>

          <p>In the latter, the father exercises a despotic rule.</p>
          <p>Where political rule prevails, the ruler for the time being <lb/>
            is invested with external signs of dignity.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIII.—The master of a house should first regard the <lb/>

            <title type="sub">BOOK II.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>(INTRODUCTORY.) This book is divided into two parts; <lb/>
            (I.) chap. i.—viii., in which Aristotle discusses the ideal po­ <lb/>
            lities of Plato and of others, and (2.) chap. ix.—xii., in which <lb/>
            he treats of the existing constitutions of Sparta, Crete, and <lb/>
            Carthage.</p>
          <p>CHAP. I.—In order to exhibit the best form of a state, we <lb/>
            must examine the best existing states, and also the purely <lb/>
            ideal state (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ μάλιστα κατ̓εὐχήν</foreign>).</p>
          <p>It is necessary that there should be in every state (I.) a <lb/>
            community of all things, or (2.) of some things only, or <lb/>
            (3.) of nothing.</p>
          <p>The last of these three alternatives is contradicted by the <lb/>
            very idea of a state, as being a community, and sharing <lb/>
            therefore in site, etc.</p>
          <p>Ought then some things, or ought every thing, to be in <lb/>
            common in a good state ?</p>
          <p>In Plato's Republic all things are in common among the <lb/>
            citizens, even their children and wives. Should this be so <lb/>
            or not ?</p>
          <p>CHAP. II.—Plato's Republic discussed.</p>
          <p>The opinion of Socrates and Plato as to the community <lb/>
            of wives and children refuted.</p>
          <p>Aristotle denies that a state is best in proportion as it <lb/>
            is more entirely one ; for, (1.) the very theory of a state <lb/>
            excludes such a unity as Plato imagines; and (2.) a state <lb/>
            is overthrown by too complete a unity (<foreign xml:lang="grc">προϊου̃σα καὶ γιγνο­ <lb/>
            μένη μία μα̃λλον οὒδε πόλις ἒϭται</foreign>).</p>
          <p>A state is composed of persons differing in species (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξ <lb/>
            εἲδει διαφερόντων</foreign>) ; and it is the just balance (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἲϭον τὸ <lb/>
            ἀντιπεπονθός</foreign>) of the various elements which compose a <lb/>
            state that preserves it.</p>
          <p>Moreover a state must be self-dependent (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀυτάρκης</foreign>). But <lb/>
            all <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτάρκεια</foreign> would be destroyed by this Platonic unity.</p>
          <p>CHAP. III.—But granting that this unity tends to preserve, <lb/>
            and not to destroy a state; it does not follow that unity <lb/>
            would be realized, though the citizens should call their pro­ <lb/>
            perty common (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐὰν πάντες ἃμα λέγωσι τὸ ἐμὸν</foreign>feed <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ μη <lb/>
            ἐμόν</foreign>).</p><pb n="li"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. IV.—VI.]"/>
          <p>For the word “all” (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πάντες</foreign>) is used in two senses; Ist, <lb/>
            collectively, 2nd, distributively.</p>
          <p>And as every thing, (as wives, children, etc.,) would be­ <lb/>
            long to all the citizens collectively alone, and not distri­ <lb/>
            butively, they would not be cared for, since what is every­ <lb/>
            body's business is nobody's (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἣκιστα γὰρ ἐπιμελείας τυγχάνει</foreign> <lb/>
            TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλέιστωνκοινόν</foreign>).</p>
          <p>Such a state of things, instead of binding families to­ <lb/>
            gether, would do away with family affections, and so weaken <lb/>
            the state.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IV.—It would also give rise to incests and murders, <lb/>
            which would be inexpiable.</p>
          <p>Certain other difficulties and inconsistencies noticed in <lb/>
            the Republic of Plato</p>
          <p>How far the community of wives should be extended.</p>
          <p>Evils arising from the interchange of children, and from <lb/>
            the fact that nature will defeat the end proposed by So­ <lb/>
            crates, by the likeness of the children to individual citizens.</p>
          <p>CHAP. V—As to community of property, instead of bringing <lb/>
            about unity, it will be the parent of discord.</p>
          <p>It will also cause neglect, for what is everybody's busi­ <lb/>
            ness is nobody's.</p>
          <p>It will deprive individuals of the pleasure derived from <lb/>
            that which is TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἲδιονκαὶ</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγαπητόν</foreign>.</p>
          <p>It will cut off opportunities of practising the virtues of <lb/>
            temperance and liberality.</p>
          <p>This too great unity, then, will destroy the very essence <lb/>
            of a state, as harmony would be destroyed if all sounds <lb/>
            were reduced to a single note.</p>
          <p>A state then is not a mere individual, but a body com­ <lb/>
            posed of dissimilar parts, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πλη̃θος ἐξ ἀνομοίων</foreign>,) and its <lb/>
            unity is to be drawn "ex dissimilium hominum consensu."</p>
          <p>The perpetuity of the magistrates in office, which flows <lb/>
            as a consequence from the myth in Plato concerning the <lb/>
            three classes of citizens, in whose natures gold, silver, and <lb/>
            brass are blended, will be a further cause of strife.</p>
          <p>It is also absurd to attempt to make the whole state <lb/>
            happy, while its component parts are deprived of their <lb/>
            proper happiness.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VI.—Plato's book of Laws discussed. <note type="footnote"> e 2 </note></p><pb n="lii"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK II."/>
          <p>It omits all mention of many important points; such as <lb/>
            the discipline of the citizens.</p>
          <p>It divides the citizens into two classes or castes, but says <lb/>
            nothing of the lower class bearing arms.</p>
          <p>It says nothing of the education of the lower class.</p>
          <p>It confines itself to laws, and says little about govern­ <lb/>
            ment.</p>
          <p>Some discrepancies noticed between the " Laws " of Plato <lb/>
            and his " Republic.”</p>
          <p>General character of the Socratic dialogues.</p>
          <p>Absurdity of framing polities which cannot be realized; <lb/>
            and of using vague terms ;</p>
          <p>And of enforcing equality of property.</p>
          <p>It is better to regulate the population. Pheidon the Cor­ <lb/>
            inthian. Plato.</p>
          <p>Plato's state tends to a perfect community of goods, but <lb/>
            does not approach the true standard of excellence.</p>
          <p>Great merits of the Spartan constitution; it blends to­ <lb/>
            gether a variety of forms.</p>
          <p>The monarchical form has not justice done to it in the <lb/>
            Republic of Plato.</p>
          <p>Prevalence of the oligarchic principle in the election of <lb/>
            senate.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VII.—The ideal state of Phaleas; based on equality of <lb/>
            property, as a guarantee against discord.</p>
          <p>We object, first, that he limits the property, but not the <lb/>
            number of the citizens ;</p>
          <p>And further, that an equality of property does not suffice <lb/>
            to suppress discords;</p>
          <p>Because, if men do not contend about goods, they will <lb/>
            for honour.</p>
          <p>Other points are left undefined by Phaleas, as to military <lb/>
            affairs and external policy.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VIII.—The ideal state of Hippodamus consisted of <lb/>
            10,000 citizens, divided into three classes, artizans, hus­ <lb/>
            bandmen, and soldiery.</p>
          <p>The land of the state to be divided into three parts, sa­ <lb/>
            cred, common, and private.</p>
          <p>Three kinds of law-suits to be admitted, with one su­ <lb/>
            preme tribunal of appeal; and the amount of punishment <pb n="liii"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. IX.]"/> <lb/>
            to be settled by the sentence of the judges written on a <lb/>
            tablet.</p>
          <p>Honours and rewards to be given to those who have <lb/>
            done good service to the state, and their children to be <lb/>
            reared at the public expense.</p>
          <p>The magistrates to be elected by the three classes of the <lb/>
            people.</p>
          <p>Objections of Aristotle against the system of Phaleas.</p>
          <p>(1.) He has done wrong in giving full rights of citizens <lb/>
            to the second and third class, though he has deprived them <lb/>
            of arms.</p>
          <p>(2.) The husbandmen till the land, not for themselves, <lb/>
            but for the soldiery.</p>
          <p>(3.) There is no class to till the public land, each being <lb/>
            busied with its own duties.</p>
          <p>(4.) The office of the judge is confounded with that of <lb/>
            an arbiter.</p>
          <p>(5.) The system of rewards tends to produce calumnies <lb/>
            and detractions, and thus a premium is offered for innova­ <lb/>
            tions ; but a change of laws and institutions is perilous <lb/>
            in any state.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IX.—In testing a constitution, we should ask, (1.) <lb/>
            whether it is consistent with the idea of perfection or not ? <lb/>
            and (2.) whether it is consistent with itself?</p>
          <p>All political writers agree that citizens should be ex <lb/>
            empted from illiberal arts and labours.</p>
          <p>But they differ as to the means of effecting this end.</p>
          <p>The Spartan constitution faulty, (1.) Because it allots the <lb/>
            illiberal arts to strangers, and gives agriculture to the He­ <lb/>
            lots.</p>
          <p>(2.) It does not enforce authority over the women. <lb/>
            Hence the women at Sparta, and indeed in all warlike <lb/>
            states, grow licentious, owing to the long absence of the <lb/>
            male population who are serving in arms.</p>
          <p>(3.) Too great a share of property is given to the women <lb/>
            at Sparta.</p>
          <p>(4.) The choice of Ephors from the lower ranks is ob­ <lb/>
            jectionable.</p>
          <p>(5.) The senators retain their office when they are too <lb/>
            old and past their work.</p><pb n="liv"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[ BOOK II."/>
          <p>(6.) The common meals are open to objection as being <lb/>
            defrayed by private and not public cost.</p>
          <p>(7.) The permanency of the post of admiral of the Spar­ <lb/>
            tan fleet is objectionable.</p>
          <p>(8.) The end of the Spartan constitution and of the in­ <lb/>
            stitutions of Lycurgus, namely, war, is a wrong end. As <lb/>
            was proved by fact: for Sparta throve, as long as she was <lb/>
            engaged in war and acquiring power; but as soon as she <lb/>
            had gained the summit of her ambition, she fell through <lb/>
            luxury and licentiousness.</p>
          <p>CHAP. X.—The constitution of Crete is like that of Sparta, <lb/>
            though less skilfully contrived.</p>
          <p>How Lycurgus became acquainted with the legislation <lb/>
            of Minos.</p>
          <p>The natural advantages of the situation of Crete.</p>
          <p>Analogy between the Spartan Helots and the Cretan <lb/>
            serfs—common tables—the Ephors and Cosmi.</p>
          <p>Objections against the constitution of the senates of <lb/>
            Sparta and Crete, as irresponsible (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνυπεύθυνοι</foreign>).</p>
          <p>Practical evil consequences.</p>
          <p>The insular position of Crete saves it from external at­ <lb/>
            tacks, and keeps the serfs from revolting.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XT.—The constitution of Carthage is like the two above <lb/>
            mentioned: but better; for it has remained a long time un­ <lb/>
            changed.</p>
          <p>Common tables. Council of the " hundred and four," <lb/>
            answering to the Ephors and Cosmi.</p>
          <p>The kings or suffetes at Carthage chosen on a better <lb/>
            principle than at Sparta.</p>
          <p>The ruling body chosen on a good principle.</p>

          <p>Advantages of placing political power in the hands of <lb/>

          <p>(1.) Admixture of oligarchic and democratical principles.</p>
          <p>(2.) Pluralism, and its ill effects.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>THIS book naturally is divided into two parts. (1.) Chap. <lb/>
            i.—v., in which the definition of a citizen and of a city or state <lb/>
            is considered. (2.) Chap. vi.—xvii., which discuss succes­ <lb/>
            sively the various forms of government.</p>
          <p>CHAP. I.—First question, "what is a state?"</p>
          <p>It is a whole body or system made up of citizens.</p>
          <p>What then is a citizen? To answer this, let us first see <lb/>
            who are not citizens.</p>
          <p>Slaves, sojourners, children, degraded persons, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂτιμοι</foreign>,) <lb/>
            are not called citizens, because they have no share in the <lb/>
            government.</p>
          <p>It is this share which constitutes a man a citizen. Ob­ <lb/>
            jection answered.</p>
          <p>But in different states it is not always the same persons <lb/>
            who will have the rights of citizens; ( e. g. in a tyranny <lb/>
            the people have no share.)</p>
          <p>Hence our definition of a citizen will only apply strictly <lb/>
            to a democracy or polity; for no one can be truly a citizen <lb/>
            who is absolutely excluded from obtaining civil power.</p>
          <p>CHAP. II.—The popular definition of a citizen, as a person <lb/>
            who has one parent at least a citizen, considered.</p>
          <p>Its absurdity shown by considering the case of the first <lb/>
            founders of a state or a family.</p>
          <p>The true test of citizenship is the actual right of holding <lb/>
            office ; whether justly or unjustly, it matters not.</p>
          <p>CHAP. III.—The identity of a state is not altered, though its <lb/>
            outward form is changed.</p>
          <p>When may a state be said to be the same ?</p>
          <p>Its identity does not consist in mere sameness of situation.</p>
          <p>Is it then in containing the same inhabitants ; as a river <lb/>
            or fountain is still the same, though its waters are for ever <lb/>
            changing ?</p><pb n="lvi"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[ BOOK III."/>
          <p>No, for the form of government may be changed, though <lb/>
            its material part continues the same.</p>
          <p>It consists therefore, in the same form of government <lb/>
            being preserved.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IV.—The good man and the good citizen are not ab­ <lb/>
            stractedly (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁπλω̃ς</foreign>) the same; nor, consequently, is the virtue <lb/>
            of the one and of the other the same.</p>
          <p>For the virtue of a good man is always the same, since <lb/>
            it is the union of all the moral virtues.</p>
          <p>But that of a good citizen differs with the form of go­ <lb/>
            vernment ; and in the same state the virtue of some citizens <lb/>
            differs from that of others.</p>
          <p>The virtue of a ruler in a state, and of a good man, may <lb/>
            possibly be the same; and in the best ideal state, the good <lb/>
            citizens must also be good men.</p>
          <p>The peculiar virtue of a ruler is <foreign xml:lang="grc">φρόνησς</foreign>, or prudence.</p>
          <p>Servile occupations do not befit citizens.</p>
          <p>In a political government, or that of equals, the citizen <lb/>
            must learn how to obey and command; and therefore, to <lb/>
            some extent, the virtue of a good citizen and of a good man <lb/>
            may be identical.</p>
          <p>CHAP. V.—Reasons for regarding mechanics as citizens, and <lb/>
            also for excluding them from citizenship.</p>
          <p>In the best state, mechanics and tradesmen will not be <lb/>
            citizens.</p>
          <p>They may be admitted, however, to civil rights in an <lb/>
            oligarchy or democracy, especially if they become rich.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VI.—Being about to speak concerning the various forms <lb/>
            of government, Aristotle now proceeds to define a common­ <lb/>
            wealth (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πολιτεία</foreign>).</p>
          <p>The government differs according to the number of hands <lb/>
            in which the supreme power is lodged.</p>
          <p>Man is a social being, and has a natural tendency to asso­ <lb/>
            ciate with others, even apart from all consideration of per­ <lb/>
            sonal wants and mutual benefits.</p>
          <p>The rule of a master over his slave is primarily for the <lb/>
            benefit of himself, and accidentally for that of his slave ; but <lb/>
            the master of a house rules over his wife and children for <lb/>
            their common good as well as his own.</p><pb n="lvii"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. VII.—IX.]"/>
          <p>Just so, in states, the ruling body, be it composed of one <lb/>
            or of many, may regard the interest of itself only, or that <lb/>
            of the entire community.</p>
          <p>All those forms of government which regard the common <lb/>
            good, are right and proper forms.</p>
          <p>And those which do not, are perversions or corrupt forms <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παρεκβάσεις</foreign>).</p>
          <p>CHAP. VII.—The various kinds of government.</p>
          <p>There are three proper kinds, (1.) monarchy, (2.) aris­ <lb/>
            tocracy, and (3.) a commonwealth.</p>
          <p>Corresponding to which are their three respective per­ <lb/>
            versions, (1.) tyranny, (2.) oligarchy, (3.) democracy.</p>
          <p>The latter are distinguished from the former, by their <lb/>
            regarding the interest, not of the community in general, <lb/>
            but of the rulers only.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VIII.—Tyranny is a despotic monarchy: and the sub­ <lb/>
            jects of a tyranny are analogous to slaves.</p>
          <p>The state is an oligarchy when power is exclusively in <lb/>
            the hands of the rich; a democracy, when in the hands of <lb/>
            the poor only; whether they be few or many, in either case <lb/>
            it matters not.</p>
          <p>Still it seldom happens that the rich in an oligarchy are <lb/>
            many in number, or that the poor in a democracy are few.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IX.—The Athenians held that a democracy was just; <lb/>
            the Spartans thought in like manner of an oligarchy; the <lb/>
            former considering that every thing should be equal, as the <lb/>
            citizens were all equal in liberty; the latter, that things <lb/>
            should be equal among those who were already equal in <lb/>
            power and riches.</p>
          <p>Now neither party are wholly right.</p>
          <p>For firstly, individuals are bad judges in their own case.</p>
          <p>And secondly, they are apt to confound what is relatively <lb/>
            just with that which is so abstractedly.</p>
          <p>Virtue and merit, not riches and liberty, ought to have <lb/>
            supreme power in the state; and the best citizens are not <lb/>
            the most wealthy or free, but those of the highest virtue.</p>
          <p>This position proved from considering the end of a state; <lb/>
            which is, not merely life, or mutual aid, or commercial in­ <lb/>
            tercourse, but a perfect and happy life, sufficiently supplied <lb/>
            with external goods, and which looks to virtue as its aim.</p><pb n="lviii"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK III."/>
          <p>CHAP. X.—In whose hands ought the supreme power of a <lb/>
            state to be lodged ? In the hands of one or of more ?</p>
          <p>The different inconveniences which arise under each <lb/>
            form of government.</p>
          <p>Under a democracy, there is danger of the poor laying <lb/>
            violent hands on the property of the rich.</p>
          <p>Under an oligarchy, there is danger lest the wealthy few <lb/>
            should tyrannize over the poor.</p>
          <p>Under an aristocracy, lest the many should be left ex­ <lb/>
            cluded from honours and office.</p>
          <p>Under a monarchy, lest all but the reigning sovereign <lb/>
            should be excluded.</p>
          <p>But if any one says that the law should be supreme, the <lb/>
            difficulty remains the same; for the law must be adminis­ <lb/>
            tered by men, under any form of government, and must be <lb/>
            accommodated to that form.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XI.—It is better to lodge power in the hands of the <lb/>
            many than of the few.</p>
          <p>For collectively the citizens will unite many points of ex­ <lb/>
            cellence which one individual could not possess.</p>
          <p>It is not however safe to intrust the highest magistracies <lb/>
            to a poor and ignorant multitude, nor yet wholly to exclude <lb/>
            them from office. They must therefore have a share in <lb/>
            deliberative and judicial functions.</p>
          <p>Thus Solon gave them at Athens the right of election <lb/>
            and of scrutiny (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐθύνη</foreign>).</p>
          <p>A fusion of the upper and lower classes is good for both <lb/>
            and for the state.</p>
          <p>Brief review of the constitution of Solon.</p>
          <p>In the professors of the arts there are three grades; the <lb/>
            lowest grade executes practically, another prescribes, while <lb/>
            the third and highest studies the theory; and even the <lb/>
            lowest grade, by mere experience, comes to be a fit judge <lb/>
            of matters within its own sphere.</p>
          <p>Just so in political matters, the multitude, even though <lb/>
            they know nothing of the political science, and hold no ma­ <lb/>
            gistracy, still can form a good practical judgment upon go­ <lb/>
            vernment in general, and even a better one than those in <lb/>
            office, who cannot see their own defects and errors.</p>
          <p>The supreme power should rest with the laws, if they are <lb/>
            just.</p><pb n="lix"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. XII.—XIV.]"/>
          <p>CHAP. XII.—Justice (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ δίκαιον</foreign>) is the end of the political <lb/>
            science.</p>
          <p>But justice is a certain equality; and equality is of two <lb/>
            kinds, like justice itself.</p>
          <p>In distribution of honours, mere equality or inequality of <lb/>
            things is not to be regarded.</p>
          <p>But the end and interest of the state itself must be taken <lb/>
            into account.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIII.—If a state contains the rich, the noble, the good, <lb/>
            and the multitude, to which of these classes shall the public <lb/>
            honours be given ?</p>
          <p>To answer this, let us first settle whether upright laws <lb/>
            ought to regard the interest of the good, or of the multi­ <lb/>
            tude.</p>
          <p>Clearly they should refer to the common good: and a <lb/>
            citizen will be one who has a share both in governing and <lb/>
            in being governed.</p>
          <p>The citizen differs in each different form of government, <lb/>
            etc.</p>
          <p>As to men of pre-eminent and heroic virtue, if such be <lb/>
            found, the supreme power should be given to them; for <lb/>
            they stand in the relation of gods to their fellow-men; and <lb/>
            it is absurd to legislate for such individuals; for they are a <lb/>
            law to themselves.</p>
          <p>Great pre-eminence, however, in merit or civil power, is <lb/>
            an object of suspicion among citizens.</p>
          <p>Ostracism devised as a remedy against this evil in free <lb/>
            states.</p>
          <p>Corresponding methods adopted in other states.</p>
          <p>The principle defended from the analogy of the arts.</p>
          <p>Pre-eminence of political power not to be tolerated ; but <lb/>
            the man who is pre-eminent in virtue should be elected <lb/>
            king, and receive perfect submission from all.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIV.—Discussion concerning particular forms of go­ <lb/>
            vernment ; firstly concerning the right forms, secondly con­ <lb/>
            cerning their perversions.</p>
          <p>Is monarchy better adapted for practical purposes than <lb/>
            any other form ?</p>
          <p>To answer this question, we distinguish the different <lb/>
            kinds of monarchy.</p><pb n="lx"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> [BOOK in. </note> </p>
          <p>(1.) That established at Sparta; which is, in fact, a per­ <lb/>
            petual generalship.</p>
          <p>(2.) Hereditary; as among barbarians.</p>
          <p>(3.) Elective; called JEsymneteia in ancient Greece.</p>
          <p>(4.) Limited monarchy, such as that of the heroic times.</p>
          <p>(5.) Absolute and paternal.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XV.—These five kinds may be reduced to two, the ab­ <lb/>
            solute and the Lacedaemonian forms.</p>
          <p>Two questions proposed; (1.) Is it for the interest of the <lb/>
            state to have a perpetual monarchy established, as at Sparta ? <lb/>
            This question postponed.</p>
          <p>(2.) Is it better to be under an absolute king, or under <lb/>
            the best of laws ?</p>
          <p>The law does not enter into particular cases, but the king <lb/>
            can do so in executing the law.</p>
          <p>It is absurd, therefore, to go upon a mere written law.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, the law is not affected by passion as <lb/>
            a king is.</p>
          <p>In the best state, the law and the king should conspire.</p>
          <p>Is it better to leave the correction of the written law to <lb/>
            one or to many ?</p>
          <p>Three reasons in favour of the latter.</p>
          <p>Monarchy, as compared with aristocracy, is free from fac­ <lb/>
            tions ; though if the members of an aristocracy be good, <lb/>
            they can be as one man; hence aristocracy is to be pre­ <lb/>
            ferred.</p>
          <p>Monarchy proved to be the more ancient form; for it was <lb/>
            easier to find one good man than many; and it is only as <lb/>
            good citizens increased, that aristocracies supplanted mon­ <lb/>
            archies, and in turn were supplanted by democracies.</p>
          <p>The love of wealth and gain next paved the way for <lb/>
            oligarchies, which soon were turned into tyrannies, and <lb/>
            these at length reverted to the form of democracies. I</p>
          <p>Two questions proposed; (1.) Whether upon the suppo­ <lb/>
            sition of a monarchy being the best form, it ought to be <lb/>
            made hereditary ? (2.) Whether a king has need of arms <lb/>
            and soldiery to support him ?</p>
          <p>The former question left unsolved: it is bad to have as <lb/>

          <p>The second question solved: the king ought to have a <lb/>
            sufficient guard to enforce the laws.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVI.—An absolute monarchy not natural. It is better <lb/>
            that the law should be supreme, than any citizen.</p>
          <p>(1.) The citizens being all equal, it is unjust not to give <lb/>
            them equal dignity.</p>
          <p>(The law should be supreme, and the magistrates minis­ <lb/>
            ters of the law.)</p>
          <p>(2.) The law is intellect free from all passions, and the <lb/>
            supremacy of the law is but the supremacy of God under <lb/>
            another name.</p>
          <p>(The argument supported by the analogy of the medical <lb/>
            art.)</p>
          <p>(3.) Many eyes see better than one eye.</p>
          <p>(4.) Two good men are better than one.</p>
          <p>(5.) The policy of kings in power proves the superiority <lb/>
            of aristocracy; for they impart a share of their power to <lb/>
            friends.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XVII.—Men are not all fitted to one kind of govern­ <lb/>
            ment ; but some to a despotism, others to a political state.</p>
          <p>Three kinds of government are natural; monarchy, aris­ <lb/>
            tocracy, and a republic ; the others are unnatural.</p>
          <p>In a true and well-constituted republic, all the citizens <lb/>
            should have a share of rule.</p>
          <p>Any person of pre-eminent merit ought to be chosen king; <lb/>
            for any other arrangement will involve an inequality and <lb/>
            absurdity.</p>
          <p>The same course of education and training which make <lb/>
            a good man, will also make a good citizen or king.</p>

          <p>INTRODUCTORY. — THIS book contains three parts: (1.) <lb/>
            Chap. i.—iii., which treats of states in general. (2.) Chap. <lb/>
            v.—xiii., of their different forms. (3.) Chap. xiv.—xvi., the <lb/>
            component parts of a free state.</p>
          <p>CHAP. I.—The politician ought to be acquainted with four <lb/>
            things;</p>
          <p>(1.) What is the best ideal and abstract polity.</p>
          <p>(2.) What is the best viewed practically.</p><pb n="lxii"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK IV."/>
          <p>(3.) The nature of the constitution of his own state and <lb/>
            its means of preservation.</p>
          <p>(4.) What government is best suited to all states.</p>
          <p>Argument drawn from analogy of the arts and sciences.</p>
          <p>The medical art ought to ascertain the best abstract <lb/>
            bodily condition, the same viewed practically, and so forth.</p>
          <p>The politician ought to study existing forms of govern­ <lb/>
            ment, and existing laws.</p>
          <p>CHAP. II. A repetition of what was said in the last book con­ <lb/>
            cerning monarchy and aristocracy, and the division of <lb/>
            governments into natural and unnatural.</p>
          <p>We come now to consider a polity properly so called ; and <lb/>
            also to treat of oligarchy, democracy, and tyranny.</p>
          <p>A tyranny is the worst perversion, as being the corrup­ <lb/>
            tion of the best form.</p>
          <p>And consequently a democracy is the least bad perversion.</p>
          <p>An outline of our future method.</p>
          <p>CHAP. III.—A variety of constituent parts causes a corre­ <lb/>
            sponding variety in the forms of government.</p>
          <p>The rich and the poor, the noble and ignoble, etc., con­ <lb/>
            stitute these different parts.</p>
          <p>The noble, too, may be so called, from their riches, or <lb/>
            their birth, or their personal merit.</p>
          <p>The error of those who reckon only two forms of govern­ <lb/>
            ment, oligarchy and democracy.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IV.—The test of a democracy is the supreme power <lb/>
            being vested in its poor but free citizens, as superior in <lb/>
            numbers to the rest.</p>
          <p>That of an oligarchy in its being vested in the wealthy <lb/>
            citizens, though inferior in numbers.</p>
          <p>As the various genera of animals are distinguished by <lb/>
            the varied composition of their bodily organs, so it is in <lb/>
            polities.</p>
          <p>And their different genera are subdivided into various <lb/>
            minuter species.</p>
          <p>The component parts of a state are eight different classes.</p>
          <p>Plato censured for introducing into his state none but <lb/>
            such as are employed in necessary matters of daily life, <lb/>
            emitting such as belong to the liberal arts.</p><pb n="lxiii"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. V.—IX.]"/>
          <p>Five classes of democracies; the last of which is tyran­ <lb/>
            nical, because the laws are not supreme in it.</p>
          <p>CHAP. V.-Oligarchy distinguished into its four kinds.</p>
          <p>(1.) When its members are chosen from a high census.</p>
          <p>(2.) When its members are chosen from a low census, <lb/>
            to supply vacancies.</p>
          <p>(3.) Hereditary.</p>
          <p>(4.) When the richest individual is chosen, without re­ <lb/>
            gard to the law or merit. This tyrannical, and called a <lb/>
            dynasty.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VI.—Democracy similarly distinguished into its four <lb/>
            kinds.</p>
          <p>In what cases the four kinds of oligarchy are respectively <lb/>
            found.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VII.—A polity, properly so called, very rarely found in <lb/>
            existence.</p>
          <p>There are three kinds of aristocracy, to be distinguished <lb/>
            from each other.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VIII.—A polity or republic.</p>
          <p>It is an admixture or fusion together of oligarchy and <lb/>
            democracy; its offices being open, as in the former, to the <lb/>
            rich, and to the poor, as in the latter.</p>
          <p>And hence, it is called an aristocracy or a democracy, <lb/>
            according as it tends to the one or the other of these extremes.</p>
          <p>But the name of an aristocracy is not rightly given to it; <lb/>
            for an aristocracy and an oligarchy differ very widely.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IX.—The origin of a polity considered.</p>
          <p>It arises from a fusion of oligarchic and democratic prin­ <lb/>
            ciples; and this in three ways.</p>
          <p>(1.) Where a fine is laid on the rich, and pay is given <lb/>
            to the poor.</p>
          <p>(2.) Where the standard is moderate for the admission <lb/>
            of citizens to political power.</p>
          <p>(3.) Where an oligarchic principle (such as election by <lb/>
            votes) is combined with a democratic principle (such as <lb/>
            election of persons without an income).</p>
          <p>The first test of a good admixture is, if you are able to <lb/>
            call the same state by either name indiscriminately; for <lb/>
            each extreme should be recognised in the mean.</p><pb n="lxiv"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK IT."/>
          <p>CHAP. X.—Three kinds of tyranny. (1.) That among bar­ <lb/>
            barians. (2.) The CEsymnetic.</p>
          <p>These are not tyrannies, but monarchies, if exercised <lb/>
            over willing subjects.</p>
          <p>Upon this point, see above, book iii.</p>
          <p>(3.) The last kind is that which is the most perfect coun­ <lb/>
            terpart to monarchy; viz. where one individual is supreme <lb/>
            and irresponsible, and consults his own interest, and not <lb/>
            that of his subjects.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XI.—The best practicable form of government and the <lb/>
            happiest state is that in which the middle ranks are very <lb/>
            numerous.</p>
          <p>For the upper ranks, if many, become factious and de­ <lb/>
            spotic: the lower classes, if they preponderate, produce <lb/>
            fraud and malice, and tend to servility.</p>
          <p>The middle state safest and best.</p>
          <p>This kind of republic is rarely found, because a large <lb/>
            middle class is rare: so democracies and oligarchies pre­ <lb/>
            vail.</p>
          <p>The best form of democracy, or of oligarchy, is that which <lb/>
            most nearly approximates to this polity; the worst, which <lb/>
            departs furthest from it.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XII.—The conservative element ought to have greater <lb/>
            weight and authority in a state than the element which is <lb/>
            given to change.</p>
          <p>There are two things in a state, quality and quantity.</p>
          <p>By quantity is meant numbers; by quality, wealth, no­ <lb/>
            bility, etc.</p>
          <p>Sometimes the one party excels in quantity, and the other <lb/>
            in quality.</p>
          <p>A democracy is best where the popular party by its quan­ <lb/>
            tity surpasses the quality of the nobler class; an oligarchy, <lb/>
            where the contrary takes place.</p>
          <p>The law to be especially directed to the interests of the <lb/>
            middle class.</p>
          <p>The mistakes of statesmen who seek to bend states <lb/>
            towards aristocracy.</p>
          <p>The riches of the wealthy more to be feared than the <lb/>
            humble state of the poor; for the people will easily rise <lb/>
            against a wealthy nobility.</p><pb n="lxv"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. XIII.—XV.]"/>
          <p>CHAP. XIII.—The tricks used by nobles against the poor, and <lb/>
            by the poor against the nobles.</p>
          <p>(1.) The rich nobles cajole the lower orders in matters <lb/>
            connected with the assembly, the magistracies, the law <lb/>
            courts, the arms, the exercises.</p>
          <p>(2.) On the contrary, the people have their own weapons <lb/>
            of defence; in oligarchies they fine the rich, in democracies <lb/>
            they pay the poor for attendance at the council.</p>
          <p>In a polity, rightly so called, the chief power lies in the <lb/>
            hands of the soldiery.</p>
          <p>After the cessation of monarchy in Greece, the soldiery <lb/>
            constituted the state; first the cavalry, and second, the foot- <lb/>
            soldiers.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XIV.—There are three departments in every republic: <lb/>
            the deliberative, the executive, and the judicial.</p>
          <p>The first of these is the chief. A share in its deliber­ <lb/>
            ations is either given to all citizens, (in which case it is de­ <lb/>
            mocratic ;) or else to a few only, (which renders it olig­ <lb/>
            archic ;) or such a share is given to all in certain matters <lb/>
            only; or to a select few in certain matters.</p>
          <p>The tendency of the state affected by the mode of elec­ <lb/>
            tion. It will be aristocratic, if the election is by vote; de­ <lb/>
            mocratic, if by lot.</p>
          <p>Democratical and oligarchical precepts.</p>
          <p>In democracies pay should be given to the poor for at­ <lb/>
            tendance ; the rich should be fined for absenting themselves.</p>
          <p>Persons to be chosen from all ranks for deliberation.</p>
          <p>In an oligarchy, some few members of the senate should <lb/>
            be chosen by the people.</p>
          <p>Power of deliberation to be given to all members of the <lb/>
            state; but of execution, only to the magistrates.</p>
          <p>The power of pardon to be given to the many; of con­ <lb/>
            demnation, to the magistrates only.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XV.—As to the magistracy, a question arises as to <lb/>
            what and how many they should be, perpetual or not, and <lb/>
            from what class they should be chosen.</p>
          <p>A magistrate defined as one who has the right of deliber­ <lb/>
            ation, of judging, and of ordaining, but especially the last <lb/>
            right.</p>
          <p>With respect to an union of more than one office in a <note type="footnote"> 1 </note> <pb n="lxvi"/>

            single magistrate, it is laid down that in large states such <lb/>
            an arrangement is not proper, but necessary in a small one.</p>

          <p>Magistrates to inspect the behaviour of the youths and <lb/>

          <p>INTRODUCTORY.- THIS book, (which, together with the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing one, Gillies regards as supplemental to the rest, and <lb/>
            therefore places last in order, as Books VII. and VIII.,) <lb/>
            contains two parts: (1.) Chap. i—iv. On the causes of the <lb/>
            preservation and overthrow of democratic states; (2.) Chap. <lb/>
            v.—xii. On those of a monarchy or tyranny.</p>
          <p>CHAP. I.—The origin of all sedition lies in false views of <lb/>
            equality.</p>
          <p>Persons are apt to think that because they are equal in <lb/>
            one point, they are equal in all.</p>
          <p>And hence they desire complete equality.</p>
          <p>Others, of higher rank, desire not equality, but superiority.</p>
          <p>How changes of governments take place.</p>
          <p>(1.) When their form is changed into another.</p>
          <p>(2.) When the form remains, but the ruling body is <lb/>
            changed.</p>
          <p>(3.) When the form and the ruling body remaining, the <lb/>
            government departs from its own theory, or carries out its <lb/>
            own principles to a further length.</p>
          <p>Democracy and oligarchy are practically the most com­ <lb/>
            mon forms of government.</p>
          <p>Governments generally fail through being based on a <lb/>
            wrong principle at first.</p>
          <p>An oligarchy is less safe than a democracy, because com­ <lb/>
            posed of a larger number of individuals of the middle class.</p>
          <p>CHAP. II.—The first cause of sedition is a false idea of equality, <pb n="lxvii"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. III.—VII.]"/> <lb/>
            (see chap. i.,) when citizens forget that equality is not ab­ <lb/>
            solute, but relative.</p>
          <p>Another is the desire of gain and honours, with fear of <lb/>
            their opposites.</p>
          <p>Several other causes enumerated.</p>
          <p>CHAP. III.—Further exposition of the eleven causes of se­ <lb/>
            dition mentioned in the preceding chapter, illustrated by <lb/>
            examples.</p>
          <p>Origin of ostracism.</p>
          <p>Difference of race, or of site, or of merit, tends to sedition.</p>
          <p>Historical examples of seditions.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IV.—Republics are sometimes disturbed by seditions <lb/>
            on trifling matters; e. g. by love affairs.</p>
          <p>Dissensions are the bane of all states.</p>
          <p>The state suffers perversion by changes of party or of <lb/>
            ranks in the state.</p>
          <p>Two special methods of overthrowing a state ; treachery <lb/>
            and violence.</p>
          <p>Different kinds under each method.</p>
          <p>CHAP. V.—Thus far as to the overthrow of governments in <lb/>
            general: now of particular kinds.</p>
          <p>As to a democracy, it is overthrown by the petulance of <lb/>
            mob orators.</p>
          <p>It generally becomes changed into a tyranny, or an olig­ <lb/>
            archy, or some better or worse form of democracy.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VI.—As to an oligarchy; it is overthrown by two <lb/>
            especial causes:</p>
          <p>Either by the violence of the nobles towards the lower <lb/>
            orders; or</p>
          <p>By the internal dissensions of its rulers.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VII.—An aristocracy is subverted by several causes.</p>
          <p>By reason of the fewness of those who share in honours.</p>
          <p>Through the nobles being partly rich and partly poor.</p>
          <p>If one of the nobles is too pre-eminent; for so he comes <lb/>
            to aim at a tyranny.</p>
          <p>Through a transgression of justice. This cause is com­ <lb/>
            mon also to a polity; and it arises in either case from the <lb/>
            fact that the constituent parts of each are not well blended <lb/>
            together. <note type="footnote"> f 2 </note></p><pb n="lxviii"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> [BOOK V. </note></p>
          <p>All states are mostly changed into that form towards <lb/>
            which they naturally incline.</p>
          <p>Sometimes, however, it is otherwise ; e. g. an aristocracy <lb/>
            changes into a democracy, when the popular party are not <lb/>
            content with having crushed the nobles, but take the entire <lb/>
            government into their own hands.</p>
          <p>The same happens not only by internal causes, but also <lb/>
            by the operation of external causes; as through the prox­ <lb/>
            imity of a hostile state, or the plots of a powerful enemy <lb/>
            though distant.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VIII.—The causes of a state's preservation.</p>
          <p>The exact observance of the laws, and precautions against <lb/>
            innovations.</p>
          <p>The prudent conduct of the magistrates towards their <lb/>
            subjects.</p>
          <p>The vigilance and concord of the rulers.</p>
          <p>The settlement of differences by a legislator, and not by <lb/>
            chance hands.</p>
          <p>A fair and equitable census. Precaution against allow­ <lb/>
            ing any individual to grow too powerful.</p>
          <p>The creation of a magistrate to see that the citizens con­ <lb/>
            duct themselves aright towards the state.</p>
          <p>Care to keep the various parts of the state in due pro­ <lb/>
            portion.</p>
          <p>The prevention of persons from making a gain or traffic <lb/>

          <p>CHAP. IX.—The rulers in a state should be patriots, skilled <lb/>
            in their duties, and virtuous.</p>
          <p>To preserve states which are themselves deflexions, me­ <lb/>
            diocrity must be observed, e. g. Into a democracy some <lb/>
            anti-democratic principle should be infused.</p>
          <p>Danger of an unmixed oligarchy and democracy.</p>
          <p>In a democracy the demagogues should favour the power­ <lb/>
            ful ; the opposite in an oligarchy.</p>
          <p>In every state, whether oligarchic or democratic, the <pb n="lxix"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. X. XI.] </note> <lb/>
            citizens should be educated and trained in a matter suited <lb/>
            to it.</p>
          <p>CHAP. X.—Monarchy, and the causes of its destruction.</p>
          <p>Monarchies reduced to two kinds : monarchy proper, and <lb/>
            tyranny.</p>
          <p>The same causes tend to overthrow a monarchy as other <lb/>
            states ; for a monarchy follows the form of an aristocracy, <lb/>
            a tyranny that of an oligarchy.</p>
          <p>Hence tyranny is the worst of all bad forms of govern­ <lb/>
            ment.</p>
          <p>Monarchy and tyranny have a different origin; a king <lb/>
            is chosen from the good, for protection; a tyrant from the <lb/>
            commons, for oppression.</p>
          <p>A tyranny and a monarchy are different in their ends, <lb/>
            objects, and circumstances.</p>
          <p>A tyranny and an oligarchy have in common the pursuit <lb/>
            of riches.</p>
          <p>A tyranny and a democracy have in common their hatred <lb/>
            towards the chiefs and leaders of the state.</p>
          <p>The same things as those above related are the causes of <lb/>
            the overthrow and preservation of monarchies. (See above, <lb/>
            chap. ii. and iii.)</p>
          <p>To the above causes we may add <foreign xml:lang="grc">φιλοτιμία</foreign>,or ambition.</p>
          <p>The external and internal causes of the overthrow of <lb/>
            tyrannies and of monarchies are different.</p>
          <p>The causes which tend to overthrow tyrannies are the <lb/>
            same as those which subvert extreme oligarchies and demo­ <lb/>
            cracies.</p>
          <p>Monarchies are seldom destroyed by external causes, but <lb/>
            by two internal ones; viz. discord between the heirs to a <lb/>
            throne, and the assumption of illegal powers.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XI.—The means of preserving monarchies are the con <lb/>
            traries to the means of their overthrow.</p>
          <p>The first cause of preservation is due moderation.</p>
          <p>A tyranny may be preserved by great cruelty, or by <lb/>
            great indulgence.</p>
          <p>(The object of a tyranny is to corrupt its subjects, and <lb/>
            to cause them to distrust each other.)</p>
          <p>A monarchy is rule over a willing, tyranny over an un­ <lb/>
            unwilling, people.</p><pb n="lxx"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="BOOK VL"/>
          <p>A tyranny, in order to be stable, should assume, as far as <lb/>
            possible, the appearance of a monarchy.</p>
          <p>It should pretend to affability, moderation, and a regard <lb/>
            for religion and virtue.</p>
          <p>A tyrant should try to be neither exactly good nor bad, <lb/>
            but <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡμιπονηϱὺζ καὶἡμιχϱηστόζ</foreign>, half good and half wicked.</p>
          <p>CHAP. XII.—Of all forms of government, oligarchy and tyranny <lb/>
            are the least stable. Reason why such is the case.</p>
          <p>Censure of the errors of Plato concerning the changes to <lb/>
            which states are subject.</p>
          <p>First, Plato assigns as a cause the general flux in which <lb/>
            all things are, and explains the reason by his theory of <lb/>
            harmonic numbers. But numbers cannot be causes of such <lb/>
            changes.</p>
          <p>Some are by nature so bad that they cannot be made <lb/>
            good by any means.</p>
          <p>Secondly, Plato asserts that these changes take place in <lb/>
            a fixed order and method; but states do not always change <lb/>
            into the same kind of forms.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, He has laid down nothing concerning tyranny.</p>
          <p>Fourthly, He has made oligarchy not one form of govern­ <lb/>
            ment, but two.</p>
          <p>Lastly, He asserts that an oligarchy always changes into <lb/>
            a democracy.</p>

          <p>CHAP. I.—A brief repetition of what has been already laid <lb/>
            down in books IV. and V., concerning the senate, the ma­ <lb/>
            gistrates, and the judicial body, as also concerning the cor­ <lb/>

          <p>The union and fusion of the democratic and oligarchic <lb/>
            forms of government.</p>
          <p>Democracies are of various kinds-reasons why such is <lb/>
            the case.</p><pb n="lxxi"/>

          <p>CHAP. II.—Liberty the end of democracy.</p>
          <p>Two notes of liberty: first, a share of governing and be­ <lb/>
            ing governed alternately.</p>
          <p>Second, the right of living at will.</p>
          <p>Hence these two things are the concomitants of demo­ <lb/>
            cracy.</p>
          <p>The institutions of a democracy are,</p>
          <p>(1.) The election of magistrates from the whole body of <lb/>
            citizens.</p>
          <p>(2.) That all shall have power over each and each over all</p>
          <p>(3. The election of magistrates by lot.</p>
          <p>(4.) The absence of a fixed census as a qualification for <lb/>
            office.</p>
          <p>(5.) That no office be held twice, (6.) nor for a perma­ <lb/>
            nency.</p>
          <p>(7.) That all shall have the right of judging over all causes.</p>
          <p>(8.) The supremacy of the ecclesia, or popular assembly, <lb/>
            over the <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλὴ</foreign>,or senate.</p>
          <p>(9.) Pay to be given to certain magistrates.</p>
          <p>The <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλὴ</foreign>will have greater power when no pay is offered <lb/>
            to the people for their attendance in the ecclesia, or in the <lb/>
            courts of justice.</p>
          <p>CHAP. In.-The rights of the people in a democracy.</p>
          <p>Is the decision of the majority, or of the leaders, or of the <lb/>
            wealthy few, to be binding ?</p>
          <p>That which is affirmed by the majority of both rich and <lb/>
            poor should be deemed binding.</p>
          <p>One rich man's vote should be equal to that of two poor <lb/>
            men.</p>
          <p>If the votes are equal, the matter must be decided by lot, <lb/>
            or by some other way.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IV.—Of the four kinds of democracies, the earliest or <lb/>
            agricultural kind is the best.</p>
          <p>The people should have conceded to them the right of <lb/>
            electing their magistrates and of calling them to account.</p>
          <p>It is bad to exclude any section of the community from <lb/>
            office, as such a proceeding tends to foster seditions.</p>

          <p>Agrarian regulations-share of land held by each person <lb/>
            to be limited by law.</p>
          <p>Of the other kinds, that which is composed of shepherds <lb/>
            is best.</p>
          <p>Other kinds of democracies-the last and worst-the <lb/>
            reason why it is not apt to be permanent.</p>
          <p>A democracy should be strengthened by taking care that <lb/>
            the plebs out-number the rest; by an increase in the tribes; <lb/>
            by confiscating private sacred rights ; by a general fusion of <lb/>
            all ranks and classes; and by giving general licence to in­ <lb/>
            dulgence.</p>
          <p>CHAP. V.—Care to be taken hot only in appointing, but also <lb/>
            in preserving a state.</p>
          <p>The property of the citizens not to be confiscated, but to <lb/>
            be consecrated.</p>
          <p>Trials to be as few as possible-so also meetings of the <lb/>
            popular assembly.</p>
          <p>The people not to be suffered to sink too deeply into <lb/>
            poverty.</p>
          <p>Five means of preserving the people from poverty enu­ <lb/>
            merated.</p>
          <p>CHAP. VI.—As to an oligarchy, the means of preserving it are <lb/>
            to be inferred from what has been said upon the subject <lb/>
            of democracy.</p>
          <p>In the best and purest oligarchy, the highest magistracies <lb/>
            should be given to those who have the highest census, the <lb/>
            lesser to those who are poorer.</p>
          <p>It is for the interest of an oligarchy to confer some lesser <lb/>
            offices on men of slender means.</p>
          <p>In the second kind of oligarchy a higher census is to be <lb/>
            required, so that fewer persons may be in office.</p>
          <p>The third and worst kind is most tyrannical, and requires <lb/>
            the greatest attention.</p>
          <p>A large number of citizens suits a democracy, a smaller <lb/>
            number, if well ordered, suits an oligarchy.</p>

          <p>The worst kind of oligarchy will arise where the land <lb/>

          <p>The middle kind of oligarchy, where the land is suited to <lb/>

          <p>INTRODUCTORY.—THIS book contains three parts. (1.) <lb/>
            Chap. i.—iv. Prefatory-concerning the best state and the <lb/>
            best life. (2.) Chap. v.—xiii., containing certain principles <lb/>
            as to the theoretic construction of a state. (3.) Chap. xiv.— <lb/>
            xvii., in which Aristotle commences the practical considera­ <lb/>
            tion of the education, training, matrimony, etc., of the citizens <lb/>
            of the best state, which he continues throughout the next <lb/>
            book, to the end of his treatise, at least as it exists in its pre­ <lb/>
            sent state.</p>
          <p>CHAP. I.—The politician should have clear views of the best <lb/>
            life, for this and the best form of government cannot be <lb/>
            disjoined.</p>
          <p>The happiest life is that which is based on virtue; and <lb/>
            our happiness is proportioned to our virtue.</p>
          <p>That a life of virtue is best for a state, may be proved <pb n="lxxiv"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK VII."/> <lb/>
            by the same arguments which prove it to be the best for <lb/>
            individuals.</p>
          <p>External goods come in as auxiliaries (<foreign xml:lang="grc">χοϱηγία</foreign>).</p>
          <p>CHAP. II.—The chief good of the state is identical with that <lb/>
            of the individual; viz. happiness.</p>
          <p>Those therefore who regard happiness as consisting in <lb/>
            riches, make riches the end of a state; and so forth.</p>
          <p>So also with reference to virtue.</p>
          <p>Two questions proposed: first, Whether the philoso­ <lb/>
            phical or political life is superior ?</p>
          <p>Secondly, What is the best form of government ?</p>
          <p>That is to be regarded as the best government, in which <lb/>
            a man can live the best.</p>
          <p>But as to the former question, a dispute is raised.</p>
          <p>Some propose dominion over neighbours, as the end of <lb/>
            states, and estimate virtue by warlike prowess.</p>
          <p>Reasons why the latter end cannot be right, and why <lb/>
            such a state cannot be perfect or happy.</p>
          <p>War not to be regarded as an end, but as a means.</p>
          <p>The duty of a politician is to consider the true interest <lb/>
            and happiness of the citizens.</p>
          <p>CHAP. III.—Is the political or contemplative life to be pre­ <lb/>
            ferred ?</p>
          <p>Reasons for preferring the latter—" the life of a citizen <lb/>
            is servile."</p>
          <p>Reasons for entertaining the contrary opinion—" the <lb/>
            contemplative life is indolent, and works no good."</p>
          <p>Aristotle answers that not all obedience to government <lb/>
            is servile.</p>
          <p>Reasons for preferring upon the whole the political and <lb/>
            practical life.</p>
          <p>Mistake of politicians as to the practical life.</p>
          <p>There are higher kinds of actions even than the carrying <lb/>
            out of the details of government.</p>
          <p>. Philosophers, in consulting and advising, follow this <lb/>
            higher line of action.</p>
          <p>Character of the actions of God.</p>
          <p>CHAP. IV.—The best and most perfect form of government <lb/>

          <p>The real power of the citizens not to be reckoned by <lb/>
            their mere numbers; the best city will be the greatest.</p>
          <p>Slaves, and low mechanics, etc., are not parts of the state <lb/>
            in reality.</p>
          <p>Too large a population not to be regarded as a sign of <lb/>
            strength: it is not easily managed by the law.</p>
          <p>States, like every thing besides, should have a certain <lb/>
            definite size-the best size is one such as can be controlled <lb/>
            by the laws, while it makes the state independent, and en­ <lb/>

          <p>A lofty acropolis suits a monarchy or oligarchy; a level <lb/>

          </head>
          <p>PREFATORY REMARKs.-Like "Politics," it is to be ob <lb/>
            served that the term " Economics," in the language of ancient <lb/>
            Greek philosophy, had a much wider signification than it now <lb/>
            bears with us. It is almost superfluous to remark that, in the <lb/>
            language of Aristotle, it signifies the science or art (for it is <lb/>
            both) of managing and providing for the well-being of a fa­ <lb/>
            mily, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">οἰ̃κοζ</foreign>,) the first natural combination to which man's <lb/>
            social nature disposes him. See Politics, Book I. chaps, i. ii. <lb/>
            viii. and xiii. If the Politics of Aristotle have come down to us <lb/>
            in an imperfect state, much more is this the case with his Eco­ <lb/>
            nomics, which only just introduce the subject of domestic rule. <lb/>
            The relation in which the Economics stand to the whole sys­ <lb/>
            tem of Aristotle's moral philosophy, as holding a middle post <lb/>
            between his Ethics and Politics, has been already sufficiently <lb/>
            touched upon in the introductory note, prefixed above, to the <lb/>
            first book of the Politics (page xvii.). It only remains for the <lb/>
            editor to add, that while some critics have gone so far as to <lb/>
            doubt the genuineness of the first book of the Economics, a <lb/>
            much greater suspicion, in the opinion of all, hangs over the <lb/>
            second book ; and that it existed for many ages only in a Latin <lb/>
            version, from which it was translated back again into Greek <lb/>
            by Aretinus or Tusanus. Sylburgius regards the whole of <lb/>
            the second book as spurious, and in fact believes the chap­ <lb/>
            ters of which it consists to have been "supposita ab Aretino, <lb/>
            non con versa." However, he follows Camerarius in admitting <lb/>
            what is generally known as the first chapter, as standing on a <lb/>
            somewhat different footing from the rest, and accordingly he <lb/>
            prints it as belonging to Book I. It should be observed, how­ <lb/>
            ever, that Plutarch, in his Life of Aristotle, expressly attributes <lb/>
            to Aristotle two books on the subject of the economic art. <lb/>
            We have, therefore, given the whole of the so-called second <lb/>
            book in this edition ; the translation of it is entirely original, <note type="margin"> <pb n="lxxx"/>

          </ab>
          <p>POLITICS, or the political science, (as has been observed in the Ana. <lb/>
            lytical Introduction to the Ethics,) was understood by Aristotle, and <lb/>
            indeed by all the ancient philosophers, not in the narrow and restricted <lb/>
            sense to which modem ideas have confined it, but as a science investi­ <lb/>
            gating the subject of human good and the nature of man, not merely as an <lb/>
            individual, but as a member of the family and of the state. Hence it <lb/>
            naturally divides itself into three corresponding parts; Ethics, which <lb/>
            treat of man's nature and good, apart from the social relations; and <lb/>
            Economics and Politics, which view him under the social relations <lb/>
            of the family (<foreign xml:lang="grc">οἰ̃κοζ</foreign>) and the state (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πόλιζ</foreign>) respectively. Occasionally, <lb/>
            however, the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολιτική</foreign> is used in a wider, as well as in its nar­ <lb/>
            rower, sense, both as embracing the two other branches, and as ex­ <lb/>
            clusive of them. In the last chapter, of the Nicomachean Ethics, <lb/>
            where Arist. speaks of education, and shows that it is the duty of every <lb/>
            state to educate its members, and that the study of legislation is necessary <lb/>
            in order to qualify persons to undertake the education of others, he <lb/>
            expresses his intention to write at length upon the subject of poli­ <lb/>
            tics ; and in the last words of the chapter, he even goes so far as to sketch <lb/>
            out the three divisions of the present treatise, thus: " Since ... all <lb/>
            former authors have passed over without examination the subject of legis­ <lb/>
            lation, it would be better perhaps for us to examine it ourselves, and, in <lb/>
            short, the whole subject of politics, in order that the philosophy of human <lb/>
            nature may, as far as in our power, be completed ...... Let us then <lb/>
            make a commencement." (Eth. x. ch. 9.) The present treatise is that <lb/>
            to which he here refers; and it is divisible into three general parts, <lb/>
            (1.) B. i. and ii. (2.) B. iii.—vi. (3.) B. vii. and viii.</p>
          <p>The following table of the division of Philosophy in general, according <lb/>
            to the Stoic and the Peripatetic schools respectively, will be useful. It may <lb/>
            be observed in passing that Cicero mainly follows the former of these di­ <lb/>
            visions, Aristotle the latter. <figure type="illustration">

          <p>As we see that every state is a society, and <lb/>
            that every society is established for the sake of <lb/>
            some good end ;1 (for an apparent good is the <lb/>

            that the principles of a political, a regal, a domes­ <lb/>
            tic, and a despotic government are the same; in­ <lb/>
            asmuch as they suppose that each of these differ merely in <lb/>
            point of number, and not in kind: so that with them a <lb/>
            despotic government is one composed of a very few, a domes­ <lb/>
            tic of more, a civil and a regal of still more, as if there were <lb/>
            no difference between a large family and a small city; and <lb/>
            they hold that a regal and political government are the same <lb/>

            of the social state; that is, of man in his various natural relations to his <lb/>
            fellow men. Compare Eth. i. 1, " Every art and every scientific system, <lb/>
            and in like manner every course of action and deliberate preference, <lb/>
            seems to aim at some good; and, consequently, ‘ The Good' has been <lb/>

            taken in its most extensive signification; utility, in the strict sense, con­ <lb/>
            stituting but one branch, and that the lowest, of " the good." See Ethics, <lb/>
            i. and x. passim. Plato uses the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὠφέλον</foreign> nearly in the same <lb/>
            sense. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάλλισταγὰρ δὴτου̃τοκαὶλέγεται καὶ λελέξεται,ὃτιτὸ μὲνι­ <lb/>

            phical analysis of the real nature of a state, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πόλις</foreign>,or <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολιτεία</foreign>,) it may <lb/>
            be well to insert here a few words upon the subject, for the benefit of the <lb/>
            English reader. " If we would picture to ourselves the true notion <lb/>
            which the Greeks embodied in the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόλις</foreign>, we must lay aside all <lb/>
            modem ideas respecting the nature and object of a state With us, prac­ <lb/>
            tically, if not in theory, the essential object of a state hardly embraces <lb/>
            more than the protection of life and property. The Greeks, on the other <lb/>
            hand, had the most vivid conception of the state as a whole, or system, <lb/>
            every part of which was to co-operate towards some great end to which <lb/>
            all other duties were considered as subordinate. Thus the aim of demo­ <lb/>
            cracy was said to be liberty: wealth, of oligarchy; and education, of <lb/>
            aristocracy. In all governments, the endeavour was to draw the social <lb/>
            union as close as possible; and it seems to have been with this view that <lb/>
            Aristotle laid down a principle which answered well enough to the acci­ <lb/>
            dental circumstances of the Grecian states, that a <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόλις</foreign> must be of a <lb/>
            certain size. (See below, book vii. 4, and compare Eth. Nic. ix. 10.) This <lb/>
            unity of purpose, marked as it was in all the states of Greece, was no <lb/>
            where so fully carried out as at Sparta." Accordingly, we cannot be <lb/>
            surprised to find that in discussing the nature of a <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόλις</foreign>, Aristotle begins <lb/>
            with the question, " What constitutes a citizen ? It (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πολίτης</foreign>). " He de­ <lb/>
            fines a citizen to be one who is a partner in the legislative and judicial <lb/>
            functions of the state. No definition, of course, will apply equally to ail <lb/>
            the different states of Greece, or to any single state at different times; <lb/>
            but the above seems to comprehend, more or less, properly all those whom <lb/>

            man and wife, <lb/>
            (2.) master and <lb/>
            slave.</p>
          <p>Now if any one would watch the parts of a state <lb/>
            from the very first as they rise into existence, as <lb/>
            in other matters, so here he would gain the truest <lb/>
            view of the subject.1 In the first place, then, it <lb/>
            is requisite that those should be joined together, <lb/>
            which cannot exist without each other, as the <lb/>
            male and the female, for the business of propagation; and <lb/>
            this not through deliberate choice, but by that natural impulse <lb/>
            which acts both in plants and in animals, namely, the desire <lb/>
            of leaving behind them others like themselves. By nature <lb/>
            too some beings command, and others obey, for the sake of <lb/>
            mutual safety; for a being endowed with discernment and <lb/>
            forethought is by nature the superior and governor; whereas <lb/>
            he who is merely able to execute by bodily labour, is the in­ <lb/>
            ferior and a natural slave ; and hence the interest of master <note type="footnote"> ship to have consisted in the share possessed by every citizen in the legis­ <lb/>
            lature, in the election of magistrates, in the <foreign xml:lang="grc">δοκιμασία</foreign>, and in the courts <lb/>
            of justice." (See Dictionary of Gr. and Rom. Antiq., article Civitas, pp. <lb/>
            234—236.) For further information on this subject, the reader is referred <lb/>
            to the Analysis of the 8th book of Aristotle's Ethics prefixed to the trans­ <lb/>
            lation of that work by Prof. R. W. Browne. (Bohn's Classical Library.) </note><note type="footnote"> 1 There are upon the whole two views held concerning the origin of <lb/>
            society:- <lb/>
            1. That it arose by compact. (Hobbes.) <lb/>
            2. That it arose by nature. (Aristotle.) <lb/>
            In support of the theory of Aristotle, it is observed by Wachsmuth, <lb/>
            that " to assume an agreement with a view to political society, before the <lb/>
            commencement and trial of the same, is nearly tantamount to the propo­ <lb/>
            sition of Lord Monboddo, which affirms that language was the result of <lb/>
            an agreement entered into for the purpose of calling it into existence." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Compare Ethics, b. viii. ch. 12. " Between husband and wife, friend­ <lb/>
            ship is thought to exist by nature; for man is by nature a being inclined <lb/>
            to live in pairs rather than in societies, inasmuch as a family is prior in <lb/>
            point of time and more necessary than a state, and procreation is more <lb/>
            common to him, together with animals. To other animals, therefore, <lb/>
            community proceeds thus far only; but human beings associate, not only <lb/>
            for the sake of procreation, but for the affairs of life." Compare also <lb/>
            Cicero de Off. b. i. ch. 17. Nam quum sit hoc nature commune animan­ <lb/>
            tium, ut habeant libidinem procreandi, prima societas in ipso conjugio est, <lb/>
            proxima in liberis; deinde una domus, communia omnia." The whole <lb/>
            chapter is useful, as proving that Aristotle believed in the progressive <lb/>
            expansion of human sympathies. </note> <pb n="5"/>

            and slave is identical. But there is a natural difference be­ <lb/>
            tween the female and the slave; for nature does nothing <lb/>
            meanly, like artists who make the Delphic swords; but she <lb/>
            has one instrument for one end; for thus her instruments are <lb/>
            most likely to be brought to perfection, being made to con­ <lb/>
            tribute to one end, and not to many. Yet, among Barbarians, <lb/>
            the female and the slave are upon a level in the community; <lb/>
            the reason for which is, that they are not fitted by nature to <lb/>
            rule; and so their relationship becomes merely that between <lb/>
            slaves of different sexes. For which reason the poets say, <lb/>
            " Tis meet that barbarous tribes to Greeks should bow." <lb/>
            as if a barbarian and a slave were by nature one <lb/>
            and the same. Now of these two societies the <lb/>
            domestic tie is the first, and Hesiod 1 is right when <lb/>
            he says, <lb/>
            From these re <lb/>
            lations arises <lb/>
            first the family <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">οἰ̃κος</foreign>), then the <lb/>
            village (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κώμη</foreign>), <lb/>
            and lastly the <lb/>
            state (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πόλις</foreign>). <lb/>
            " First house, then wife, then oxen for the plough; " <lb/>
            for the ox is to the poor man in the place of a household <lb/>
            slave. That society, then, which nature has estab­ <lb/>
            lished for daily support, is a family (<foreign xml:lang="grc">οἰ̃κος</foreign>), and <lb/>
            those who compose it are called by, Charon das <lb/>

            ‘<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ομοσίπυοι</foreign>,2 and by Epimenides the Cretan ‘<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ομόκαπνοι</foreign>. But <lb/>
            the society of many families, which was instituted for lasting <lb/>
            and mutual advantage, is called a village (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κώμη</foreign>), <lb/>
            and a village is most naturally composed of the <lb/>

            hence, by the way, states were originally governed by kings,4 <lb/>

            general opinion which makes the gods themselves subject to <lb/>

            villages join themselves perfectly together into <lb/>
            one society, that society is a state, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πόλις</foreign>,) and <lb/>
            contains in itself, if I may so speak, the perfection of inde­ <lb/>
            pendence; and it is first founded that men may live, but <lb/>
            continued that they may live happily.2 For which reason every- <lb/>
            state is the work of nature,3 since the first social ties are such ; <lb/>
            for to this they all tend as to an end, and the nature of a <lb/>
            thing is judged by its tendency. For what every being is in, <lb/>
            its perfect state, that certainly is the nature of that being, <lb/>
            whether it be a man, a horse, or a house ; besides, its own final <lb/>
            cause and its end must be the perfection of any thing; but a <lb/>
            government complete in itself constitutes a final cause and <lb/>
            Man by nature <lb/>
            social (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πολπι­ <lb/>

            this fact. <lb/>
            what is best. Hence it is evident, that a state is <lb/>
            one of the works of nature, and that man is na­ <lb/>
            turally a political animal, and that whosoever is <lb/>
            naturally, and not accidentally, unfit for society, <lb/>
            must be either inferior or superior to man ; just as the person <lb/>

              For he whose nature is such as this, must needs be a lover of <lb/>
              strife, and as solitary as a bird of prey.1 It is clear, then, <lb/>
              that man is truly a more social animal than bees, or any <lb/>
              of the herding cattle ; for nature, as we say, does nothing <lb/>
              in vain, and man is the only animal who has reason. Speech <lb/>
              undeed, as being the token of pleasure and pain, is imparted <lb/>
              o other beings also, and thus far their nature extends; they <lb/>
              can perceive pleasure and pain, and can impart these sensa­ <lb/>
              tions to others; but speech is given to us to express what is, <lb/>
              useful or hurtful to us, and also what is just and unjust; for <lb/>
              in this particular man differs from other animals, that he alone <lb/>
              has a perception of good and evil, of justice and injustice, and <lb/>
              it is the interchange of these common sentiments which forms <lb/>
              a family and a city. And further, in the order <lb/>
              of nature, the state is prior to the family or the <lb/>
              individual; for the whole must necessarily be prior <lb/>
              to the parts ; for if you take away the whole body, <lb/>
              you cannot say a foot or a hand remains, unless <lb/>
              The <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολις</foreign> prior <lb/>

              latter to the <lb/>
              individual. <lb/>
              by equivocation, as if any one should call a hand made of <lb/>
              stone, a hand; for such only can it have when mutilated. <lb/>
              But every thing is defined according to its effects and inherent <lb/>
              powers, so that when these no longer remain such as they <lb/>
              were, it cannot be said to be the same, but something of the <lb/>
              same name. It is plain, then, that the state is prior to the in­ <lb/>
              dividual,2 for if an individual is not complete in himself, he <lb/>
              bears the same relation to the state as other parts do to a <lb/>
              whole; but he that is incapable of society, or so <lb/>
              complete in himself as not to want it, makes no part <lb/>
              of a state, but is either a beast or a god. There is <lb/>
              No condition <lb/>

              up of families, and every family has again its separate parts <lb/>
              of which it is composed; and when a family is complete, it <lb/>
              consists of freemen and slaves. But as in every <lb/>
              subject we should first begin with examining into <lb/>
              its component parts, and as the first and smallest <lb/>
              parts of a family, are the master and slave, the <lb/>
              husband and wife, the father and child, let us first <lb/>
              Three relations <lb/>
              necessary in it, <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεσποτική, γα­ <lb/>
              μική</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τεκ­ <lb/>
              νοποιητική·</foreign> <lb/>
              inquire into these three relations, what each of them are, and <lb/>
              what they ought to be ; that is to say, the despotical, the <lb/>
              conjugal, and thirdly the paternal ; though these two latter <lb/>
              relations have no peculiar established name. Let these then <lb/>
              be considered as the three distinct parts of a family. Now <lb/>
              there is a duty which, some identify with the government of a <lb/>
              family, while others regard it as constituting its most import­ <lb/>
              ant part; I mean that of providing for its maintenance. Now <lb/>
              we must inquire philosophically how the matter stands. But <lb/>
              let us first speak of the master and the slave, that <lb/>
              we may both understand what things are abso­ <lb/>
              lutely necessary, and also try if we can get to learn <lb/>
              The relation of <lb/>
              master and <lb/>
              slave. <lb/>
              any thing better on this subject than what is already laid <lb/>
              down. Some persons have thought that the power <lb/>
              of the master over his slave is a certain science, <lb/>
              and that the government of a family and a slave, <lb/>
              political and regal government, are all the same <lb/>
              Some say that <lb/>
              slaves are such <lb/>

              things, just as we said at the beginning ; but others think that <lb/>
              despotic government is contrary to nature, and that it is cus­ <lb/>
              tom only which makes one man a slave and another free, but <lb/>
              that in nature there is no difference between them; for which <lb/>

          <p>SINCE then a subsistence is implied in every family, the means <lb/>
            of procuring it certainly makes up part of the management of <lb/>
            a family, for without necessaries it is impossible to live, and to <lb/>
            live well. And as in all arts which have a definite <lb/>

            ments if they would perfect their works, so is it <lb/>
            in the art of managing a family. Now of instru­ <lb/>
            ments some are alive, others inanimate ; thus with <lb/>
            respect to the pilot of a ship, the tiller is without life, the <lb/>
            sailor is a live instrument ; and so too a servant is as an in­ <lb/>
            strument in many arts. Thus property is as an instrument to <lb/>
            living; and an estate is a multitude of instruments ; so a <lb/>
            slave is a living instrument, and every servant is an instru­ <lb/>
            ment more valuable than any other instrument. For if every <lb/>
            instrument, at command, or from foreknowledge of its mas­ <lb/>
            ter's will, could accomplish its special work, (as the story goes <lb/>
            of the statues of Daedalus,1 or what the poet tells us of the <lb/>
            tripods of Vulcan, how <lb/>
            " Self-taught they moved into the godlike course; ") 2 <lb/>
            if the shuttle thus would weave, and the lyre play of itself; <lb/>
            then neither would the architect want servants, nor the master <lb/>
            slaves. Now what are generally called instruments, are the <lb/>
            efficients of something else, but possessions are what we <lb/>
            simply use : thus with a shuttle we make something else over <lb/>
            and above its mere use ; but we only use a cloak, or a bed: <lb/>
            since then making and using differ from each other in kind, <lb/>
            and they each require their own instruments, the latter also <lb/>
            must be different from each other. Now life is a thing which <lb/>
            we use, and not an efficient of something else ; and hence the <lb/>
            slave is a minister in matters of daily use. But a possession <lb/>
            The slave is <lb/>
            merely a part <lb/>
            of the master. <lb/>
            may be considered as a part of any thing ; now a <lb/>
            part is not only a part, but also wholly the pro­ <lb/>
            perty, of something else ; and the same is true of <lb/>
            a possession; therefore, while a master is only a master of <lb/>
            the slave, but no part of him, the slave is not only the slave <lb/>
            of the master, but also wholly his property. This fully ex­ <lb/>
            plains what is the nature of a slave, and what is his capacity; <lb/>
            for that being, who by nature is not his own, but totally an­ <lb/>
            other's, and yet is a man, is a slave by nature; and that man is <lb/>
            the property of another, who is his mere chattel, though he is <lb/>
            still a man; but a chattel is an instrument for use, separate <lb/>
            from the body.3 <note type="footnote"> I Mentioned by Plato: see Menexenus, ch. 39. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Homer, Iliad xviii. 376. </note><note type="footnote"> * Compare the definition of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">φύσει δου̃ς</foreign> given below, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ δυνάμενος</foreign> </note></p><pb n="11"/>

          <p>BUT whether any person of such a nature exists, <lb/>
            and whether it is right and just for any one to be <lb/>
            a slave or no,l or whether all slavery is contrary <lb/>
            to nature, must be considered hereafter. Not <lb/>
            that it is difficult to take a philosophic view of the <lb/>
            matter, or to infer it from matters of fact; for that <lb/>
            some should govern and others be governed, is not <lb/>
            only necessary but useful; and from the hour of <lb/>
            their birth, some are marked out for the purpose <lb/>
            of obeying, and others for ruling. There are, <lb/>
            moreover, many species of both the governing <lb/>

            Slavery sup­ <lb/>
            ported by ana­ <lb/>
            logies drawn <lb/>
            from the rela­ <lb/>
            tion of the body <lb/>
            to the soul, of <lb/>
            the animal <lb/>
            creation to <lb/>
            man, and of the <lb/>
            female to the <lb/>
            male. <lb/>
            and the governed. And the better those are who are go­ <lb/>
            verned, the better also is the government, as for instance that <lb/>
            of man, rather than of a brute : for the more excellent the <lb/>
            materials are with which the work is finished, the more ex­ <lb/>
            cellent is the work; and wherever there is a governor and a <lb/>
            governed, there certainly is some work produced. For what­ <lb/>
            soever is composed of many parts, which together make up one <lb/>
            whole, whether united or separate, evidently shows the marks <lb/>
            of some one thing governing and another thing governed; and <lb/>
            this is true of every living thing in all nature ; nay, even in <lb/>
            some things which partake not of life there is a principle of <lb/>
            subjection, as in music ;2 but this matter probably belongs to <note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">α̃λλου εἶναι</foreign>. The whole train of reasoning adopted in this chapter, may <lb/>
            serve to recall to the reader's mind a similar argument of Butler in his <lb/>
            Analogy, part i. ch. 1, which, however, he uses for a very different pur­ <lb/>
            pose; namely, to show that our limbs are mere instruments and organs, <lb/>
            and not essential parts of our actual selves. </note><note type="footnote"> I The sum is this, according to our author: " Slavery appears to me <lb/>
            both necessary and expedient, as is shown by the existence of a ruling <lb/>
            and a ruled principle, pervading all the orders of nature, and extending <lb/>
            even to things inanimate. We may see a like analogy in the mind and <lb/>
            body, and in the despotic rule exercised by the former over the latter. <lb/>
            We see how wild animals are subjected by the tame; we see the female <lb/>
            subject to the male; we see the well-born from their birth adapted to <lb/>
            social life, and fit for the service of war; while the base-born are fitted <lb/>
            only for the humble services which their bodies can render to a master. <lb/>
            And all these analogies point to one single conclusion, viz. that slavery in <lb/>
            some cases, is in conformity with nature." With what limitations this is <lb/>
            to be understood, will be seen in a later chapter of this book. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 In every chord of music there is what is technically called the <lb/>

            a disquisition somewhat foreign to our purpose. Every living <lb/>
            thing, in the first place, is composed of soul and body, and of <lb/>
            these the one is by nature the governor, the other the go­ <lb/>
            verned ; now we must learn what is natural, by those things <lb/>
            which are in accordance with nature, and not by those which <lb/>
            are corrupted ;l we should therefore examine into a man who <lb/>
            Men born with <lb/>
            different quali­ <lb/>
            ties of body as <lb/>
            well as of soul. <lb/>
            is most perfectly formed both in soul and body ; <lb/>
            for in him this fact is evident; while in the <lb/>
            depraved and vicious, the body would seem to rule <lb/>
            rather than the soul, on account of their being <lb/>
            corrupt and contrary to nature. Even in an animal, then, as <lb/>
            we affirm, it is possible to discern the despotic and political <lb/>
            government; for the soul governs the body as the master his <lb/>
            slave ;2 but the mind governs the appetite, with a political or <lb/>
            kingly power; which shows that it is both natural and advan­ <lb/>
            tageous that the body should be governed by the soul, and <lb/>
            the seat of the passions by the mind and that part which is <lb/>
            possessed of reason ; but equality of rule, or power inverted, <lb/>
            is hurtful to all. And this holds true not only of man, but of <lb/>
            other animals also ; for tame animals are naturally better than <lb/>
            wild ones, and yet it is advantageous to all these that they <lb/>
            should be subject to man ; for thus they insure their own <lb/>
            safety. So too is it naturally with the male and the female; <lb/>
            the one is superior, the other inferior; the one governs, the <lb/>
            other is governed; and the same rule must necessarily hold <lb/>
            good with respect to all mankind. Whoever, therefore, are <lb/>
            as much inferior to their fellows as the body is to the soul, or <lb/>
            the brutes to men,— (and this is in reality the case with all <lb/>

            who, as it were, have reached their full growth, for in their case only <lb/>

              lence consists in this part,)—these, I say, are slaves by na­ <lb/>
              ture, and it is advantageous to them to be always under this <lb/>
              kind of government, inasmuch as it is advantageous to those <lb/>
              above-mentioned. He then is by nature formed a slave, who <lb/>
              is fitted to become the chattel of another person, and on that <lb/>
              account is so, and who has just reason enough to perceive <lb/>
              that there is such a faculty (as reason), without being indued <lb/>
              with the use of it. For other animals have no perception of <lb/>
              reason, but obey their passions ; and indeed they vary very <lb/>
              little in their use from each other. For the advantage which <lb/>
              we receive, both from slaves and tame animals, arises from <lb/>
              their administering to our bodily necessities. Now it is the <lb/>
              intention of nature to make the bodies of slaves and freemen <lb/>
              different from each other, that the one should be robust for <lb/>
              their necessary purposes, but the others erect; useless indeed <lb/>
              for such servile labours, but fit for civil life, which is divided <lb/>
              into the duties of war and peace ;1 though the contrary often <lb/>
              takes place, namely, that the one have the bodies, but the others <lb/>
              have the souls, of free citizens. For this at all events is evi­ <lb/>
              dent, that if they excelled others as, much as the statues of the <lb/>
              gods excel the human form, every one would allow that the <lb/>
              inferiors ought to be slaves to the others. And since this is <lb/>
              true with respect to the body, it is still more just to determine <lb/>
              in the same manner, when we consider the soul; though it is <lb/>
              not so easy to perceive the beauty of the soul as it is of the <lb/>
              body. It is clear then that some men are free by nature, and <lb/>
              others are slaves, and that in the case of the latter the lot of <lb/>
              slavery is both advantageous and just.2 <note type="footnote"> 1 Some persons, and among others the learned Schneider, have doubted <lb/>
              the genuineness of this line ; probably because they did not see its true <lb/>
              meaning. This would seem to be as follows: " As nature has made us <lb/>
              of two distinct forms, the free-born and the slave-born, and has given us <lb/>
              two distinct parts, namely, our soul and our body, so are the duties of a <lb/>
              free citizen two-fold,-the duties of war and those of peace,-the one as <lb/>
              superior to the other as the soul to the body, or the freeman to the slave. <lb/>

            and a slave have each two different senses; for <lb/>

            would an orator, and say that it would be hard that whoever <lb/>
            is compelled by violence should become the slave and subject <lb/>

            opinion on this <lb/>
            point. <lb/>
            perior in strength ; and even of those who are <lb/>
            wise, some think one way and some another on <lb/>
            this subject; but the source of this doubt, and that <lb/>
            which makes this conflict of opinions, is the fact that ability <lb/>
            when accompanied with proper means, in a certain way, is <lb/>
            able to commit the greatest violence; for victory is always <lb/>
            owing to some superior advantage; so that it seems that <lb/>
            violence does not prevail without ability; and so the dispute <lb/>
            is only concerning what is just. For on this account some <lb/>
            persons think that justice consists in benevolence, while others <lb/>
            think it just that the superior should govern, since in the <lb/>
            midst of these contrary opinions, the opposite argument has <lb/>
            nothing weighty enough to persuade us that the superior on <lb/>
            the score of ability ought not to rule and to govern. 1 But <note type="footnote"> I consider <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατὰ νόμον</foreign> as equivalent to <foreign xml:lang="grc">παϱα φύσιν</foreign>, and can only say that <lb/>
            their interests can never be identified, and that the system of making a <lb/>
            freeman into a slave is unnatural, and a perversion of that which, if well <lb/>
            directed, would work well-a good system of slavery for those whom na­ <lb/>

            this is not practically true. It ought to be remarked here, that by the <lb/>

            nevertheless, some persons, clinging, as they think, to a cer­ <lb/>
            tain plea of right, (for custom is a kind of right,) insist that <lb/>
            slavery in war is just, but at the same time they contradict <lb/>
            themselves. 1 For it may happen that the principle upon which <lb/>
            the wars were commenced is unjust; and no one will say <lb/>
            that the man who is undeservedly enslaved, is therefore a <lb/>
            slave; for if so, men of the noblest families might happen to <lb/>
            be slaves and the descendants of slaves, if they chance to be <lb/>
            taken prisoners in war, and sold. And on this account they <lb/>
            do not choose to give the name of slave to such <lb/>
            persons, but only to barbarians. But when they <lb/>
            say this, they do nothing more than inquire who <lb/>
            is a slave by nature, as we said at the first; for <lb/>
            we must acknowledge that some persons, wherever <lb/>
            they may be, are of necessity slaves, but that <lb/>
            Those who say <lb/>
            it is unjust to <lb/>
            make slaves in <lb/>
            war, really im­ <lb/>
            ply that some <lb/>
            are <foreign xml:lang="grc">φύσει, <lb/>
            δου̃λοι</foreign>. <lb/>
            others can in no case be slaves. Thus also it is with those <lb/>
            of noble descent; it is not only in their own country, but <lb/>
            every where, that men esteem them as such, while barbarians <lb/>
            are respected on this account at home only; as if nobility and <lb/>
            freedom were of two sorts, the one universal, the other not <lb/>
            so. Thus says the Helen of Theodectes; <lb/>
            " Who dares reproach me with the name of slave ? <lb/>
            When from immortal gods, on either side, <lb/>
            I draw my lineage." <lb/>
            Those who express these sentiments show that <lb/>
            they distinguish the slave and the freeman, the <lb/>
            noble and the ignoble, from each other by no test <lb/>
            And daily <lb/>
            speech implies <lb/>
            the same. <lb/>
            save that of their virtues and their vices; for they think it <lb/>
            reasonable, that as a man begets a man, and a beast a beast, <lb/>
            so from a good man, a good man should be descended; and <note type="footnote"> I The whole passage may be paraphrased thus: " Those are not <lb/>
            wrong in their judgment who hold that a captive taken in war is law­ <lb/>
            fully a slave. Some however impugn this doctrine. Now this dif­ <lb/>
            ference of opinion all arises from the fact that they are not agreed as <lb/>
            to what justice is. For the one party think that is just, which man's <lb/>
            innate good-will or benevolence prompts him to do:; others think that the <lb/>
            law of might is the law of right. Now those who deny that conquest <lb/>
            gives a man no right over another, have no arguments to support their <lb/>
            opinion; the others follow justice in some sense, for they adhere to the <lb/>
            law, and the law is a kind of justice.”—”<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αμα δ</foreign>’ ov <foreign xml:lang="grc">φασι</foreign>, " and at the same <lb/>

            this is what nature desires to bring about, but oftentimes can- <lb/>
            Some then are <lb/>
            born slaves, <lb/>

            Is a perversion <lb/>
            of nature. <lb/>
            not accomplish it. It is evident then that this <lb/>
            doubt has no reason in it,1 and that some persons <lb/>
            are slaves and others freemen by the appoint­ <lb/>
            ment of nature; and also that in some instances <lb/>
            there are two distinct classes, for the one of whom <lb/>
            it is expedient to be a slave, and for the other to <lb/>
            be a master; and that it is right and just that <lb/>
            some should be governed, and that others should <lb/>
            exercise that government for which they are fitted by nature ; <lb/>
            and if so, then the rule of master over slave (is just also). <lb/>
            But to govern ill is disadvantageous to both; for the same <lb/>
            thing is useful to the part and to the whole, to the body and <lb/>
            to the soul; but the slave is as it were a part of the master, <lb/>
            as though he were an animated part of his body, though se­ <lb/>
            parate. For which reason a mutual utility and friendship <lb/>
            may subsist between the master and the slave, I mean when they <lb/>
            are placed by nature in that relation to each other; for the <lb/>
            contrary is the case with those who are reduced to slavery by <lb/>
            custom, or by conquest.</p>

          <p>IT is evident from what has been said, that a despotic and a <lb/>

            seem to be also one sort of knowledge proper for <lb/>

            knowledge of the master, on the other hand, is the <lb/>
            proper use of his slaves, for the office of a master <lb/>

            and apply themselves either to public affairs or philosophy. <lb/>

            either of the above; and this, in order to be just, must be <lb/>

            the acquisition of money, according to the manner we have <lb/>

            question whether the getting of money is the same <lb/>
            thing as economics,2 or whether it is a part of it, <lb/>

              it? <lb/>
              or something subservient to it; and if so, whether <lb/>
              it is as the art of making shuttles is to the art of <lb/>
              weaving, or as the art of making brass to that of statue- <lb/>

              the one supplies the tools, the other the matter; and by the <lb/>
              matter I mean, that out of which the work is finished ; as, for <lb/>

              tuary. It is evident then that the getting of money <lb/>
              is not the same thing as economy,, for the business <lb/>
              of the one is to furnish the means, theother <lb/>
              to use them. For what art is there but economics, to make use <lb/>

              ordinate. <lb/>
              of what is in the house ? Still there is a doubt, <lb/>
              whether this is a part of economics, or something of <lb/>
              a different kind; for if it is the business of him who <lb/>
              is to get money, to find out how riches and pos­ <lb/>
              sessions may be procured, and if possessions and <lb/>
              wealth embrace various parts, we must first1 ascertain whe­ <lb/>
              ther the art of husbandry is a part of money-getting, or some­ <lb/>
              thing different, and whether [the same is not true of] the <lb/>
              care and acquisition of provisions in general. But as there <lb/>
              The different <lb/>
              lives of men. <lb/>
              are many sorts of provision, so is there a variety <lb/>
              in the lives both of men and of the brute crea­ <lb/>
              tion : and as it is impossible to live without food, <lb/>
              the difference in that particular makes the lives of animals so <lb/>
              different from each other. Nbw of beasts, some live in herds, <lb/>
              others separate, as is most convenient for procuring them­ <lb/>
              selves food ; as some of them live upon flesh, others on fruit, <lb/>
              and others on whatsoever they light on, for nature has dis­ <lb/>
              tinguished their course of life, so that they can with ease <lb/>
              make choice of such things. And as the same things are not <lb/>
              agreeable to all, but one animal likes one thing and another <lb/>
              another, the lives of carnivorous beasts must be different from <lb/>
              the lives of those who live on fruits; and in like manner is it <lb/>
              with men; for their lives differ greatly from each other. <lb/>
              Now of these, the idlest is the nomad life ; for their food <lb/>
              comes from the flesh of tame animals, without any trouble, <lb/>
              while they sit at ease; and as their cattle of necessity keep <lb/>
              changing their place on account of pasture, they too are compel­ <lb/>
              led to follow with them, cultivating, as it were, a living farm. <note type="footnote"> 1 The word wore, in the text of Bekker and others, is plainly corrupt <lb/>

              Other men live by the chase, some hunting this thing, and <lb/>
              others that; some by freebooting, and some by fishing ; as for <lb/>
              example, those who live near lakes and marshes, and rivers, <lb/>
              or the sea itself ;1 while others are fowlers, or hunters of <lb/>
              wild beasts. But the greater part of mankind live upon the <lb/>
              produce of the earth, and its cultivated fruits. Such, for the <lb/>
              most part, are the lives of those who labour for their own <lb/>
              subsistence, and without procuring their provision by way of <lb/>
              exchange or merchandise; such are shepherds, husbandmen, <lb/>
              freebooters, fishermen, and hunters: some join different em­ <lb/>
              ployments together, and thus live very agreeably, supplying <lb/>
              those deficiencies which are wanting to make their mode of <lb/>
              life independent. Thus, for instance, some persons will join <lb/>
              together the life of a nomad and a freebooter, or of a hus­ <lb/>
              bandman and a hunter; and so with respect to the rest, they <lb/>
              pursue that mode of life to which necessity conspires to com­ <lb/>
              pel them. Now such a power of providing food seems <lb/>
              to be taught to all animals by Nature herself, as well <lb/>
              immediately upon their first birth, as also when they are <lb/>
              arrived at maturity. For with respect to the first of these <lb/>
              periods, some of them, together with their young, produce <lb/>
              nourishment which is sufficient until their new-born offspring <lb/>
              can get food for itself; as is the case with those which are <lb/>
              vermiparous and oviparous ; and as to those which bring <lb/>
              forth their young alive, they have within themselves the <lb/>
              means for their subsistence for a certain time, namely, milk. <lb/>
              It is evident then that we may conclude that plants are <lb/>
              created for the sake of animals, and all other animals for the <lb/>
              sake of man ; the tame for our use and provision ; the wild, <lb/>

            other, that this is one and the same with the art <lb/>
            just mentioned; but it is not the same as that, <lb/>
            and a second­ <lb/>
            ary use. <lb/>
            though not very different; for one of these is natural, the other <lb/>
            is not, but rather arises from some art and skill. Now let us <lb/>
            enter on our inquiry into the subject from the following point <lb/>
            The uses of every possession are two, both indeed essential <lb/>
            but not in the same manner; for the one is strictly proper to <lb/>
            the thing, the other not; as a shoe, for instance, may be either <lb/>
            worn or exchanged for something else; for both these are <lb/>
            uses of the shoe; for he who exchanges a shoe with some <lb/>
            man who wants one, for money, or provisions, uses the shoe <lb/>
            as a shoe, but not according to its proper use; for shoes are <lb/>
            not made to be exchanged. The same thing holds <lb/>
            true of all other possessions ; for barter in general <lb/>
            had its original beginning in nature, from the <lb/>
            fact that some men had a surplus, and others less <lb/>
            Barter (<foreign xml:lang="grc">καπη­ <lb/>
            λική</foreign>) is a se­ <lb/>
            condary use of <lb/>
            property, and <lb/>
            so is <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ, φύσει</foreign>. <lb/>
            than was necessary for them. And hence it is evident, that <lb/>
            the selling provisions for money is not naturally a part of pe­ <lb/>
            cuniary science; for men were obliged to use barter as far as <lb/>
            would supply their wants. Now it is plain that <lb/>
            barter could have no place in the first community, <lb/>
            that is to say, in the household: but must have <lb/>
            It could not <lb/>
            exist in the <unclear/> <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἶκος</foreign>, and why. <lb/>
            begun when the number of those who composed the commu­ <lb/>
            nity came to be enlarged; for the former of these had all <lb/>
            things the same and in common; but those who <lb/>
            came to be separated, had in common many other <lb/>
            things1 which both parties were obliged to ex- <lb/>
            How money <lb/>
            arose from ex­ <lb/>
            tended wants. <lb/>
            change as their wants arose. And this custom of barter is <lb/>
            still preserved amongst many barbarous nations, who exchange <lb/>
            one necessary for another, but do nothing more; for example, <lb/>
            - giving and receiving wine for corn, and the like in other such <lb/>
            things. This sort of barter then is not contrary to nature, nor yet <lb/>
            is it any species of money-getting ; but it is necessary in order <lb/>
            to complete that independence which is natural. From this <lb/>
            barter however arose the use of money, as might <lb/>
            ' be expected; for as the needful means for import­ <lb/>
            ing what was wanted, or for exporting a surplus, <lb/>

            cessity devised.1 For it is not every thing which is naturally <lb/>
            useful, that is easy of carriage; and for this reason men in­ <lb/>
            vented among themselves, by way of exchange, something <lb/>
            which they should mutually give and take, and which being <lb/>
            really valuable in itself, might easily be passed from hand to <lb/>
            hand for the purposes of daily life, as iron and silver, or any <lb/>
            thing else of the same nature. This at first had a fixed <lb/>
            standard simply according to its weight or size; but in pro­ <lb/>
            cess of time they put upon it a certain stamp, to save the <lb/>
            trouble of weighing, and this stamp was affixed as a sign of its <lb/>
            express value. Money then being devised from the necessity <lb/>
            of mutual interchange, the second species of money-getting <lb/>
            arose, namely, by buying and selling ; and this was conducted <lb/>
            probably at first in a simple manner, but afterwards it came to <lb/>
            True object of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρηματιστική</foreign>, <lb/>
            the supply of <lb/>
            instruments, <lb/>
            not of coin. <lb/>
            employ more skill and experience, as to where and <lb/>
            how the greatest profit might be made. For which <lb/>
            reason the art of money-getting seems to be chiefly <lb/>
            conversant about trade, and its end to be able to <lb/>
            see where the greatest profit can be made ; for it is the means <lb/>
            of procuring abundance of wealth and possessions. For men <lb/>
            Money is not <lb/>
            wealth. <lb/>
            oftentimes suppose wealth 2 to consist in the quan­ <lb/>
            tity of money which any one possesses, as this is <lb/>
            that medium with which trading and trafficking <lb/>
            are concerned: 3others again regard it as a mere trifle, as <lb/>
            having no value by nature, but merely by arbitrary compact; <lb/>
            so that if those who use it should alter their sentiments, it <lb/>
            would be worthless, and unserviceable for any necessary pur­ <lb/>
            pose. Thus oftentimes the man who abounds in money will <lb/>
            want the necessary food; and it is absurd to say that wealth is <lb/>
            a thing of such a kind that a man with plenty of it around him <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare Eth. v. 5, cloy <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὲ ὑπάλλαγαγμα τη̃ς χρείας τὸ νόμισμα γί <lb/>

            may perish with hunger, like Midas in the fable, who from <lb/>
            his insatiable wish found every thing set before him turned <lb/>
            into gold. For which reason people look about for something <lb/>
            else by way of riches and property, and rightly too; for the <lb/>
            mere getting of money differs from natural wealth, and the <lb/>
            latter is the true object of economy; while trade only procures <lb/>
            money, not by all means, but by the exchange of it; and it <lb/>
            seems to be chiefly employed about trading, for money is the <lb/>
            element and the regulator of trade; nor are there any bounds <lb/>
            to be set to the wealth which is thereby acquired. For just <lb/>
            as there are no limits to the art of medicine with respect to <lb/>
            health, and as all other arts with respect to their ends are in­ <lb/>
            finite 1—(for these ends they desire to effect to the furthest <lb/>
            possible extent)—but still the means used for those ends are <lb/>
            limited, and their several ends are the limits of each; so too <lb/>
            in the art of acquiring riches, its end has no limits, for its <lb/>
            object is money and possessions; but economy has a boundary, <lb/>
            though the former has not; for acquiring riches is not its <lb/>
            real end. 2 And for this reason it should seem that some <lb/>
            boundary should be set to riches, though in practice we see <lb/>
            the contrary of this taking place; for all those who get riches <lb/>
            add to their money without end. The cause of this is the <lb/>
            near connexion of these two arts- with each other, The storing ap <lb/>
            for they sometimes change employment with money is <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ</foreign>, <lb/>

            health, virtue ; but things instrumental are limited by the ends to which <lb/>

            end which it proposes, and which it always attains. And so what he <lb/>
            means here by saying <foreign xml:lang="grc">περάς</foreign> rb <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέλος πάσαις</foreign> is this; " inasmuch as they <lb/>
            cannot always reach the ideal end, artists in any line put up with the <lb/>

            same manner; for the end of the one is something beyond <lb/>
            itself, but the end of the other is merely to increase it; so <lb/>

            of <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὶκονμική</foreign>. <lb/>
            object of economy, and think that for this purpose <lb/>
            they ought to continue to save or to hoard up <lb/>
            money without end. And the reason of this dis­ <lb/>
            position is that they are intent upon livings but <lb/>
            not upon living well; and this desire being boundless in its <lb/>
            extent, the means which they employ for that purpose are <lb/>
            boundless also. And those who set themselves to live well, <lb/>
            often confine their view to the enjoyment of sensual pleasures ; <lb/>
            so that as this also seems to depend upon what a man has, all <lb/>
            their care is to get money, and hence arises the second species <lb/>
            of money-getting; for as their enjoyment is in excess, they <lb/>
            seek means proportionate to supply this excess of enjoyment; <lb/>
            and if they cannot do this merely by the art of dealing in <lb/>
            money, they will endeavour to do it by other ways, and apply <lb/>
            all their powers to a purpose which is not according to nature. <lb/>
            Thus, for instance, courage was intended to inspire fortitude, <lb/>
            not to get money by; neither is this the end of the soldier's <lb/>
            or the physician's art, but victory and health respectively. <lb/>
            But such persons make every art subservient to money-getting, <lb/>
            as if this was the only end, and to the end every thing ought to <lb/>
            contribute. We have now considered that art of money-getting <lb/>
            which is not necessary, and have said what it is, and how we <lb/>
            come to need it, and also that which is necessary, which is <lb/>
            different from it; for that economy which is natural, and <lb/>
            whose object is to provide food, is not infinite like this, but <lb/>
            has its bounds.</p>

            whether it is not, and yet must of necessity <lb/>
            exist; for as the political science does not make men, but <note type="footnote"> 1 For <foreign xml:lang="grc">ςωεσήρχ κτῆσις</foreign> Goettling suggests <foreign xml:lang="grc">κτήσως χρῆσις</foreign>; and this <lb/>

            receiving them from the hand of nature employs them to <lb/>
            proper purposes ; thus nature, whether it be the earth, or <lb/>
            sea, or any thing else, ought to supply them with provisions; <lb/>
            and this it is the business of the master of the family to <lb/>
            manage properly. For it is not the weaver's business to <lb/>
            make yarn, but to use it, and to distinguish what is good and <lb/>
            useful from what is bad and of no service: and <lb/>
            in like manner some one may inquire why money- <lb/>
            getting should be a part of economy, when the <lb/>
            For <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρῆσις</foreign> <lb/>
            presupposes <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κτἦσις</foreign>. <lb/>
            art of healing is not; since it is as requisite that the family <lb/>
            should be in health as that they should eat, or have any thing <lb/>
            else which is necessary. Now, as it is indeed in some sense <lb/>
            the business of both the master of the family and the ruler of <lb/>
            a state to see after the health of those under their care, but <lb/>
            in another sense not, but the physician's ; so also as to money, <lb/>
            in some respects it is the business of the master of the family, <lb/>
            in others not, but of the servile art. But as we have already <lb/>
            said, it is chiefly the part of nature; for it is her part to sup­ <lb/>
            ply her offspring with food; for nourishment is left for every <lb/>
            thing born, by that which gave it birth; and hence by the <lb/>
            way, the natural riches of all men arise from fruits and from <lb/>
            animals. But since these riches may be applied, as we have <lb/>
            said, to two purposes, the one to make money of, the other <lb/>
            for the service of the house; of these the first is necessary <lb/>
            and commendable, the other, which has to do with traffic, is <lb/>
            justly censured;1 for it has not its origin in nature, but <lb/>
            amongst ourselves; for usury is most reasonably <lb/>
            detested, as the increase of our fortune arises <lb/>
            from the money itself, and not by employing it <lb/>
            Unnatural cha­ <lb/>
            racter of usury <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τοκισμός</foreign>). <lb/>
            to the purpose for which it was intended. For it was devised <lb/>
            for the sake of exchange, but usury multiplies it. And hence <lb/>
            usury has received the name of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τόκος</foreign>, or "produce;" for <lb/>
            whatever is produced is itself like its parents; and usury is <lb/>
            merely money born of money: so that of all means of money- <lb/>
            making, this is the most contrary to nature. <note type="footnote"> 1 Comp. Psalm xv. " Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord ? ... <lb/>
            he that hath not given his money unto usury." Deut. xxiii. 19, " Thou <lb/>

            victuals, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury : unto a stranger thou <lb/>

          <p>BUT since we have already sufficiently considered the matter <lb/>
            in its general principles, let as now go into the practical part <lb/>
            of it; for the contemplation of such matters offers a liberal <lb/>
            employment for the mind, but the application to practice is <lb/>
            The parts of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρηματιστικὴ <lb/>
            κατὰ φύσιν</foreign>. <lb/>
            necessary. But it is an useful part in the man­ <lb/>
            agement of one's affairs, to be skilful in the <lb/>
            nature of cattle, as to which are most profitable, <lb/>
            and where, and how; for instance, what is the advantage of <lb/>
            rearing horses, or oxen, or sheep, or any other live stock. It <lb/>
            is also necessary to be acquainted with the comparative value <lb/>
            of these things, and which of them are worth most in par­ <lb/>
            ticular places; for some do better in one place, and some in <lb/>
            another. Next, as to the pursuit of agriculture, and the man­ <lb/>
            agement of arable grounds and orchards ;1 and also as to the <lb/>
            care of bees, and other living things, such as fish and birds, <lb/>
            from whence any profit may arise. These are the first and <lb/>
            most considerable parts of domestic management: but with <lb/>
            respect to gaining money by exchange, the principal method <lb/>
            is merchandise, which is carried on in three different ways, <lb/>
            The parts of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρηματιστικὴ <lb/>
            μὴ κατα φύσιν</foreign>, <lb/>
            either by sea-trading, by warehousing, or by <lb/>
            retail-dealing; and these differ from each other <lb/>
            in this, that some of them are more safe, while <lb/>
            others bring in a larger return. The second method is <lb/>
            usury. The third is the receipt of wages for work done, <lb/>
            and this either by being employed in some illiberal art, <lb/>
            or else in what is unscientific and serviceable merely to the <lb/>
            An intermedi­ <lb/>
            ate kind. <lb/>
            body. There is also a third species of im­ <lb/>
            proving a fortune, between this and the first; for <lb/>
            it has part in common with the natural method, <lb/>
            and part with the system of exchange; and it has to do <lb/>
            with things that are immediately from the earth, or their <lb/>
            produce, which, though they bear no fruit, are yet useful, <lb/>
            such as the felling of timber, and the whole art of min­ <lb/>
            ing: but the latter includes many different species, for <lb/>
            there are various sorts of things dug out of the earth. <lb/>
            Concerning each of these we have now spoken in general, <lb/>
            but minute particulars concerning all of them, though useful <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψιλῆς τε, κ.τ.λ</foreign>. the tillage of land, whether for corn (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ψιλὴ</foreign>) or for <lb/>

            for practical experiment, would be tiresome to dwell on. <lb/>
            Now of all the works of art, those are the most <lb/>
            excellent wherein chance has the least to do ; and <lb/>
            those are the meanest in which the body is most <lb/>

            impaired, and those the most servile in which bodily strength <lb/>
            alone is chiefly wanted, and those most illiberal which require <lb/>
            least skill. But as there are books written on these subjects <lb/>
            by some persons, as by Chares the Parian, and Apollodorus <lb/>
            the Lemnian, upon husbandry and planting, and likewise by <lb/>
            others on other matters, let those who have occasion draw out <lb/>
            a theory therefrom: but every person should collect together <lb/>
            whatsoever chances to be spoken at random, by means of <lb/>
            which many who aimed at making a fortune have attained <lb/>
            success, For all these are useful to those who set <lb/>
            great store on money-getting ; as was the money- <lb/>
            getting contrivance of 1 Thales the Milesian, <lb/>
            which men attributed to him on account of his <lb/>
            A practical <lb/>
            knowledge of <lb/>
            them useful to <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">οικονόμος</foreign>, <lb/>
            and why. <lb/>
            wisdom, though it is one of general application. For when <lb/>
            they reviled him for his poverty, as if the study of philosophy <lb/>
            was useless, it is said that, while it was yet winter, he per­ <lb/>
            ceived by his skill in astrology, that there would be great <lb/>
            plenty of olives that year, and that having got a supply of <lb/>
            money, he bought on a small security all the oil-presses that <lb/>
            were in Miletus and Chios, which he hired at a low price, <lb/>
            as there was no one to bid against him. When the season <lb/>
            came for making oil, many persons wanted them, and so all at <lb/>
            once he let them upon terms he pleased; and raising a large <lb/>
            sum of money by that means, he convinced them that it was easy <lb/>
            for philosophers to be rich if they chose it, but that this was <lb/>
            not what they aimed at ;2 in this manner is Thales said to have <lb/>
            shown his wisdom. It indeed is, as we have said, generally <lb/>
            lucrative, for a person to contrive to make a monopoly of any <lb/>
            thing; for which reason some cities also adopt this method <lb/>
            when they want money, for they make a monopoly of their <lb/>
            commodities. There was, too, a certain person in Sicily who <lb/>
            laid out a sum of money which was deposited in his hands in <lb/>
            buying up all the iron from the iron works, so that after- <note type="footnote"> 1 The story is told at length in Plutarch's Life of Solon, chap. ii., as <lb/>

            wards, when the dealers came from the markets to purchase, <lb/>
            no one had any to sell but himself; and though he put no <lb/>
            great advance upon it, yet by laying out fifty talents he made <lb/>
            an hundred. When Dionysius heard this, he permitted him <lb/>
            to take his money along with him, but forbade him to con­ <lb/>
            tinue any longer in Syracuse, as being one who contrived <lb/>
            means for getting money, inconsistent with his interests. This <lb/>
            man's foresight and that of Thales was exactly the same; for <lb/>
            both of them contrived to procure a monopoly for themselves.1 <lb/>
            The same <lb/>
            knowledge <lb/>
            useful in a <lb/>
            higher degree <lb/>
            to statesmen. <lb/>
            It is useful also for politicians definitely to under­ <lb/>
            stand these things ; for many states want to raise <lb/>
            money and to employ such means, as well as pri­ <lb/>
            vate families, nay more so; for which reason, <lb/>
            some persons employed in public affairs confine themselves to <lb/>
            this province alone.</p>

          <p>IT was laid down, then, that there are three parts of domestic <lb/>
            government; one, that of the master, of which we have already <lb/>
            treated ; another of the father, and a third that of the husband. <lb/>
            How a wife <lb/>
            and a child are <lb/>
            to be governed. <lb/>
            Now the government of the wife and children, <lb/>
            should both be that of free persons, but not the <lb/>
            same ; for the wife should be treated as the member <lb/>
            of a state, but the children should be under kingly rule; for the <lb/>
            male is by nature made to rule over the female, except when <lb/>
            something happens contrary to the usual course of nature; <lb/>
            as the elder and full-grown is superior to the younger and <lb/>
            Difference of <lb/>
            principle be­ <lb/>
            tween <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολιτικὴ</foreign> <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">βασιλικὴ <lb/>
            ἀρχή</foreign>. <lb/>
            imperfect. Now in the generality of free states, <lb/>
            the governors and the governed alternately <lb/>
            change place; for an equality without any pre­ <lb/>
            ference is what nature chooses; however, when <lb/>
            one governs and another is governed, she endeavours that a <lb/>
            distinction shall be made between them, in forms, expressions, <lb/>
            and honours; according to what Amasis said of his laver.2 <lb/>
            This then should be the established rule between the male <note type="footnote"> 1 For further instances the reader can refer to the Economics, book ii. <lb/>

              and the female. The government of children should be <lb/>
              kingly; for the power of the father over the child is founded <lb/>
              on both affection and seniority; and this is a species of kingly <lb/>
              government; for which reason Homer very properly calls <lb/>
              Jupiter " Father of gods and men," as being the king of all <lb/>
              of them. For it is required that a king should be of the same <lb/>
              species with those whom he governs, though naturally supe­ <lb/>
              rior ; as is the case between the elder and the younger, and <lb/>
              between the father and the son.</p>

          <p>IT is evident then that, in the due government of <lb/>
            a family, greater attention should be paid to its <lb/>
            several members than to the mere gaining of inan­ <lb/>
            imate things; and to the virtues of the former <lb/>
            The <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἰκονομος</foreign> <lb/>
            must look to <lb/>
            the virtue of <lb/>
            his household. <lb/>
            rather than of the latter, (and this we term wealth;) and greater <lb/>
            regard to those of freemen than of slaves. But <lb/>
            here some one may question whether there is any <lb/>
            other virtue in a slave than his mechanical ser­ <lb/>
            vices, and of higher estimation than these, as tem- <lb/>
            Can a slave <lb/>
            possess <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρετή</foreign>, <lb/>
            beyond per­ <lb/>
            formance of bo­ <lb/>
            dily labour ? <lb/>
            perance, fortitude, justice, and other such like habits, or <lb/>
            whether slaves possess none beyond mere bodily qualities. <lb/>
            Each side of the question has its difficulties ; for if they possess <lb/>
            these virtues, wherein will they differ from freemen? and <lb/>
            since they are men, and partakers of reason, it is absurd to <lb/>
            say that they do not. Nay, nearly the same in­ <lb/>
            quiry may be made concerning a woman, and a <lb/>
            child, whether these also have their proper virtues, <lb/>
            Can a wife or <lb/>
            child ? <lb/>
            whether a woman ought to be temperate, brave, and just, and <lb/>
            whether a child can be unbridled and temperate or not;1 and <lb/>
            indeed this inquiry ought to be made in general, whether the <lb/>
            virtues of those who by nature either govern or are governed, <lb/>
            are the same, or different. For if it is necessary <lb/>
            that both of them should partake of noble charac­ <lb/>
            ter, why is it necessary that the one should always <lb/>
            The question <lb/>
            put in general. <lb/>
            govern, the other always be governed ? Surely this difference <lb/>
            cannot be merely one of degree; for to govern, and to be <note type="footnote"> 1 Goettling (p. 303) takes a different view of Aristotle's meaning here, <lb/>

            governed, are things different in species, but more or less are <lb/>
            not. And yet it is strange that the one party ought to have <lb/>
            them, and the other not; for if be who is to govern shall not <lb/>
            be temperate and just, how can he govern well ? or if he is <lb/>
            to be governed, how can he be governed well ? for he who is <lb/>
            intemperate and a coward, will never do what he ought. It <lb/>
            is evident, then, that both parties ought to partake of virtue, <lb/>
            but that there must be some difference of virtue between them, <lb/>
            Different <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρεταἰ</foreign> <lb/>
            of the ruler <lb/>
            and the ruled. <lb/>
            as there is between those who by nature command <lb/>
            and those who by nature obey. This is sug­ <lb/>
            gested by the soul; for in this there is implanted <lb/>
            by nature one part that rules and one that obeys; and the <lb/>
            virtues of these we say are different, as are those of a rational <lb/>
            and an irrational being. It is plain then that the same prin­ <lb/>

            and are governed. Now a freeman governs his <lb/>
            slave in one manner, the male governs the female <lb/>
            in another, and in another manner the father go­ <lb/>
            verns his child; and all these have the different parts of the <lb/>
            soul within them, but in a different manner. Thus a slave <lb/>
            can have no deliberative faculty,l a woman but a weak one,! <lb/>
            a child an imperfect one. Thus also must it necessarily be <lb/>
            with respect to moral virtues ; it must be supposed that all <lb/>
            must possess them, though not in the same manner, but as is best <lb/>
            The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂρχων</foreign> <lb/>
            must be per­ <lb/>
            fect in <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠθικὴ <lb/>
            ὰρετή</foreign> . <lb/>
            suited to the several ends of each. Hence, by the <lb/>
            way, he who is to govern ought to be perfect in <lb/>
            moral virtue,—(for his business is entirely that of <lb/>
            a master artificer, and reason is the master arti­ <lb/>
            ficer;)—while others want only that portion of it which <lb/>
            may be sufficient for their station: and hence it is evident, <lb/>
            that although moral virtue is common to all those of whom we <lb/>
            have spoken, yet the temperance of a man and of a woman are <lb/>
            not the same, nor their courage, nor their justice, as Socrates <lb/>
            thought ;3 for the courage of the man consists in commanding, <note type="footnote"> 1 If however this be the case with the <foreign xml:lang="grc">φύσει δοῠλος</foreign>, the question nature <lb/>
            ally arises, " why educate him at all ? and how shall he be educated ? " <lb/>
            Here is clearly an inconsistency; for at the end of the present chapter <lb/>

            the woman's in obedience. And the same is true in all other <lb/>
            particulars, and this will be evident to those who will examine <lb/>
            the matter in detail; for those who use general terms deceive <lb/>
            themselves, when they say that virtue consists in a good dis­ <lb/>
            position of mind, or in doing what is right, or something of <lb/>
            this sort. They do much better who enumerate the different <lb/>
            virtues as Georgias did, than those who thus de­ <lb/>
            fine them, and hence we ought to think of all per­ <lb/>
            sons, as the poet says of a woman, <lb/>
            The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρ</foreign>pern of <lb/>
            the wife. <lb/>
            " Silence is woman's ornament," 1 <lb/>
            but it is not the ornament of a man. But as a <lb/>
            child is incomplete, it is evident that his virtue is <lb/>
            not to be referred to himself, but to the full-grown <lb/>
            The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρετὴ</foreign> of <lb/>
            the child. <lb/>
            man, and to him whom he obeys. In like manner, the virtue <lb/>
            of a slave is to be referred to his master ; for we laid it down <lb/>
            as a maxim, that the use of a slave is to be employ­ <lb/>
            ed in what is wanted ; so that it is clear enough <lb/>
            that but little virtue is required in him, only just <lb/>
            The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρετὴ</foreign> of <lb/>
            the slave. <lb/>
            so much as that he may not neglect his work through intern­ <lb/>
            perance or cowardice. Here some person may question <lb/>
            (supposing what 1 have said is true whether <lb/>
            virtue will not be necessary for artificers in their <lb/>
            calling ; for they often neglect their work through <lb/>
            The <foreign xml:lang="grc">αρετὴ</foreign> of <lb/>
            an artificer <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τεχνίτης</foreign>). <lb/>
            intemperance But the difference between the two cases is <lb/>
            very great; for a slave partakes of animal life, but the arti­ <lb/>
            ficer is something more than this; 2 as near therefore as the <lb/>
            artificer approaches to the slave, just so much ought he to <lb/>
            have of the virtues of one, for a mean artificer has a certain <lb/>
            distinctive kind of slavery; but then a slave is one of those <lb/>
            things which are by nature what they are, though this is not <note type="footnote"> public of Plato, to the effect that women are equally fit with men to un­ <lb/>

            Slaves must be <lb/>
            trained to vir. <lb/>
            tue by their <lb/>
            masters. <lb/>
            equally true of a shoemaker, or of any other artist.1 <lb/>
            It is evident then that a slave ought to be trained <lb/>
            to such virtue by his master; and not in the way <lb/>
            in which a master would teach him mere servile <lb/>
            drudgery. Those therefore are in the wrong who would de­ <lb/>
            prive slaves of reason, and say that they have only to follow <lb/>
            their orders, for slaves want more instruction than children; <lb/>
            thus, then, let us determine as to this matter. But it is ne­ <lb/>
            cessary, in a treatise upon government, to enter particularly <lb/>
            into the relations of husband and wife, and of parent and child, <lb/>
            and to show what are the virtues of each and their respective <lb/>
            connexions with each other, what is right and what is wrong; <lb/>
            and how they ought to follow the good, and avoid the evil. <lb/>
            We must seek <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρετή</foreign> of the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόλις</foreign> by train­ <lb/>
            ing its indivi­ <lb/>
            dual members <lb/>
            well. <lb/>
            Since then every family is part of a state, and <lb/>
            each of those individuals is part of a family, <lb/>
            and the virtue of the parts ought to have regard <lb/>
            to the virtue of the whole; it is necessary to in­ <lb/>
            struct both the wives and children of the commu­ <lb/>
            nity, as to the nature thereof, inasmuch as it is of some conse­ <lb/>
            quence to the virtue of the state that the wives and children <lb/>
            therein should be virtuous. And of consequence it necessarily <lb/>
            is, for the wives compose one half of the free persons; and of <lb/>
            the children the succeeding citizens are to be born. As then <lb/>
            we have determined these points, we will leave the rest to be <lb/>
            considered in another place; and2 as if the subject was now <lb/>

          <p>SINCE then we propose to inquire what civil <lb/>
            society is of all others best 1 for those who have it <lb/>
            in their power to live entirely as they wish, it is <lb/>
            necessary to examine into the polities adopted in <lb/>
            To find what it <lb/>
            the best go­ <lb/>
            vernment, let <lb/>
            us examine <lb/>
            existing forms. <lb/>
            those states which are allowed to be well governed, and in <lb/>
            any others which may chance to have been described by <lb/>
            writers, and appear properly regulated, in order that we <lb/>
            may note what is right and useful in them. And as to our <lb/>
            seeking for something beyond these states, let it not be re­ <lb/>
            garded as an affectation of wisdom; but let us have the credit <lb/>
            of setting ourselves to this systematic work, because there are <lb/>
            great defects in those which are already established. And <lb/>
            we must begin first with that part of the subject which na­ <lb/>
            turally is the foundation of our discussion.</p>
          <p>Now the members of every state must of necessity have all <lb/>
            things in common, or nothing at all in common, or some things <lb/>
            in common and not others. To have nothing in common is <lb/>
            evidently impossible, for the social state itself is a species of <lb/>
            community; and the first thing necessary is a common place <lb/>
            of habitation, namely, the city; this too must be one, and <lb/>
            every citizen must have a share in this one state. But in a <note type="footnote"> ' Having in the first book laid down the elements of which states are <lb/>
            composed, Aristotle proceeds next in order to discuss the question, <lb/>
            " What is the best form of government ?" and he examines it in a prac­ <lb/>
            tical way, and with a practical object. <lb/>
            There are three possible ways of examining this question : <lb/>
            1. Ideally. Which is the most perfect conceivable theory, irrespective <lb/>
            of practicability ? <lb/>
            2. Really. Which is the best form of government now in existence ? <lb/>
            3. Practically. Which is the best and most suitable that can be devised <lb/>
            for man as he is? <lb/>
            It is the third of these methods which Aristotle adopts, as most entirely <lb/>
            in accordance with his system of philosophy. Compare book iv. ch. i. <lb/>
            " Besides ... it is necessary to distinguish what sort of government is <lb/>
            best fitting for all cities: for most of those writers who have treated this <lb/>
            subject, however speciously they may handle other parts of it, have failed <lb/>
            in describing the practical parts: for it is not enough to lay down scien­ <lb/>
            tifically what is best, but what can be put in practice (ri <foreign xml:lang="grc">δυνατόν</foreign>). It <lb/>
            should also be simple and easy for all to attain to. But, contrary to this, <lb/>
            they seek out only the most subtle form of government, and one which <lb/>
            needs many things to fill it up." </note> <note type="footnote"> D </note> <pb n="34"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK II. </note> <lb/>
            state which is to be well governed, will it be best that all <lb/>
            shall have a share in every thing which is capable of being <lb/>
            shared, or only in some particulars, but not in others ? for it <lb/>
            is possible that the citizens may have their wives, and chil­ <lb/>
            dren, and goods in common with each other, as in Plato's com­ <lb/>
            monwealth ;1 for in that, Socrates affirms that the children, <lb/>
            the wives, and the possessions ought to be common. Which <lb/>
            then shall we prefer ? the plan which is already established, <lb/>
            or the custom which is proposed in Plato's commonwealth ? <note type="footnote"> 1 For the views of Socrates on this subject, the reader will do well to <lb/>
            consult Plato's Republic, especially b. v. p. 458—465. Aristotle's objec­ <lb/>
            tions to the theory of Plato may all be reduced to two heads: <lb/>
            I. That Plato's end is a wrong one. <lb/>
            2. That his means do not answer their end. <lb/>
            Plato's end was that the state should be as much one as possible. </note> <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_39_fig10.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> Plato desired a state in which all things should be common; in which <lb/>
              all should be as brothers, and call nothing u mine." He desired to effect <lb/>
              a moral union, but he endeavoured to attain it by physical means. <lb/>
              Now to the above theory Aristotle objects that this perfect unity, so <lb/>
              far from perfecting, would in reality destroy the essence of a state; <lb/>
              and that which destroys its essence cannot be the end or good of any <lb/>
              thing. <lb/>
              In support of this view he says, a " family is more one than a state, and <lb/>
              an individual more than a family. For not only must a state consist of <lb/>
              numbers, but these must be different in kind; else the state will be a mere <lb/>
              tribe, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἒθνος</foreign>,) and not a <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόλις</foreign>; for even where all the citizens are equal, <lb/>
              a fictitious difference must be preserved. This is the very essence of a <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόλις</foreign>, viz. TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂρχειν καὶ ἂϱχεσθαι</foreign>. <lb/>
              Aristotle then next sets himself to prove that a community of wives <lb/>
              does not tend to produce the end of a state. <lb/>
              Plato's argument is this, in syllogistic form : <lb/>
              What tends to unity, tends to the end of a state; <lb/>
              But a community of wives tends to unity ; <lb/>
              Therefore, it tends to preserve a state. <lb/>
              It will be observed that Aristotle denies both premises; a proceeding <lb/>
              which possibly raises a presumption in favour of Plato's theory. For if <lb/>
              unity be shown to be not the end of the state, and if the above community <lb/>
              does not tend to unity, then it does not tend to some thing which is not the <lb/>
              end of a community. It is one step in a negative induction towards proving <lb/>
              that the aforesaid community does tend towards the end of a state. </note></p><pb n="35"/>

          </ab>
          <p>Now a general community of wives is attended <lb/>
            with many other difficulties ; and among others, <lb/>
            the object for which Socrates would have his <lb/>
            Plato's Repub­ <lb/>
            lie. Its merits <lb/>
            canvassed. <lb/>
            government framed in this manner, does not seem to fol­ <lb/>
            low from his reasoning : again, it is not capable of producing <lb/>
            that end which he says ought to be in the view of a state, as <lb/>
            was but just now stated ; nor has he given any particular . <lb/>
            directions as to how the arrangement ought to be made. Now <lb/>
            I also am willing to admit that the state ought to be one <lb/>
            as much as possible, (for this is the principle <lb/>
            which Socrates adopts:) 1 and yet it is evident <lb/>
            that if it goes on till it becomes too much one, <lb/>
            Is a perfect <lb/>
            unity desirable <lb/>
            or no ? <lb/>
            it will be no longer a state, for the state naturally sup­ <lb/>
            poses a multitude; so that if we proceed in this manner, from <lb/>
            a state it will become a family, and from a family it will be­ <lb/>
            come an individual: for we should say that a family is one <lb/>
            to a greater degree than a state, and a single person than a <lb/>
            family ; so that even if this end could be obtained, it should <lb/>
            never be put in practice, as it would annihilate the state. For <lb/>
            not only does a state consist of a large number of inhabitants, <lb/>
            but they must also be of different sorts : for were they all <lb/>
            alike there could be no state; for a confederacy and a state 2 <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristotle refers here to Plato's Republic, (v. chap. 5,) where Socrates is <lb/>
            represented as asking, " Is there any greater evil for a state than that which <lb/>
            tears it to pieces, and makes it many instead of one ? or any greater good <lb/>
            than that which binds it together and makes it one ? " Pinzger, in his <lb/>
            commentary on the Strictures of Aristotle upon Plato's Republic, asserts <lb/>
            that Aristotle does not take the word unity in the same sense as Plato, but <lb/>
            understands it as meaning an individual, (in logical phrase, unum nu­ <lb/>
            mero ;) while Plato takes it in the sense of unanimity. To prove his <lb/>
            assertion, he quotes the well-known passage from Aristotle's Metaphysics <lb/>
            (iv. 6) ; but incorrectly. But the answer which Aristotle gives below, <lb/>
            to the effect that an excess of unity will reduce the state first to a mere <lb/>
            family, and from that to an individual, shows that he scarcely understood <lb/>
            or appreciated Plato's meaning. A moral unity is plainly something <lb/>
            different from physical unity, and a moral whole from a physical whole. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The three words here used by Aristotle are <foreign xml:lang="grc">συμμαχία, ἒθνος</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόλις</foreign>. <lb/>

            The same distinction will prevail between a state and a tribe, <lb/>
            when the people are not collected into separate villages, but live <lb/>
            as the Arcadians. Now those things by which a state should <lb/>
            become one are of different sorts; and it is the preserving a <lb/>
            just and equal balance of power, which is the safety of states, <lb/>
            as has already been mentioned in our treatise on Ethics.1 Now <lb/>
            among freemen and equals this is absolutely necessary; for <lb/>
            all cannot govern at the same time, but either by the year, or <lb/>
            There must be <lb/>
            a distinction <lb/>
            between the <lb/>
            rulers and the <lb/>
            ruled. <lb/>
            according to some other regulation or time.2 By <lb/>
            this means, it follows that every one in his turn <lb/>
            will be in office; as if the shoemakers and <lb/>
            carpenters should exchange occupations, and not <lb/>
            always be employed in the self-same calling. But as it is <lb/>
            better that these should continue in their respective trades, so <lb/>
            also in civil society, where it is possible, it would be better <lb/>
            that the government should continue in the same hands; <lb/>
            but where it is not—(as Nature has made all men equal, and <lb/>
            therefore it is just, be the administration good or bad, that all <lb/>
            should partake of it )-there it is best to observe a rotation, <lb/>
            and let those who are their equals by turns submit to those <lb/>
            who are magistrates at the time;3 since they in turn will <lb/>
            alternately be governors and governed, as if they were different <lb/>
            men ;4 by the same method different persons will execute dif­ <note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴ</foreign>v <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεγάλην πόλιν</foreign> constituit, quo, quasi vinculo gens universa con­ <lb/>

              is really their destruction ; though the good of any thing tends <lb/>

              that it is not for the best to endeavour to make a <lb/>
              state too much one, because a family is more <lb/>
              sufficient in itself than a single person, and a <lb/>
              Why a state <lb/>

              made too like <lb/>
              an individual. <lb/>
              state than a family ;1 and indeed it can lay claim to the name <lb/>
              of a state only when this sufficiency results to the members <lb/>
              of the community. If then this sufficiency is preferable, a <lb/>
              state which is less one, is better than that which is more <lb/>
              nearly so.</p>

          <p>BUT admitting that it is best for the state to be <lb/>
            one as much as possible, it does not seem to be <lb/>
            proved that this will take place on his theory, by <lb/>
            permitting all at once to say " this is mine," and <lb/>
            Plato's theory <lb/>
            fails when <lb/>
            applied to <lb/>
            practice. <lb/>
            " this is not mine, though this is what Socrates regards as a <lb/>
            proof that a state has perfect unity. For the word all is used <lb/>
            in two senses; if it means each individual, what Socrates <lb/>
            proposes will more nearly take place; for each person will <lb/>
            say, this is his own son, and his own wife, and his own pro­ <lb/>
            perty, and of every thing else that may happen to belong to him, <lb/>
            that it is his own. But now those who have their wives and <lb/>
            children in common will not say so, but all will say so, though <lb/>
            not as individuals; and likewise with regard to property, all <lb/>
            will say so, but not as individuals; therefore, this use of the <lb/>
            word "all," is evidently a fallacious mode of speech ;2 for the <lb/>
            words " all" and " both " are odd and even, and are some­ <lb/>
            times used distributively, and sometimes collectively, on ac­ <note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχη̃ς</foreign>. The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">παϱὰ μέρος</foreign> in the following line, he regards as a <lb/>

            shall lose the independence of a state; for it will sink down first into a <lb/>

            thus far, its essence will be found to be in a great measure destroyed. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This is what is commonly called a fallacy of " Compositio et Divisio." <lb/>

            count of their double meaning, and are the cause of contentious <lb/>
            syllogisms in reasoning. Therefore for all persons to say the <lb/>
            same thing was their own, using the word "all" in its distribu­ <lb/>
            tive sense, would be well, but is impossible: while in its collec­ <lb/>
            tive sense, it would by no means contribute to the concord of the <lb/>
            state. Besides, there is another harm attending this proposal; <lb/>
            for whatever is common to many is taken least care of; for all <lb/>
            men regard most what is their own, and care less for common <lb/>
            property, or only just as much as concerns them. For, be­ <lb/>
            sides other considerations, every one is more negligent of <lb/>
            what another has to see to ; as in a family, one is often worse <lb/>
            served by many servants, than by a few. Now each citizen <lb/>
            in the state will have a thousand children, but none of them <lb/>
            will be as the children of any individual, but every child will <lb/>
            be the son of every father, as chance may have it, and the <lb/>
            parents all will alike neglect them. Besides, in consequence <lb/>
            of this, whenever any citizen fared well or ill, every person, <lb/>
            be the number what it would, might say, " this is my son," or <lb/>
            " that man's son;" and in this manner would they speak, and <lb/>
            Further diffi­ <lb/>
            culties; con. <lb/>
            fusion. <lb/>
            doubtingly withal, concerning each of the thou­ <lb/>
            sand, or whatever number the city consisted of; <lb/>
            for it would be uncertain to whom each child be­ <lb/>
            longed, and who should preserve it when born. Now which <lb/>
            of the two do you think is better, for every one to say " this <lb/>
            is mine," while they apply it equally to two thousand, or ten <lb/>
            thousand; or, as we say " this is mine," under our present <lb/>
            forms of government, where one man calls another his son, <lb/>
            another calls that same person his brother, another nephew, <lb/>
            or according to some other relationship, either by blood or <lb/>
            marriage, and first extends his care to him and his, while <lb/>
            another regards him as one of the same brotherhood and the <lb/>
            same tribe ? For sure it is better for any one to be a nephew in <lb/>
            his private capacity, than a son after this manner. Besides, it <lb/>

            suspecting that they are brothers and children, or <lb/>
            fathers and mothers, to each other; for from the <lb/>

          <p>BESIDES, those who contrive this plan for a com­ <lb/>
            munity, cannot easily avoid such evils as the fol­ <lb/>

            not know each other, than among those who do ; and when <lb/>
            they do happen, among those who know their relations, they <lb/>
            admit of a legal expiation, but in the latter case, this can­ <lb/>

            who love each other from sexual intercourse, <lb/>
            while they do not restrain them from the passion <lb/>

              no other reason than the violence of the pleasure, while the <lb/>

              and children in common, than the military class, for there will <lb/>

              greatest good which can happen to any state, as <lb/>
              nothing so much prevents seditions: and unity <note type="footnote">1 In order to understand the allusions of Aristotle here and elsewhere, <lb/>
              t is necessary to inform the reader that Plato divided his purely theoretic <lb/>
              state into three classes. <lb/>
              1. <foreign xml:lang="grc">φύλακες</foreign>—the ruling military class, into whose minds and bodies <lb/>
              precious metal had been infused. <lb/>
              2. <foreign xml:lang="grc">γεωϱγοί</foreign>, (husbandmen,) called citizens, but practically excluded <lb/>
              3. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τεχνι̃ται</foreign>, (artificers,) from all share in the government. <lb/>
              A community of wives was allowed by Plato to the ruling class only. <lb/>
              Aristotle here says, by way of objection, that the two latter classes will not <lb/>
              be satisfied with nominal rule; and that they too ought to be allowed a. <lb/>
              community of wives, lest they should unite too closely among themselves <lb/>
              and rebel against the <foreign xml:lang="grc">φύλκες</foreign>. See Plato's Republic, b. iii. ch. xix. to <lb/>
              the end. As to the community of wives and children, see Republic, <lb/>
              book v. passim. The system of Plato could only be carried out by the <lb/>
              state ascertaining what metal was infused into each child, and classing i <lb/>
              accordingly among the <foreign xml:lang="grc">φύλακες</foreign> or not. The point of objection on which. <lb/>
              Aristotle lays the greatest stress, is the idea that citizens-( for such the <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">γεωργοι</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τεχνι̃ται</foreign> were in theory)—would remain quiet without hav­ <lb/>
              ing any share in the government. Next be censures the idea that a com­ <lb/>
              munity of goods can strengthen anybody of citizens, which Plato evident­ <lb/>
              ly asserted when he confined that community of goods to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κες</foreign>.In <lb/>
              reference to the former, Aristotle says, " If there be a body of men who <lb/>
              cannot attain to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχικὴ</foreign>åpXLlctj <foreign xml:lang="grc">φϱόνησις</foreign>, do not make them citizens at all; at <lb/>
              all events do not make them nominally citizens while you practically ex­ <lb/>
              clude them from civil rights." And as to the second point, Aristotle says <lb/>
              that a community of goods is no bad element in a state, if it be confined <lb/>
              to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">γεωϱγοὶ</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τεχνι̃αι</foreign> : for it will prevent them from combining to­ <lb/>
              gether and making head against the <foreign xml:lang="grc">φύλακες</foreign>, who are intended to be the <lb/>
              ruling body. </note> <pb n="41"/>

              in a state is what Socrates commends above all things ; an <lb/>
              this appears to be, as indeed he says, the result of friendship ; <lb/>
              as we learn from Aristophanes in the Erotics,1 who says, that <lb/>
              those who love one another from the excess of that passion, <lb/>
              desire to coalesce, and from being two to be blended into one : <lb/>
              from whence it would necessarily follow, that both, or one of <lb/>
              them, must be destroyed. But now in a state, the tie of <lb/>
              friendship must be extremely weak on account of this com­ <lb/>
              munity, and neither parent nor child can point to his own re­ <lb/>
              lative. For as a very little of what is sweet, mixed with a <lb/>
              great deal of water, makes the mixture scarcely perceptible, so <lb/>
              must they necessarily disregard all family connexion arising <lb/>
              from such names, in such a community; for it is by no <lb/>
              means necessary that a father should have any regard for a <lb/>
              son, or a brother for his brother. For there are two things <lb/>
              which principally inspire mankind with care and affection, <lb/>
              namely, the sense of what is one's own, and exclusive posses­ <lb/>
              sion ;2 neither of which can find a place in this sort of com­ <lb/>
              munity. As for exchanging the children of the <lb/>
              artificers and husbandmen with those of the mili­ <lb/>
              tary, and theirs in turn with these, it will occa- <lb/>

              must know to whom they give each of them; and by this <lb/>
              means, those evils which we have already mentioned will <lb/>
              necessarily be the more likely to happen, as blows, incestuous <lb/>
              love, murders, and the like; for those who are transferred to <lb/>
              other citizens, will no longer call the military caste by the name <lb/>
              of brothers, sons, fathers, or mothers. The same thing would <lb/>
              happen to those born among the military who were trans­ <lb/>
              ferred to the other citizens ; so that every one thus would be <lb/>
              in fear how to act in consequence of consanguinity. And <lb/>
              thus let us determine concerning a community of wives and <lb/>
              children. <note type="footnote"> 1 That is, in the " Symposium," or " Banquet" of Plato, wherein <lb/>

          <p>Community of <lb/>
            property.</p>
          <p>WE proceed next to consider, as to property, in <lb/>
            what way it should be regulated among those <lb/>
            who are to live under a state formed after the <lb/>
            most perfect mode of government, whether it should be <lb/>
            common or not; (for this may be considered as a separate <lb/>
            question from what has been determined concerning wives <lb/>
            and children ;) I mean, whether it is better, (although these <lb/>
            should be held separate, as is now the case every where,) <lb/>
            that not only the possessions but also the produce of them <lb/>
            should be in common ; or that the soil should belong to a par­ <lb/>
            ticular owner, but that its produce should be brought to­ <lb/>
            gether and used as one common stock, as some nations at <lb/>
            present do; or, on the contrary, that the soil should be com­ <lb/>
            mon and be cultivated in common, while the produce is <lb/>
            divided amongst individuals for their special use, as is said tc <lb/>
            be the practice among some of the barbarians; or whether <lb/>
            both the soil and the fruit should be in common? When <lb/>
            The difficulties <lb/>
            involved in it. <lb/>
            the husbandman and the citizen are distinct, there <lb/>
            is another and easier method; but when they each <lb/>
            labour at their possessions for themselves, this <lb/>
            may occasion several difficulties ; for if there be not an equal <lb/>
            proportion between their labour and what they consume, those <lb/>
            who labour hard and have but a small proportion of the pro­ <lb/>
            duce, will of necessity complain against those who take a <lb/>
            large share and do but little labour. Upon the whole, it is <lb/>
            difficult to live together as a community, and thus to have all <lb/>
            things that man can possess in common, and especially this is <lb/>
            the case with respect to such property. This is evident from <lb/>
            the partnerships of those who go out to settle a colony; for <lb/>
            nearly all of them have disputes with each other upon the <lb/>
            most common matters, and come to blows upon trifles: we find <lb/>
            too, that we oftenest disagree with those slaves who are gener­ <lb/>
            ally employed in the common offices of a family. A community <lb/>
            of property then has these and other inconveniences attending <lb/>
            it: but the manner of life which is now established, more <lb/>
            particularly when embellished with good morals and a system <lb/>
            of upright laws, is far superior to it, for it will embrace the <lb/>
            advantages of both; by " both" we mean, the advantage arising <pb n="43"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. V.] </note> <lb/>
            from properties being common, and from being divided also; <lb/>
            for in some respects it ought to be common, but upon the <lb/>
            whole private. For the fact that every man's attention is em­ <lb/>
            ployed on his own particular concerns, will prevent mutual <lb/>
            complaints; and prosperity will increase as each person la­ <lb/>
            bours to improve his own private property; and it will then <lb/>
            happen that, from a principle of virtue, they will perform good <lb/>
            offices to each other, according to the proverb, " All things are <lb/>
            common amongst friends." And in some states there are traces <lb/>
            of this custom to be seen, showing that it is not impracticable ; <lb/>
            and particularly in those which are best governed some things <lb/>
            are in a manner common, and others might be so; for there, <lb/>
            while every person enjoys his own private property, he assists <lb/>
            his friend with some things, and others he shares in common ; <lb/>
            as in Lacedæmon, where they use each other's slaves as if they <lb/>
            were, so to speak, their own, 1 and also their horses and dogs, <lb/>
            or even any provision they may want in a journey. It is <lb/>
            evident then that it is best to have property private, but to <lb/>
            make the use of it common; but how the citizens are to be <lb/>
            brought to this mind, is the particular business of the legis­ <lb/>
            lator to contrive. And also with respect to pleasure, it is <lb/>
            unspeakable how advantageous it is, that a man should think <lb/>
            he has something of his own; for it is by no means to no <lb/>
            purpose, 1 that each person has an affection for himself, for that <lb/>
            is natural, and yet selfishness is justly censured; for we mean <lb/>
            by that, not that he loves himself, but that he loves himself <lb/>
            more than he ought; in like manner we blame a money- <lb/>
            lover ; and yet all men love both money and self. Besides, <lb/>
            it is very pleasant to oblige and assist our friends <lb/>
            and companions, and strangers,2 which cannot be <lb/>
            unless property be private; but this cannot result <lb/>
            It destroys the <lb/>
            practice of mo­ <lb/>
            ral virtues. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μὴ γὰϱ οὐ μάτην</foreign>. Est modeste negantis opinio. " For possibly it <lb/>
            may not be in vain," &amp;c. As to self-love and selfishness, and the dis­ <lb/>
            tinction between them, see Butler's first Sermon on Human Nature, <lb/>
            and Analogy, Part I. chap. v. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 We have here almost a Christian argument against the ideal com­ <lb/>
            munity of goods proposed by Socrates. In a state where the principle of <lb/>
            unity is thus carried out, it will be impossible to exercise the social duties <lb/>
            of liberality, kindness, &amp;c., and there will be no room for the virtues of <lb/>
            benevolence, charity, modesty, &amp;c. But virtue cannot exist if its proper <lb/>
            objects are withdrawn; this result, then, shows that however fair and <lb/>
            plausible such an Utopian theory may be, it is contrary to the nature of <lb/>
            man, and therefore false in principle. </note> <pb n="44"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK II. </note> <lb/>
            where they make the state too entirely one. And further, they <lb/>
            destroy the offices of two principal virtues, modesty and liber­ <lb/>
            ality—modesty with respect to the female sex, for it is right <lb/>
            to abstain from her who is another's; and liberality, as it re­ <lb/>
            lates to private property, without which no one can appear <lb/>
            liberal, or do any generous action; for the office of liberality <lb/>
            On other <lb/>
            grounds also <lb/>
            impracticable. <lb/>
            consists in imparting to others what is our own. <lb/>
            This system of polity does indeed recommend it­ <lb/>
            self by its good appearance, and specious pretences <lb/>
            to humanity; and the man who hears it proposed will receive <lb/>
            it gladly, concluding that there will be a wonderful bond of <lb/>
            friendship between all its members, particularly when any one <lb/>
            censures the evils which are now to be found in society, as <lb/>
            arising from property not being common; as for example, the <lb/>
            disputes which happen between man and man, upon their con­ <lb/>
            tracts with each other; the judgments passed to punish per­ <lb/>
            jury, and the flattering of the rich; none of which arise from <lb/>
            properties being private, but from the corruption of man­ <lb/>
            kind. For we see those who live in one community and have <lb/>
            all things in common, disputing with each other oftener than <lb/>
            those who have their property separate; but we observe fewer <lb/>
            instances of strife, because of the very small number of those <lb/>
            who have property in common, compared with those where <lb/>
            it is appropriated. It is also but right to mention not only <lb/>
            the evils from which they who share property in common <lb/>
            will be preserved, but also the advantages which they will <lb/>
            lose; for viewed as a whole, this manner of life will be found <lb/>
            Different kinds <lb/>
            of unity. <lb/>
            impracticable. We must suppose, then, that the <lb/>
            error of Socrates arose from the fact that his first <lb/>
            principle 1 was false; for we admit that both a <lb/>
            family and a state ought to be one in some particulars, but <lb/>
            not entirely so ; for there is a point, beyond which if a state <lb/>
            proceeds towards oneness, it will be no longer a state. There <lb/>
            is also another point at which it will still be a state, but in <lb/>
            proportion as it approaches nearer to not being a state, it will <lb/>
            be worse ;2 as if one should reduce the voices of those who sing <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τὴν ὐπόθεσιν</foreign>. The first principle with which he starts, " Initia et <lb/>

              in concert to one, or a verse to a foot. But as a state con­ <lb/>
              tains a multitude, it ought to be brought to unity and com­ <lb/>
              munity, as we have already said, by education; just as pro­ <lb/>
              perty at Lacedaemon and their public tables in Crete were <lb/>
              made common by their legislators. But yet, as <lb/>
              we said above, he must make a state one by <lb/>
              means of education; and he who is about to in- <lb/>
              Moral unity to <lb/>
              be produced by <lb/>
              moral means. <lb/>
              troduce education, and who thinks thereby to make his state <lb/>
              excellent, will be absurd if he expects to fashion it by the <lb/>
              former means, and rather than manners, philosophy, and laws.1 <lb/>
              And the legislator ought to know that he should consult the <lb/>
              experience of long time and of many years, which would <lb/>
              plainly enough inform him whether such a scheme is useful: <lb/>
              for almost all things have already been found out; but some <lb/>
              have been neglected, and others, which men know, they do not <lb/>
              put into practice. But this would be most evident, if any <lb/>
              one could see such a form of government actually established : <lb/>
              for it would be impossible to frame such a state without <lb/>
              dividing and separating it into its distinct parts, as public <lb/>
              tables, wards, and tribes; so that here nothing further will be <lb/>
              provided by the laws than to forbid the military to engage in <lb/>
              agriculture, which is what the Lacedaemonians are at present <lb/>
              endeavouring to do. And further, Socrates has not told us <lb/>
              (nor is it easy to say) what plan of government should be <lb/>
              pursued with respect to the individuals who share in a com­ <lb/>
              munity of goods; for the majority of his state will comprise a <lb/>
              multitude of persons of different occupations, but of these he <lb/>
              has determined nothing; whether the property of the husband­ <lb/>
              man ought to be in common, or whether each should have his <lb/>
              share to himself; as also, whether their wives and children <note type="footnote"> Many editions, however, and that of Goettling among the number, omit <lb/>
              the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἒσται</foreign>; an emendation which makes the text somewhat more <lb/>
              intelligible. We have given what seemed upon the whole to be the sim­ <lb/>
              plest meaning. Compare below, book v. ch. 9, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πϱω̃τον μὲν χειϱω ποιησει <lb/>

              ought to be in common or not. For if all things are to be alike <lb/>
              common to all, where will be the difference between them and <lb/>
              the military, or what will they get by submitting to their <lb/>
              government ? and upon what principles would they thus <lb/>
              submit, unless they should establish the wise practice of <lb/>
              the Cretans, who allowed every thing else to their slaves, <lb/>
              but forbade them only gymnastic exercises and the use of <lb/>
              arms ?1 But if matters are to be with them as they are in <lb/>
              other states, what will be their terms of intercourse ? For in <lb/>
              Absurdity of <lb/>
              confining edu­ <lb/>
              cation to the <lb/>
              military. <lb/>
              one city there must of necessity arise two states, <lb/>
              and those contrary to each other ; for he makes <lb/>
              the military to be the guardians of the state, and <lb/>
              the husbandmen, artisans, and others he makes <lb/>
              citizens; and all those quarrels, accusations, and things of <lb/>
              the like sort, which he says are the bane of other states, will <lb/>
              be found in his also. Notwithstanding, Socrates says that in <lb/>
              consequence of their education they will not want many laws, <lb/>
              but such only as may be necessary for regulating the streets, <lb/>
              the markets, and the like; while at the same time it is the <lb/>
              military only to whom he has granted education. Besides, <lb/>
              he makes the husbandmen masters of property upon paying <lb/>
              a tribute; but this would be likely to make them far more <lb/>
              troublesome and high-spirited than the Helots, the Penestæ, <lb/>
              or other slaves. Nor has he determined what is connected <lb/>
              herewith, their polity, their education, and their laws: be­ <lb/>
              sides, it is of no little consequence, nor is it easy to determine, <lb/>
              how these should be framed so as to preserve the community <lb/>
              of the military. Besides, if he makes the wives common <lb/>
              while the property continues separate, who shall manage the <lb/>
              domestic concerns with the same care which the man bestows <lb/>
              upon his fields ? Nor will it answer by making the property <lb/>
              common as well as the wives: and it is absurd to draw a <lb/>
              comparison from the brute creation, and to say, that the same <lb/>
              principle should regulate the connexion of a woman with a <lb/>
              man, as prevails among brutes, amongst whom there are no <lb/>
              family ties. It is also very hazardous to settle the magistracy <lb/>
              as Socrates has clone ; for he would have persons of the same <note type="footnote"> 1 It would seem that the treatment of the children of Israel by their <lb/>

              frame his community in this manner; for that golden particle <lb/>
              which God has mixed up in the soul of man, flies not from <lb/>
              one to the other, but always continues with the same; for he <lb/>
              says,2 that some of our species have gold, and <lb/>
              others silver, blended in their composition from <lb/>
              the moment of their birth; but those who are to <lb/>
              be husbandmen and artists have brass and iron. <lb/>

              commonwealth <lb/>
              Besides, though he deprives the military of happiness, he says, <lb/>
              that the legislator ought to make the entire body of citizens <lb/>
              happy; but it is impossible that the whole state can be happy, <lb/>
              except all, or the greater part, or some part of it be happy. <lb/>
              For happiness is not the same as the property of even num­ <lb/>

              those who are employed in inferior offices. The state, then, <lb/>

            Too many <lb/>
            questions left <lb/>
            undefined. <lb/>
            to consider the polity there described. For So­ <lb/>
            crates has thoroughly settled but very few parts of <lb/>
            his polity; as for instance, in what manner the <lb/>
            community of wives and children ought to be regulated, and <lb/>
            as to property, and to the manner of conducting the govern­ <lb/>
            ment. Now the whole amount of inhabitants are divided by <lb/>
            him into two parts, the husbandmen and the soldiery; and <lb/>
            from these he selects a third part, who are to be senators and to <lb/>
            govern the state; but he has not said whether or no the hus­ <lb/>
            bandmen and artificers shall have any, and what, share in the <lb/>
            government, or whether they shall have arms, and join with <lb/>
            the others in war, or not. He thinks also that the women <lb/>
            ought to go with the men to war, and have the same edu­ <lb/>
            cation as the soldiery; and as to other particulars, he has <lb/>
            filled his treatise with matter foreign to the purpose; and <lb/>
            with respect to education, he has only said what that of the <lb/>
            soldiery ought to be. As to his book of Laws, laws are the <lb/>
            principal thing which that contains, for he has there said but <lb/>
            little concerning government; and though he desired to frame <lb/>
            this government in states, on the principle of a more entire <lb/>
            community, he bends it round again almost to his original <lb/>
            form.1 For, except the community of wives and goods, the <lb/>
            rest he frames alike in both his governments: for the education <lb/>
            of the citizens is to be the same in both, in both are they to <lb/>
            live without any servile employ, and their common tables2 are <note type="footnote"> ' Laws' in order to be convinced that the treatise was never written by <lb/>
            Plato. But the real fact is, that the scope of the two treatises is dire <lb/>
            ferent, and that there is a consequent discrepancy between them in many <lb/>
            points of detail. For in the ' Republic,' the enactments are all of a purely <lb/>
            moral kind, but in the ' Laws' of a penal character likewise. In a polity <lb/>
            such as Plato has framed in his ' Republic,' there would be no need of <lb/>
            any laws whatsoever, for their place would be supplied by a virtuous <lb/>
            education. Now as the ' Laws' are supposed to be written for a state <lb/>
            not merely ideal, but one to be put in practice, we need not be surprised <lb/>
            at finding that in it specific enactments are suggested, relating to cove­ <lb/>
            nants and dealings in trade, which are rejected in the ' Republic,' as being <lb/>
            useless in a well-regulated state. For in the former treatise, the whole <lb/>
            superstructure of a state is supposed to rest on the basis of moral habits. <lb/>
            resulting from a correct education; in the latter the arm of the law is <lb/>
            called upon to restrain by punishment all deviations from a correct moral <lb/>
            conduct." (p. 7—9.) </note><note type="footnote"> 1 From professing to give an outline of a really practical state, he <lb/>

            women also ought to have common tables, and that there <lb/>
            should be a thousand men-at-arms, in the other that there <lb/>
            should be five thousand.1</p>
          <p>All the discourses of Socrates, then, contain <lb/>
            much which is highly wrought and ingenious, <lb/>
            new and curious; but it may probably be hard <lb/>

            the dialogues <lb/>
            of Socrates. <lb/>
            to say that all their contents are true. tor now, with respect <lb/>
            to the numbers just mentioned, it must not be concealed that <lb/>
            he would want the country of Babylonia, or some other like <lb/>
            it of immeasurable extent, to support five thousand idle per­ <lb/>
            sons, besides another and much greater number of women and <lb/>
            servants to attend them. It is true that a man may sketch <lb/>
            out an ideal state as he pleases, but yet it ought to be some­ <lb/>
            thing possible. It is said that when a legislator frames his <lb/>
            laws, he should have two things in view, the country and the <lb/>
            people.3 He will also do well to add to this some <lb/>
            regard to the neighbouring states, if he intends <lb/>
            that his community should maintain any political <lb/>
            Policy as to <lb/>
            neighbouring <lb/>
            states. <lb/>
            intercourse with them; for it is necessary that they should <lb/>
            employ not only those weapons of war which are adapted to <lb/>
            their own land, but those which suit foreign countries also; <lb/>
            for even granting that no one chooses this life either in public <lb/>
            or private, yet, nevertheless, there is occasion for the people <lb/>
            to be formidable to their enemies, not only when they invade <lb/>
            their country, but also when they retire out of it. It should <note type="footnote"> tables relating to the men have been instituted in both a beautiful and, as <lb/>

            those relating to the women have by no means correctly been left un.. <lb/>
            regulated by law; nor has the arrangement of their common tables been <lb/>
            brought to light "This, therefore, to take up and correct, and <lb/>
            to arrange all pursuits in common for women and men, is better for the <lb/>

              also be considered, whether the quantity of property may not <lb/>
              be settled in a different manner, and better too, by more clearly <lb/>
              defining it; for he says that it ought to be large enough for <lb/>
              every one to live moderately, as if any one had said " enough <lb/>
              to live well," which is the most vague expression. Besides, <lb/>
              a man may live moderately and miserably at the same time ; <lb/>
              he had therefore better have laid it down, that they should <lb/>
              live both moderately and liberally; for unless these two con­ <lb/>
              spire, luxury will follow on the one course, and wretchedness <lb/>
              on the other; since these two habits of living are the only <lb/>
              ones which regard the employment of our substance; 1 for it <lb/>
              is not possible for a man to be mild or courageous in the use <lb/>
              of his fortune ; but he may be prudent and liberal; so that <lb/>
              these uses arc the only ones necessarily connected with pro- <lb/>
              As to popula­ <lb/>
              tion. <lb/>
              perty. It is also absurd to render property equal, <lb/>
              and not to provide for the number of the citi­ <lb/>
              zens, but to leave the increase of population un­ <lb/>
              certain ; as if it would regulate itself according to the number <lb/>
              of women who should happen to be childless, let that be what <lb/>
              it may, because this seems now to take place in other states. <lb/>
              But the case of necessity would not happen with the same <lb/>
              certainty in such a state which he proposes, as in those which <lb/>
              now exist; for in these no one actually wants, as the property <lb/>
              is divided amongst the whole body, be its numbers what they <lb/>
              will; but as it could not then be divided, the supernumeraries, <lb/>
              whether they are many or few, must needs have nothing at <lb/>
              all. But one would suppose that it is even more necessary <lb/>
              than the regulation of property, to provide, as to the increase <lb/>
              of numbers, that not more than a certain number should be­ <lb/>
              come parents; and to determine this number by calculating <lb/>
              the chances of those children who will die, and of those women <lb/>
              who will be barren ; and to neglect2 this, as is done in several <note type="footnote"> 1 Coraës rightly reads here, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῷ μὲν</foreign> rb <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρυφᾶν ἀκολουθήσει, τῷ δε</foreign> rb <lb/>

              supports his rendering by a reference below to Aristotle's own words, b. <lb/>
              v. chap. 5, with reference to Heraclea. It would seem that Aristotle, in <lb/>
              objecting to Plato's scheme, on the ground that he has not proposed any </note> <pb n="51"/>
              <note type="margin"> CHAP. VI. </note> <lb/>
              states, is to bring certain poverty on the citizens; and poverty <lb/>
              is the cause of sedition and evil. Now Pheidon the Corinthian, <lb/>
              one of the oldest of legislators, thought that the families and <lb/>
              number of citizens ought to continue the same; although it <lb/>
              should happen that all at the first have allotments dispro­ <lb/>
              portionate to their numbers. In Plato's Laws it is however <lb/>
              different; and we must mention hereafter1 what we think <lb/>
              would be best in these particulars. He has also <lb/>
              neglected in this same book of Laws to point out <lb/>
              how the governors are to be distinguished from <lb/>
              Other omis­ <lb/>
              sions. <lb/>
              the governed; for he says, that as of one sort of wool the <lb/>
              warp ought to be made, and of another the woof, so ought the <lb/>
              governors to be in regard to those who are governed. But <lb/>
              since he admits 2 that all their property may be increased five­ <lb/>
              fold, why should he not allow the same increase to the country <lb/>
              to some extent ? He ought also to consider whether his allot­ <lb/>
              ment of houses will be useful to the community, for he has <lb/>
              appointed two houses to each person, separate from each <lb/>
              other; but it is inconvenient for a person to regulate two <lb/>
              houses. And his whole system of government claims to be <lb/>
              neither a democracy nor an oligarchy, but something between <lb/>
              both, which is generally called a polity,4 for it is to be com­ <lb/>
              posed of men-at-arms. If Plato intended to frame a state, in <lb/>
              which more than in any other every thing should be common, <lb/>
              he has certainly given it a right name; but if he intended it <lb/>
              to be the next in perfection to the best theoretic state,5 it is not <note type="footnote"> measure to guard against an excess of population, has overlooked the fact <lb/>
              that Plato in his Laws (b. v. p. 740) expressly suggests a voluntary co­ <lb/>
              lonization as the great safeguard against any superfluous population in <lb/>
              his ideal city or state. <lb/>
              The following is the substance of the note of Goettling, in loco: <foreign xml:lang="grc">τό δὲ <lb/>
              ἀφε</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">σθαι</foreign>. This is generally rendered as if it meant " to neglect." But <lb/>
              we might very plausibly argue in favour of understanding the words as <lb/>
              referring to " colonization," the remedy proposed by Plato as a means of <lb/>
              carrying off the supernumerary members of the state. See Laws, book v. <lb/>
              10. " Moreover, should any difficulty arise concerning the inequality of <lb/>
              the 5040 households, ..... there remains the old contrivance which <lb/>
              we have often mentioned, of friendly colonies being sent out from friends, <lb/>
              whithersoever it may appear to be suitable." </note><note type="footnote"> 1 This promise Aristotle afterwards redeems in book vii. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See Plato's Laws, v. 744. 3 Ibid. v. 14, 236. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 See below, book vii. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 The polity which was the original object of our inquiry-or that <lb/>

              <note type="margin"> [BOOK II. </note> <lb/>
              so; for perhaps some persons will give the preference to the <lb/>
              Lacedaemonian form of government, or some other which may <lb/>
              more nearly approximate to an aristocracy. Now some per­ <lb/>
              sons say, that the most perfect government should be one <lb/>
              composed of all others blended together, for which reason <lb/>
              they commend that of Lacedasmon ; for some say, that this is <lb/>
              composed of an oligarchy, a monarchy, and a democracy; their <lb/>
              kings representing the monarchical part, their gerusia the <lb/>
              oligarchical; and that in the ephoralty may be found the de­ <lb/>
              mocratical element, as they are taken from the body of <lb/>
              the people. But others assert, that the ephors have absolute <lb/>
              power, and that it is their common meals and daily course of <lb/>
              life, in which the democratic form is represented. It is also <lb/>
              said in this treatise of Laws, that the best form of government <lb/>
              must be one composed of a democracy and a tyranny; though <lb/>
              such a mixture no one would allow to be any government at <lb/>
              all, or, if it is, the worst possible. Those, on the other hand, <lb/>
              propose what is much better, who blend many governments <lb/>
              together; for the most perfect is that which is formed of many <lb/>
              Faults as to the <lb/>
              composition <lb/>
              and election of <lb/>
              the ruling <lb/>
              body. <lb/>
              parts. But now this polity (of Plato's) shows no <lb/>
              traces of a monarchy, but only of an oligarchy and <lb/>
              democracy; and it seems rather to incline towards <lb/>
              an oligarchy, as is evident from the appoint­ <lb/>
              ment of the magistrates; for to choose them by lot, is common <lb/>
              to both ; but the fact that men of fortune must necessarily be <lb/>
              members of the assembly, and elect the magistrates, and take <lb/>
              part in the management of other public affairs, while the rest <lb/>
              are passed over, this makes the state incline to an oligarchy ; <lb/>
              as does the endeavouring that the greater part of the rich <lb/>
              may be in office, and that the rank of their appointments may <lb/>
              correspond with their fortunes. The oligarchic principle <lb/>
              prevails also in the choice of their senate; the manner of <lb/>
              electing which is favourable also to an oligarchy ; for all are <lb/>
              obliged to vote for senators out of the first class, afterwards <lb/>
              for the same number out of the second, and then out of the <lb/>
              third; but this compulsory voting does not extend to all of <note type="footnote"> to be one in which the various forms of government are blended to some <lb/>
              extent, but inclining more nearly to an aristocracy, which, as its name im­ <lb/>
              plies, is based on virtue or merit (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρετή</foreign>). See a few lines below, " Those <lb/>
              on the other hand propose what is much better, who blend many govern­ <lb/>

              the third and fourth classes, but only the first and second <lb/>
              classes out of the entire four.1 By this means, he says, he <lb/>
              ought to show an equal number of each rank elected : but he <lb/>
              is mistaken; for the majority will always consist of the first <lb/>
              rank, and the most considerable people; and for this reason, <lb/>

              attend the elections. From hence it is evident, that such a <lb/>
              state will not consist of a democracy and a monarchy, as well <lb/>
              as from what we shall say when we come particularly to con­ <lb/>
              sider this form of government.</p>
          <p>Danger also will arise from the manner of choosing the <lb/>
            senate, when those who are elected themselves are afterwards <lb/>
            to elect others; for, if a certain number choose to combine <lb/>
            together, though not very considerable, the election will <lb/>
            always fall according to their pleasure. Such are the points <lb/>
            on which Plato touches, concerning his form of government, <lb/>
            in his book of Laws.</p>

          <p>THERE are also certain other forms of govern­ <lb/>
            ment, which have been proposed, some by pri­ <lb/>
            vate persons,3 and some by philosophers and <lb/>
            Other ideal <lb/>
            polities. <lb/>
            politicians, all of which come much nearer than the above to <lb/>
            those which have been really established, or now exist: for <lb/>
            no one else has introduced the innovation of a community of <lb/>
            wives and children, and public tables for the women ; but they <lb/>
            have set out with establishing such points as are absolutely <lb/>
            necessary.</p>
          <p>There are some who think that the first object <lb/>
            of government should be to regulate well every <lb/>
            thing relating to property; for they say, that <lb/>
            herein lies the source of all seditions whatsoever. <lb/>
            That of <lb/>
            Phaleas. <lb/>
            His mode of <lb/>
            equalizing <lb/>
            property. <lb/>
            For this reason, Phaleas the Chalcedonian was the first who <lb/>
            proposed this plan, that the fortunes of the citizens should be <lb/>
            equal. This he thought was not difficult to accomplish when <note type="footnote"> I Bekker reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκ</foreign> rov <foreign xml:lang="grc">τετάρτου τω̃ν τετάρτων</foreign>. But it is necessary to <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [BOOK II. </note> <lb/>
            a community was first settled, but that it was a work of much <lb/>
            difficulty in states which had been long established ; but yet <lb/>
            that an equality might possibly be effected as follows : name­ <lb/>
            ly, that the rich should give marriage portions but never <lb/>
            receive any, while the poor should always receive but never <lb/>
            give them.</p>
          <p>But Plato, in his treatise of Laws,1 thinks that a difference <lb/>
            in circumstances should be permitted to a certain degree; <lb/>
            but that no citizen should be allowed to possess more than five <lb/>
            times as much as the lowest income,2 as we have already men­ <lb/>
            tioned. But one thing ought not to escape the notice of legis­ <lb/>
            lators who would establish this principle, though now they <lb/>
            are apt to overlook it; that while they regulate the quantity <lb/>
            of property belonging to each individual, they ought also to <lb/>
            regulate the number of his children ; for if the number of his <lb/>
            family exceed the allotted quantity of property, the law must <lb/>
            necessarily be repealed ; and yet, apart from such a repeal, <lb/>
            it will have the bad effect of reducing many from wealth to <lb/>
            poverty ; so difficult is it for innovators not to fall into such <lb/>
            mistakes. That an equality of goods has some force to <lb/>
            strengthen political society, seems to have been determined <lb/>
            by some of the ancients; for Solon made a law to this effect; <lb/>
            and also among certain others there is a law restraining per­ <lb/>
            sons from possessing as much land as they please. And upon <lb/>
            the same principle there are laws which forbid men to sell <lb/>
            their property, (as among the Locrians,) unless they can prove <lb/>
            that some notorious misfortune has befallen them. They <lb/>
            were also to preserve their ancient patrimony; and this custom <lb/>
            being broken through among the Leucadians, made their <lb/>
            government too democratic; for by that means it was no <lb/>
            longer necessary to be possessed of a certain fortune, in order <lb/>
            to step into the magistracy. But it is possible that an equal­ <lb/>
            ity of goods is established, and yet that this may be either <lb/>
            too great, when it tends to luxurious living, or too little, when <lb/>
            it obliges them to live hard. Hence it is evident, that it is <lb/>
            not enough for the legislator to establish an equality of cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances, but he must aim at a proper medium. Besides, if <lb/>
            any one should so regulate property, as that there should be <note type="footnote"> 1 See the Laws, book v. ch. 13. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Aristotle is here quoting from memory. In the Laws of Plato, the, <lb/>
            quadruple of a single lot (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κλη̃ϱος</foreign>) is laid down as the extreme limit of <lb/>
            wealth which the legislator ought to tolerate. </note> <lb/>

             <note type="margin"> CHAP. VII. </note> <lb/>
            a moderate sufficiency for all, it would be of no use ; for it is <lb/>
            of more consequence that the citizens should entertain a simi­ <lb/>
            larity of feelings than an equality of property ; but this can <lb/>
            never be, unless they are properly educated under the direction <lb/>
            of the laws. But probably Phaleas may say, that this is what <lb/>
            he himself mentions ; for he thinks that states ought to pos­ <lb/>
            sess an equality of these two things, property and education. <lb/>
            But he should have said particularly what education he in­ <lb/>
            tended ; nor is it of any service to have this one and the same <lb/>
            for all; for this education may be one and the same, and yet <lb/>
            such as will make the citizens over-greedy to grasp after <lb/>
            honours, or riches, or both. Besides, not only an inequality <lb/>
            of possessions, but also one of honours, occasions seditions, <lb/>
            though in a contrary way in either case ; for the vulgar will be <lb/>
            seditious if there be an equality of goods, but those of more <lb/>
            elevated sentiments, if there is an equality of honours; whence <lb/>
            it is said, <lb/>
            " When good and bad do equal honours share." <lb/>
            Homer, II. ix. 319. <lb/>
            For men are not guilty of crimes for necessaries only,-( for <lb/>
            which they think an equality of goods would be a sufficient <lb/>
            remedy, as they would then have no occasion to steal 'for cold <lb/>
            or hunger,)—but that they may enjoy what they desire, and not <lb/>
            wish for it in vain; for if their desires extend beyond the <lb/>
            common necessaries of life, they will do any injustice to gra­ <lb/>
            tify them ; and not only so, but, if they feel a desire, they <lb/>
            will do the same to enjoy pleasures free from pain. 1 What <lb/>
            remedy then shall we find for these three disorders ? For the <lb/>
            first, let every one have a moderate subsistence, and labour <lb/>
            for his living. For the second, let him practise temperance ; <lb/>
            and thirdly, let those who wish for pleasure through them­ <lb/>
            selves, seek for it only in philosophy; for all other pleasures <lb/>
            want the assistance of man. Men, then, are guilty of the <lb/>
            greatest crimes from ambition, and not from necessity ; no <lb/>
            one, for instance, aims at being a tyrant, to keep him from <lb/>
            the cold ; hence great honour is due to him who- kills not a <lb/>
            thief, but a tyrant; 2 so that form of polity which Phaleas <note type="footnote"> I There are three motives of human actions, according to Aristotle in <lb/>
            this passage. 1st, Absolute want (<foreign xml:lang="grc">έπιθυμία τω̃ν ἀναγκαίων</foreign>). 2nd, De. <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [BOOK II </note> <lb/>
            establishes, would only be salutary to prevent little crimes. <lb/>
            He is also very desirous to establish such rules as will tend to <lb/>
            better the internal policy of his state ; but he ought also to <lb/>
            have done the same with respect to its neighbours, and all <lb/>
            foreign nations ; for it is necessary that every government <lb/>
            should be well appointed as to its military force ; but of this <lb/>
            he has said nothing. So also with respect to property; it <lb/>
            ought not only to be adapted to the exigencies of the state, but <lb/>
            also to such dangers as may arise from without. Thus it <lb/>
            should not be so great as to tempt those that are near and <lb/>
            more powerful to invade it, while those who possess it are not <lb/>
            able to drive out the invaders, nor so little as that the state <lb/>
            should not be able to go to war with those who are quite equal <lb/>
            to itself; of this too he has determined nothing ; but it ought <lb/>
            not to be forgotten that some amount of resources is advan­ <lb/>
            tageous to a state. Perhaps, then, the proper boundary is <lb/>
            this ; not to possess enough to make it worth while for a more <lb/>
            powerful neighbour to attack you, any more than those who <lb/>
            have not so much as yourself. Thus when Autophradatus <lb/>
            proposed to besiege Atarneus, Eubulus advised him to con­ <lb/>
            sider what time it would require to take the city, and then <lb/>
            to calculate the expenses of that period; for that he would <lb/>
            be willing for a less sum at once to quit Atarneus : his say­ <lb/>
            ing this made Autophradatus reflect upon the business, and <lb/>
            give over the siege. There is, indeed, some advantage in an <lb/>
            equality of goods, to prevent seditions amongst the citizens ; <lb/>
            and yet, to say the truth, it is no very great one ; for men of <lb/>
            great abilities will be likely to feel hurt at not being reckoned <lb/>
            at their proper worth, and hence they will very often appear <lb/>
            ready for commotion and sedition. For the wickedness of <lb/>
            mankind is insatiable. For though at first two obols might <lb/>
            be sufficient pay, yet when once it is become customary, they <lb/>
            continually want something more, until they set no limits to <lb/>
            their expectations ;1 for it is the nature of our desires to be <lb/>
            boundless, and many live only to gratify them. But for this <note type="footnote"> Athens, who were rewarded with extraordinary honours, for having, as <lb/>
            was supposed, put Hipparchus to death, and so freed their city from <lb/>
            tyranny. See Herod, v. 55 and vi. 123 ; and the acute comment of Thu. <lb/>
            cydides (vi. 55—59) upon the story of the death of Hipparchus. </note><note type="footnote"> I An instance in point would be the " sportula," or dole-baaket, at <lb/>

            purpose, the first object is not so much to establish an equal­ <lb/>
            ity of fortune, as to prevent those who are of a good dispo­ <lb/>
            sition from desiring more than their own, and those who are <lb/>
            of a bad one from being able to acquire it ;1 and this may be <lb/>
            done if they are kept in an inferior station, and not exposed <lb/>
            to injustice. Nor has he treated well one of the <lb/>
            equality of goods; for he has extended his regu­ <lb/>
            lation only to land, whereas a man's substance <lb/>
            His mistakes <lb/>
            in legislation. <lb/>
            consists not only in this, but also in slaves, cattle, money, and <lb/>
            all that variety of things which fall under the name of chat­ <lb/>
            tels. Now there must be either an equality established in all <lb/>
            these, or some certain general rule, or they must be left en­ <lb/>
            tirely at large. It appears too by his laws, that <lb/>
            he intends to establish his state on a small scale, <lb/>
            as all the artificers are to belong to the public, and <lb/>
            will add nothing to the complement of citizens ; <lb/>
            His system <lb/>
            suited only to a <lb/>
            very small <lb/>
            state. <lb/>
            but if all those who are to be employed upon public works <lb/>
            are to be public slaves, it should be done in the same manner <lb/>
            as it is at Epidamnus, and as Diophantus formerly regulated <lb/>
            it at Athens. From these particulars any one may nearly <lb/>
            judge whether Phaleas has said well or ill as to his com­ <lb/>
            munity.</p>

            philosopher, he was the first who, not being actually engaged <lb/>
            in the management of public affairs, took in hand to lay <lb/>
            Its numbers <lb/>
            and divisions. <lb/>
            down what sort or government was best. Ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly he planned his state to consist of ten <lb/>
            thousand persons, and divided into three parts, <lb/>
            one consisting of artisans, the second of husbandmen, and the <lb/>
            third of the military order; he also divided the lands into <lb/>
            three parts, allotting one to sacred purposes, another to the <lb/>
            public, and the third to individuals. The first of these was <lb/>
            to supply what was necessary for the established worship of <lb/>
            the gods; the second was to be allotted to the support of the <lb/>
            soldiery; and the third was to be the property of the bus­ <lb/>
            bandmen. He thought also that there need only be three <lb/>
            sorts of laws, for there are only three matters on account of <lb/>
            which actions can be brought, namely, assault, trespass, or <lb/>
            death. He ordered also that there should be one final court <lb/>
            of appeal, into which all causes were to be removed which <lb/>
            seemed to have been unjustly determined elsewhere ; and this <lb/>
            court he composed out of a body of elders chosen for that <lb/>
            purpose. He thought also that they should not pass sentence <lb/>
            by votes; but that every one should bring with him a tablet, <lb/>
            on which he should write that he found the party guilty, if such <lb/>
            was the case, but that, in case of an acquittal, he should bring <lb/>
            a plain tablet; but if he acquitted him of one part of the in­ <lb/>
            dictment, but not of the other, he should express that also on <lb/>
            the tablet; for he disapproved of the custom already estab­ <lb/>
            lished by law, as obliging the judges to be guilty of perjury if <lb/>
            they determined positively on the one side or the other. He <lb/>

            artisans, the husbandmen, and the soldiery, all <lb/>
            His system <lb/>
            open to many <lb/>
            objections. <lb/>
            are to have a share in the community, while the husband­ <lb/>
            men are to have no arms, and the artisans neither arms <lb/>
            nor land, which would in a manner render them slaves to <lb/>
            the soldiery. It is also impossible that they should all par­ <lb/>
            take of all the posts of honour ; for the generals and the <lb/>
            guardians of the state must necessarily be appointed out of <lb/>
            the soldiery, and indeed, so to say, the most honourable magis­ <lb/>
            trates ; but if the others have not their share in the govern­ <lb/>
            ment, how can they be expected to be friendly disposed <lb/>
            towards it ? But it is necessary that the soldiery should be <lb/>
            superior to the other two parts, and this will not be effected <lb/>
            unless they are very numerous; and if they are so, why <lb/>
            should the community consist of any other members, and <lb/>
            have a right to elect the magistrates ? Besides, of what use <lb/>
            are the husbandmen to this community? Artisans, it is true, <lb/>
            are necessary, for these every city wants, and they can live off <lb/>
            their business as in all other states. If the husbandmen in­ <lb/>
            deed furnished the soldiery with provisions, they would be <lb/>
            properly part of the community; but these are supposed to <lb/>
            have their private property, and to cultivate it for their own <lb/>
            use. Moreover, if the soldiery are themselves to cultivate that <lb/>
            common land which is appropriated for their support, there <lb/>
            will be no distinction between the soldier and the husband­ <lb/>
            man, which the legislator intended there should be; and if <lb/>
            there should be any others besides those who cultivate their <lb/>
            own private property, and the military, there will be a fourth <lb/>
            order in the state, which has no share in it, and will always <lb/>
            be alien from it. But further, if any one should propose that <lb/>
            the same persons should cultivate their own lands and the <lb/>
            public land also, then there would be a deficiency of provisions <lb/>
            to supply two families, as the lands would not immediately <lb/>
            yield enough for themselves and the soldiers also; all these <pb n="60"/>

            Difficulties of <lb/>
            his judicial <lb/>
            system. <lb/>
            things, then, involve great confusion. Neither <lb/>
            is his method of determining causes a good one, <lb/>
            when he would have the judge, in deciding, <lb/>
            split the case which comes simply before him, and thus, <lb/>
            instead of being a judge, become an arbitrator. Now in <lb/>
            matters of arbitration, this is possible to a number of indi­ <lb/>
            viduals ; 1 (for they confer together upon the business that is <lb/>
            before them;) but when a cause is brought before judges it <lb/>
            is not so; but on the contrary, the majority of legislators take <lb/>
            care that the judges shall not communicate their sentiments to <lb/>
            each other. Besides, what can prevent confusion in the de­ <lb/>
            cision, when one judge thinks a fine should be inflicted, but <lb/>
            not so great an one as that which the suitor thinks fit; the <lb/>
            latter proposing twenty minæ, while the judge imposes ten, or <lb/>
            be it more or less, another four, and another five ? It is evi­ <lb/>
            dent then that in this manner they will differ from each <lb/>
            other, some giving the whole damages sued for, and others <lb/>
            nothing; and if so, how shall the determinations of their votes <lb/>
            be settled? Besides, nothing compels a judge to perjure him­ <lb/>
            self who simply acquits or condemns, if the action is fairly <lb/>
            and justly brought; for he who acquits the party, does not <lb/>
            say that he ought not to pay any fine at all, but that he ought <lb/>
            not to pay a fine of twenty minæ. But he that condemns <lb/>
            him is guilty of perjury, if he sentences him to pay twenty <lb/>
            minae, while he believes the damages ought not to be so <lb/>
            high. But with respect to the honours which he proposes to <lb/>
            bestow on those who devise any thing which is useful to the <lb/>
            community, this, though all very pleasing to the ear, is not <lb/>
            safe for the legislator to settle, for it would occasion informers, <lb/>
            and, it may be, commotions too in the state. And this pro- <lb/>
            Further objec­ <lb/>
            tions and diffi­ <lb/>
            culties. <lb/>
            posal of his gives rise also to a further conjecture <lb/>
            and inquiry; for some persons doubt whether it <lb/>
            is useful or hurtful to alter the established laws of <lb/>
            any country, if even it be for the better; for which reason one <lb/>
            cannot immediately accede to what is here said, since it is not <lb/>
            advantageous to alter them. We know indeed, that it is pos­ <lb/>
            sible to propose a remodelling of both the laws and govern­ <lb/>
            ment as a common good; and since we have mentioned this <lb/>
            subject, it may be very proper to enter into a few particulars <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ πλείοσιν</foreign>. On this passage Goettling remarks, " Mihi hæc <lb/>

            foncerning it; for it contains some difficulties, as we have al. <lb/>
            ready said, and it may appear better to alter them, for it has <lb/>
            been found useful in other sciences at all events so to do. <lb/>
            Thus the science of physics is extended beyond its ancient <lb/>
            bounds; so is the gymnastic, and indeed all other arts and <lb/>
            faculties; and hence, since the political science must be held to <lb/>
            be one of them, it is clear that the same thing will necessarily <lb/>
            hold good in its respect. And it may also be affirmed that <lb/>
            experience itself gives a proof of this; for the ancient laws <lb/>
            are too simple and barbarous; for example, the Greeks used <lb/>
            to wear armour in common, 1 and to buy their wives of each <lb/>
            other. And indeed all the remains of old laws which we <lb/>
            have, are very simple; for instance, a law in Cyme relative <lb/>
            to murder, by which if any one, in prosecuting another for <lb/>
            murder, can produce a certain number of witnesses to it of his <lb/>
            own relations, the accused person is to be held guilty of the <lb/>
            crime. But, in a word, all persons ought to endeavour to <lb/>
            follow what is right, and not what is established ; and it is <lb/>
            probable that the first of the human race, whether they <lb/>
            sprung out of the earth, or were saved from some general <lb/>
            calamity, were much in the same state as the vulgar and un­ <lb/>
            learned now, as is affirmed of the aborigines; so that it <lb/>
            would be absurd to continue in the practice of their rules. <lb/>
            Nor is it moreover right to permit written laws always to <lb/>
            remain unaltered; for as in all other sciences, so in politics, <lb/>
            it is impossible that every thing should be expressed in writ­ <lb/>
            ing with perfect exactness; for when we commit a thing to <lb/>
            writing we must use general terms; but in every action there <lb/>
            is something particular to itself, which these may not com­ <lb/>
            prehend ; and hence it is evident, that certain laws will at <lb/>
            certain times admit of alterations. But if we consider this <lb/>
            matter in another point of view, it will appear to be one <lb/>
            which requires great caution; for when the advantage pro­ <lb/>
            posed is trifling, as the accustoming the people <lb/>
            easily to abolish their laws is a bad thing, it is <lb/>
            evidently better to pass over some faults on the <lb/>
            part of both the legislator and the magistrates; <lb/>
            Change of laws <lb/>
            and constitu­ <lb/>
            tion a bad <lb/>
            thing. <lb/>
            for the alterations will not be productive of so much good, as <figure type="illustration">

              <note type="margin"> [BOOK II. </note> <lb/>
              a habit of disobeying the magistrates will be of harm. Be­ <lb/>
              sides, the instance brought from the arts is fallacious; for <lb/>
              it is not the same thing to alter the one as the other. For <lb/>
              a law derives from custom all its power to enforce obedience, <lb/>
              and this requires long time to establish; so that to make it an <lb/>
              easy matter to pass from the established laws to other new <lb/>
              ones, is to weaken the power of laws. And besides, if the <lb/>
              laws are to be altered, are they all to be altered, and in every <lb/>
              government or not ? and shall it be the pleasure of any chance <lb/>
              person, or of whom ? Now all these particulars make a great <lb/>

            ment of Spar­ <lb/>

            Two questions <lb/>
            started.</p>
          <p>BUT the considerations which offer themselves <lb/>
            with respect to the governments established at <lb/>
            Lacedæmon and in Crete, and indeed in all other <lb/>
            states, are two in number ; the one, whether <lb/>
            their laws are laid down well or ill, when com­ <lb/>
            pared with the best form possible: the other, whether there <lb/>
            is any thing in its principles or administration, in any way <lb/>
            opposed to the theory proposed to them.1 Now it is allowed <lb/>
            that the members of every well-regulated state should be <lb/>
            free from servile labour ; but in what manner this shall be <lb/>
            effected, is not easy to determine. For the Penestæ have <lb/>
            very often attacked the Thessalians, and the Helots2 the <note type="footnote"> 1 The questions to be asked here with reference to slavery are two: <lb/>
            a. Is the end good, in comparison with the best possible form of polity ? <lb/>
            b. Do the means succeed in effecting their end ? </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The Helots, a. The object of their institution is sufficiently good; viz. <lb/>
            to enable the citizens to perform the duties of citizenship. <lb/>
            b. The practical working of the system is bad ; for, <lb/>
            1. Like the Penestea of Thessaly, it breeds Helot wars. If the case <lb/>
            be otherwise in Crete, this is to be attributed to its insular position and <lb/>
            the prevalence of the same institution in all its towns ; while Sparta was <lb/>
            surrounded by nations who had no Helotry. <lb/>
            2. It is impossible to associate with them on common terms; if you <lb/>
            oppress them, they rebel; if you treat them with kindness, they grow <lb/>
            insolent. <lb/>
            Muller speaks as follows concerning the Helots. " Their name is de­ <lb/>
            rived (not from the town Helos, but) from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔλω</foreign>, capio—' perhaps those <lb/>
            who were taken after resisting to the uttermost, while the Periœci sur­ <lb/>

            Lacedæmonians; for they in a manner continually <lb/>
            watch an opportunity for some misfortune to be­ <lb/>

            arising from <lb/>
            the Helots. <lb/>
            pened to the Cretans ; the reason for which probably is, that <lb/>
            although the neighbouring cities are engaged in frequent <lb/>
            wars with each other, yet none of them are ready to enter <lb/>
            into alliance with the revolters, as it would be disadvantageous <lb/>
            for themselves who have villains of their own. But there has <lb/>
            been perpetual enmity between the Lacedæmonians and all <lb/>
            their neighbours, the Argives, the Messenians, and the Area­ <lb/>
            dians. Their slaves also, from the very first, have revolted <lb/>
            from2 the Thessalians, while they have been engaged in wars <note type="footnote"> at a very early period, and passed over as slaves to the Dorian conquer­ <lb/>
            ors.' " Dorians, vol. ii. book iii. ch. 3. <lb/>
            1. Political rights of the Helots, a. They were public slaves-not <lb/>
            alienable, even by the state-belonged to the land-had dwellings of their <lb/>
            own-paid rent-got wealth by cultivating the soil, and by plunder in war, <lb/>
            (Herod. ix. 80,)—had little intercourse with their masters, for the Spar­ <lb/>
            tans lived in town-and served as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψιλοὶ</foreign> in war. At Platea 5,000 Spar­ <lb/>
            tans were attended by 35,000 Helots. The Helots in battle were imme­ <lb/>
            diately under the king. (Herod. vi. 80, 81.) Slavery was, in Dorian <lb/>
            states, the basis of commercial prosperity ; but in time of war slaves were <lb/>
            dangerous — <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὥστε</foreign> yap <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐφεδϱεύοντες</foreign> roT, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀτυχήμασι διαελου̃σι</foreign> See <lb/>
            Thucyd. i. 100, 118; v. 14, 23. <lb/>
            b. They could be enfranchised. They served in the fleet with the <lb/>
            Periœci, under the name of <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεσποσιοναυ̃ται</foreign>. After some time they were <lb/>
            called Neodamodes; and the Mothaces, or Mothones, answered to the <lb/>
            Latin " Vernæ," were well treated, and could acquire full citizenship; <lb/>
            for Callicratidas, Gylippus, and Lysander were all of this class. <lb/>
            2. Their treatment has probably been much misrepresented. They <lb/>
            wore a <foreign xml:lang="grc">κυνη̃</foreign>-as the peasants in Homer. (See Odyss. xxiv. 230.) This has <lb/>
            been absurdly understood as a hardship. Plutarch's story we reject as un­ <lb/>
            true ; that they were compelled to get drunk as an example to the Spartan <lb/>
            youth. The Cryptea is also misunderstood; it was not an institution for <lb/>
            murder, but for inspection of roads and fortresses. This we gather from <lb/>
            Plato's Laws, i. p. 633, C. Thucydides, however, (iv. 80,) seems to adhere <lb/>
            to the popular belief. <lb/>
            3. Their number. Thucydides (viii. 40) says that the Lacedaemo­ <lb/>
            nians had the largest body of slaves. Now there were present at <lb/>
            Plataea 5000 Spartans, 35,000 Helots, and 10,000 Periœci. Almost all <lb/>
            the Spartans served in the war, but few Periœci; for the latter had 30,000 <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κλη̃ροι</foreign>, the former 9000. And as there were 8000 Spartans, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν ὅπλοις</foreign>, they <lb/>
            were attended by 56,000 Helots, i. e. by about half their entire number. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 In Crete slaves of the class corresponding to the Helots were called <lb/>
            Aphamiottæ, and at Argos, Gymnesians <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γυμνη̃τες</foreign>). </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Perhaps it would be better to read here <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐφίσταντο</foreign>, as it suits bettel <lb/>

            with their neighbours the Achaeans, the Perrhæbeans, and the <lb/>
            Magnesians. It seems to me indeed, if nothing else, yet a <lb/>
            very troublesome business, to settle how to keep upon proper <lb/>
            terms with them ; for if you are remiss in your discipline, <lb/>
            they grow insolent, and think themselves upon an equality <lb/>
            with their masters ; and if they are hardly used, they are <lb/>
            continually plotting against you, and hate you. It is evident <lb/>
            then, that those who happen to employ slaves, have not as yet <lb/>
            And from the <lb/>
            women. <lb/>
            hit upon the right way of managing them. As to <lb/>
            giving licence to the women, it is hurtful to the <lb/>
            end of government and to the prosperity of the <lb/>
            state; for as a man and his wife are each a part of a family, <lb/>
            it is clear that we must suppose the city to be divided into <lb/>
            two nearly equal parts, namely, into the number of men and <lb/>
            of women. In whatever city, then, the women are not under <lb/>
            good regulations, we must look upon one half of it as not under <lb/>
            the restraint of law. And this actually happened at Sparta; <lb/>
            for the legislator, desiring to make his whole city a collection <lb/>
            of warriors, most evidently accomplished his design with <lb/>
            respect to the men, but in the mean time the women were quite <lb/>
            neglected, for they live without restraint in every improper in­ <lb/>
            dulgence and luxury.1 So that in such a state riches will ne­ <lb/>
            cessarily be in general esteem, particularly if the men chance <lb/>
            to be governed by their wives, which has been the case with <lb/>
            many a brave and warlike people, except the Celts, and those <lb/>
            other nations, if there are any such, who openly approve of <lb/>
            connexion with men. And the first mythologists seem not 5 <lb/>
            without good reason to have joined Mars and Venus to­ <lb/>
            gether ; for all nations of this character appear to be greatly <lb/>
            addicted either to the love of women or of boys; for which <lb/>
            reason it was thus at Lacedæmon; and many things in their <note type="footnote"> 1 " So strange did the influence which the Lacedæmonian women ex­ <lb/>

            state were done by the authority of the women. For what is <lb/>
            the difference, if the power is in their hands, whether the women <lb/>
            rule, or whether the rulers themselves are influenced by their <lb/>
            women ? The same is the result in either case. And as this <lb/>
            boldness of the women can be of no use in any matters of <lb/>
            daily life, if it was ever so, it must be in war; but we find <lb/>
            that the Lacedaemonian women were of the greatest disservice <lb/>
            in this respect, as was proved at the time of the Theban inva­ <lb/>
            sion, when they were of no use at all, as they are in other <lb/>
            cities, but made more disturbance than even the enemy. This <lb/>
            licence which the Lacedæmonian women enjoy is <lb/>
            what might be expected from the first; for the <lb/>
            men were wont to be absent from home for a <lb/>
            How this hap­ <lb/>
            pened. <lb/>
            long time upon foreign expeditions against the Argives, and <lb/>
            afterwards against the Arcadians and Messenians ; so that, <lb/>
            when these wars were at an end, owing to their military life, <lb/>
            in which there is no little virtue, they showed themselves pre­ <lb/>
            pared to obey the precepts of their lawgiver; but we are <lb/>
            told, that when Lycurgus endeavoured to reduce the women <lb/>
            also to an obedience to his laws, upon their refusal, he de­ <lb/>
            sisted from his purpose. The women, then, were the causes <lb/>
            of these results, so that all the fault was theirs. But we are <lb/>
            not now considering for whom we ought to make allowance or <lb/>
            not, but what is right and what is wrong; and when the <lb/>
            manners of the women are not well regulated, as we have al­ <lb/>
            ready said, they are likely not only to occasion discord be­ <lb/>
            tween the various parts of the community, which is dis­ <lb/>
            graceful, but also to increase the love of money. In the next <lb/>
            place, after what has been said, one might find <lb/>
            fault with his unequal division of property ; for <lb/>
            it so happens that some have far too much, <lb/>
            others too little, by which means the land has <lb/>
            the <lb/>
            And from the <lb/>
            bution of pro­ <lb/>
            perty. <lb/>
            come into few hands; and this matter is badly regulated by <lb/>
            his laws. For he made it infamous for any one either to buy <lb/>
            or sell his possessions, and in this he did right; but he per­ <lb/>
            mitted any one that chose it to give them away or bequeath <lb/>
            them, although nearly the same consequences must needs arise <lb/>
            from the one course as from the other. For it is supposed that <lb/>
            nearly two parts in five of the whole country is the property <lb/>
            of women, owing to their being so often heiresses, and having <lb/>
            such large fortunes in marriage; though it would be better to <note type="footnote"> <unclear/></note> <pb n="66"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK II. </note> <lb/>
            allow them none, or a little, or a certain regulated propor­ <lb/>
            tion. Now however every one is permitted to give his <lb/>
            heiress to whomsoever he pleases; and if he dies intestate, he <lb/>
            who succeeds as heir at law gives her to whom he pleases. <lb/>
            Dearth of <lb/>
            population. <lb/>
            Whence it happens that, although the country is <lb/>
            able to support fifteen hundred horse and thirty <lb/>
            thousand foot, the number does not amount even <lb/>
            to one thousand. And from these results it is made evident, <lb/>
            that in this particular the state is badly regulated; for the <lb/>
            city could not support one blow, but was ruined for want of <lb/>
            men.2 They say, that during the reigns of their ancient <lb/>
            kings they used to present foreigners with the freedom of <lb/>
            their city, to prevent there being a want of men while they <lb/>
            carried on long wars; it is also affirmed that the number of <lb/>
            Spartans was formerly ten thousand; but be that true or <lb/>
            false as it may, it is far better to increase the number of the <lb/>
            male population by an equality of property. The law too <lb/>
            which he made to encourage population, was by no means <lb/>
            calculated to correct this inequality; for being willing that <lb/>
            the Spartans should be as numerous as possible, he encouraged <lb/>
            them to have as large families as possible; and to this end <lb/>
            there is a law that he who had three children should be ex­ <lb/>
            empted from the night-watch, and that he who had four <note type="footnote"> 1 It has been suggested that we should here read <foreign xml:lang="grc">τρισχιλίους</foreign>, and not <lb/>

            Hoplites. and at Plataea were double in number to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σπαρτια̃ται</foreign>. The <lb/>
            Spartans were at one time 9000 or even 10,000 in number. The Hop­ <lb/>
            lites from among the Periœci in that case would have amounted to 18,000 <lb/>
            or even 20,000. And this would make the number nearly correct as it <lb/>
            stands here. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 A Spartan was degraded if he could not support himself in his proper <lb/>
            rank. This, combined with exclusive right of marriage between true <lb/>

            The " one blow " alluded to here was the battle of Leuctra, B. c. 371, in <lb/>

            should pay no taxes: 1 though it is very evident, tha. while <lb/>
            the land was divided in this manner, if the people increased, <lb/>
            many of them must be very poor. And further, <lb/>
            the constitution of the Ephoralty is faulty;2 for <lb/>
            these magistrates take cognizance of things of the <lb/>
            Objections <lb/>
            against the <lb/>
            Ephoralty. <lb/>
            last importance, and yet they are chosen out of the people in <lb/>
            general; so that it often happens that very poor <lb/>
            persons chance to be elected to that office, who, <lb/>
            from that circumstance, are easily bought. There <lb/>
            How the <lb/>
            Ephoralty was <lb/>
            democratic. <lb/>
            have been many instances of this formerly, as well as in the <lb/>
            late affair at Andros. For certain men,. being <lb/>
            corrupted with money, went as far as they could <lb/>
            to ruin the city. And, moreover, because their <lb/>
            power was very great and nearly tyrannical, <lb/>
            Difficulties <lb/>
            with regard to <lb/>
            the kings of <lb/>
            Sparta. <note type="footnote">1 Cf. Herod. i. 136. Among the Persians he is most honoured who <lb/>
            has the largest family. And to this day the same law is said to be <lb/>
            observed in some parts of Switzerland. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The establishment of the Ephoralty has been erroneously assigned to <lb/>
            Theopompus, and to Lycurgus, (Herod. i. 65,) but it probably existed <lb/>
            earlier; for we find Ephors in Thera, Cyrene, etc., and under the name of <lb/>
            Cosmi in Crete. It was an office intended to limit the authority of the kings; <lb/>
            though perhaps, in very early times, its chief duty lay in the trial of civil <lb/>
            causes; their very name seems to imply " inspectors,"—perhaps of the <lb/>
            market (Herod. i. 153) ; for " buying and selling " was esteemed honour­ <lb/>
            able, even among the Spartiatæ. Thucyd. v. 34. Herod. vi. 50. <lb/>
            They were elected from the whole body of the people, (oi <foreign xml:lang="grc">τυχόντες</foreign>,) <lb/>
            but not by lot alone (Pol. iv. 15, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μηδεμιὰν κληϱωτὴν ἀϱχήν</foreign>); perhaps by <lb/>
            lot and choice combined. (Plato, Legg. iii. p. 692, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγγὺς τη̃ς κληϱωτη̃ς</foreign>.) <lb/>
            Their powers gradually came to be enlarged; for in all Grecian states, <lb/>
            the civil courts rose in power in proportion as the criminal courts de­ <lb/>
            clined—e. g. the Heliæa and Areopagus at Athens. <lb/>
            They became <foreign xml:lang="grc">κϱίσεων μεγάλων κύϱιοι</foreign>, as Aristotle here states, when <lb/>
            they gained the right of scrutiny (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐυθύνη</foreign>) into the conduct of magistrates; <lb/>
            but they were subjected to it themselves at the end of their year of office. <lb/>
            In time the kings became subject to the Ephors. Cleomenes was tried br <lb/>
            them on a charge of bribery. (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δωϱοδοκία</foreign>. Herod. vi. 82.) They could even <lb/>
            imprison the king, or put him to death. (Th. i. 131.) They conducted their <lb/>
            court with great propriety. (Th. v. 63.) Agis was brought before them <lb/>
            They compelled Anaxandridas to marry a second wife, though polygamy <lb/>
            was contrary to Spartan usage. (Herod. v. 39.) They fined Agesilaus <lb/>
            (Plutarch.) <lb/>
            They punished citizens for indolence, luxurious habits, etc., and pro­ <lb/>
            bably took a part in superintending public education. <lb/>
            They were assessors of the kings in judicial matters, (Herod. vi. <unclear>6</unclear>&amp;' <lb/>
            and they judged according to their own will and pleasure, or rather ac­ <lb/>
            cording to unwritten laws; for Sparta knew no others. As to their ve­ <lb/>
            nality see some remarks in Aristotle's Rhet. iii. 18. </note> <note type="footnote"> r 2 </note> <pb n="68"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK II. </note> <lb/>
            their kings too were obliged to flatter them, which contri­ <lb/>
            buted greatly to hurt the state ; for it was altered from an aris­ <lb/>
            tocracy to a democracy. This magistracy1 is indeed the great <lb/>
            bond which holds the state together; for the people are easy, <lb/>
            knowing that they have a share of the first office in it; so <lb/>
            that whether it took place by the intention of the legislator, <lb/>
            or whether it happened by chance, this is of great service to <lb/>
            their affairs; for in a state which aims at permanency, every <lb/>
            member of it ought to endeavour that each part of the govern­ <lb/>
            ment may be preserved and continue the same. And upon <lb/>
            this principle their kings have always acted, out of regard to <lb/>
            their honour; the wise and good from their attachment to the <lb/>
            senate, a seat wherein. they consider as the reward of virtue ; <lb/>
            and the common people, that they may support the ephors, <lb/>
            for the latter are chosen from the entire body. And it is <lb/>
            proper that these magistrates should be chosen out of the <lb/>
            whole community, but not in the way which is customary at <lb/>
            present, for it is very ridiculous. The ephors are the supreme <lb/>
            judges in cases of the last consequence; but, as they are per­ <lb/>
            sons taken at chance from the people, it is not right that they <lb/>
            should determine according to their own opinion, but by <lb/>
            written law or established customs.2 Their way of life also <lb/>
            is not consistent with the will of the city, for it is too indul­ <lb/>
            gent ; whereas that of the others tends to too great severity, <lb/>
            so that they cannot support it, but privately act contrary to <lb/>
            the law and enjoy sensual pleasures. There are also great de­ <lb/>
            fects in the institution of their senators. If indeed they were <lb/>
            of a kind disposition, fitly trained to manly virtue, every one <lb/>
            would readily admit that they would be useful to the govern­ <lb/>
            ment ; but still it might be debated, whether they should con­ <lb/>
            tinue judges for life, to determine points of the greatest <lb/>
            moment, since the mind has its old age as well as the body; <lb/>
            but as they are so brought up that even the legislator could <lb/>
            not depend upon them as good men,3 their power must be far <note type="footnote"> 1 The Ephoralty was established at Sparta by Lycurgus; its powers <lb/>
            were extended by Theopompus. The Ephors were elected out of the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δη̃μος</foreign>, and to a great extent resembled the Tribunes of the people in the <lb/>
            Roman commonwealth. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 In defence of the Dorian policy, Muller says that there were no writ­ <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CHAP. IX.] </note> <lb/>
            from safe: for it is known that the members of toat body have <lb/>
            been guilty of taking bribes, and of much partiality in public <lb/>
            affairs. For this reason it had been much better if they had <lb/>
            been made responsible for their conduct, which they are not. <lb/>
            But it may be said that the ephors seem to have a check upon <lb/>
            all the magistrates. This power indeed is far too great a pri­ <lb/>
            vilege ; but I affirm that they should not be intrusted with this <lb/>
            control in the manner in which they are. Moreover, the mode <lb/>
            of choice which they make use of at the election of their sen­ <lb/>
            ators is very childish. Nor is it right for any one about to be <lb/>
            elected to office to solicit a place ; for every person who is fit <lb/>
            to hold office, whether he chooses it or not, ought to be elected. <lb/>
            But his intention was evidently the same in this, as in the <lb/>
            other parts of his government. For making his citizens am­ <lb/>
            bitious after honours, he has employed persons of that dispo­ <lb/>
            sition in the election of his senate, since no others will solicit <lb/>
            that office; and yet the principal part of those crimes of <lb/>
            which men are deliberately guilty, arise from ambition and <lb/>
            avarice. We will inquire at another time whether the kingly <lb/>
            office is useful to the state or not: but thus much is certain, <lb/>
            that they should be chosen, not as they are now, but from a <lb/>
            consideration of their individual conduct. But that the legis­ <lb/>
            lator himself did not expect to make all his citizens completely <lb/>
            virtuous, is evident from the fact, that he distrusts them as <lb/>
            not being sufficiently good men; for he sent out enemies upon <lb/>
            the same embassy, and thought that dissensions between the <lb/>
            kings were the very safety of the state. Neither <lb/>
            were their common meals, called Pheidittia,1 well <lb/>
            arranged by him who first established them: for <lb/>
            Tendency of <lb/>
            the public <lb/>
            tables. <lb/>
            the table should rather have been provided at the public ex­ <lb/>
            pense, as at Crete; whereas at Lacedæmon every one was <lb/>
            obliged to contribute his portion, although he might be very <lb/>
            poor and could by no means bear the expense. By this <lb/>
            means the contrary happened to what the legislator desired : <lb/>
            for he intended that the appointment of those public meals <lb/>
            should strengthen the democratic element; but arranged as it <lb/>
            was by him, it had far from a democratic tendency; for those <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare the statement of Plutarch, Lye. 12. " The Lacedæmonians <lb/>

            who were very poor could not take part in them ; and the limit <lb/>
            of the state was laid down by their forefathers, that whoever <lb/>
            could not contribute his proportion to the common tables <lb/>
            should have no share in them. Other persons have censured <lb/>
            his law concerning the office of High Admiral, and not with­ <lb/>
            out reason, as it gave rise to disputes. For the office of admi­ <lb/>
            ral is in opposition to the kings, who are generals of the army, <lb/>
            and being for life, becomes, as it were, a second monarchy. And <lb/>
            in this respect, too, one might censure the theory of the legis­ <lb/>
            lator, as Plato has done in his Laws; the whole arrangement <lb/>
            of the constitution is calculated only for the business of war, <lb/>
            Sparta a mili­ <lb/>
            tary state, and <lb/>
            could live only <lb/>
            in war. <lb/>
            for it is excellent to make them conquerors. And <lb/>
            this is the reason why the state survived as long <lb/>
            as they were at war, but began to perish as soon <lb/>
            as they gained sway: for they knew not how to <lb/>
            be idle, or to engage in any other employment more proper than <lb/>
            war. In this also they were no less mistaken, that they thought <lb/>
            rightly enough that those things which are objects of conten­ <lb/>
            tion, are better procured by virtue than by vice ; yet they <lb/>
            wrongfully supposed the things themselves to be preferable to <lb/>
            virtue. Nor was the public revenue well managed at Sparta; <lb/>
            for the state had nothing in its coffers while it was obliged <lb/>
            to carry on extensive wars, and the subsidies were badly <lb/>
            raised; for as the Spartans possessed a large extent of country, <lb/>
            they were obliged to look closely to each other, as to what <lb/>
            they paid in. And thus an event took place contrary to the <lb/>
            prudent design of the legislator; for he made the state poor, <lb/>

          <p>THE form of government in Crete1 bears a near resem., <lb/>
            blance to this; in some few particulars it is not worse, but <note type="footnote"> 1 " In Crete the constitution founded on the principles of the Doric <lb/>
            race, was first moulded into a firm and consistent shape, but even in a <lb/>
            more simple manner than in Sparta at a subsequent period. Thus Ly­ <lb/>
            curgus was able, without forcing any foreign usages upon Sparta, to take <lb/>
            for a model the Cretan institutions, which had been more fully deve­ <lb/>
            loped at an earlier period ; so that the constitutions of Crete and Sparta <lb/>
            had from that time, as it were, a family resemblance." Müller's Dorians, <lb/>
            vol. ii. chap. i. 8. </note> <pb n="71"/>
            <note type="margin"> OHAP. X.] </note> <lb/>
            in general it is less skilfully contrived. For it <lb/>
            appears, and is said, that in most particulars <lb/>
            the constitution of Lacedaemon was formed in <lb/>
            imitation of that of Crete; and in general most <lb/>
            The govern­ <lb/>
            ment of Crete <lb/>
            resembles the <lb/>
            Spartan. <lb/>
            old things are less compactly put together than new ones. <lb/>
            For they say, that when Lycurgus ceased to be guardian to <lb/>
            King Charilaus, he went abroad, and spent a long time with <lb/>
            his relations in Crete. For the Lycians are a colony of the <lb/>
            Lacedaemonians ; and those who first settled there adopted <lb/>
            that body of laws which they found already established by the <lb/>
            inhabitants; in like manner also, those who now live near <lb/>
            them have the very laws which they had when Minos first <lb/>
            drew out his system of a state. This island seems formed by <lb/>
            nature to be the mistress of Greece, for it lies across the en­ <lb/>
            tire length of the sea, around which nearly all the Greeks are <lb/>
            settled ; and it is not far distant on the one side from Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnesus, on the other, which looks toward Asia, from Trio­ <lb/>
            pi um and Rhodes. Hence Minos acquired the empire of the <lb/>
            sea and of the islands, some of which he subdued, and others <lb/>
            he colonized :2 at last he died at Camicus while he was at­ <lb/>
            tacking Sicily. There is this analogy between the customs of <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonians and the Cretans, the Helots cultivate the <lb/>
            grounds for the one, the serfs for the other.3 Both states too <note type="footnote"> 1 Comp. infr. book vii. chap. 10. 2 Comp. Thucyd. i. chap. 8. </note><note type="footnote">a " In this island, several different classes of dependants existed. <lb/>
            Sosicrates speaks of three classes, the public bondsmen, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κοινὴ δουλεία</foreign>, <lb/>
            called by Cretans <foreign xml:lang="grc">μνοία</foreign>,) the slaves of individual citizens, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφαμιω̃ται</foreign>,) <lb/>
            and the Periœci (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπήκοοι</foreign>). Now we know that the Aphamiotæ re­ <lb/>
            ceived their name from the cultivation of the lands of private individuals, <lb/>
            (in Crete called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφαμίαι</foreign>,) and accordingly were agricultural bondsmen. <lb/>
            These latter are identical with the Clarotae, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κληϱω̃τοι</foreign>).... They were <lb/>
            bondsmen belonging to the individual citizens, and both the Clarotae and <lb/>
            Aphamiotæ have therefore been correctly compared with the Helots: and as <lb/>
            the latter were entirely distinct from the Lacedaemonian Periœci, so were <lb/>
            the former from the Cretan, though Aristotle neglects the distinction <lb/>
            accurately observed by Cretan writers. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">μνοία</foreign>, by more precise his­ <lb/>
            torians, was distinguished as well from the constitution of the Periœci as <lb/>
            from that of private bondage, and it was explained to mean a state of <lb/>
            public vassalage. Hence we may infer that every state in Crete was pOSe <lb/>
            sessed of public lands, which the Mnotæ cultivated in the same relative <lb/>
            situation to the community as that in which the Aphamiotae, who culti­ <lb/>
            vated the allotted estates, stood to the several proprietors. Finally, the <lb/>
            Periœci in Crete, as in Laconia, formed dependent and tributary commu­ <lb/>
            nities ; and their tribute, like the produce of the national lands, was partly <lb/>
            applied to the public banquets." (Miiller's Dorians, ibid.) </note> <pb n="72"/>

            have their common meals, and the Lacedæmonians called these <lb/>
            formerly not <foreign xml:lang="grc">φειδίττα</foreign>, but "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ανδια</foreign>, as the Cretans do ; which <lb/>
            proves whence the custom arose. In this particular their <lb/>
            governments are also alike: the ephors have the same power <lb/>
            with those who are called Cosmi in Crete;1 with this differ­ <lb/>
            ence only, that the number of the one is five, of the other ten. <lb/>
            The senators are the same as those whom the Cretans call the <lb/>
            council There was formerly also a kingly power in Crete , <lb/>
            The Cosmi. <lb/>
            but it was afterwards dissolved, and the command <lb/>
            of their armies belongs to the Cosmi. Every one <lb/>
            also has a vote in their public assembly; but this has only <lb/>
            the power of confirming what has already been passed by the <lb/>
            The public <lb/>
            tables. <lb/>
            council and the Cosmi. The Cretans conducted <lb/>
            their public meals better than the Lacedæmonians, <lb/>
            for at Lacedaemon each individual was obliged to <lb/>
            furnish what was assessed upon him ; and if he could not <lb/>
            do this, there was a law which deprived him of the rights of <lb/>
            a citizen, as has been already mentioned: but in Crete they <lb/>
            were furnished by the community ; for all the corn and cat­ <lb/>
            tle, taxes and contributions, which the domestic slaves were <lb/>
            obliged to furnish, were divided into parts, and allotted to <lb/>
            the gods, the public services of the state, and these public <lb/>
            meals ; so that all the men, women, and children were main­ <lb/>
            tained from a common stock. The legislator gave many minute <lb/>
            regulations to encourage a habit of eating sparingly, as being <lb/>
            very useful to the citizens. In regard to the marriage of the <lb/>
            women also, he provided that they should not be too prolific, <lb/>
            by introducing the love of boys: whether in this he did well <lb/>
            or ill we shall have some other opportunity of considering.2 <lb/>
            But that the public meals were better ordered at Crete than <lb/>
            at Lacedæmon is very evident. The institution of the Cosmi <note type="footnote"> 1 " What the Dorians endeavoured to obtain in the state was good order, <lb/>
            or <foreign xml:lang="grc">κόσμος</foreign>, the regular combination of different elements. The expression <lb/>
            of King Archidamus, (Thucyd. ii. 11,) that " it is most honourable and <lb/>
            most secure for many persons to show themselves obedient to the same <lb/>
            order," (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κόσμος</foreign>,) was a fundamental principle with this race.... For <lb/>
            this reason, the supreme magistrate among the Cretans was called Cosmos. <lb/>
            ... Thus this significant word expresses the spirit of the Dorian govern. <lb/>
            ment, as well as of the Dorian music and philosophy." (Müller, ubi supr.) </note><note type="footnote"> 2 He refers to book vii. chap. 16, sub fin. For a discussion as to the <lb/>
            real state of the case, in regard to this matter, the reader may refer with <lb/>
            advantage to Miiller's Dorians, vol. ii. chap. iv. 6. </note> <pb n="73"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. X.] </note> <lb/>
            was still worse than that of the ephors : for the faults incident <lb/>
            to that magistracy belong to the former also; for in both cases <lb/>
            it is uncertain who will be elected: but the Lacedæmonians <lb/>
            have this advantage which the others have not, that as the <lb/>
            election is made from the whole body, the people have a share <lb/>
            in the highest honours, and therefore all desire to preserve <lb/>
            the state: whereas among the Cretans, the Cosmi are not <lb/>
            chosen out of the people in general, but out of some certain <lb/>
            families, and the senate out of those who have served as Cosmi. <lb/>
            And the same observations which have been made on the <lb/>
            senate at Lacedaemon, may be applied to these; for their <lb/>
            being irresponsible, and elected for life, is an honour greater <lb/>
            than they merit; and to rule, not according to a written law, <lb/>
            but at their own discretion, is dangerous. (As to there being <lb/>
            no insurrections, though the people share not in the manage­ <lb/>
            ment of public affairs, this is no proof of a well-constituted <lb/>
            government, for the Cosmi have no opportunity of being bribed <lb/>
            like the ephors, as they live in an island far from those who <lb/>
            would corrupt them.) But the method they take to correct <lb/>
            that fault is absurd, at variance with civil equality, and tyran­ <lb/>
            nical ; for very often either their fellow magistrates or some <lb/>
            private persons conspire together and turn out the Cosmi; <lb/>
            they are also permitted to resign their office before their time <lb/>
            is elapsed.1 Now it would be better if all this was done by <lb/>
            law, and not at the pleasure of the individuals, which is a bad <lb/>
            rule to follow. But what is worst of all, is that general con­ <lb/>
            fusion which those who are in power often introduce, when i <lb/>
            they wish to impede the course of justice ; which sufficiently <lb/>
            shows that the government has some properties of a polity, <lb/>
            but in reality is rather a tyranny. And it is usual with the <lb/>
            principal persons amongst them to collect together apart some <lb/>
            of the common people and their friends, and then to set up for <lb/>
            themselves, and sow seditions, and to come to blows with each <lb/>
            other. And what is the difference, if such be the case, or if <lb/>
            the state gradually alters in process of time, and becomes no <lb/>
            longer the same constitution ? A state like this will ever be <note type="footnote"> 1 The institutions relating to the Cosmi in Crete were at variance with <lb/>

            the serfs still remain quiet at Crete, while the Helots are per­ <lb/>

            affairs, and it is but lately that any foreign attack has been <lb/>

          <p>THE Carthaginians, too, seem to enjoy a good <lb/>
            form of government, and in many respects su­ <lb/>
            perior to the rest; and in some particulars it <lb/>
            bears a near resemblance to the Lacedaemonians. <lb/>
            And indeed, these three states, the Cretans, the Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians, and the Carthaginians, are in some things very <lb/>
            like each other; in others they differ greatly, and many of <lb/>
            their arrangements are excellent. And this is a proof of a <lb/>
            well-constituted government, if it admits the people to a <lb/>
            share, and still remains unaltered in its form of polity, <lb/>
            without any popular insurrection worth notice on the one <lb/>
            hand, or growing into a tyranny on the other. Now the <note type="footnote"> I On the Dorian constitution, Müller writes as follows: " An unity of <lb/>
            this kind having been once established, their next object is to remove <lb/>
            whatever has a tendency to destroy it, and to repress all causes which <lb/>
            might lead to a change : yet an attempt to exclude all alteration is never <lb/>
            completely successful; partly on account of the internal changes which <lb/>
            take place in the national character, and partly because causes operating <lb/>
            from without, will necessarily produce some modifications... Those states <lb/>
            which never admit of innovation, will at last, after having long stood as <lb/>
            ruins in a foreign neighbourhood, yield to the general tide of human <lb/>
            affairs, and their destruction is commonly preceded by the most complete <lb/>
            anarchy." Derians, vol. ii. p. 2, 3. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The reader will do well, in reading the following chapter, to consult <lb/>

            Carthaginians, in common with the Lacedaemonians, have <lb/>
            public tables for those who are bound together by companion­ <lb/>
            ship, answering to their Phiditia ; they have also their magis­ <lb/>
            tracy consisting of a hundred and four persons, <lb/>
            similar to the ephors, but chosen on a better plan; <lb/>
            for there they are chosen from the common herd, <lb/>
            The Hundred <lb/>
            and Four. <lb/>
            but at Carthage they are chosen out of those of the better <lb/>
            sort ;1 the kings and the senate also, these answer <lb/>
            to the kings and senate at Sparta; but it is better <lb/>
            The kings. <lb/>
            to appoint their kings (as at Carthage) without confining them­ <lb/>
            selves to one family, or choosing from any common stock : but <lb/>
            if there be any persons of greater merit than the rest, from <lb/>
            these they prefer to choose rather than on account of age :2 <lb/>
            for as they are invested with supreme power over many <lb/>
            things, if they are persons of no account, they become very <lb/>
            hurtful to the state, as they have ere this been to the Lace­ <lb/>
            daemonians. Now the greater part of those points which might <lb/>
            be blamed in their deviations, are common to all those go­ <lb/>
            vernments which we have described; but as to this abstract <lb/>
            form of their aristocratic polity, some parts of it incline to a <lb/>
            democracy, others an oligarchy. For instance, the kings and <lb/>
            the senate, if they are unanimous upon any point, can choose <lb/>
            whether they will bring it before the people or no ; but if they <lb/>
            disagree, the people must decide. But whatever they may <lb/>
            introduce to its notice, it belongs to the people not only to <lb/>
            hear what has been approved of by the senate, but finally to <lb/>
            ratify it: and whosoever chooses has a right to speak against <note type="footnote"> below, book v. ch. 12.) We can only reconcile the apparent discrepancy <lb/>
            between these two statements, by understanding, with Dr. Arnold, that <lb/>
            this tyranny, of which our author speaks, must have taken place in the <lb/>
            earlier times of Carthaginian history, before the existence of that consti­ <lb/>

            port their dignity, or to have leisure for public business. <lb/>
            Accordingly, as the electing men by their fortune makes a <lb/>
            state incline to an oligarchy, and to elect them by ability, <lb/>
            to an aristocracy, so is there a third method of proceeding, <lb/>
            according to which matters are regulated in the polity of <lb/>
            Carthage; for they have an eye to these two particulars when <lb/>
            they elect their officers, and particularly those of the highest <lb/>

            admit that this deviation of the state from an <lb/>
            aristocracy was a great fault in their legislator; <lb/>
            for this is a most necessary thing to provide for from the <lb/>

            For this principle makes riches of more account than virtue, <lb/>
            and causes the state to grow avaricious : for whatever those <lb/>
            who have the chief power regard as honourable, the opinion of <lb/>
            the citizens necessarily follows in their wake ; and where the <lb/>
            first honours are not paid to virtue, there the aristocratic form <lb/>
            of government cannot flourish firmly : for it is reasonable to <lb/>
            conclude, that those who bought their places should make an <lb/>
            advantage of it, when they gain their offices by purchase; as <lb/>
            it is absurd to suppose that if a man of probity is poor, and <lb/>
            still desires to gain something, a bad man will not wish to do <lb/>
            the same, to reimburse himself; for which reason the magis­ <lb/>
            tracy should be formed of those who are most able to support <lb/>
            an aristocracy. It would have been better if the legislator had <lb/>
            passed over the poverty of men of merit, only taking care that <lb/>
            in office they should have sufficient leisure to attend to public <lb/>
            affairs. It seems also improper, that one person <lb/>
            should execute several offices, which is approved of <lb/>

            not to appoint the same person a musician and a shoemaker: <lb/>
            so that where the state is not small, it is more politic and more <lb/>
            popular to admit many persons to have a share in the govern­ <lb/>

            every thing is'better and sooner accomplished, when done by <lb/>
            the same persons: and this is evident both in the army and <lb/>
            navy, where almost every one, in his turn, both commands and <lb/>

            but this is depending on chance; whereas the legislator ought <lb/>
            so to frame his government that there can be no room for insur­ <lb/>

          <p>SOME of those persons who have written upon government <lb/>
            are men who never had a share in public affairs, but always <lb/>
            led a private life; and nearly every thing worthy of notice in <lb/>
            their works we have already spoken about. Others have been <lb/>
            legislators, some in their own cities, and some of them em­ <lb/>
            ployed in regulating the governments of foreign states. Some <lb/>
            of them were merely composers of a body of laws; others <lb/>
            Solon and <lb/>
            other legisla­ <lb/>
            tors. <lb/>
            The Athenian <lb/>
            constitution <lb/>
            combines the <lb/>
            three elements <lb/>
            together. <lb/>
            The Arcopa­ <lb/>
            gus. <lb/>
            formed the constitution also, as Lycurgus and <lb/>
            Solon, who were the authors both of laws and of <lb/>
            a polity. The Lacedaemonians have already been <lb/>
            mentioned. Some persons think that Solon was <lb/>
            an excellent legislator, in that he dissolved a pure <lb/>
            oligarchy, and saved the people from their state of <lb/>
            slavery, and established the ancient democratic <lb/>
            form of government in his country, thus blending <lb/>
            the whole system well together. In the senate <lb/>
            of Areopagus, the oligarchic element was pre­ <lb/>
            served ; by the manner of electing their magistrates, the axis- <note type="footnote"> 1 Goettling rejects the whole of this last chapter as spurious. It certain­ <lb/>
            ly contains a quantity of useless repetitions, and its style is very puerile ; <lb/>
            and especially is it void of all connexion. For example, the story of Phi­ <lb/>
            lolaus and Diodes is entirely out of place, and is connected neither with <lb/>
            what goes before nor with what follows. And the Equites (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱππει̃ς</foreign>) con­ <lb/>
            stituted not the third but the second rank in the timocracy of Athens, as <lb/>
            settled by Solon. Goettling also remarks sundry uses of words and forms <lb/>
            of expression, very unlike those adopted by Aristotle. And for these <lb/>
            reasons we are at liberty to condemn the chapter as spurious; it is pro­ <lb/>
            bably the work of some commentator, embodying some of his own Adver­ <lb/>
            saria. </note> <pb n="79"/>

            tocratic; and in their courts of justice, the democratic. So­ <lb/>
            lon, too, seems not to have altered the established form of <lb/>
            government, either with respect to the senate, or the mode of <lb/>
            electing their magistrates ; but to have raised the people to <lb/>
            great consideration in the state, by electing the supreme courts <lb/>
            from all the citizens : and for this some persons blame him, as <lb/>
            having overturned the balance of power, by making the popular <lb/>
            assembly, chosen as it was by lot, supreme. For as soon as the <lb/>
            latter grew strong, it became necessary to flatter a tyrannical po­ <lb/>
            pulace : and so they brought the government to its present form <lb/>
            of a democracy. Both Ephialtes and Pericles abridged the <lb/>
            power of the Areopagus, the latter of whom introduced the <lb/>
            method of paying those who attended the courts of justice :1 <lb/>
            and thus every popular leader went on increas­ <lb/>
            ing the power of the people to what we now see <lb/>
            it. But it is evident that this was not according <lb/>

            pular power. <lb/>
            to the intention of Solon, but that it arose from accident; for <lb/>
            the people, being the cause of the naval supremacy in the <lb/>
            Persian war, grew proud, and enlisted themselves under fac­ <lb/>
            tious demagogues, although opposed by the better part of the <lb/>
            citizens. Solon, indeed, seems to have intrusted the people <lb/>
            with the most necessary part of power, the choice of their <lb/>
            magistrates, and the right of calling them to account; for with­ <lb/>
            out these powers the people must have been slaves and ene­ <lb/>
            mies to the rest. But he elected to the magistracy <lb/>
            none but persons of good account and property, <lb/>

              Other legisla­ <lb/>
              tors. <lb/>
              mechanics, they were incapable of any office. Za­ <lb/>
              leucus was the legislator of the western Locrians, <lb/>
              as was Charondas the Catanean of his own cities, <lb/>
              and of the Chalcidian cities also in Italy and Sicily. Some per­ <lb/>
              sons endeavour to prove that Onomacritus the Locrian was the <lb/>
              first person of note who drew up laws; and that he employed <lb/>
              himself in that business while he was at Crete, where he con­ <lb/>
              tinued some time to learn the prophetic art: and they say, that <lb/>
              Thales was his companion; and that Lycurgus and Zaleucus <lb/>
              were disciples of Thales, and Charondas of Zaleucus; but <lb/>
              those who advance this, speak without due regard to chrono­ <lb/>
              logy. Philolaus also, a Corinthian, and of the family of the <lb/>
              Bacchiadae, was a Theban legislator. This man was very fond <lb/>
              of Diodes, a victor in the Olympic games, and when he left <lb/>
              his country from a disgust at an improper passion which his <lb/>
              mother Alcyone had entertained for him, and settled at Thebes, <lb/>
              Philolaus followed him, where they both died, and where they <lb/>
              still show their tombs placed in view of each other, but so dis­ <lb/>
              posed, that one of them is in sight of Corinth, the other not; <lb/>
              the reason they give for this is, that Diodes, from his detest­ <lb/>
              ation of his mother's passion, would have his tomb so placed <lb/>
              that no one could see Corinth from it; but Philolaus chose <lb/>
              that it might be seen from his: and this was the cause of their <lb/>
              living at Thebes. As Philolaus gave them laws concerning <lb/>
              many other things, so did he upon the rearing of children, <lb/>
              which they call Laws of Adoption ;1 and this he did in a man­ <lb/>
              ner peculiar to himself, to preserve the number of families. <lb/>
              But Charondas did nothing new, except in actions for perjury, <lb/>
              which he was the first person who took into particular con­ <lb/>
              sideration. He also drew up his laws with greater accuracy <lb/>
              than even any of our present legislators. Philolaus introduced <lb/>
              the law for the equal distribution of goods; Plato, that for the <note type="footnote"> I Upon the words of Aristotle (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμοι θετικοί</foreign>) Thirlwall remarks, that <lb/>

              tables for the women ; and besides the law concerning drunk­ <lb/>
              enness, that the sober should preside at their symposiums. <lb/>
              He also made a law concerning their warlike exercises, that <lb/>
              they should acquire the habit of using both hands alike, as it <lb/>
              was necessary that one hand should be as useful as the other. <lb/>
              There are also laws by Draco, but they were published when <lb/>
              the government was already established, and they have no­ <lb/>
              thing particular in them worth mentioning, except their seve­ <lb/>
              rity on account of the greatness of their punishments. Pitta­ <lb/>
              cus, too, was the author of some laws, though he never drew <lb/>
              up any form of government; a peculiar one of which was <lb/>
              this, that if drunken men beat any person, they should be <lb/>
              punished more than if they did it when sober; for as people <lb/>
              are more apt to be abusive when drunk than when sober, he <lb/>
              paid no consideration to the excuse which drunkenness might <lb/>
              claim, but regarded only the common benefit. Andromadas of <lb/>
              Rhegium was also a lawgiver among the Thracian Chalcidians. <lb/>
              There are some laws of his concerning murders, and heiresses, <lb/>
              but these contain nothing that any one can say is his own. <lb/>

            What a state is<lb/>
            question, " What is a state?" For upon this point there is <lb/>
            a dispute: for some persons say, the state did this or that, <lb/>
            while others say it was not the state, but the oligarchy, or the <lb/>
            tyrant.1 We see, too, that the state is the only object which <lb/>
            both the politician and legislator have in view in all they do; <lb/>
            but government is a certain ordering of those who live as <note type="footnote"> I Thus the Thebans (Thucyd. iii. 62) plead that the rise of a dynasty <unclear/> <lb/>

            To answer this, <lb/>
            we must first <lb/>
            find out what <lb/>
            is a citizen. <lb/>
            members of a state. Now since a state is a col­ <lb/>
            lective body, and, like other wholes, composed of <lb/>
            many parts, it is evident that our first point must <lb/>
            be to inquire what a citizen is : for a state or city <lb/>
            is a certain number of citizens.1 So that we must consider <lb/>
            whom we ought to call a citizen, and who is one; for this is <lb/>
            often doubtful: for every one will not allow that this charac­ <lb/>
            ter is applicable to the same person; for that man who would <lb/>
            be a citizen in a republic, would very often not be one in an <lb/>

            tion by some chance means or other, as natural­ <lb/>
            ized citizens, for instance, we must pass them by. <lb/>
            Now it is not residence which constitutes a man a citizen; <lb/>
            for in this point sojourners and slaves are upon an equality <lb/>
            with him. Nor will it be sufficient that he have the privi­ <lb/>
            lege of the laws, and may plead or be impleaded; for this <lb/>
            point belongs to all who have a mutual agreement upon which <lb/>
            to associate ; for these privileges are theirs also; and withal <lb/>
            it very often happens that sojourners have not perfect rights <lb/>
            therein, but are obliged to apply to some patron;2 and this <lb/>
            shows that their share in the community is incomplete. In <lb/>
            like manner, with respect to boys, who are not yet enrolled, or <lb/>
            old men, who are discharged from service, we admit that they <lb/>
            are in some respects citizens, yet not completely so; but we <lb/>
            add some qualification, for the one are not of full age, and the <lb/>
            others are past service; nor is there any difference between <lb/>
            them. But what we mean is sufficiently clear; we want a <lb/>
            complete citizen, one in whom there is no such defect as needs <lb/>
            to be corrected in order to make him fully so. As to those <lb/>
            who are banished or degraded, there may be made the same <note type="footnote"> 1 What Aristotle here means is, not that a <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόλις</foreign> is adequately defined <lb/>
            by the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλη̃θος πολιτω̃ν</foreign>, but that as it is made up of certain com­ <lb/>
            ponent parts, which are citizens, we must first accurately lay down our <lb/>
            definition of a citizen (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πολίτης</foreign>) before we come to discuss the definition <lb/>
            of a state (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πόλις</foreign>). To apply the well-known argument of Butler, (Pref. to <lb/>
            Sermons,) every <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόλις</foreign> is a system; that is, " not only a whole made up of <lb/>
            several parts, but such a whole made up of parts which have a mutual <lb/>
            relation to each other, and are conducive to some end." And this end <lb/>
            must be taken into account before we can be said to have an adequate <lb/>
            idea of the nature of a <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόλις</foreign>. See Eth. Nicom. ix. 10, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ</foreign> yap <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκ δέκα <lb/>

            objections, and the same answers. There is nothing that <lb/>
            more characterizes a. complete citizen than caving <lb/>
            a share in the judicial- and executive part of the <lb/>
            government. With respect to offices, some are <lb/>
            fixed to a particular time, so that no person on any <lb/>
            A citizen is one <lb/>
            who has a <lb/>
            share in the <lb/>
            government of <lb/>
            the state. <lb/>
            account is permitted to fill them twice, or else not till some <lb/>
            certain period has intervened; others are not fixed, as that of <lb/>
            a juryman, or a member of the popular assembly. But pos­ <lb/>
            sibly some one may say, these are not offices, nor <lb/>
            have the citizens in these capacities any share in <lb/>
            Objection. <lb/>
            the government; though surely it is ridiculous to say that <lb/>
            those who have the principal power in the state bear no office <lb/>
            in it. But grant that this objection is of no weight, for it is <lb/>
            only a dispute about words; as there is no general term which <lb/>
            can be applied both to a dicast and a member of the assembly. <lb/>
            For the sake of distinction, then, let us call it an indeterminate <lb/>
            office : we lay it down then as a maxim, that those are citi­ <lb/>
            zens who have this share. Such then is the description of the <lb/>
            citizen who comes nearest to what all those are who are <lb/>
            called citizens. Every one also should remember, that of the <lb/>
            component parts of those things which differ from each other <lb/>
            in species, those which follow after the first or second remove <lb/>
            have either nothing at all, or to a very little extent, in com­ <lb/>
            mon. Now we see that governments differ from each other <lb/>
            in their form, and that some of them are prior, others poste­ <lb/>
            rior in time; for it is evident, that those which have many <lb/>
            defects and deviations in them must be in time posterior to <lb/>
            those which are without such faults.1 (What we mean by <lb/>
            deviations will be hereafter explained.) Hence it <lb/>
            is clear, that the office of a citizen, must differ just <lb/>
            as governments do from each other: for which <lb/>
            reason he who is called a citizen is most truly a. <lb/>
            Citizens differ­ <lb/>
            ent under dif­ <lb/>
            ferent forms of <lb/>
            government. <lb/>
            citizen in a democracy. In other forms of government he may <lb/>
            be so indeed, but not necessarily; for in some states. the people <lb/>
            have no power; nor have they any general assembly, but a <lb/>
            few select officers; the trial also of different causes is allotted <note type="footnote"> 1 Just as in the Nic. Ethics, (book i. ch. 6,) Aristotle disproves the <lb/>
            existence of the abstract or ideal " good " of Plato, by asserting that pri­ <lb/>
            ority and posteriority could not be predicated concerning it; so here, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to Aristotle, there can be no single definition given of a <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολίτης</foreign>, <lb/>
            because some polities are prior and posterior to others. </note> <note type="footnote"> G 2 </note> <pb n="84"/>

            to different persons ; 'as at Lacedæmon, where all disputes con­ <lb/>
            cerning contracts are brought before some of the ephors , while <lb/>
            the senate are the judges in cases of murder, some cases being <lb/>
            heard by one magistrate, others by another: and thus at Car­ <lb/>
            thage certain magistrates determine all causes.1 But our <lb/>
            former description of a citizen will admit of correction ; for in <lb/>
            some governments, the office of a dicast and of a member of <lb/>
            the general assembly, is not an indeterminate one; but there <lb/>
            are particular persons appointed for these purposes, some or <lb/>
            all of the citizens being appointed jurymen, or members of the <lb/>
            general assembly; and this either for all causes and all public <lb/>
            business whatsoever, or else for some particular one. This <lb/>
            A state is the <lb/>
            aggregate of <lb/>
            such citizens. <lb/>
            then is sufficient to show what a citizen is; for <lb/>
            whoever has a right to take part in the judicial <lb/>
            and executive part of government in any state, <lb/>
            him we call a citizen of that place; and a state, in one word, <lb/>
            is the collective body of such persons, sufficient in themselves <lb/>
            for all the purposes of life.2</p>

          <p>FOR common use, then, men define a citizen to be <lb/>
            one who is sprung from citizens on both sides, not <lb/>
            on the fathers or the mother's only.3 Others <lb/>
            carry the matter still further, and inquire as to his ancestors, <note type="footnote"> 1 See above, note on the last chapter. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 In the same spirit Cicero, in the Somnium Scip. ch. 3, defines a state <lb/>
            as " concilium coetusque hominum jure sociati." A " civitas," or <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόλις</foreign>, <lb/>
            therefore, is properly a political community, possessed of an internal prin­ <lb/>
            ciple of unity of its own, sovereign and independent. Its <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐταρκεία</foreign> (of <lb/>
            which Aristotle here speaks) is a property necessarily flowing from the <lb/>
            above essential point in its constitution. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Aristotle here says that, for practical purposes, it is sufficient to define <lb/>
            a citizen as the son or grandson of a citizen. It is certain that the law <lb/>
            required that any one enrolled as a citizen should prove that he had been <lb/>
            born in lawful wedlock. This regulation, however, was only carried <lb/>
            out in its utmost rigour at the time when Athenian citizenship was most <lb/>
            valuable. In Solon's time, it is not certain that the offspring of a citizen <lb/>
            and a foreign woman incurred any civil disadvantage; and even the law <lb/>
            of Pericles, (Plut. Pericl. c. 37,) which enacted citizenship on the mo­ <lb/>
            ther's side, appears to have become obsolete very soon afterwards. Our <lb/>
            author in this place makes his test the formal cause of a man being <lb/>
            a citizen, viz. the power which he actually enjoys : the other writers re­ <lb/>
            ferred to, measured his citizenship by the efficient or material cause, <lb/>
            namely, birth and hereditary descent. </note> <pb n="85"/>

            for three or more generations. But some persons have ques­ <lb/>
            tioned how the first of the family, be he third or fourth in <lb/>
            ascent, could prove himself a citizen, according to this popu­ <lb/>
            lar and careless definition, Grorgias of Leontium, <lb/>
            partly entertaining the same doubt, and partly <lb/>
            in jest, says, that as mortars an made by mor- <lb/>
            That of Gorgiæ <lb/>
            refuted. <lb/>
            tar-makers, and Larissaean kettles by kettle-makers, so citizens <lb/>
            are made by citizen-makers. 1 This is indeed a very simple <lb/>
            account of the matter ; for they would be citizens if they had <lb/>
            a share in the state, according to this definition ; but this can­ <lb/>
            not apply to the first founders or inhabitants of states, who <lb/>
            can claim no right either from their father or mother. It is <lb/>
            probably a matter of still greater difficulty to determine their <lb/>
            political rights, in the case of those who are enfranchised after <lb/>
            any revolution in the state. As, for instance, at Athens, after <lb/>
            the expulsion of the tyrants, when Cleisthenes enrolled many <lb/>
            foreigners and city slaves amongst the tribes ; the doubt with <lb/>
            respect to them was, not whether they were citizens or no, <lb/>
            but whether they were legally so or not. Though <lb/>
            indeed some persons may have this further doubt, <lb/>
            whether a citizen can be a citizen, when he is <lb/>
            illegally made; as if an illegal citizen, and one <lb/>
            A further ques­ <lb/>
            tion as to citi­ <lb/>
            zens unjustly <lb/>
            created. <lb/>
            who is no citizen at all, were the same: but since we see some <lb/>
            persons govern unjustly, whom yet we admit to be governors, <lb/>
            though not justly so, and the definition of a citizen is one <lb/>
            who exercises certain offices, (for such we have defined a <lb/>
            citizen to be,) it is evident that a citizen illegally created yet <lb/>
            continues to be a citizen; but whether justly or unjustly so, <lb/>
            follows next upon the former inquiry.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAP. III.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>SOME also doubt what is and what is not the act <lb/>
            of the state ; as for instance, when a democracy <lb/>
            arises out of an aristocracy, or a tyranny ; for <lb/>
            Wherein con­ <lb/>
            sists the iden­ <lb/>
            t5ty of a state f <lb/>
            some persons then refuse to fulfil their contracts ; as if the <note type="footnote"> I Copper kettles made at Larissa were called Larissae, just as those <lb/>
            made at Tanagra were called Tanagræ. Thirlwall, however, understands <lb/>
            the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">δημιουργοὶ</foreign> in a different sense, and would seem inclined to iden­ <lb/>
            tify it with the office of <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολιτοφύλαξ</foreign>, mentioned below, book v. 6. See <lb/>
            Thirlwall's Greece, vol. i. p. 438, note. </note> <pb n="86"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK in. </note> <lb/>
            right of receiving the money was in the tyrant, and not in <lb/>
            the state, and many other things of the same nature ; or as <lb/>
            if any covenant was founded for violence and not for the com­ <lb/>
            mon good. So in like manner, whatever is done by those <lb/>
            who manage an established democracy, the actions of this go­ <lb/>
            vernment are to be considered as the actions of the state, as <lb/>
            well as in the oligarchy or tyranny. And here it seems very <lb/>
            proper to consider this question, when shall we say that a <lb/>
            state is the same, and when shall we say that it is different ? <lb/>
            Not in locality. <lb/>
            Now the most superficial mode of examining <lb/>
            into this question, is to begin with the place and <lb/>
            the people ; for it may happen that the place and the people <lb/>
            may be divided, and that some one of them may live in one <lb/>
            place, and some in another. But this question may be re­ <lb/>
            garded as no very knotty one; for, as a state is so called in <lb/>
            a variety of senses, it may be solved many ways. And in <lb/>
            like manner, when men inhabit one common place, when shall <lb/>
            we say that the state is the same ? for it does not depend <lb/>
            upon the walls; for it would be possible to surround Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnesus itself with a wall, as was Babylon, and every other <lb/>
            place which encircles rather a nation than a city; for they <lb/>
            say that when it had been taken three days, some of the in­ <lb/>
            habitants knew nothing of it. But we shall find a proper <lb/>
            time to determine this question ; for the extent of a state, <lb/>
            how large it should be, and whether it should consist of more <lb/>
            than one people, these are particulars which ought not to <lb/>
            escape the politician. This too is a matter of inquiry, whether <lb/>
            Nor in mere <lb/>
            sameness of <lb/>
            race. <lb/>
            we shall say that a state is the same while it is <lb/>
            inhabited by the same race of men, though some <lb/>
            of them are perpetually dying, others coming into <lb/>
            the world, as we say that a river or a fountain is the same, <lb/>
            though the waters are continually changing ; or, when a si­ <lb/>
            milar event takes place shall we say that the men are the same, <lb/>
            but the state is different ?1 For if a state is a community, it is <lb/>
            a community of citizens; but if the mode of government <note type="footnote"> 1 The definition of a <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολίτης</foreign> will depend upon the <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶδος</foreign> of the polity <lb/>
            itself; and in like manner whether we are able to predicate of a state at <lb/>
            two different periods that it is the same state, will depend upon whether <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶδος πολιτείας</foreign> be the same or no. And whether an action may be <lb/>
            justly called the action of the state will depend upon the part of it in <lb/>
            which the supreme power is lodged (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ κύϱιον</foreign>). </note> <pb n="87"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. IV.] </note> <lb/>
            should alter, and become of another sort, it would seem a ne­ <lb/>
            cessary consequence that the state is not the same ; as we <lb/>
            regard the tragic chorus as different from the comic, though <lb/>
            it may probably consist of the same performers. Thus every <lb/>
            other community or composition is said to be different, if the <lb/>
            species of composition is different; as in music the same <lb/>
            voices produce different harmony, as at one time the Doric <lb/>
            and at another the Phrygian melody. If this is <lb/>
            true, it is evident that when we speak of a state <lb/>
            as being the same, we refer especially to the go- <lb/>
            But in identity <lb/>
            of government. <lb/>
            vernment there established; and it is possible to call it by <lb/>
            the same name or any other, whether it be inhabited by the <lb/>
            same men or by different ones. But whether or no it is <lb/>
            right or not right to dissolve the community, when the state <lb/>
            passes into an altered form of constitution, is another question.</p>

          <p>AFTER what has been said, it follows that we <lb/>
            should consider, whether the virtue of a good man <lb/>
            is the same as that of a valuable citizen, or differ­ <lb/>
            ent from it; and since this point ought to have a <lb/>
            Is the virtue <lb/>
            of a good man <lb/>
            the same as <lb/>
            that of a good <lb/>
            citizen? <lb/>
            particular inquiry, we must first give in a general outline the <lb/>
            virtue of a good citizen. For as a sailor is one of those who <lb/>
            make up a community, this also we say of a citizen; although <lb/>
            the province of one sailor may be different from that of an­ <lb/>
            other,—(for one is a rower, another a steersman, a third a boat­ <lb/>
            swain, and so on, each having their several denominations,)- <lb/>
            it is evident, that though the most accurate description of any <lb/>
            one good sailor must refer to his peculiar abilities, still there is <lb/>
            some common description which will apply to the whole <lb/>
            crew; for the safety of the ship is the common business of <lb/>
            all of them, as this is the point at which each sailor aims. <lb/>
            So also with respect to citizens, although different from <lb/>
            each other, yet they have one common care, the safety of the <lb/>
            community; for the state is a community: and for this reason, <lb/>
            the virtue of a citizen has necessarily a reference to the state. <lb/>
            But since there are different kinds of governments, it is evi­ <lb/>
            dent, that those actions which constitute the virtue of an ex­ <lb/>
            cellent citizen will not always be the same, and hence that it <lb/>
            cannot be perfect; but we call a man good when he is of <pb n="88"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK III. </note> <lb/>
            perfect virtue; and hence it follows, that a man who is an <lb/>
            excellent citizen may not possess that virtue which constitutes <lb/>
            a good man. Those who are doubtful concerning this same <lb/>
            question as to the best polity, may follow up the matter in <lb/>
            another way; for if it is impossible that a state should con­ <lb/>
            sist entirely of excellent citizens, (while it is necessary that <lb/>
            every one should do well in his calling, in which consists his <lb/>
            excellence, and as it is impossible that all the citizens should <lb/>
            be upon the same level,) it is impossible that the virtue of a <lb/>
            citizen and a good man should be the same. For all should <lb/>
            possess the virtue of an excellent citizen, for from hence ne­ <lb/>
            cessarily arises the perfection of the state ; but that every one <lb/>
            should possess the virtue of a good man is impossible, if it is <lb/>
            not necessary that all the citizens in a well-regulated state <lb/>
            should be virtuous. Besides, as a state is composed of dis­ <lb/>
            similar parts, as an animal is of life and body; the soul, of <lb/>
            reason and appetite ; a family, of a man and his wife; pro­ <lb/>
            perty, of a master and a slave ; in the same manner, as a <lb/>
            state is composed of all these, and of many other very differ- <lb/>
            The virtue of <lb/>
            some citizens <lb/>
            differs from <lb/>
            that of others. <lb/>
            ent parts, it necessarily follows, that the virtue <lb/>
            of all the citizens cannot be the same; as the bu­ <lb/>
            siness of the leader of a chorus is different from <lb/>
            that of a dancer. From all these proofs it is evi­ <lb/>
            dent that the virtues of a citizen cannot be one and the same. <lb/>
            But do we never find those virtues united which constitute <lb/>
            a good man and excellent citizen ? for we say that such a one <lb/>
            is an excellent magistrate, and a prudent and good man ; but <lb/>
            prudence is necessary to all who engage in public affairs.. <lb/>
            Nay, some persons affirm, that the education of those who are <lb/>
            intended to command, should from the beginning be different <lb/>
            from other citizens ; as is shown by those who instruct the <lb/>
            children of kings in riding and warlike exercises; and thus <lb/>
            Euripides says, <note type="footnote"> 1 The <foreign xml:lang="grc">φϱόνησις</foreign> which Aristotle requires in the private citizen is only <lb/>
            that which will enable him to perform well his proper <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔϱγον</foreign>, and differs <lb/>
            widely from that moral <foreign xml:lang="grc">φϱόνησις</foreign> properly so called, which is a master <lb/>
            faculty, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιστατικὴ δύναμις</foreign>,) and is requisite in the ruler only. The <lb/>
            ruler indeed knows, or should know, how to rule and to obey, but <lb/>
            the latter he need only know virtually, not experimentally. But the <lb/>
            subject need only know how to rule virtually, if at all, but it is <lb/>
            necessary that he should know practically and experimentally how the<lb/>
            obey. </note> <pb n="89"/>

            " No showy arts be mine,1 <lb/>
            But what the state requires; " <lb/>
            as if there were some education peculiar to a ruler. But since <lb/>
            the virtues of a good man and a good magistrate may be the <lb/>
            same, and since a citizen is one who obeys the magistrate, it <lb/>
            follows that the virtue of the one cannot in general be the <lb/>
            same as the virtue of the other, although it may be true of <lb/>
            some particular citizen; for the virtue of the magistrate must <lb/>
            be different from the virtue of the citizen. For this reason <lb/>
            Jason declared, that were he no longer king, he should pine <lb/>
            away with regret, as not knowing how to live a private man. <lb/>
            But it is a great recommendation to know how to command <lb/>
            as well as to obey; and to do both these things well is the <lb/>
            virtue of an accomplished citizen. Since then <lb/>
            the virtue of a good man consists in being able to <lb/>
            command, but that of a good citizen renders him <lb/>
            The question <lb/>
            decided. <lb/>
            equally fit for either post, they are not both equally praise­ <lb/>
            worthy. It appears then, that both he who commands and <lb/>
            he who obeys should each of them learn their separate busi­ <lb/>
            ness, and not the same; but that the citizen should be master <lb/>
            of and take part in both these, as any one may see from the <lb/>
            fact that in a family government there is no occasion for the <lb/>
            master to know how to perform the necessary offices, but <lb/>
            rather to enjoy the labour of others; for to do the other is a <lb/>
            servile part. I mean by the other, the performance of the <lb/>
            family business of the slave.</p>
          <p>There are many sorts of slaves, for their em­ <lb/>
            ployments are various; one of these are the handi­ <lb/>
            craftsmen, who, as their name imports, get their <lb/>
            Slaves of dif­ <lb/>
            ferent kinds. <lb/>
            living by the labour of their hands ; and amongst these all me­ <lb/>
            chanics are included. For which reasons such workmen in <lb/>
            some states were not formerly admitted into any share in the <lb/>
            government, till at length democracies were established: it <lb/>
            is not therefore proper for any man of honour, or <lb/>
            any citizen, or any one who engages in public af­ <lb/>
            fairs, to learn these servile employments, without <lb/>
            Servile occupa­ <lb/>
            tions unfit for <lb/>
            citizens. <lb/>
            they have occasion for them for their own use; for otherwise <lb/>
            the distinction between a master and a slave would be lost. <note type="footnote"> I This verse does not occur in any of the extant plays of Euripides. <lb/>

            But there is a government of another sort, in which men go­ <lb/>
            vern those who are their equals in rank and freemen ; and <lb/>
            this we call a political government, in which men learn to <lb/>
            command, by first submitting to obey; just as a good general <lb/>
            of horse, or a commander-in-chief, must acquire a knowledge <lb/>
            of his duty, by having been long under the command of an­ <lb/>
            other, and having served in command of a rank and a troop ; <lb/>
            for well is it said, that no one knows how to command, who <lb/>
            has not himself been under command of another. The virtues <lb/>
            How far the <lb/>
            virtue of the <lb/>
            good man and <lb/>
            the good citi­ <lb/>
            zen are iden­ <lb/>
            tical. <lb/>
            of each are indeed different, but a good citizen <lb/>
            must know how to be able to command and to <lb/>
            obey; he ought also to know in what manner <lb/>
            freemen ought to govern and be governed. Both <lb/>
            too belong to the good man, even though the <lb/>
            temperance and justice of him who commands is different in <lb/>
            kind from that of another; for it is evident that the virtue <lb/>
            of a good citizen cannot be the same when he is under com­ <lb/>
            mand or free, (as justice, for instance,) but must be of a dif­ <lb/>
            ferent species in either of these different situations, as the <lb/>
            temperance and courage of a man and a woman are different <lb/>
            from each other; for a man would appear a coward, who had <lb/>
            only that courage which would be graceful in a woman, and <lb/>
            a woman would be thought a chatterer, who should take as <lb/>
            large a part in the conversation as would become a man of <lb/>
            consequence. The domestic employments of each of them <lb/>
            are also different; it is the man's business to acquire a sub­ <lb/>
            sistence, the woman's to take care of it. But practical wis­ <lb/>
            dom is a virtue peculiar to those who govern, while all others <lb/>
            seem to belong in common to both parties. But practical <lb/>
            wisdom does not concern the governed, but only to entertain <lb/>
            just notions; the latter indeed are like flute-makers, while <lb/>
            he who governs is the musician who plays on the flutes. <lb/>
            And thus much to show whether the virtue of a good man and <lb/>
            an excellent citizen is the same, or if it is different, and also <lb/>
            how far it is the same, and how far different.</p>

          <p>Are mechanics <lb/>
            Citizens ?</p>
          <p>BUT with respect to the citizens there is a doubt <lb/>
            remaining, whether those only are truly so who <lb/>
            are allowed a share in the government, or whether <pb n="91"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. V.] </note> <lb/>
            mechanics also are to be considered as such. For if those <lb/>
            who are not permitted to rule are to be reckoned among them, <lb/>
            it is impossible that the virtue of all the citizens should be <lb/>
            the same; (for these also are citizens ;) and if none of them are <lb/>
            admitted to be citizens, where shall they be ranked ? for they <lb/>
            are neither sojourners, nor foreigners. Or shall we say that <lb/>
            no absurdity will arise from their not being citizens, as nei­ <lb/>
            ther the slaves nor the freedmen consist of those above men­ <lb/>
            tioned ? This is certainly true, that all are not citizens who <lb/>
            are necessary to the existence of a state, as boys are not <lb/>
            citizens in the same manner that men are, for the former <lb/>
            are perfectly so, the latter under some conditions; for they <lb/>
            are citizens, though imperfect ones. In former times indeed, <lb/>
            among some people, the mechanics and foreigners were slaves; <lb/>
            and for this reason many of them are so now ; and indeed the <lb/>
            best-regulated states will not permit a mechanic to be a <lb/>
            citizen ; but if it be allowed them, we cannot then attribute <lb/>
            the virtue which we have described to every citizen or freeman, <lb/>
            but to those only who are disengaged from servile offices. <lb/>
            Now those who are employed in such things by one person, <lb/>
            are slaves ; those who do them for money, are mechanics and <lb/>
            hired servants ; and hence it is evident on the least reflection <lb/>
            what is their situation, for what I have said is self-evident, <lb/>
            and fully explains the matter. Since the number of commu­ <lb/>
            nities is very great, it follows necessarily that <lb/>
            there will be many different sorts of citizens, par­ <lb/>
            ticularly of those who are governed by others ; so <lb/>
            This will be <lb/>
            different in <lb/>
            different states. <lb/>
            that in one state it may be necessary to admit mechanics and <lb/>
            hired servants to be citizens, but in others it may be impos­ <lb/>
            sible; as particularly in an aristocracy, and where honours <lb/>
            are bestowed on virtue and merit; for it is impossible for <lb/>
            one who lives the life of a mechanic or hired servant to prac­ <lb/>
            tise a life of virtue.1 In oligarchies also hired servants are <lb/>
            not admitted to be citizens; because there a man's right to <lb/>
            bear any office is regulated by the size of his fortune; but <note type="footnote"> 1 The prescription which practically excluded from the rights of citi­ <lb/>
            zenship all those who gained their living by agricultural labour, or by <lb/>
            handicraft trades, was of course derived from the old heroic times, before <lb/>
            the rise of the dominant class which afterwards overthrew the mon­ <lb/>
            archies. The force of this prescription is shown remarkably in such <lb/>
            words as <foreign xml:lang="grc">χείϱων, χεϱὴς</foreign>, etc. </note> <pb n="92"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK in. </note> <lb/>
            mechanics are admitted, for the majority of citizens are very <lb/>
            rich. There was a law at Thebes, that no one could have a <lb/>
            share in the government, till he had been ten years out of <lb/>
            trade. In many states the law invites strangers to accept the <lb/>
            freedom of the city; and in some democracies the son of a <lb/>
            free-woman is himself free. The same is also observed in <lb/>
            many others with respect to natural children ; but it is through <lb/>
            want of citizens regularly born that they admit such; for <lb/>
            these laws are always made in consequence of a scarcity of <lb/>
            inhabitants; so, as their numbers increase, they first deprive <lb/>
            the children of a male or female slave of this privilege, next <lb/>
            the child of a free-woman, and last of all, they will admit <lb/>
            none but those whose fathers and mothers were both free. <lb/>
            From this it is clear that there are many sorts of citizens, and <lb/>
            that he who shares the honours of the state may be called a <lb/>
            complete citizen. Thus Achilles, in Homer, complains of <lb/>
            Agamemnon's treating him <lb/>
            " like some unhonoured stranger; " 1 <lb/>
            for he who shares not in the honours of a state, is as it were <lb/>
            a stranger, or sojourner; and whenever such a thing as this <lb/>
            is concealed, it is for the sake of deceiving the inhabitants. <lb/>
            The virtue of a <lb/>
            good man may <lb/>
            be the same as <lb/>
            that of a good <lb/>
            citizen when in <lb/>
            command. <lb/>
            From what has been said then, it is plain whether <lb/>
            we must lay down the virtue of a good man and <lb/>
            an excellent citizen to be the same or different; <lb/>
            for we find that in some states it is the same, <lb/>
            in others not, and also that this is not true of <lb/>
            each citizen, but of those only who take the lead, or are ca­ <lb/>
            pable of taking the lead, in public affairs, either alone or in <lb/>
            conjunction with others.</p>

          <p>How many <lb/>
            polities are <lb/>
            admissible ?</p>
          <p>AND since these points are determined, we pro­ <lb/>

            should be established, or more than one; and if <lb/>
            more, then how many, and of what sort, and what are the <lb/>
            differences between them. Now a polity is the ordering and <lb/>
            regulating of the state, and of all its offices, particularly of that <lb/>
            I See Homer II. ix. 644. <pb n="93"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. VI.] </note> <lb/>
            wherein the supreme power is lodged; and this <lb/>
            power is always possessed by the administration; <lb/>
            but the administration itself determines the particu­ <lb/>
            lar polity. Thus, for instance, in a democracy the <lb/>
            They differ <lb/>
            with the form <lb/>
            of administra­ <lb/>
            tion. <lb/>
            supreme power is lodged in the whole people; on the contrary, <lb/>
            in an oligarchy it is in the hands of a few. We say then, that <lb/>
            the polity in these states is different, and we shall find the <lb/>
            same thing hold good in others. Let us first determine for <lb/>
            whose sake a state is established, and point out the different <lb/>
            species of rule which relate to mankind and to social life. <lb/>
            It has already been mentioned, in the beginning <lb/>
            of our treatise, where a definition was made as to <lb/>
            the management of a family, and the power of a <lb/>
            Man a social <lb/>
            being. <lb/>
            mastery that man is an animal naturally formed for society, <lb/>
            and that therefore, even when he does not want any foreign <lb/>
            assistance, he will equally desire to live with others ; not but <lb/>
            that mutual advantage also induces them to it, as far as the <lb/>
            share of it enables each person to live agreeably. This is <lb/>
            indeed the great object, not only to all in general, but also to <lb/>
            each individual: and they join in society also for the sake of <lb/>
            being able to live, (for doubtless in this, too, what is agreeable <lb/>
            has a share,) and they also bind together civil society, even <lb/>
            for the sake of preserving life, unless they are grievously over­ <lb/>
            whelmed with its miseries: for it is very evident, that men <lb/>
            will endure many calamities for the sake of life, as having in <lb/>
            itself something naturally sweet and desirable. It is easy to <lb/>
            point out the different received modes of government, and we <lb/>
            often lay them down in our exoteric2 discourses. The power <lb/>
            of the master, though there is an identity of interest between <lb/>
            him who is by nature a master and him who is by nature a <lb/>
            slave, yet nevertheless tends especially to the benefit of the <lb/>
            master, but accidentally to that of the slave; for if the slave <lb/>
            is destroyed, the power of the master is at an end. But the <lb/>
            authority which a man has over his wife, and <lb/>
            children, and his family, which we call domestic <lb/>
            government, is either for the benefit of those who <lb/>
            Distinctions of <lb/>
            government in <lb/>
            domestic life. <lb/>

            mon to both ; but its essential object is the benefit of the go­ <lb/>
            verned, as we see in other arts, (in physic, for instance, and <lb/>
            the gymnastic exercises,) but accidentally it may be for the <lb/>
            sake of those who govern; for nothing forbids the master of <lb/>
            the exercises from sometimes being himself one of those who <lb/>
            take exercise, as the steersman is always one of the sailors; <lb/>
            but both the master of the exercises and the steersman con­ <lb/>
            sider the good of those who are under their government. <lb/>
            But when either of them becomes one of these, it is by aoci­ <lb/>
            dent that he shares in their benefits; for the one becomes a <lb/>

            which they <lb/>
            have in view. <lb/>
            master of the exercises, Thus in all political <lb/>
            governments, which are established upon the prin­ <lb/>
            ciple of an equality of the citizens, and accoDd­ <lb/>
            ing to similitude, it is held right to rule by turns. <lb/>
            Formerly, as was natural, every one expected that each of his <lb/>
            fellow-citizens should in his turn1 serve the public, and thus <lb/>
            administer to his private good, as he himself when in office <lb/>
            had done for others. But now every one is desirous of being <lb/>
            continually in power, that he may enjoy the advantage which <lb/>
            he derives from public business and being in office; as if <lb/>
            offices were a never-failing remedy for sickly rulers; for if <lb/>
            this were so, no doubt they would be eagerly sought after. <lb/>
            Wkat govern­ <lb/>
            ments are <lb/>
            proper. <lb/>
            It is evident, then, that all those governments <lb/>
            which have the common good in view, are rightly <lb/>
            established and strictly iust; but that those which <lb/>
            have in view only the good of the rulers, are all founded on <lb/>
            wrong principles, and are widely different from what a go­ <lb/>
            vernment ought to be ; for they are tyrannical; whereas a <lb/>
            state is a community of freemen. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">λειτουϱγει̃ν</foreign>. For an account of the ancient <foreign xml:lang="grc">λειτουϱγίαι</foreign>, see the <lb/>

          <p>HAVING established these particulars, the next point is to <lb/>
            consider how many different kinds of governments there are, <lb/>
            and what they are; and first we must review those of them <lb/>
            which are correct; for when we have determined this, their <lb/>
            deflections will be evident enough.</p>
          <p>It is evident that every form of government or <lb/>
            administration, (for the words are of the same im­ <lb/>
            port,) must contain the supreme power over the <lb/>
            The forms of <lb/>
            government <lb/>
            laid down. <lb/>
            whole state, and that this supreme power must necessarily <lb/>
            be in the hands of one person, or of a few, or of the many ; <lb/>
            and that when the one, the few, or the many direct their po­ <lb/>
            licy to the common good, such states are well governed: but <lb/>
            when the interest of the one, the few, or the many who are in <lb/>
            office, is alone consulted, a perversion takes place; for we must <lb/>
            either affirm that those who share in the community are not <lb/>
            citizens, or else let these share in the advantages of govern­ <lb/>
            ment. Now we usually call a state which is go­ <lb/>
            verned by one person for the common good, a <lb/>
            1. Monarchy. <lb/>
            kingdom; one that is governed by more than one, but by a <lb/>
            few only, an aristocracy; either because the go­ <lb/>
            vernment is in the hands of the most worthy <lb/>
            2. Aristocracy. <lb/>
            citizens, or because it is the best form for the city, and its in­ <lb/>
            habitants. But when the citizens at large direct <lb/>
            their policy to the public good, it is called simply <lb/>
            a polity; a name which is common to all other <lb/>
            3. Polity or free <lb/>
            state. <lb/>
            governments. And this distinction is consonant to reason; <lb/>
            for it will be easy to find one person, or a very few, of very <lb/>
            distinguished abilities, but most difficult to meet with the <lb/>
            majority of a people eminent for every virtue ; but if there <lb/>
            is one common to a whole nation it is valour; for this exists <lb/>
            among numbers: for which reason, in this state the military <lb/>
            have most power, and those who possess arms will have their <lb/>
            share in the government. Now the perversions <lb/>
            attending each of these governments are these ; a <lb/>
            kingdom may degenerate into a tyranny, an aris­ <lb/>
            tocracy into an oligarchy, and a state into a de­ <lb/>
            mocracy. Now a tyranny is a monarchy where <lb/>

            of each several <lb/>

            1. Tyranny. <lb/>
            2. Oligarchy. <lb/>
            3. Democracy. <lb/>
            the good of one man only is the object of government, an <lb/>
            oligarchy considers only the rich, and a democracy only the <pb n="96"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK in. </note> <lb/>
            poor; but neither of them have the common good of all in <lb/>
            view.1</p>

          </ab>
          <p>IT will be necessary to enlarge a little more upon the nature of <lb/>
            each of these forms of government; and this is a matter which <lb/>
            includes some difficulties; for he who would enter into a phi­ <lb/>
            losophical inquiry into their principles, and not content him­ <lb/>
            self with a mere practical view of them, must pass over and <lb/>
            omit nothing, but explain the true spirit of each of them. A <lb/>
            tyranny then is, as has been said, a monarchy where one <lb/>
            person has a despotic power over the whole community: an <lb/>
            oligarchy, where the supreme power of the state is lodged <lb/>
            with the rich: a democracy, on the contrary, is where it is in <lb/>
            Difficulties re­ <lb/>
            sulting from <lb/>
            the above <lb/>
            division. <lb/>
            the hands of those who are worth little or nothing. <lb/>
            But the first difficulty that arises from the dis­ <lb/>
            tinction laid down is this; should it happen that <lb/>
            the majority of the inhabitants who possess the <lb/>
            . power of the state (for this is a democracy) are rich, the <lb/>
            question is, how does this agree with what we have said ? The <lb/>
            same difficulty occurs, should it ever happen that the poor <lb/>
            compose a smaller part of the people than the rich, but from <lb/>
            their superior abilities acquire the supreme power; (for this <lb/>
            is what they call an oligarchy:) it would seem then that our <lb/>
            definition of the different forms of government was not cor­ <lb/>
            rect ; nay, moreover, could any one suppose that the majority <lb/>
            of the people were poor, and the minority rich, and then de­ <lb/>
            scribe the state in this manner, that an oligarchy was a <lb/>
            government in which the rich, being few in number, possessed <lb/>
            the supreme power, and that a democracy was a state in which <lb/>
            the poor, being many in number, possessed it, still there will <lb/>
            be another difficulty; for what name shall we give to those <lb/>
            states which we have been describing? we mean, that in <note type="footnote"> 1 In his Ethics (book viii. ch. 10) Aristotle gives a veiy similar division <lb/>
            of governments. He there says that there are three kinds of political <lb/>
            constitutions, monarchy, aristocracy, and timocracy; and three cor­ <lb/>
            ruptions of them, namely, tyranny, oligarchy, and democracy. Of the above <lb/>
            forms, he says that monarchy is best and timocracy worst; while, in­ <lb/>
            versely, of the three corruptions, democracy is the least bad and tyranny <lb/>
            the worst. So true is the old proverb," Corruptio optimi pessima fit <lb/>
            corruptio." </note> <pb n="97"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. IX.] </note> <lb/>
            which the greater number are rich, and that in which the <lb/>
            lesser number are poor, where each of these respectively pos­ <lb/>
            sess the supreme power? If there are no other forms of <lb/>
            government besides those we have described, it seems there­ <lb/>
            fore evident to reason, that it may be a mere accident whether <lb/>
            the supreme power is vested in the hands of many or few; <lb/>
            but that it is clear enough, that when it is in the hands of the <lb/>
            few, it will be a government of the rich; when in the hands <lb/>
            of the many, it will be a government of the poor; since in all <lb/>
            countries there are many poor and few rich. It is not there­ <lb/>
            fore the cause that has been already assigned, namely, the <lb/>
            number of people in power, which makes the difference be­ <lb/>
            tween the two forms of government; but an oli­ <lb/>
            garchy and a democracy differ in this from each <lb/>
            other, namely, in the poverty of those who go- <lb/>
            How an oligar­ <lb/>
            chy and a de­ <lb/>
            mocracy differ. <lb/>
            vern in the one, and the riches of those who govern in the <lb/>
            other; for when the government is in the hands of the rich, <lb/>
            be they few or be they more, it is an oligarchy; when it is <lb/>
            in the hands of the poor, it is a democracy. But, as we have <lb/>
            already said, the one will be always few, the other numerous ; <lb/>
            for few enjoy riches, but all enjoy liberty; and hence will <lb/>
            arise continual disputes with each other for the lead in public <lb/>
            affairs.</p>

          <p>LET us first determine what they lay down as the <lb/>
            proper limits of an oligarchy and a democracy, <lb/>
            and what is just in each of these forms of go- <lb/>
            An oligarchy <lb/>
            and democracy <lb/>
            limited. <lb/>
            vernment. For all men have some natural inclination to <lb/>
            justice, but they proceed therein only to a certain degree ; <lb/>
            nor can they universally point out what is absolutely just. For <lb/>
            instance, what is equal appears just, and is so, but not to all, <lb/>
            only among those who are equals; and what is unequal ap­ <lb/>
            pears just, and is so, but not to all, only amongst those who are <lb/>
            unequals. This relative nature of justice some people neglect, <lb/>
            and therefore they judge ill; and the reason of this is, that they <lb/>
            judge for themselves, and almost everyone is the worst judge <lb/>
            in his own cause. Since then j ustice has reference <lb/>
            to persons, the same distinctions must be made with <lb/>
            respect to persons, which are made with respect<lb/>
            Justice is relative. <note type="footnote"> H </note> <pb n="98"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK III. </note> <lb/>
            to things, in the manner that I have already described in my <lb/>
            Ethics.1 As to the equality of the things, they are agreed$ <lb/>
            but their dispute is concerning the equality of the persons, <lb/>
            and chiefly for the reason above assigned, because they judge <lb/>
            ill in their own cause; and also because each party thinks, <lb/>
            that if they admit what is right in some particulars, they say <lb/>
            what is just on the whole. Thus, for instance, if some per­ <lb/>
            sons are unequal in riches, they suppose them unequal in the <lb/>
            whole; or on the contrary, if they are equal in liberty, they <lb/>
            suppose them equal in the whole. But they forget that which <lb/>
            is the essential point; for if civil society was founded for the <lb/>
            sake of preserving and increasing property, every one's right <lb/>
            in the state would be in proportion to his fortune; and then <lb/>
            the reasoning of those who insist upon an oligarchy would be <lb/>
            valid ; for it would not be right that he who contributed one <lb/>
            mina should have an equal share in the hundred, along with <lb/>
            him who brought in all the rest, either of the original money or <lb/>
            Civil society, <lb/>
            why founded. <lb/>
            of what was afterwards acquired. Nor was civil <lb/>
            society founded merely in order that its members <lb/>
            might live, but that they might live well,—(for <lb/>
            otherwise a state might be composed of slaves, or of the ani­ <lb/>
            mal creation ; which is far from the case, because these have <lb/>
            no share in happiness, nor do they live after their own choice;) <lb/>
            -nor is it an alliance mutually to defend each other from in­ <lb/>
            juries, or for a commercial intercourse; for then the Tyr­ <lb/>
            rhenians, and Carthaginians, and all other nations between <lb/>
            whom treaties of commerce subsist, would be citizens of one <lb/>
            state. For they have articles to regulate their imports, and <lb/>
            engagements for mutual protection, and alliances for mutual <lb/>
            defence; yet still they have not all the same magistrates <lb/>
            established among them, but they are different among differ­ <lb/>
            ent people; nor does the one take any care that the morals <lb/>
            of the other should be as they ought, or that none of those <lb/>
            who have entered into the common agreements should be <lb/>
            unjust, or in any degree vicious, but only that they shall not <lb/>
            injureanother confederate. But whosoever endeavours to <lb/>
            establish wholesome laws in a state, attends to the virtues <lb/>
            Virtue the end <lb/>
            of legislation. <lb/>
            and the vices of each individual who composes it; <lb/>
            and hence it is evident that the first care of a man <lb/>
            who would found a state truly deserving that <note type="footnote">1 He refers to book v. chap. 5. </note> <pb n="99"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. IX.] </note> <lb/>
            name, and not nominally so, must be to have his citizens <lb/>
            virtuous;1 for otherwise it is merely an alliance for self- <lb/>
            defence, differing only in place from those which are made <lb/>
            between different people. For the law is an agreement, and <lb/>
            as the sophist Lycophron says, a pledge between the citizens <lb/>
            of their intending to do justice to each other, though not suf­ <lb/>
            ficient to make all the citizens just and good. And it is <lb/>
            evident that this is the fact; for could any one bring different <lb/>
            places together, as, for instance, Megara and Corinth, within <lb/>
            the same walls, yet they would not be one state, not even if <lb/>
            their inhabitants intermarried with each other, though this <lb/>
            inter-community contributes much to combine people into one <lb/>
            state. Besides, could we suppose a set of people living separ­ <lb/>
            ate from each other, but within such a distance as would ad­ <lb/>
            mit of an intercourse, and that there were laws subsisting <lb/>
            between each party to prevent their injuring one another in <lb/>
            their mutual dealings,—(one being a carpenter, another a <lb/>
            husbandman, another a shoemaker, and the like,)—and that <lb/>
            their numbers were ten thousand, and still that <lb/>
            they had nothing in common but a tariff for trade, <lb/>
            or an alliance for mutual defence, even so they <lb/>
            would not constitute a state. And why in the <lb/>
            How a city or <lb/>
            state differs <lb/>
            from a mere <lb/>
            confederacy. <lb/>
            world? Not because their mutual intercourse is not near <lb/>
            enough; for even if persons so situated should come to one <lb/>
            place, and every one should live in his own house as in his <lb/>
            native city, and there should be alliances subsisting between <lb/>
            each party, mutually to assist and prevent any injury being <lb/>
            done to the other, still they would not be admitted to be a <note type="footnote"> I In the last chapter of the Ethics, Aristotle confesses, with regard to <lb/>
            this point, that moral instruction has but a limited influence, being con­ <lb/>
            fined to those minds which are generous and liberal, and not reaching to <lb/>
            those of the masses. And as men are to be made good in three ways, by <lb/>
            nature, by reasoning, and by teaching; and as over nature we have no <lb/>
            power at all, while reasoning and teaching exercise an influence only over <lb/>
            minds duly cultivated for their reception, the moral character of the in­ <lb/>
            dividual members of a state must be formed by education, and this edu­ <lb/>
            cation ought to be enforced by law. And as education is necessary not <lb/>
            only while we are children, but throughout life, hence exhortations to <lb/>
            virtue become the duty of legislators, as much as the punishment of evil­ <lb/>
            doers ; and as men will acknowledge the authority of the state and of <lb/>
            the law, though Dot of individuals, the state therefore ought to undertake <lb/>
            the duty of educating its members-a duty which, if neglected by the <lb/>
            state, in the opinion of Aristotle, falls upon the parents. </note> <note type="footnote"> u 2 </note> <pb n="100"/>

            city by those who reason correctly, if they preserved the same <lb/>
            customs when they were together as when they were separate. <lb/>
            It is evident, then, that a state is not a mere community of <lb/>
            place, nor established for the sake of mutual safety or traffic ; <lb/>
            but that these things are the necessary consequences of a <lb/>
            state, although they may all exist where there is no state; but <lb/>
            What a <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόλις</foreign> <lb/>
            really is. <lb/>
            a state is a society of people joining together with <lb/>
            their families, and their children, to live well, for <lb/>
            the sake of a perfect and independent life; and <lb/>
            for this purpose it is necessary that they should live in one <lb/>
            place, and intermarry with each other. Hence in all cities <lb/>
            there are family meetings, clubs, sacrifices, and public enter­ <lb/>
            tainments, to promote friendship;1 for a love of sociability is <lb/>
            friendship itself; so that the end for which a state is estab­ <lb/>
            lished is that the inhabitants of it may live happily; and these <lb/>
            things are conducive to that end; for it is a community of fa­ <lb/>
            milies and villages, formed for the sake of a perfect independ­ <lb/>
            ent life; that is, as we have already said, for the sake of living <lb/>
            Its end. <lb/>
            well and happily.2 The political state therefore is <lb/>
            founded not for the purpose of men's merely living <lb/>
            together, but for their living as men ought; for which reason <lb/>
            those who contribute most to this end deserve to have greater <lb/>
            power in the state than either those who are their equals in <lb/>
            family and freedom, but their inferiors in civil virtue, or those <lb/>
            who excel them in wealth, but are below them in worth. It <lb/>
            is evident from what has been said, that in all disputes upon <lb/>
            forms of government each party says something that is just.</p>

          <p>THERE may also be a doubt as to who should possess <lb/>

            was founded and continues to exist. Thus, if the state has wealth in <lb/>

            persons, or one better than the rest, or a tyrant ? <lb/>
            But whichever of these we prefer, some difficulty <lb/>
            will arise. For what? if the poor, because they <lb/>
            are the majority, may divide among themselves <lb/>
            what belongs to the rich, is not this unjust ? In <lb/>
            Certain diffi­ <lb/>
            culties consi­ <lb/>
            dered. <lb/>
            1• Shall it be <lb/>
            in the hands of <lb/>
            the many ? <lb/>
            sooth, by heaven, it will have been judged just enough by the <lb/>
            multitude when they gain the supreme power. What there­ <lb/>
            fore is the extremity of injustice, if this is not? Again, if <lb/>
            the many seize into their own hands every thing which be­ <lb/>
            longs to the few, it is evident that the state will be at an end. <lb/>
            But virtue never tends to destroy what is itself virtuous ; nor <lb/>
            can what is right be the ruin of the state. Therefore such a <lb/>
            law can never be right; nor can the acts of a tyrant ever be <lb/>
            wrong, for of necessity they must all be just; for, from his <lb/>
            unlimited power, he compels every one to obey his command, <lb/>
            as the multitude oppress the rich. Is it right <lb/>
            then that the rich and few should have the su­ <lb/>
            preme power ? and what if they be guilty of the <lb/>
            2. Or of the <lb/>
            few! <lb/>
            same rapine, and plunder the possessions of the majority, will <lb/>
            this be just ? It will be the same as in the other case; but it <lb/>
            is evident that all things of this sort are wrong and unjust. <lb/>
            Well then, suppose that those of the better sort <lb/>
            shall have the supreme power, must not then all <lb/>
            the other citizens live unhonoured, without sharing <lb/>
            3. Or of the <lb/>
            best ? <lb/>
            the offices of the state ? for the offices of a state we call <lb/>
            honours, and if one set of men are always in power, it is evi­ <lb/>
            dent that the rest must be without honours. Then, will it be <lb/>
            better that the supreme power be in the hands of that one <lb/>
            person who is fittest for it ? but by this means the power will <lb/>
            be still more confined, for a greater number than before will <lb/>
            continue unhonoured. But some one may say, that, in short, <lb/>
            it is wrong that man should have the supreme power rather <lb/>
            than the law, as his soul is subject to so many passions. <lb/>
            But if this law appoints an aristocracy, or a democracy, how <lb/>
            will it help us in our present doubts ? for those things will <lb/>
            happen which we have already mentioned.</p>

            <note type="margin"> [BOOK M. </note> <lb/>
            preme power <lb/>
            with the many. <lb/>
            to be lodged with the many, rather than with those <lb/>
            of the better sort, who are few, there would seem <lb/>
            to be some doubt, though also some truth as well Now, <lb/>
            though each individual of the many may himself be unfit for <lb/>
            the supreme power, yet, when these many are joined together, <lb/>
            it is possible that they may be better qualified for it, than the <lb/>
            others ; and this not separately, but as a collective body. So <lb/>
            the public suppers exceed those which are given at one per­ <lb/>
            sons private expense: for, as they are many, each person <lb/>
            brings in his share of virtue and wisdom ; and thus, coming <lb/>
            together, they are like one man made up of a multitude, with <lb/>
            many feet, many hands, and many senses. Thus is it with <lb/>
            respect to the character and understanding. And for this <lb/>
            reason the many are the best judges of music and poetry ; for <lb/>
            some understand one part, some another, and all collectively <lb/>
            the whole. And in this particular men of consequence differ <lb/>
            from each of the many; as they say those who are beautiful <lb/>
            differ from those who are not so, and as fine pictures excel any <lb/>
            natural objects, by collecting into one the several beautiful <lb/>
            parts which were dispersed among different originals, although <lb/>
            the separate parts of individuals, as the eye or any other part, <lb/>
            may be handsomer than in the picture. But it is not clear <lb/>
            whether it is possible that this distinction should exist between <lb/>
            every people and general assembly, and some few men of con­ <lb/>
            sequence ; but, by heaven, doubtless it is clear enough that, <lb/>
            with respect to a few, it is impossible; since the same conclu­ <lb/>
            sion might be applied even to brutes: and indeed, so to say, <lb/>
            wherein do some men differ from brutes ? But nothing pre­ <lb/>
            vents what I have said being true of the people in some states.</p>
          <p>The question <lb/>
            decided.</p>
          <p>The doubt, then, which we have lately proposed, <lb/>
            with that which is its consequence, may be settled <lb/>
            in this manner; it is necessary that the freemen <lb/>
            and the bulk of the people should have absolute power in some <lb/>
            things; but these are such as are not men of property, nor <lb/>
            have they any reputation for virtue. And so it is not safe to <lb/>
            trust them with the first offices in the state, both on account <lb/>
            of their injustice and their ignorance ; from the one of which <note type="footnote"> 1 In Bekker's text the words stand thus, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δόξειεν</foreign> av <foreign xml:lang="grc">λύεσθαι</foreign> Kai <foreign xml:lang="grc">τιν' <lb/>

            they are likely to do what is wrong, from the <lb/>
            other to make mistakes. And yet it is dangerous to <lb/>
            allow them no power or share in the government ;1 <lb/>
            for when there are many poor people who are <lb/>
            The people <lb/>
            should be su­ <lb/>
            preme in some <lb/>
            things, but not <lb/>
            in others. <lb/>
            excluded from office, the state must necessarily have very <lb/>
            many enemies in it. It remains, then, that they should have <lb/>
            a place in the public assemblies, and in determining causes. <lb/>
            And for this reason Socrates and some other legislators give <lb/>
            them the power of electing the officers of the state, and also <lb/>
            of inquiring into their conduct after their term of office, but <lb/>
            do not allow them to act as magistrates by themselves. For the <lb/>
            multitude, when they are collected together, have <lb/>
            all of them sufficient understanding for these pur­ <lb/>
            poses, and by mixing among those of higher rank <lb/>
            An union of the <lb/>
            many with the <lb/>
            few, desirable. <lb/>
            are serviceable to the state; as some things which alone are <lb/>
            improper for food, when mixed with others, make the whole <lb/>
            more wholesome than a few of them would be; though each <lb/>
            individual is unfit to form a judgment by himself. But there <lb/>
            is a difficulty attending this form of government; for it seems <lb/>
            that the same person, who himself was capable of curing any <lb/>
            one who was then sick, must be the best judge who to employ <lb/>
            as a physician; but such a one must be himself a physician. <lb/>
            And the same holds true in every other practice and art: <lb/>
            and as a physician ought to give an account of his practice <lb/>
            to physicians, so ought it to be in other arts. But phy­ <lb/>
            sicians are of three sorts; the first makes up the medicines; <lb/>
            the second prescribes; the third understands the science, <lb/>
            but never practises it. Now these three distinctions may be <lb/>
            found in those who understand all other arts; and we have no <lb/>
            less opinion of their judgment who are only instructed in the <lb/>
            principles of the art, than of those who practise it. And <lb/>
            with respect to elections the same would seem to <lb/>
            hold true ; for to elect a proper person in any line, <lb/>
            is the business of those who are skilled in it; as <lb/>
            in geometry, it is the part of geometricians, and of <lb/>
            Who should <lb/>
            have the power <lb/>
            of electing <lb/>
            magistrates f <lb/>
            steersmen in the art of steering. But even if some individuals <lb/>
            do know something of particular arts and works, they do not <lb/>
            know more than the professors of them; so that, even upon <note type="footnote"> I Instances in point here may be found in the annals of our own <lb/>
            country. </note> <pb n="104"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK III. </note> <lb/>
            this principle, neither the election of magistrates, nor the cen­ <lb/>
            sure of their conduct, should be intrusted to the many. But <lb/>
            possibly much that has been here said may not be right; for, <lb/>
            to resume the argument lately used, if the people are not very <lb/>
            brutal indeed, although we allow that each individual knows <lb/>
            less of these affairs than those who have given particular <lb/>
            attention to them, yet when they come together they will <lb/>
            know them better, or at least not worse: besides, in some <lb/>
            particular arts it is not the workman only who is the best <lb/>
            judge, as in those the works of which are understood by those <lb/>
            who do not profess them. Thus he who builds a house is not <lb/>
            the only judge of it, (for the master of the family who inhabits <lb/>
            it is a better one;) thus also a steersman is a better judge of <lb/>
            a tiller than he who made it, and he who gives an entertain­ <lb/>
            ment than the cook. What has been said seems a sufficient <lb/>
            solution of this difficulty ; but there is another that follows : <lb/>
            for it seems absurd that greater power in the state should be <lb/>
            lodged with the bad than with the good. Now the power of <lb/>
            election and censure are of the very utmost consequence, and <lb/>
            this, as has been said, in some states they intrust to the people ; <lb/>
            for the general assembly is the supreme court of all. And <lb/>
            yet they have a voice in this court, and deliberate on all public <lb/>
            affairs, and try all causes, without any objection to the mean­ <lb/>
            ness of their circumstances, and at any age: but their quæs­ <lb/>
            tors, generals, and other great officers of state are taken from <lb/>
            The question <lb/>
            determined. <lb/>
            men of high condition. This difficulty, then, may <lb/>
            be solved upon the same principle ; and here too <lb/>
            they may be right. For the power is not in the <lb/>
            man who is member of the assembly or council, but in the <lb/>
            assembly itself, and in the council and people, of which each <lb/>
            individual of the whole community forms a part, as senator, <lb/>
            adviser, or judge. And for this reason it is very right that <lb/>
            the many should have the greatest powers in their own hands ; <lb/>
            for the people, the council, and the judges are composed of <lb/>
            them, and the property of all these collectively is more than <lb/>
            the property of any person, or of a few who fill the great <lb/>
            offices of the state : and thus let us determine these points.</p>
          <p>But the first question that we stated shows nothing besides <lb/>
            Supremacy of <lb/>
            the law. <lb/>
            so plainly, as that the supreme power should be <lb/>
            lodged in laws duly made, and that the magistrate, <lb/>
            or magistrates, (either one or more,) should be <pb n="105"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. XII.] </note> <lb/>
            authorized to determine those cases on which the laws cannot <lb/>
            define particularly; as it is impossible for them, in general <lb/>
            language, to explain themselves upon every thing that may <lb/>
            arise. But what these laws are, which are established upon <lb/>
            the best foundations, has not been yet explained, but still <lb/>
            remains a matter of some question: but the laws of every <lb/>
            state will necessarily be like the state itself, either trifling or <lb/>
            excellent, just or unjust; for it is evident, that the <lb/>
            laws which are framed, must correspond to the <lb/>
            constitution of the government; and, if so, it is <lb/>
            Laws good or <lb/>
            bad, a test of <lb/>
            governments. <lb/>
            plain, that a well-formed government will have good laws, a <lb/>
            bad one, bad ones.</p>

          <p>SINCE in every art and science the end aimed at <lb/>
            is always good, the greatest good is particularly <lb/>
            the end of that which is the most excellent of all, <lb/>
            and this is the political science : the political <lb/>
            The chief good <lb/>
            the end of the <lb/>
            political sci­ <lb/>
            ence. <lb/>
            good is justice ; for this, in other words, is the interest of all. <lb/>
            Now, it is the common opinion, that justice is a certain equal­ <lb/>
            ity ; and up to a certain point men agree with the teaching of <lb/>
            philosophers, when they lay down definitions of morals : for <lb/>
            they say what is just, and to whom; and that equals ought <lb/>
            to receive equal; but we should know how to determine of <lb/>
            what things there is equality, and of what there is an in­ <lb/>
            equality ; and in this there is some difficulty, which calls for <lb/>
            the philosophy of the writer on morals. Some persons will <lb/>
            probably say that the offices of state ought unequally to be <lb/>
            given according to every particular excellence of each citizen, <lb/>
            if there is no other difference between them and <lb/>
            the rest of the community, but they are in every <lb/>
            respect else alike: for to persons who differ from <lb/>
            Justice abso­ <lb/>
            lute and rela­ <lb/>
            tive. <lb/>
            each other, justice is one thing and that which is according <lb/>
            to worth is another. But if this is admitted to be true, com­ <lb/>
            plexion, or height, or any such advantage will be made by <lb/>
            the superiors a means of grasping for a greater share of the <lb/>
            public rights. But, surely, this is evidently absurd; as is <lb/>
            clear from the other arts and sciences; for with respect to <lb/>
            musicians who are equal in their art, the best flute is not to <lb/>
            be given to those who are of the best family, for they will <pb n="106"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK III. </note> <lb/>
            play never the better for that, but the best instrument ought <lb/>
            to be given to him who is the best artist. But if what is now <lb/>
            said does not make this clear, we will explain it still further: <lb/>
            if there should be any one who is a very excellent player on <lb/>
            the flute, but very deficient in family and beauty, (though each <lb/>
            of these are more valuable endowments than a skill in music, <lb/>
            and excel this art in a higher degree than that player excels <lb/>
            others,) yet the best flutes ought to he given to him ; for the <lb/>
            superiority in beauty and fortune should have a reference to <lb/>
            the business in hand; but these have none. Moreover, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to this reasoning, every possible excellence might be <lb/>
            brought into comparison with every other; for if some bodily <lb/>
            strength might dispute the point with riches or liberty, even <lb/>
            any amount of strength might do it; so that if one person <lb/>
            excelled in size more than another did in virtue, and if, in <lb/>
            short, bodily size was a thing more excellent than virtue, all <lb/>
            things must then admit of a comparison with each other. For <lb/>
            if such a size is greater than virtue by so much, it is evident <lb/>
            that another size must be equal to it. Since, however, this <lb/>
            is impossible, it is plain that it would be contrary to common <lb/>
            sense to dispute a right to any office in the state according to <lb/>
            every point of superiority whatsoever: for if one set of persons <lb/>
            be slow, and another swift, neither are the one better qualified, <lb/>
            A claim to <lb/>
            office must be <lb/>
            based on due <lb/>
            qualification <lb/>
            for the particu­ <lb/>
            la' place. <lb/>
            nor the other worse, on that account; though in <lb/>
            the gymnastic races a difference in these particu­ <lb/>
            lars will gain the prize ; but a pretension to offices <lb/>
            of state should be founded on those qualifications <lb/>
            which are part of itself. And for this reason, men <lb/>
            of family, independence, and fortune, with great propriety <lb/>
            contend with each other for office; for those who hold office <lb/>
            ought to be persons of independence and property: for a state <lb/>
            can no more consist of all poor men, than it can of all slaves. <lb/>
            But although such persons are requisite, it is evident that <lb/>
            there is an equal need of justice and military valour. For <lb/>
            without justice and valour, no state can be supported; just as <lb/>
            without the former class a state cannot exist, and without the <lb/>
            latter it cannot be well governed.</p><pb n="107"/>

          <p>IT seems then requisite that all, or at least many, <lb/>
            of these points should vie together towards the <lb/>
            establishment of a state; but virtue and education <lb/>
            may most justly dispute the right of being consi- <lb/>
            Virtue and <lb/>
            education the <lb/>
            means towards <lb/>
            happiness. <lb/>
            dered as the necessary means of enabling the citizens to live <lb/>
            well, as we have already said. But as those who are equal in one <lb/>
            particular need not therefore be equal in all, and those who <lb/>
            are unequal in one particular need not therefore be unequal <lb/>
            in all; it follows of necessity, that all governments which are <lb/>
            established upon such a principle are erroneous. We have <lb/>
            already said that all the members of the commu­ <lb/>
            nity will dispute with each other for the offices of <lb/>
            the state; and to a certain extent justly, but ab­ <lb/>
            stractedly not so in general; the rich, for instance, <lb/>
            Rival clahns to <lb/>
            office. <lb/>
            Of the rich. <lb/>
            because they have the greatest landed property, and because <lb/>
            the ultimate right to the soil is vested in the community; and <lb/>
            also because their fidelity in contracts is in general most to be <lb/>
            depended on. The freemen and men of family <lb/>
            will dispute the point with each other, as nearly <lb/>
            Of the noble. <lb/>
            on an equality; for these latter have a right to higher regard <lb/>
            as citizens than obscure persons: for honourable descent is <lb/>
            every where of great esteem ; and further, it is reasonable to <lb/>
            expect that the descendants of men of worth will be men of <lb/>
            worth themselves; for noble birth is the virtue of a family. <lb/>
            For the same reason also we shall justly say that <lb/>
            virtue has a right to put in her pretensions; for <lb/>
            Of thevirtuous. <lb/>
            justice, we say, is a social virtue, and all others must yield <lb/>
            her the precedence. Let us now see what the <lb/>
            many have to urge on their side against the few; <lb/>
            Of the many. <lb/>
            they may say, that if each are collectively taken and compared, <lb/>
            the many are stronger, richer, and better than the others. <lb/>
            But should it ever happen that all these should inhabit the <lb/>
            same city, I mean the good, the rich, the noble, as well as <note type="footnote"> 1 This is but another form of the old proverb, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξ ἀγαθω̃ν ἀγαθούς</foreign>. <lb/>

            the many, such as usually make up the community, I ask, <lb/>
            will there be any reason to dispute concerning who shall <lb/>
            govern, or will there not ? for in every community which we <lb/>
            have mentioned, there is no dispute as to who ought to rule ; <lb/>
            for they differ from each other in those who have the chiet <lb/>
            power. For in one state the rich enjoy it, in another the me­ <lb/>
            ritorious, and thus, each according to their separate manners. <lb/>
            Certain diffi­ <lb/>
            culties solved. <lb/>
            Let us however consider what is to be done when <lb/>
            all these happen at the same time to inhabit the <lb/>
            city. If the virtuous should be very few in num­ <lb/>
            her, how shall we then decide ? shall we direct our attention <lb/>
            to their fewness as compared with their work, if they are <lb/>
            capable of governing the state ? or should they be so many as <lb/>
            to compose a state ? There is also a doubt concerning the <lb/>
            pretensions of all those who claim the honours of government: <lb/>
            for those who found them either on their fortune or their <lb/>
            family would seem to have nothing which they can justly say <lb/>
            in their defence; since it is evident upon their principle, that <lb/>
            if any one person can be found richer than all the rest, the <lb/>
            right of governing all these will be justly vested in this one <lb/>
            person. In the same manner, one man who is of the best <lb/>
            family will claim it from those who dispute the point upon <lb/>
            family merit; and probably in an aristocracy the same dispute <lb/>
            might arise on the score of virtue; for if there is one man <lb/>
            better than all the other men of worth, who are in the same <lb/>
            community, it is requisite on the same plea of justice, that he <lb/>
            should enjoy the supreme power. In like manner also, while <lb/>
            the many suppose that they ought to have the supreme com­ <lb/>
            mand, as being more powerful than the few, if one, or more <lb/>
            than one, though it be a small number, should be found <lb/>
            stronger than themselves, these ought rather to have it than <lb/>
            they. All these things seem to make it plain, that none of <lb/>
            these principles are justly founded, on which these persons <lb/>
            would establish their right to the supreme power, and that <lb/>
            all men whatsoever ought to obey them; for with respect to <lb/>
            those who claim it as due to their virtue or their fortune, the <lb/>
            multitude might justly have some objection to make, which <lb/>
            they could jointly urge against them ; for nothing hinders but <lb/>
            that it may sometimes happen, that the many may be better <lb/>
            or richer than the few, not as individuals, but in their col­ <lb/>
            lective capacity. As to the doubt which some persons raise <pb n="109"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. XIII. J </note> <lb/>
            and propose, we may answer it in this manner; <lb/>
            it is this, whether a legislator who would estab­ <lb/>
            lish the most perfect system of laws, should cal­ <lb/>
            culate them for the use of the better part of the <lb/>
            citizens, or of the many, under the circumstances <lb/>
            Should a legis­ <lb/>
            later lay down <lb/>
            laws for the <lb/>
            benefit of the <lb/>
            many, or of the <lb/>
            few ? <lb/>
            we have already mentioned? The rectitude of any thing <lb/>
            must be assumed to consist in its equality; that therefore <lb/>
            which is equally right, will be advantageous to the whole state, <lb/>
            and to every member of it in common. Now, in general, a <lb/>
            citizen is one who shares in the government, and also in his <lb/>
            turn submits to be governed; but his condition is different in <lb/>
            different states; the best is that in which a man is enabled to <lb/>
            choose both to govern and to be governed with regard to <lb/>
            virtue during his whole life. But should there be found one <lb/>
            person, or a very few, eminent for an uncommon degree of <lb/>
            virtue, though not enough to make up a civil state, so that <lb/>
            the virtue or political abilities of the many are unable to come <lb/>
            into comparison with theirs, if more than one; or <lb/>
            if there be but one, with his abilities alone ; such <lb/>
            are not to be considered as part of the state; for <lb/>
            it would be doing them injustice to rate them on <lb/>
            How to deal <lb/>
            with the per­ <lb/>
            fectly virtuous <lb/>
            man. <lb/>
            a level with those who are so far their inferiors in virtue and <lb/>
            political abilities; for it is fit that such an one should appear <lb/>
            to them like a god amongst men.1 Hence it is evident, that a <lb/>
            system of laws must be calculated for those who are equal to <lb/>
            each other in nature and power. Such men therefore are <lb/>
            not the object of law, for they are themselves a law; and it <lb/>
            would be ridiculous in any one to endeavour to include them <lb/>
            in legislation; for probably they might say what Antisthenes <lb/>
            tells us the lions did to the hares, when they harangued and <lb/>
            demanded an equal share with them in the government. And <lb/>
            it is on this account that democratic states have <lb/>
            established Ostracism;2 for of a truth equality <lb/>
            seems the principal object of their government. <lb/>

            And for this reason they ostracise all those who are very <lb/>
            eminent for their power, their fortune, their friendships, or <lb/>
            any other cause which may give them too great weight in the <lb/>
            government, and force them to leave the city for a stated <lb/>
            time ; as the fabulous histories relate the Argonauts left Her­ <lb/>
            cules behind, for they were unwilling that he should command <lb/>
            the ship Argo together with the rest, because he excelled the <lb/>
            other sailors in valour. For which reason those who hate a <lb/>
            tyranny, and find fault with the advice which Periander gave <lb/>
            to Thrasybulus,l must not think that they are wholly right in <lb/>
            their course. For the story goes, that Periander said nothing <lb/>
            to the messenger sent to him with reference to the matter of <lb/>
            advice, but that he struck off those ears of corn which were <lb/>
            higher than the rest, and so reduced the whole crop to a level; <lb/>
            so that the messenger, without knowing the cause of what <note type="footnote">whereas the ostracised did not; the former also had no fixed place of <lb/>
            abode, or time of return, but the latter had. This ostracism is supposed <lb/>
            by some to have been instituted by Cleisthenes, after the expulsion of the <lb/>
            Pisistratidæ. It is well known, as Aristotle implies here in the text, that <lb/>
            ostracism was not a punishment of any crime, but rather a precautionary <lb/>
            removal of those who possessed sufficient power in the state to excite <lb/>
            either envy or fear. Thus Plutarch says (Pericl. ch. x.) that it was a <lb/>
            good-natured way of allaying envy, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">φθόνου παϱαμυθία φιλάνθρωπος</foreign>) by <lb/>
            the humiliation of superior dignity and power. The manner of effecting <lb/>
            it was as follows at Athens. A space in the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγοϱὰ</foreign> was enclosed within <lb/>
            barriers, with ten entrances for the ten tribes. By these the tribesmen <lb/>
            entered, each with his <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄστρακον</foreign> or piece of tile, on which was written <lb/>
            the name of the individual whom he wished to be ostracised. The nine <lb/>
            archons and the senate, i. e. the presidents of that body, superintended the <lb/>
            proceedings; and the party who had the greatest number of votes against <lb/>
            him, supposing that this number amounted to 6000, was obliged to with­ <lb/>
            draw from the city within ten days; but if the number of votes did not <lb/>
            amount to 6000, nothing was done. The expelled was not deprived of <lb/>
            his property .... some of the most distinguished men at Athens were <lb/>
            removed by ostracism, but recalled when the city found their services in­ <lb/>
            dispensable. Amongst these were Themistocles, Alcibiades, Cimon, and <lb/>
            Aristides. . . . . The last person against whom ostracism was used at <lb/>
            Athens was Hyperbolus, a demagogue of low birth and character; but <lb/>
            the Athenians thought their dignity compromised, and ostracism degraded <lb/>
            by such an application of it, and accordingly discontinued the practice. <lb/>
            (Plut. Arist. c. 7. Thucyd. viii. 73.) Ostracism prevailed in other do­ <lb/>
            mocratical states as well as at Athens ; as for instance at Argos, Miletus, <lb/>
            and Megara; and from it was copied the Petalism (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πεταλισμὸς</foreign>) of the <lb/>
            Syracusans, so called from the leaves (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πέταλον</foreign>) of the olive tree, on which <lb/>

            was done, related the fact to Thrasybulus, who understood <lb/>
            from it that he must take off all the principal men in the city. <lb/>
            Nor is this serviceable to tyrants only, nor is it <lb/>
            tyrants only who do it; for the same thing is <lb/>
            practised both in oligarchies and democracies: <lb/>
            for the ostracism has in a manner nearly the same <lb/>
            power, by restraining and banishing those who <lb/>
            The same prin­ <lb/>
            ciple prevails <lb/>
            in tyrannies, <lb/>
            oligarchies, <lb/>
            and democra­ <lb/>
            cies. <lb/>
            are too great. And the very same thing is done also by those <lb/>
            who have the supreme power in the cities and separate states ; <lb/>
            as by the Athenians, with respect to the Samians, the Chians, <lb/>
            and the Lesbians ; 1 for when suddenly they had acquired a <lb/>
            firm sway over Greece, they brought the other states into <lb/>
            subjection, contrary to the treaties which subsisted between <lb/>
            them. The king of Persia also very often has reduced the <lb/>
            Medes and Babylonians, when they have assumed a tone of <lb/>
            arrogance on account of their former power. And this is a <lb/>
            principle on which all governments act, even those which are <lb/>
            best administered: those which are corrupted do it for the <lb/>
            sake of private utility, and this also takes place in like man­ <lb/>
            ner in polities which look to the common good. The same <lb/>
            thing is to be perceived in the other arts and sciences; for a <lb/>
            painter would not represent an animal with a foot large be­ <lb/>
            yond proportion, though he had drawn it remarkably beau­ <lb/>
            tiful ; nor would the shipwright make the prow, or any other <lb/>
            part of the vessel, larger than it ought to be ; nor will the mas­ <lb/>
            ter of the chorus permit any one who sings louder and better <lb/>
            than the rest, to sing in concert with them. There is there­ <lb/>
            fore no reason why a monarch should not act in agreement <lb/>
            with free states, to support his own power, if they do the <lb/>
            same thing for the benefit of their respective communities; <lb/>
            upon which account when there is any acknowledged disparity <lb/>
            in the power of the citizens, the reason upon which the ostra­ <lb/>
            cism is founded will be politically just. It is <lb/>
            better indeed for the legislator so to establish his <lb/>
            state at the beginning as not to want this remedy: <lb/>
            Prevention <lb/>
            better than <lb/>
            cure. <lb/>
            but, in the second place, if in course of time such an incon­ <lb/>
            venience should arise, to endeavour to amend it by some such <lb/>
            correction. This certainly was not done in the states; for <note type="footnote"> 1 For an account of the growth of the Athenian <foreign xml:lang="grc">άρχή</foreign>after the Persian <lb/>

            they did not regard the benefit of their respective communinet, <lb/>
            but used the ostracism for party purposes.1 It is evident, <lb/>
            then, that in corrupt governments it is partly just and useful <lb/>
            in an individual case, though probably it is as clear that it is <lb/>
            not absolutely just: for in a well-governed state there may <lb/>
            be great doubts about the use of it, not on account of the su­ <lb/>

            but when the point of superiority is virtue, what then is to be <lb/>
            done ? for it seems not right to turn out such a person, and <lb/>
            to banish him; neither does it seem right to subject him to <lb/>
            control; for that would be like desiring to share the power <lb/>
            with Jupiter, and to govern him. Nothing then remains but <lb/>
            The perfectly <lb/>
            virtuous cha­ <lb/>
            racter to be <lb/>
            chosen king. <lb/>
            what indeed seems natural, and that is, for all <lb/>
            persons quietly to submit to one who is thus emi­ <lb/>
            nently virtuous, and to let such men be perpetu­ <lb/>

          <p>Monarchy.</p>
          <p>AFTER what has been now said, it would seem <lb/>
            proper to change our subject, and to inquire into <lb/>
            the nature of a monarchy; for we admit this to be one of <lb/>
            those species of government which are properly founded. And <lb/>
            here let us consider, whether a kingly government is proper <lb/>
            or not for a city or country which desires to be well governed, <lb/>
            or whether some other polity is proper. But let us first deter­ <lb/>
            mine whether this is of one kind only or more. Now it is easy <lb/>
            Of many kinds. <lb/>
            Ist, At Sparta. <lb/>
            enough to perceive that it consists of many dif­ <lb/>
            ferent species, and that the forms of government <lb/>
            are not the same in all states; for at Sparta the <lb/>
            kingly power seems chiefly regulated by the laws;2 for it is <note type="footnote"> 1 See note above, p. 109, ] 1C </note><note type="footnote"> 2 With respect to the nature of the sovereignty in Doric states in ge­ <lb/>
            neral, as well as at Sparta in particular, see Müller's Dorians, vol. ii. ch. <lb/>
            vi. As to the power of the kings of Sparta, Muller observes that it " de­ <lb/>
            rived additional strength from the fabulous notion that the conquest of the <lb/>
            country had originated from the royal family." In war they had liberty <lb/>
            to sacrifice, (see Herod. vi. 46,) and it consequently follows that they pre­ <lb/>
            sided over the entire worship of the army, being both priests and princes, <lb/>
            .ike the Agamemnon of Homer, or like Anius in Virgil, <lb/>
            " Hex Anius, rex idem hominum, Phœbique sacerdos." <lb/>
            They considered the kingly power as proceeding from the Deity, and not <unclear/> <lb/>
            originating from the people. The constitutional powers of the kings at </note> <pb n="113"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. XIV.] </note> <lb/>
            not supreme in all circumstances; but when the king quits <lb/>
            the territories of the state, he is their general in matters of <lb/>
            war; and all religious affairs are intrusted to the king. In­ <lb/>
            deed, the kingly power with them is chiefly that of a general <lb/>
            who cannot be called to account for his conduct, and whose <lb/>
            command is for life: for he has not the power of life and <lb/>
            death, except as a general; as the ancients frequently had <lb/>
            in their expeditions by martial law, which we learn from <lb/>
            Homer; for when Agamemnon was affronted in the council, he <lb/>
            restrained his resentment, but when he was in the field, he <lb/>
            had the power of life and death. At any rate, he says, <lb/>
            " Whoe'er this day shall shun th' impending fight, <lb/>
            To dogs and vultures soon shall be a prey; <lb/>
            For in my hands is death." II. v. 391.</p>
          <p>This then is one species of monarchical government, in which <lb/>
            a man is made general for life ; and it is sometimes hereditary, <lb/>
            sometimes elective. But besides this, there is <lb/>
            also another, which is to be met with among some <lb/>
            of the barbarians. In these states the kings are <lb/>
            2nd. Among <lb/>
            barbarous <lb/>
            tribes. <lb/>
            invested with powers nearly equal to those of a tyrant, yet are <lb/>
            they nevertheless bound by the laws and the customs of their <lb/>
            country. For as the barbarians 1 are by nature more prone to <lb/>
            slavery than the Greeks, and those about Asia more than <lb/>
            those in Europe, they endure a despotic government without <lb/>
            murmuring. For this reason their governments are tyran­ <lb/>
            nical ; but yet not liable to be overthrown, as being customary <note type="footnote"> Sparta were inconsiderable, when compared with their dignity and hon­ <lb/>
            ours. The two kings were members of the gerusia, but as such they had <lb/>
            only single votes. The greater part of their prerogative was their power <lb/>
            in foreign affairs. The kings of Sparta were the commanders of the Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnesian confederacy; and limited as was his power at home, as soon as <lb/>
            the king had assumed the command of the army, and had crossed the <lb/>
            boundaries, he became general with unlimited powers. It appears that <lb/>
            the political sagacity was almost past belief with which the ancient con­ <lb/>
            stitution of Sparta protected the power, dignity, and welfare of the office <lb/>
            of a king, yet without suffering it to grow into a despotism, or placing <lb/>
            the king in any one point above the law. And so, without endangering <lb/>
            the liberty of the state, a royal race was maintained, which, blending the <lb/>
            pride of their own family with the national feelings, produced, for a long <lb/>
            succession of years, monarchs of a noble and patriotic disposition. (Vol. <lb/>
            ii. book iii. chap. 6.) See also Herod. vi. 57, and Thucyd. i. 20. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Compare the statement of Aristotle above, book i. ch. 2. </note> <note type="footnote"> I </note> <pb n="114"/>

            and according to law. Their guards also are such as are used <lb/>
            in a kingly government, not in a despotic one; for the guards <lb/>
            of kings are composed of his citizens, but those of a tyrant are <lb/>
            foreign mercenaries. The one according to law rules over <lb/>
            willing subjects; the other arbitrarily rules over those who <lb/>
            consent not. The one therefore is guarded by the citizens, <lb/>
            3rd. Elective <lb/>
            tyrannies in <lb/>
            ancient Greece. <lb/>
            the other against them. These, then, are two <lb/>
            different sorts of monarchies; and another is that <lb/>
            which, among the ancient Greeks, is called an <lb/>
            JEsymnety ; 1 which, speaking simply, is nothing more than an <lb/>
            elective tyranny; and its difference from that which is to be <lb/>
            found amongst the barbarians, consists not in its not being <lb/>
            according to law, but only in its not being according to an­ <lb/>
            cient customs. Some persons possessed this power for life, <lb/>
            others only for a particular time or purpose; as the people of <lb/>
            Mitylene elected Pittacus to oppose the exiles, who were <lb/>
            headed by Antimenides and Alcæus the poet. And Alcæus <lb/>
            himself, in one of his songs, proves this fact; for he upbraids <lb/>
            the Mitylenians for having chosen Pittacus for their tyrant, <lb/>
            and with one voice extolling him to the skies, though he was <lb/>
            the ruin of a senseless and devoted people. These sorts of <lb/>
            government then are, and ever were, despotic, on account of <lb/>
            their being tyrannies ; but inasmuch as they are elective, and <lb/>
            4th. The heroic. <lb/>
            over willing subjects, they are also kingly. A <lb/>
            fourth species of kingly government is that which <lb/>
            was in use in the heroic times, when a free people submitted <lb/>
            to a kingly government, according to the laws and customs <lb/>
            of their country.2 For those who were at first of benefit to <note type="footnote"> 1 The <foreign xml:lang="grc">αισυμ</foreign>v<foreign xml:lang="grc">ήτης</foreign>was an individual sometimes invested with unlimited <lb/>
            power in the Greek states. His power, according to Aristotle in this <lb/>
            place, partook in some degree of the nature both of kingly and tyrannical <lb/>
            authority; since he was appointed legally, and did not usurp the govern­ <lb/>
            ment like a <foreign xml:lang="grc">τύρα</foreign>vv<foreign xml:lang="grc">ος</foreign>. but at the same time was not bound by any laws <lb/>
            in his public administration. Hence Aristotle and Theophrastus call the <lb/>
            office <foreign xml:lang="grc">τύρα</foreign>vv<foreign xml:lang="grc">ιςαιρετή</foreign>. It was not hereditary, nor was it held for life; <lb/>
            but it only continued for a certain time, or till some object was accom­ <lb/>
            plished. Thus we read that the inhabitants of Mitylene appointed Pittacus <lb/>
            to the post of <foreign xml:lang="grc">αισ</foreign>u<foreign xml:lang="grc">μ</foreign>v<foreign xml:lang="grc">ήτης</foreign>,in order to prevent the return of Alcæus and <lb/>
            the other tribes. Dionysius compares it with the dictatorship at Rome <lb/>
            In some states, such as Cyrene and Chalcedon, it was the title bore by the <lb/>
            regular magistrates. (Diet. of Gr. and Rom. Antiq.) The verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">αισυμ</foreign>­ <lb/>
            v<foreign xml:lang="grc">άω</foreign>, used in the wider and more general sense of ruling, occurs in Eurip, <lb/>

            mankind either in arts or arms, or by collecting them into <lb/>
            civilsociety, or by granting them possessions, became kings <lb/>
            over a willing people, and handed on the monarchy to their <lb/>
            successors. 1 They were also their generals in war, and pre­ <lb/>
            sided over their sacrifices, excepting such only as belonged to <lb/>
            the priests : in addition to this they were supreme judges in <lb/>
            lawsuits; and in this case some of them took an oath, others <lb/>
            did not; when they did, the form of swearing was by lifting <lb/>
            up their sceptre. In ancient times the power of <lb/>
            the kings extended to every thing whatsoever, <lb/>
            both civil, domestic, and foreign ; but in after- <lb/>
            Kingly power <lb/>
            gradually <lb/>
            abridged. <lb/>
            times they relinquished some of their privileges, and others <lb/>
            the people assumed; so that, in some states, they left their <lb/>
            kings only the right of presiding over the sacrifices; and <lb/>
            even those whom it is worth while to call by that name, <lb/>
            had only the right of being commander-in-chief in their foreign <lb/>
            wars. These then are the four sorts of kingdoms : <lb/>
            the first is that of the heroic times ; which was a <lb/>
            Recapitulation. <lb/>
            government over a free people, with limited rights in some <lb/>
            particulars ; for the king was their general, their judge, and <lb/>
            their high priest.3 The second, that of the barbarians; <lb/>
            which is an hereditary despotic government, regulated by <lb/>
            laws: the third is that which they call Æsymnetic, which is <lb/>
            an elective tyranny. The fourth is the Lacedaemonian ; and <lb/>
            this, in a few words, is nothing more than an hereditary ge­ <lb/>
            neralship : and in these particulars they differ from each other. <lb/>
            There is a fifth species of kingly government, which is where <note type="footnote"> ture of the ancient monarchies of Greece. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρότερο</foreign>v<foreign xml:lang="grc">δὲὴσα</foreign>v<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶῥητοι̃ς <lb/>

              those things which belong to the public: for as the master <lb/>

          <p>The four kinds <lb/>
            may be re­ <lb/>
            duced to two. <lb/>
            The first and <lb/>
            fourth.</p>
          <p>Now the different sorts of kingly governments, so <lb/>
            to say, may be reduced to two; which we must <lb/>
            consider more particularly; that of which we have <lb/>
            spoken, and the Lacedaemonian ; for the greater <lb/>
            part of the others lie between these, inasmuch as they have <lb/>
            less power than an absolute monarchy, and yet more than the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians. So that the matter in question may be re­ <lb/>
            duced to these two points ; the one is, whether it is advan­ <lb/>
            tageous or not to the citizens to have the office of general con­ <lb/>
            tinued in one person for life, and whether this should be by <lb/>
            family right to the succession; the other, whether it is advan­ <lb/>
            tageous for one person to have the supreme power over every <lb/>
            The former <lb/>
            postponed. <lb/>
            thing or not. But to enter into the particulars <lb/>
            concerning the office of a Lacedaemonian general, <lb/>
            would concern a treatise on laws rather than to <lb/>
            political science; since we know that this is what is done in <lb/>
            all forms of governments ; so that we must pass over this <lb/>
            The latter con­ <lb/>
            sidered. <lb/>
            question, The other kind of monarchy is a regu­ <lb/>
            lar kind of polity; and it will be necessary to <lb/>
            examine particularly into this matter, and to run <lb/>
            over such difficulties as may arise. Now the beginning of our <lb/>
            consideration is this, whether it is best to be governed by the <lb/>
            Reasons for <lb/>
            approving <lb/>
            monarchy. <lb/>
            best of men, or by the best of laws ? Those who <lb/>
            prefer a kingly government think that laws only <lb/>
            speak a general language, but cannot adapt them­ <lb/>
            selves to particular circumstances; for which reason it is <lb/>
            absurd in any science to follow a mere written rule ; and even <lb/>
            in Egypt the physician was allowed to alter the mode of cure <lb/>
            which the law prescribed to him, after the fourth day; but if <lb/>
            he did it sooner it was at his own peril. Hence it is evident, <lb/>
            on the very same account, that a government according to <lb/>
            written laws is not the best; and yet general reasoning is <lb/>
            necessary to all those who are to govern, and it will be much <pb n="117"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. XV.] </note> <lb/>
            more perfect in him who is entirely free from passions, than <lb/>
            in him to whom they are natural. In the law indeed this <lb/>
            quality does not exist; while the other of necessity belongs to <lb/>
            every human soul. But some one perchance may say, in <lb/>
            answer to this, that man will be a better judge of particulars. <lb/>
            It will be necessary, then, for a king to be a legislator, and <lb/>
            that his laws should be published, but that they should have <lb/>
            no authority where they are absurd, but that in all other cases <lb/>
            they should have authority. But is it better for the commu­ <lb/>
            nity that those things which cannot possibly come under the <lb/>
            cognizance of the law at all, or properly, should be under the <lb/>
            government of every worthy citizen ? for at the present day <lb/>
            they come together, and act as judges and counsellors, and <lb/>
            decide cases; but all their decisions are upon particular mat­ <lb/>
            ters.l For one individual, be he who he will, will <lb/>
            be found upon comparison inferior to a whole <lb/>
            people taken collectively: but a state, as composed <lb/>
            Contrary <lb/>
            reasons. <lb/>
            of many, is, as a public entertainment, better than one man s <lb/>
            portion ; for which reason the multitude judge of many things <lb/>
            better than any one single person. The multitude are also <lb/>
            less liable to corruption; as water is from its quantity, so are <lb/>
            the many less liable to corruption than the few : besides, the <lb/>
            judgment of an individual must necessarily be perverted, if he <lb/>
            is overcome by anger, or any other passion ; but it would be <lb/>
            hard indeed if the whole community should be misled by <lb/>
            anger. Moreover, let the people be composed of freemen, who <lb/>
            do nothing contrary to the law, except only in those cases <lb/>
            which the law necessarily omits. But though the following <lb/>
            may not easily be met with, yet if the majority of the state <lb/>
            should happen to be good men, should one uncorrupt governor <lb/>
            be preferred, or the majority who are all equally good ? Is it <lb/>
            not evident that the many should be preferred ? for there may <lb/>
            be divisions among them, but this cannot happen when there <lb/>
            is but one. In answer to this, it may be replied, that all their <lb/>

            Why an arist­ <lb/>

            able. <lb/>
            Why the an­ <lb/>
            cient states <lb/>
            were under <lb/>
            monarchies. <lb/>
            vernment of one, as a kingly power, it is evident, <lb/>
            that an aristocracy is to be preferred to a monarchy, <lb/>
            whether the state is powerful or not, if many <lb/>
            such persons so alike can be found. And for this <lb/>
            reason probably it was, that the first governments <lb/>
            were generally monarchies; because it was diffi­ <lb/>
            cult to find a number of persons eminently vir­ <lb/>
            tuous,l more particularly as they then dwelt in small commu­ <lb/>
            nities. Besides, kings were appointed in return for the benefits <lb/>
            they had conferred on mankind ; and such actions are peculiar <lb/>
            to good men. But when many persons equal in virtue ap­ <lb/>
            peared at the same time, they brooked not a superiority, but <lb/>
            sought after equality, and established a free stated After <lb/>
            this, when they degenerated, they made a property of the <lb/>
            public; which probably gave rise to oligarchies; for they <lb/>

            changes in an­ <lb/>
            cient govern­ <lb/>
            ments. <lb/>
            made wealth a mark ofhonour. And this was the <lb/>
            origin of tyrannies, and these in their turn gave <lb/>
            rise to democracies ; for as the power of the ty­ <lb/>
            rants continually decreased, on account of their <lb/>
            rapacious avarice, the people grew powerful enough to frame <lb/>
            and establish democracies: and as cities after that happened <lb/>
            to increase, probably it was not easy for any other form of <lb/>
            government to prevail beside a democracy. But if any person <lb/>
            prefers a kingly government in a state, we ask what is to be <note type="footnote"> 1 It is difficult, and indeed impossible, to reconcile this passage with <lb/>
            the assertions of the First Book, as to the natural growth of the monar­ <lb/>

            i. chap. 2. " And hence, by the way, states were originally governed by <lb/>
            kings, as the barbarians now are; for they were composed of those who were <lb/>
            always under kingly government. For every family is governed by the <lb/>
            elder." </note><note type="footnote"> 2Upon the various stages through which the ancient governments of <lb/>
            Greece seem to have passed, by the operation of an almost uniform law, <lb/>
            the reader will do well here to consult the masterly sketch given by Thirl. <lb/>
            wall in his History of Greece, vol. i. chap. 10. The passage would be too <lb/>
            long to be quoted here, though much of its contents will be found em­ <lb/>

            be enough here to quote the author's words as to the real cause of the <lb/>
            abolition of royalty in the early states of Greece, as indeed it was the <lb/>
            cause of all their after-changes. " It is to be sought for," he says, " in <lb/>
            the character of the people: in that same energy and versatility which <lb/>
            prevented it from ever stiffening, even in its infancy, in the mould of <lb/>
            oriental institutions; and from stopping short, in any career which it had <lb/>
            once opened, before it had passed through every stage." </note> <pb n="119"/>

            done with regard to the king's children ? Is the family also <lb/>
            to reign ? But should they have such children as Some liit <lb/>
            some persons usually have, it will be very detri- tions necessary <lb/>
            mental. It may be said, that then the king, who in a monarchy. <lb/>
            has it in his power, will never give his kingdom to such chil­ <lb/>
            dren. But it is not easy to trust to that; for it is very hard, <lb/>
            and requires greater virtue than is to be met with in human <lb/>
            nature. There is also a doubt concerning the power with <lb/>
            which a king should be intrusted, whether he should be allowed <lb/>
            force sufficient to compel those who do not choose to be obe­ <lb/>
            dient to the laws, and how he is to support his government ? <lb/>
            for if he is to govern according to law, and do nothing of his <lb/>
            own will which is contrary thereto, at the same time it will be <lb/>
            necessary that he should have some power with which to <lb/>
            guard the law. This matter however concerning a king may <lb/>
            not be very difficult to determine ; for he ought to have a <lb/>
            proper power, and such a one as will be sufficient to make <lb/>
            the king superior to any one person, or even to a large <lb/>
            part of the Community, but inferior to the whole; j ust as the <lb/>
            ancients always appointed guards for that person whom they <lb/>
            created JEsymnete, or tyrant; and some one advised the Syra­ <lb/>
            cusans, when Dionysius asked for his guards, to allow him <lb/>
            a certain number for his defence.1 <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare here the following passage from Thirlwall's History of <lb/>
            Greece, vol. i. chap. 10. " A tyranny, in the Greek sense of the word. <lb/>
            was the irresponsible dominion of a single person, not founded on heredi­ <lb/>
            tary right, like the monarchies of heroic ages and of many barbarous <lb/>
            nations; nor on a free election, like that of a dictator or an Æsymnete, <lb/>
            but on force. It did not change its character when transmitted through <lb/>
            several generations; nor was any other name invented to describe it, when <lb/>
            the power which had been gained by violence was used for the public <lb/>
            good; though Aristotle makes it an element in the definition of tyranny <lb/>
            that it is exercised for selfish ends Most of the tyrannies which <lb/>
            sprung up before the Persian wars, owed their existence to the cause above <lb/>
            described, and derived their peculiar character from the occasion which <lb/>
            gave them birth. It was usually by a mixture of violence and artifice <lb/>
            that the demagogue accomplished his ends. A hackneyed stratagem, which <lb/>
            however seems always to have been successful, was to feign that his life <lb/>
            was threatened, or had even been attacked, by the fury of the nobles, and <lb/>
            on this pretext to procure a guard for his person from the people. This <lb/>
            band, though composed of citizens, he found it easy to attach to his own <lb/>
            interests, and with its aid he made the first step towards absolute power by <lb/>
            seizing the citadel; an act which might be considered as a formal assump­ <lb/>
            tion of the tyranny, and as declaring a resolution to maintain it by force." </note></p><pb n="120"/>

          <p>An absolute <lb/>
            monarchy con­ <lb/>
            sidered.</p>
          <p>IT follows next in order to consider the absolute <lb/>
            monarch whom we have just mentioned, who does <lb/>
            every thing according to his own will; for a king <lb/>
            governing under the direction of laws does not of himself con­ <lb/>
            stitute any particular species of government, as we have al­ <lb/>
            ready said; for in every state whatsoever, whether an aris­ <lb/>
            tocracy or a democracy, it is easy to appoint a general for life ; <lb/>
            and there are many who intrust the administration of affairs <lb/>
            to one person only; such is the government at Dyrrachium, <lb/>
            and the same at Opus though in a less degree. As for an <lb/>
            absolute monarchy, as it is called, (that is to say, when the <lb/>
            whole state is wholly subject to the will of one person, namely <lb/>
            How far un­ <lb/>
            natural. <lb/>
            the king,) it seems to many to be unnatural that <lb/>
            one man should have the entire rule over his fel­ <lb/>
            low-citizens, when the state consists of equals ; <lb/>
            for nature requires that the same right, and the same rank, <lb/>
            should necessarily exist amongst all those who are equal by na­ <lb/>
            ture ; for as it would be hurtful to the body, for those who <lb/>
            are of different constitutions to observe the same regimen, <lb/>
            either of diet, or clothing ; so with respect to the honours of <lb/>
            the state, it is as hurtful that those who are equal in merit <lb/>
            should be unequal in rank. And for this reason it is as much <lb/>
            a man's duty to submit to command, as to assume it, and this <lb/>
            also by rotation; for this is law, for order is law; and it is <lb/>
            more proper that the law should govern, than any one of the <lb/>
            citizens. Upon the same principle, if it is advantageous to <lb/>
            place the supreme power in some particular persons, they <lb/>
            should be appointed to be only guardians and servants of the <lb/>
            Shall man or <lb/>
            law be su­ <lb/>
            preme ? <lb/>
            laws, for the supreme power must be placed some­ <lb/>
            where ; but they say, that it is unjust that where <lb/>
            all are equal, one person should continually enjoy <lb/>
            it. But man would scarcely be able to adjust that which the <lb/>
            law cannot determine. It may be replied, that the law having <lb/>
            purposely laid down the best rules, leaves the rest to be ad­ <lb/>
            justed by the most fair decision, and to be regulated by the <lb/>
            magistrates ; besides, it allows any thing to be altered, which <lb/>
            experience proves may be better established. Moreover, he <lb/>
            who bids the law to be supreme, makes God supreme, [and <pb n="121"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. XVI.] </note> <lb/>
            the laws ; 1] but he who intrusts man with supreme power, <lb/>
            gives it to a wild beast, for such his appetites sometimes make <lb/>
            him ; passion, too, influences those who are in power, even the <lb/>
            very best of men; for which reason the law is intellect free from <lb/>
            appetite. <unclear>The</unclear> instance taken from the arts seems fallacious: <lb/>
            wherein it is said to be wrong for a sick person to apply for <lb/>
            a remedy to books, but that it would be far more eligible to <lb/>
            employ those who are skilful in physic; for these are not <lb/>
            biassed by any feeling towards their patient to act contrary <lb/>
            to the principles of their art; but when the cure is performed, <lb/>
            they receive a pecuniary recompence: whereas those who <lb/>
            have the management of public affairs, do many things through <lb/>
            hatred or favour. And, as a proof of what we have advanced, <lb/>
            it may be observed, that whenever a sick person suspects that <lb/>
            his physician has been persuaded by his enemies to be guilty <lb/>
            of any foul practice to him in his profession, he then chooses <lb/>
            rather to apply to books for his cure. And not only this, <lb/>
            but even physicians themselves, when they are ill, call in other <lb/>
            physicians: and those who teach others the gymnastic ex­ <lb/>
            ercises practise with those of the same profession, as being <lb/>
            incapable from self-partiality to form a proper judgment of <lb/>
            what concerns themselves. From whence it is evident, that <lb/>
            those who seek for what is just, seek for a mean; now the <lb/>
            law is a mean. Moreover, the moral law is far superior to <lb/>
            the written law, and is conversant with far superior objects; <lb/>
            for the supreme magistrate is safer to be trusted to than the <lb/>
            written one, though he is inferior to the moral law. But as <lb/>
            it is not easy for any one person to have an eye to every thing <lb/>
            himself, it will be necessary that the supreme magistrate <lb/>
            should employ several subordinate ones under him; why then <lb/>
            should not this be done at first, instead of appointing one per­ <lb/>
            son in this manner ? Besides, if, according to what has been <lb/>
            already said, the man of worth is on that account fit to govern, <lb/>
            two men of worth are certainly better than one : as for in­ <lb/>
            stance, in Homer, <lb/>
            " Let two together go : <foreign xml:lang="grc">̓ ̓</foreign>2 <lb/>
            and also Agamemnon's wish ; <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [BOOK. in. </note> <lb/>
            Not but that there are even now some particular magistrates <lb/>
            invested with supreme power to decide, as the judges, those <lb/>
            things which the law cannot decide, as being one of those <lb/>
            cases which comes not properly under its jurisdiction ; for of <lb/>
            those which can, there is no doubt. Since then the laws com­ <lb/>
            prehend some things, but not all, these points make it neces­ <lb/>
            sary to inquire, and consider which of the two is preferable, <lb/>
            that the best man, or the best law, should govern; for it is <lb/>
            impossible to reduce to law every subject which can come <lb/>
            The law needs <lb/>
            a living expo­ <lb/>
            nent. <lb/>
            And it is better <lb/>
            to have many <lb/>
            exponents than <lb/>
            one alone. <lb/>
            under deliberation. No one then denies that it <lb/>
            is necessary that there should be some person to <lb/>
            decide those cases, which cannot come under the <lb/>
            cognizance of a written law; but we say, that it <lb/>
            is better to have many than one; for every one <lb/>
            who decides according to the principles of the law <lb/>
            decides justly. Yet surely it seems absurd to suppose, that <lb/>
            one person can see better with two eyes, and hear better with <lb/>
            two ears, or do better with two hands and two feet, than <lb/>
            many can do with many; for we see that absolute monarchs <lb/>
            now furnish themselves with many eyes, and ears, and hands, <lb/>
            and feet; for they intrust those who are friends to themselves <lb/>
            and their government with part of their power. If they are <lb/>
            not friends to the monarch, they will not do what he chooses ; <lb/>
            but if they are friends to him, they are friends also to his go­ <lb/>
            vernment : but a friend is an equal, and like his friend: if <lb/>
            then he thinks that such should govern, he thinks that those <lb/>
            who are his equals and like himself should govern. These <lb/>
            are nearly the objections which men usually urge in dispute <lb/>
            against kingly power.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>Now, probably what we have said, may be true of some per­ <lb/>
            sons, but not of others; for some men are by nature formed <lb/>
            to be under the government of a despot; others, of a king; <lb/>
            others, again, to be citizens of a free state, sharing what is j ust and <lb/>
            Tyranny and <lb/>
            the other cor­ <lb/>
            ruptions unna­ <lb/>
            tural. <lb/>
            useful; but a tyranny is not according to nature, <lb/>
            nor is the perversion of any other government <lb/>
            whatsoever; for they are all contrary to it. But it <lb/>
            is evident from what has been said, that among <lb/>
            equals it is neither advantageous nor right, that one person <pb n="123"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. XVII.] </note> <lb/>
            should be lord over all, either where there are no established <lb/>
            laws, but where his will is the law, or where there are laws: <lb/>
            neither is it right that one who is good should have rule over <lb/>
            those who are good; or one who is not good, over those who <lb/>
            are not good; nor one who is superior to the rest in worth, <lb/>
            except in a particular manner; and this manner shall be de­ <lb/>
            scribed, though indeed it has been already mentioned. But <lb/>
            let us next determine what people are best qua­ <lb/>
            lined for a kingly government, what for an aris­ <lb/>
            tocratic, and what for a democratic. And first, <lb/>
            Who are best <lb/>
            subjects for a <lb/>
            monarchy ? <lb/>
            those who are accustomed by nature to submit themselves to <lb/>
            the political rule of a family eminent for virtue, are adapted <lb/>
            to kingly government. For an aristocracy, those <lb/>
            who are naturally framed to bear the rule of free­ <lb/>
            men, whose superior virtue makes them worthy <lb/>
            For an aristo­ <lb/>
            cracy. <lb/>
            of the management of others; while a people adapted to a <lb/>
            free state is one among whom there is wont to <lb/>
            be found a multitude formed by nature both to <lb/>
            For a free state. <lb/>
            govern and be governed by laws, which admit the poor citi­ <lb/>
            zens to a share of honours according to their worth. But <lb/>
            whenever a whole family, or any one of another, <lb/>
            shall happen so far to excel in virtue as to surpass <lb/>
            all other persons in the community, then it is right <lb/>
            When it is <lb/>
            right to choose <lb/>
            a monarch. <lb/>
            that the kingly power should be vested in them, or if it is an <lb/>
            individual who does so, that he should be king and lord of <lb/>
            all. For this, as we have just mentioned, is not only corre­ <lb/>
            spondent to that principle of right to which all founders of <lb/>
            all states, whether aristocracies, oligarchies, or democracies, <lb/>
            have a regard, (for they all regard excellence of some kind, <lb/>
            though not the same excellence); but it is also agreeable to <lb/>
            what has been already said, as it would not be right to kill <lb/>
            or banish or ostracise such an one for his superior merit. Nor <lb/>
            would it be proper to let him have the supreme power only in <lb/>
            turn; for it is contrary to nature, that what is highest should <lb/>
            ever be lowest; but this is the case, should such a one ever be <lb/>
            governed by others. So that nothing else can be done, but <lb/>
            to submit and suffer him continually to enjoy the supreme <lb/>
            power. And with respect to kingly power in different states, <lb/>
            whether it is or is not advantageous to them, and to what states, <lb/>
            and in what manner, let thus much be laid down. Since, <lb/>
            then, we have said that there are three kinds of regular go- <pb n="124"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK IV. </note> <lb/>
            vernments, and since of these the best must necessarily be that <lb/>
            which is administered by the best men,—(and this must be <lb/>
            that which happens to have one man, or one family, or a <lb/>
            number of persons, excelling all the rest in virtue, who are <lb/>
            able to govern and be governed in such a manner as will <lb/>
            make life most agreeable, and we have already shown that <lb/>
            the virtue of a good man and of a citizen in the most perfect <lb/>
            government will be the same, )-it is evident, that in the same <lb/>
            manner, and by the same means, whereby a man becomes <lb/>
            The best prac­ <lb/>
            tical form of <lb/>
            government is <lb/>
            an aristocracy <lb/>
            or monarchy. <lb/>
            truly good, any one would compose a state in the <lb/>
            shape of an aristocracy or monarchy; so that it <lb/>
            will be found to be education and morals that are <lb/>
            almost the whole which go to make a good man, <lb/>
            and that the same qualities will make a good citizen or good <lb/>
            king.1</p>
          <p>These particulars being treated of, we must next endeavour <lb/>
            to consider what sort of government is best, how it naturally <lb/>
            arises, and how it ought to be established. Now it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary that he who intends so to do, should make a proper in­ <lb/>

            what is fitted to its particular genus; as what particular <lb/>
            exercise is fitted to a particular body, and suits it best: <lb/>
            (for that body which is formed by nature the most beauti­ <lb/>
            ful and most perfectly constructed, necessarily requires the <lb/>
            best exercise;) and also what that one kind must be, which <lb/>
            will suit most and all bodies, for this is the business of the <lb/>
            gymnastic art. And although any one should not desire to <lb/>
            acquire an adequate knowledge and skill in these exercises, <lb/>
            yet it is not, on that account, the less necessary that he who <lb/>
            professes to be a master, and to instruct the youth in them, <lb/>
            should be perfect therein. And we see that this is what hap­ <lb/>
            pens equally in the art of healing, ship-building, cloth-making, <lb/>
            and indeed all other arts; so that it evidently belongs to the <lb/>
            same art to find out what kind of government is best, and <lb/>
            would of all others be most correspondent to our wish, provid­ <lb/>
            ing it received no impediment from without, and also what parti­ <lb/>
            cular species of it is adapted to particular persons; for there <lb/>
            are many probably who are incapable of enjoying the best <lb/>
            form. So that the legislator, and he who is truly <lb/>
            a political ought to be acquainted not only with <lb/>
            that which is most perfect in the abstract, but <lb/>
            also that which is the best suited under any given <lb/>
            circumstances. 1 There is, moreover, a third sort <lb/>
            The politician <lb/>
            should study, <lb/>
            not only theo­ <lb/>
            retic, but <lb/>
            practical ex­ <lb/>
            cellence. <lb/>
            of polity, an imaginary one; and he ought, if such a one <lb/>
            should be presented to his consideration, to be able to discern <lb/>
            how it would grow into being, and, when once established, <lb/>
            what would be the proper means to preserve it for the longest <lb/>
            time. I mean, for instance, if a state should happen not to <lb/>
            have the best form of government, or to be deficient even in <lb/>
            what was necessary, or not to be as good as possible under <lb/>
            existing circumstances, but something inferior. And, besides <lb/>
            all this, it is necessary to distinguish what sort of <lb/>
            government is best fitting for all cities : for most <lb/>
            of those writers who have treated this subject, <lb/>
            Fault of pre­ <lb/>
            ceding writers. <lb/>

            failed in describing the practical parts: for it is not enough <lb/>
            to be able to lay down scientifically what is best, but what <lb/>
            can be put in practice. It should also be simple, and easy <lb/>
            for all to attain to. But, contrary to this, they seek out only <lb/>
            the most subtle form of government, and one which needs <lb/>
            many things to fill it up. Others again, choosing rather to <lb/>
            treat of what is common, censure those which now exist, and <lb/>
            extol the excellence of a particular state, as the Lacedaemonian, <lb/>
            What the aim <lb/>
            of a politician <lb/>
            should be. <lb/>
            or some other. But every legislator ought to <lb/>
            establish such a form of government, as from the <lb/>
            present state, and disposition of the people who <lb/>
            are to receive it, they will most readily submit to, and persuade <lb/>
            the community to partake of: for it is not a business of less <lb/>
            trouble to correct the mistakes of an established government, <lb/>
            than to form a new one; as it is equally difficult to recover <lb/>
            what we have forgotten, and to learn any thing afresh. The <lb/>
            politician, therefore, besides all that we have already said, ought <lb/>
            to be able to remedy the faults of a government already <lb/>
            established, as we have before mentioned. But this is im­ <lb/>
            possible for a man who does not know the different forms of <lb/>
            Hence the need <lb/>
            of studying the <lb/>
            various govern­ <lb/>
            ments. <lb/>
            government: some persons think, that there is <lb/>
            only one species both of democracy and oligarchy ; <lb/>
            but this is not true: so that no one should be un­ <lb/>
            acquainted with the difference of these govern­ <lb/>
            ments, how great they are, and in how many ways they are <lb/>
            constituted. And together with this practical wisdom, he <lb/>
            ought to perceive what laws are best, and what are most suit­ <lb/>
            able to each particular government: for all laws ought to be <lb/>
            framed, and are framed by all men, with reference to the <lb/>
            state, and not the state with reference to the laws. For <lb/>
            government is a certain ordering in a state, which respects <lb/>
            the magistrates as to the manner in which they are regulated, <lb/>
            where the supreme power shall be placed; and what is the <lb/>
            final object which each community shall have in view. But <lb/>
            laws are something different from what expresses the form of <lb/>
            the constitution ;1 and according to them, the magistrate must <lb/>
            rule and keep watch over those who transgress them. And <note type="footnote"> 1 What is the difference between v<foreign xml:lang="grc">όμοι</foreign>and <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολιτεία</foreign>, has been already <lb/>

            hence it is evident, that the founders of laws should attend <lb/>
            to the different kinds and to the number of governments ; for <lb/>
            it is impossible that the same laws should be fitted to all sorts <lb/>
            of oligarchies and democracies; for of both these governments <lb/>
            there are many species, and not one only.</p>

          <p>SINCE, then, according to our first method of <lb/>
            treating the different forms of government, we <lb/>
            Three kinds of <lb/>
            government. <lb/>
            have divided those which are regular into three sorts, the <lb/>
            kingly, the aristocratical, and the free state, and have shown their <lb/>
            three corruptions respectively ;-tyranny the corruption of <lb/>
            monarchy; oligarchy of an aristocracy; and democracy of the <lb/>
            free state ;-and as we have already treated of the aristo­ <lb/>
            cratical and kingly governments;—(for to enter into an in­ <lb/>
            quiry what sort of government is best, is the same thing as <lb/>
            to treat of these two expressly; for each of them desires to be <lb/>
            established upon the encouragement of virtue:)—and as more­ <lb/>
            over we have already determined wherein a monarchy and an <lb/>
            aristocracy differ from each other, and when a state may be <lb/>
            said to be governed by a king,-it now remains that we ex­ <lb/>
            amine into a free state, and also those other forms <lb/>
            of government, an oligarchy, a democracy, and <lb/>
            a tyranny. And it is evident, which of these <lb/>

            the part of the king; whence a tyranny will arise, the worst ex­ <lb/>
            cess imaginable, as being a government the most <lb/>
            contrary to a free state. The excess next most <lb/>
            hurtful, is an oligarchy; for an aristocracy differs <lb/>
            An oligarchy, <lb/>
            the next worst. <lb/>
            much from this sort of government; and that which is least <lb/>
            hurtful is a democracy. This subject has. been already <lb/>
            treated of by one of those writers who have gone before me, <note type="footnote"> I An illustration of the old proverb, " Corruptio optimi pessima fit per­ <lb/>

            though his views do not look the same way as <lb/>
            mine; for he thought, that a democracy was the <lb/>
            worst of all excellent constitutions, as a good oligarchy, or <lb/>
            the like, but the best of all bad ones. Now I affirm that <lb/>
            all these states without exception have fallen into excess; <lb/>
            and also it is not well to say that one oligarchy is better than <lb/>
            another, but that it is not quite so bad. But let us defer <lb/>
            How many <lb/>
            kinds of free <lb/>
            states there <lb/>
            are. <lb/>
            this question for the present. We must first in­ <lb/>
            quire how many different sorts of free states there <lb/>
            are; since there are many species of democracies <lb/>
            and oligarchies ; and which of them is the most <lb/>
            comprehensive, and most desirable after the best form of <lb/>
            government; or if there is any other, aristocratic in its prin­ <lb/>
            ciples, and well-established; and also which of these is best <lb/>
            adapted to most cities, and which of them is preferable for <lb/>
            particular persons ;-( for, probably, some may suit better with <lb/>
            a violent oligarchy than with a democracy, and others better <lb/>
            with the latter than the former ; )—and afterwards in what <lb/>
            manner a man ought to proceed who desires to establish either <lb/>
            of these states, I mean the several species of democracy and <lb/>
            How govern­ <lb/>

            served and de­ <lb/>
            stroyed. <lb/>
            of oligarchy. And, to conclude, when we shall <lb/>
            have briefly made mention of every thing that is <lb/>
            necessary, we must endeavour to point out the <lb/>
            sources of corruption and of stability in govern­ <lb/>
            ments, as well those which are common to all, as those which <lb/>
            are peculiar to each state, and from what causes they chiefly <lb/>
            are wont to arise.</p>

          <p>Why govern­ <lb/>
            ments are of <lb/>
            different kinds.</p>
          <p>THE reason for there being many different sorts <lb/>
            of governments is this, that each state consists of <lb/>
            a great number of parts ;1 for, in the first place, <lb/>
            we see that all cities are made up of families: and, again, out <note type="footnote"> I The cause of there being several kinds of polities, is the fact that <lb/>
            there are so many different ingredients in the state; the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ᾱποροι</foreign>, the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">εῡποροι</foreign>, and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέσοι</foreign>, of whom the first is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ᾰ</foreign>v<foreign xml:lang="grc">οπλο</foreign>v, the others are <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὸπλιτικό</foreign>v. And, again, there are other divisions of the citizens on a <lb/>
            different principle. Now these parts, it is clear, may all partake of state <lb/>
            privileges; and according as a larger or a smaller part of them has an <lb/>
            actual share in the administration the complexion of the government <lb/>
            itself will vary. </note> <pb n="129"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. III. ] </note> <lb/>
            of the multitude of these some must be rich, some poor, and <lb/>
            others in the middle station; and that both of the rich and <lb/>
            poor, some will be used to arms, and others not. We see also <lb/>
            that some of the common people are husbandmen, while others <lb/>
            attend the market, and others are artificers. There is also a <lb/>
            difference between the nobles in their wealth, and the dignity <lb/>
            which they maintain; for instance, in the number of their <lb/>
            horses ; for this cannot be supported without a large fortune. <lb/>
            For this reason, in former times, those cities whose strength <lb/>
            consisted in horse, became by that means oligarchies; and <lb/>
            they used horse in their expeditions against the neighbouring <lb/>
            states which were at war with them; as the Eretrians, the <lb/>
            Chalcidians, and the Magnetians, who lived near the river <lb/>
            Maeander, and many others about Asia. Moreover, besides <lb/>
            the difference of fortune, there is that which arises from <lb/>
            family and from merit; or, if there are any other distinctions <lb/>
            which make part of the city, they have been already men­ <lb/>
            tioned in treating of an aristocracy; 1 (for there we considered <lb/>
            of how many parts each city must necessarily be composed;) <lb/>
            and sometimes each of these have a share in the government, <lb/>
            sometimes a few, sometimes more. It is evident, <lb/>
            then, that there must be many forms of govern­ <lb/>
            ment, differing from each other in kind; for the <lb/>
            parts of which they are composed, each differ from <lb/>
            As many forms <lb/>
            of government <lb/>
            as ranks in the <lb/>
            state. <lb/>
            the other. For government is the ordering of the magis­ <lb/>
            tracies of the state; and these the community share between <lb/>
            themselves, either as they can attain them by force, or accord­ <lb/>
            ing to some common equality which there is amongst them, as <lb/>
            poverty, wealth, or something of which they both partake. <lb/>
            There must therefore necessarily be as many different forms <lb/>
            of governments as there are different ranks in the society, <lb/>
            arising from the superiority of some over others, and their <lb/>
            darent situations. And these seem chiefly to be <lb/>
            two, as they say the winds are but two, namely, <lb/>
            the north and the south; while all the others are <lb/>
            declinations from these. And thus in polities, <lb/>
            there is the government of the many, and the <lb/>
            government of the few; or a democracy, and an <lb/>
            oligarchy; for an aristocracy may be considered <lb/>
            But resolvable <lb/>
            into two main <lb/>
            divisions. <lb/>
            1. That of the <lb/>
            many. <lb/>
            2. That of the <lb/>
            few. <note type="footnote"> <unclear>1</unclear> The reference of Aristotle here is to book iii. chapters 6 and 7. </note> <note type="footnote"> Y. </note> <pb n="130"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK IV. </note> <lb/>
            as a species of oligarchy, as being also a government of the <lb/>
            few; and what we call a free state, may be considered as a <lb/>
            democracy; as among the winds, they consider the west as part <lb/>
            of the north, and the east as part of the south. Thus, too, it is <lb/>
            in music, according to some, who say that there are only two <lb/>
            species of it, the Doric and the Phrygian, and who call all other <lb/>
            species of composition after one of these names. Many peo­ <lb/>
            ple are accustomed to consider governments in the same light; <lb/>
            but it is both more convenient and more in accordance with <lb/>
            truth, to distinguish governments, as I have done, into two <lb/>
            species: one of those established upon proper principles, so <lb/>
            that while there are one or two sorts rightly constituted, <lb/>
            the others are but excesses of these; so that we may compare <lb/>
            the best form of government to the best-tempered harmony; <lb/>
            the oligarchic to the more violent and impassioned tunes; and <lb/>
            the democratic to the soft and gentle airs. 1</p>

            of democracy <lb/>
            And oligarchy.</p>
          <p>WE ought not, however, to define a democracy as <lb/>
            some do now-a-days, who say simply that it is a <lb/>
            government where the supreme power is lodged <lb/>
            in the people; for even in oligarchies every <lb/>
            where the supreme power is in the majority. Nor should <lb/>
            we define an oligarchy as a government where the supreme <lb/>
            power is in the hands of a few: for let us suppose the num­ <lb/>
            ber of a people to be thirteen hundred, and that of these, one <lb/>
            thousand were rich, who would not permit the three hundred <lb/>
            poor to have any share in the government, although they were <lb/>
            free, and their equals in every thing else; no one would say <lb/>
            that this government was a democracy. In like manner, if <lb/>
            the poor, when few in number, should acquire the power over <lb/>
            the rich, though more than themselves, no one would say that <lb/>
            this formed an oligarchy ; nor would any one call such a state <lb/>
            an oligarchy, when the poor, though few in number, are supe- <lb/>

            rior in power to the rich, who have a majority. <lb/>
            We should rather say that the state is a demo­ <lb/>
            cracy, when the supreme power is in the hands <note type="footnote"> 1 In this sentence it has been found impossible to adhere literally to <lb/>

            of the freemen ; an oligarchy, when it is in the hands of the <lb/>
            rich. It happens indeed that in the one case the many will <lb/>
            possess it, in the other the few ; because there are many poor, <lb/>
            and few rich. And if the offices of state were to be distri <lb/>
            buted according to the size of the citizens, as they say it is in <lb/>
            Æthiopia, 1 or according to their beauty, then it would be an <lb/>
            oligarchy : for the number of those who are tall or beautify <lb/>
            is small. Nor withal are those things which we have already <lb/>
            mentioned, alone sufficient to describe these states; for since <lb/>
            there are many species both of a democracy and an oligarchy, <lb/>
            the matter requires that further distinction be made; as we <lb/>
            cannot admit, that if a few freemen possess the supreme power <lb/>
            over the many who are not free, this government is a demo­ <lb/>
            cracy: as in Apollonia upon the Ionian Sea, and in Thera ;2 <lb/>
            for in each of these cities the honours of the state were in the <lb/>
            hands of some few distinguished families who first founded <lb/>
            the colonies. Nor would the rich, because they are superior <lb/>
            in numbers, form a democracy, as formerly at Colophon; for <lb/>
            there the majority had large possessions before the Lydian <lb/>
            war. But a democracy is a state where the free­ <lb/>
            men and the poor, being the majority, are invested <lb/>
            with the power of the state ; and an oligarchy is <lb/>
            a state where the rich and those of noble family, <lb/>
            A democracy <lb/>
            defined. <lb/>
            An oligarchy <lb/>
            defined. <lb/>
            being few, possess it. We have now proved that there are <lb/>
            various forms of government, and we have assigned a reason <lb/>
            for it; and shall proceed to show, that there are even more than <note type="footnote"> 1 See Herod. iii. 20. An obvious parallel occurs in the case of Saul, <lb/>

              these, and what they are, and why; starting from the first prin­ <lb/>
              ciple which we have already laid down. We admit that every <lb/>
              state consists not of one, but of many parts. For example, <lb/>
              if it should be our purpose to comprehend the different species <lb/>
              of animals, we should first of all note those parts which every <lb/>
              animal must have, as certain of the organs of sense, as also <lb/>
              what is fitted to receive and retain its food, as a mouth and a <lb/>
              belly; and besides, certain parts to enable it to move from <lb/>
              place to place. If, then, these are the only parts of an animal, <lb/>
              and there are differences between them, namely, in their va­ <lb/>
              rious sorts of mouths, and bellies, and organs of sense, and be­ <lb/>
              sides these in their powers of motion; the number of all these <lb/>
              combined together must necessarily make up different species <lb/>
              of animals. For it is not possible that the same kind of animal <lb/>
              should have any very great deal of difference in its mouth or <lb/>
              ears; so that when all these possible combinations are collected <lb/>
              together, they will make up various species of animals, which <lb/>
              will be as many kinds as there are of these general combina- <lb/>

              tions of necessary parts. Now the same thing is <lb/>
              true of what are called polities ; for a state is not <lb/>
              made up of one, but of many parts, as has already <lb/>
              been often said; one of which is those who supply <lb/>
              provisions, called husbandmen; another called me­ <lb/>
              chanics, whose employment is in the manual arts, <lb/>
              without which the city could not be inhabited ; of these some <lb/>
              are busied about what is absolutely necessary, others about <lb/>
              things which contribute to the elegancies and pleasures of life; <figure type="illustration">

              the third sort are hucksters, I mean by these <lb/>
              buyers, sellers, petty traffickers, and retail dealers ; <lb/>
              the fourth are hired labourers, or workmen; the <lb/>
              fifth are the men-at-arms, a rank not less useful <lb/>
              than the other, unless the community choose to be <lb/>
              the slaves of every invader. For doubtless a state which is <lb/>
              naturally a slave, is unworthy of the name of a city; for a <lb/>

              bandmen, shoemakers, and builders ; he then adds, as if these <lb/>
              were not sufficient, smiths, herdsmen for what cattle are ne­ <lb/>
              cessary, and also merchants and victuallers, and these are by <lb/>
              way of appendix to his first list; as if a city was established <lb/>
              for necessity, and not for the sake of perfect life, or as if it was <lb/>
              equally in need of shoemakers and husbandmen. Also he does <lb/>
              not reckon the military as a part of the state, before its ter­ <lb/>
              ritory increases and brings about war, by touching on the <lb/>
              borders of the neighbouring powers.1 And even amongst <lb/>
              them who compose his four divisions, or whoever have any <lb/>
              connexion with each other, it will be necessary to have some <lb/>
              one to distribute justice, and to determine between man and <lb/>
              man. Since, then, any one would hold that the mind is more <lb/>
              truly a part of man than his body, one would regard such <lb/>
              things as more properly belonging to his city than matters of <lb/>
              every-day necessity : such things are the portion devoted to <lb/>
              war and the administration of forensic justice ; to which may <lb/>
              be added those who are members of the council, which is the <lb/>
              business of political sagacity. Nor is it of any consequence, <lb/>
              whether these different employments are filled by different <lb/>
              persons, or by one, as the same man is oftentimes both a <lb/>
              soldier and a husbandman. So that if both the <lb/>
              judge and the senator are parts of the city, it <lb/>
              necessarily follows that the soldier must be so <lb/>
              also. The seventh sort are those who serve the <lb/>
              public in expensive employments at their own <lb/>
              charge; and these are called the opulent. The <lb/>
              eighth are those who in like manner execute the <lb/>
              different offices of the state, and without these it <lb/>
              could not possibly subsist: it is therefore neces­ <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_39_fig23.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              sary that there should be Some persons capable of governing <lb/>
              and of filling the places in the city; and this either for life, <lb/>
              or in rotation. The office of a senator, and of him who ad­ <lb/>
              ministers justice to litigants, alone now remain; and these <lb/>
              we have already sufficiently defined. Since, then, these <note type="footnote"> 1 It mustbe remembered that Plato constituted his orders, as was <lb/>
              theoreticallynecessary for the mere existence of the state, and that he did <lb/>
              not look to practice. The soldiery will not be necessary, he says, until the <lb/>
              state desiresto increase its territory. Still, granting this point, a judicial <lb/>
              body nevertheless is necessary. </note><note type="footnote"> J </note> <pb n="134"/>

              things are necessary for a state, to the end that it may be <lb/>
              happy and just, it follows that citizens who engage in public <lb/>
              affairs should be men of abilities therein. Many persona <lb/>
              think it possible that different employments may be allotted <lb/>
              to the same person, as that of a soldier, a husbandman, and an <lb/>
              artificer; as also, that others may be both senators and judges : <lb/>
              but all men lay claim to political ability, and think themselves <lb/>
              qualified for almost every department in the state. But the <lb/>
              same person cannot at once be poor and rich: for which rea­ <lb/>
              son the most obvious division of the city is into two parts, <lb/>
              the poor and rich. Moreover, since. in general the one are <lb/>
              few, the other many, they seem of all the parts of a city most <lb/>
              clearly contrary to each other; so that as the one or the other <lb/>
              prevail, they form different polities, and these two forms <lb/>
              of polity are democracy and oligarchy. It has been already <lb/>
              mentioned that there are many different states, and from <lb/>
              what causes they arise; let us therefore now show that there <lb/>
              Different kinds <lb/>
              of democracies <lb/>
              and oligarchies. <lb/>
              are also different kinds both of democracy and <lb/>
              oligarchy. Though this indeed is evident from <lb/>
              what we have already said: for there are many <lb/>
              different sorts of common people, 1and also of those who are <lb/>
              called the upper classes. Of the different sorts of the first <lb/>
              are the husbandmen, artificers, and hucksters, who are em­ <lb/>
              ployed in buying and selling; seamen, of whom some are <lb/>
              engaged in war, some in traffic, some in carrying goods and <lb/>
              passengers, others in fishing ;-( and of each of these there are <lb/>
              often many, as fishermen at Tarentum and Byzantium, masters <lb/>
              of galleys at Athens, merchants at Ægina and Chios, those <lb/>
              who carry passengers at Tenedos ; )—to these we may add <lb/>
              those who live by their manual labour, and have so little <lb/>
              property that they cannot live without some employ; and <lb/>
              also those who are not free-born from citizens on both sides, <lb/>
              and whatever other sort of common people there may be. <lb/>
              That which marks the upper classes, is their fortune, their <lb/>

              same relation to the happy temperament to which he gives the name of <lb/>
              polity, as oligarchy to aristocracy, or tyranny to royalty. It must not be <lb/>
              forgotten, that the body to which the terms oligarchy and democracy <lb/>
              refer, formed a comparatively small part of the population in most Greek <lb/>
              states, since it did not include either slaves or residing free foreigners. <lb/>
              The sovereign power resided wholly in the native freemen; and whether <lb/>
              it was exercised by a part or by all of them, was the question which de­ <lb/>
              termined the nature of the government. When the barrier had been <lb/>
              thrown down by which all political rights were made the inheritance of <lb/>
              certain families,-since every freeman, even when actually excluded from <lb/>
              them by the want of sufficient property, was by law capable of acquiring <lb/>
              them,-democracy might be said to have begun. Thus where the legis­ <lb/>
              lative, or, as it was anciently termed, the deliberative, branch of the <lb/>
              sovereignty was lodged in an assembly open to every freeman, and when <lb/>
              i no other qualification than free birth was required for judicial functions, <lb/>
              and for the election of magistrates, there the government was called de. <lb/>
              mocratical, though the highest offices of the state might be reserved to a <lb/>
              privileged class. But a finished democracy, that which fully satisfied <lb/>
              the Greek nation, was one in which every attribute of sovereignty might <lb/>
              be shared, without respect to rank or property, by every freeman. More <lb/>
              than this was not implied in democracy; and little less than this was re­ <lb/>
              quired, according to the views of the philosophers, to constitute the cha­ <lb/>
              racter of a citizen, which, in the opinion of Aristotle, could not exist <lb/>
              without a voice in the legislative assembly, and such a share in the ad­ <lb/>
              ministration of justice as was necessary to secure the responsibility of the <lb/>
              magistrates. But this equality of rights left room for a great diversity in <lb/>
              the modes of exercising them, which determined the real nature of a <lb/>
              democratical institution. There were indeed certain rights, those which <lb/>
              Aristotle considers as essential to a citizen, which, according to the re­ <lb/>
              ceived Greek notions, could, in a democracy, only be exercised in person. <lb/>
              The thought of delegating them to accountable representatives, seems <lb/>
              never to have occurred, either to practical or speculative statesmen. But <lb/>
              still, even in the purest form of democracy, it was not necessary that all <lb/>
              the citizens should take an equally active part in the transaction of pub­ <lb/>
              lic business, and the unavoidable inequality in the advantages of fortune, <lb/>
              and of personal qualities, fixed a natural limit to the exercise of most <lb/>
              political rights. But the principle of legal equality, which was the basis <lb/>
              of democracy, was gradually constructed in a manner which inverted <lb/>
              the wholesome order of nature, and led to a long train of pernicious </note> <pb n="136"/>
              <note type="margin"> [BOOK IV. </note> <lb/>
              this is what the law in that state directs, that the poor shall <lb/>
              be in no greater subjection than the rich; and that the su­ <lb/>
              preme power shall be not lodged with either of these, but <lb/>
              that both shall share it alike. For if liberty and equality, as <lb/>
              some persons suppose, are chiefly to be found in a democracy, <lb/>
              it must be most so, by every department of government being <lb/>
              alike open to all; but as the people are the majority, and <lb/>
              what they vote is law, it follows that such a state must be a <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_39_fig24.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
              democracy. This then is one species of a demo­ <lb/>
              cratic government. Another is, when the magis­ <lb/>
              trates are elected by a certain census, the standard <lb/>
              of which is low ; and where every one who possesses property <lb/>
              ought to have a share in the government, but as soon as he has <lb/>

              persede the <lb/>
              law. <lb/>
              lost that property, he ought no longer. Another <lb/>
              sort is, that in which every man who is not under <lb/>
              ban has a share in the government, but where the <lb/>
              government is in the law. Another, where every <lb/>
              one, provided he be a citizen, has this right, but <lb/>
              where the government is in the law. Another is <lb/>
              the same with these in other particulars, but al­ <lb/>
              lows the people and not the law to be supreme ; <lb/>
              and this takes place when every thing is determined by a <lb/>
              majority of votes, and not by a law; a thing which happens <lb/>
              by reason of the demagogues. For where a democracy is <lb/>
              governed by stated laws, there is no room for a demagogue, <lb/>
              but men of worth fill the first offices in the state; but where <note type="footnote"> consequences. The administration of the commonwealth came to be re­ <lb/>
              garded, not as a service in which all were interested, but for which some <lb/>
              might be qualified better than others, but as a property, in which each <lb/>
              was entitled to an equal share. In proportion as the assembly, or large <lb/>
              portions detached from it for the exercise of judicial functions, drew <lb/>
              all the branches of the sovereignty more and more into their sphere, <lb/>
              the character of their proceedings became more and more subject to the <lb/>
              influence of the lower class of the citizens, which constituted a perma­ <lb/>
              nent majority. And thus the democracy, instead of the equality which <lb/>
              was its supposed basis, in fact, established the ascendency of a faction, <lb/>
              which although greatly preponderant in numbers, no more represented <lb/>
              the whole state than the oligarchy itself; and which, though not equally <lb/>
              liable to fall into the mechanism of a vicious system, was more prone to <lb/>
              yield to the impulse of the moment, more easily misled by blind or <lb/>
              treacherous guides, and might thus, as frequently, though not so deli­ <lb/>
              berately and methodically, trample, not only on law and custom, but on <lb/>
              justice and humanity. This disease of a democracy was sometimes de­ <lb/>
              signated by the term ochlocracy, or the dominion of the rabble. <foreign xml:lang="grc">̕ ̕</foreign> </note> <pb n="137"/>
              <note type="margin"> CHAP. IV.] </note> <lb/>
              the power is not vested in the laws, there demagogues abound.1 <lb/>
              For there the people's voice becomes that of a king, the whole <lb/>
              composing one body; for they are supreme, not as individuals, <lb/>
              but in their collective capacity. Homer also says, <lb/>
              " III fares it, where the multitude hath sway;" <lb/>
              but whether he means this kind of democracy, or one where <lb/>
              the many are individually supreme, is uncertain. Now, when <lb/>
              the people possess this power, they desire to be altogether <lb/>
              absolute, that they may not be under the control of the law, <lb/>
              and they grow despotical, so that flatterers are held <lb/>
              in repute; and such a people become analogous to <lb/>
              tyranny among the forms of monarchy; for their <lb/>
              manners are the same, and they both hold a des- <lb/>
              Parallel be­ <lb/>
              tween such a <lb/>
              democracy and <lb/>
              a tyranny. <lb/>
              potic power over better persons than themselves. For their <lb/>
              decrees are like the others' edicts; and a demagogue with them <lb/>
              is like a flatterer among the others; but both these two classes <lb/>
              abound with each, flatterers with tyrants, and demagogues <lb/>
              among such a people. And to them it is owing that the su­ <lb/>
              preme power is lodged in the votes of the people, and not in <lb/>
              written laws: for they bring every thing before them. And <lb/>
              this they do because they have influence, on account of the <lb/>
              supreme power being lodged in the people; for these are <lb/>
              they whom the multitude obey. Besides, those who inveigh <lb/>
              against rulers are wont to say that the people ought to be the <lb/>
              judges of their conduct; and the people gladly receive their <lb/>
              complaints as the means of destroying all their offices. Any <lb/>
              one therefore may with great justice blame such a govern­ <lb/>
              ment by calling it a democracy, and not a free state ; for <lb/>
              where the government is not vested in the laws <lb/>
              then there is no free state, for the law ought to be <lb/>
              supreme over all things ; and particular incident <lb/>
              which arise, should be determined by the magis- <lb/>
              A free state or <lb/>
              polity only <lb/>
              when the law <lb/>
              is supreme. <lb/>
              trates or by the state. If, therefore, a democracy is to be <note type="footnote"> I In such a case as this, the form of government would rather be called <lb/>
              an ochlocracy, or, in the words of Thirlwall, a dominion of the rabble. <lb/>
              A <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψήφισμα</foreign>was a mere resolution of the people, and only remained in <lb/>

              reckoned as one among free states, it is evident that any such <lb/>
              establishment which centres all power in the votes of the peo­ <lb/>
              ple cannot, properly speaking, be a democracy; for their de­ <lb/>

          <p>Different kinds <lb/>
            of oligarchy. <lb/>
            1. With a high <lb/>
            census to shut <lb/>
            out the many. <lb/>
            2. The same, <lb/>
            but where the <lb/>
            rulers are self­ <lb/>
            elected. <lb/>
            BUT of the different species of oligarchies, one is <lb/>
            when the right to the offices is regulated by a cer­ <lb/>
            tain census, so that the poor, although they are the <lb/>
            majority, have no share in it; while all those who <lb/>
            are included in it take part in the management <lb/>
            of public affairs. Another sort is, when the ma­ <lb/>
            gistrates are men of very small fortune, and upon <lb/>
            any vacancy themselves fill it up. Now if they <lb/>
            do this out of the community at large, the state approaches to <lb/>
            an aristocracy; if out of any particular class of people, it will <lb/>
            3. Hereditary. <lb/>
            4. Where the <lb/>
            rulers, and not <lb/>
            the law, are <lb/>
            supreme. <lb/>
            be an oligarchy. Another sort of oligarchy is <lb/>
            when the power is an hereditary nobility. The <lb/>
            fourth is when the power is in the same hands, <lb/>
            and they are supreme instead of the laws; and <lb/>
            this sort of oligarchy exactly corresponds to a <lb/>
            tyranny among monarchies, and to that particular species of <lb/>
            democracy which we last mentioned; and this has the par­ <lb/>
            ticular name of a dynasty.2 So many, then, are the different <lb/>
            sorts of oligarchies and democracies. It should also be known, <lb/>
            that it often happens that a free state, where the supreme <lb/>
            power is in the laws, may not be democratic, and yet, in con­ <lb/>
            sequence of the established manners and customs of the people, <note type="footnote"> 1 " Whenever such a change took place in the character or relative posi­ <lb/>
            tion of the ruling body, that it no longer commanded the respect of its <lb/>
            subjects, but found itself opposed to them, and compelled to direct its <lb/>
            measures chiefly to the preservation of its own power, it ceased to be an <lb/>
            aristocracy in the Greek sense; it became a faction, an oligarchy...... <lb/>
            In this strict sense, an oligarchy could only exist where there was an <lb/>
            inferior body, which felt itself aggrieved by being excluded from the po­ <lb/>
            litical rights which were reserved to the privileged few ... In general, it <lb/>
            was a gradual, inevitable change in the relative position of the higher and <lb/>
            lower orders, which converted the aristocracy into an oligarchical faction, <lb/>
            and awakened an opposition which usually ended in its overthrow. <foreign xml:lang="grc">̕ ̕</foreign> <lb/>

            may be governed as if it was; so, on the other hand, among <lb/>
            other people where a polity in accordance to the laws may really <lb/>
            bend to a democratic form, still their customs <lb/>
            and manners may be of an oligarchic tendency. <lb/>
            And this chiefly happens when there has been any <lb/>
            alteration in the government; for the people do <lb/>

            not easily change, but love their own ancient customs; and <lb/>
            it is by small degrees only that one thing gains place from <lb/>
            another; so that the ancient laws remain in force, while the <lb/>
            power is with those who bring about a revolution in the state.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>IT is evident from what has been said, that there are as many <lb/>
            species of democracies and oligarchies as the above; for of <lb/>
            necessity, either all the aforesaid ranks of the people must <lb/>
            have a share in the government, or some only, and others not. <lb/>
            Now when the husbandmen and those only who <lb/>
            possess moderate fortunes have the supreme power, <lb/>
            they will govern according to law; for as they <lb/>
            must get their livings by their labour, they have <lb/>
            One kind of <lb/>
            democracy, <lb/>
            when a state <lb/>
            will be ruled <lb/>
            by law. <lb/>
            but little leisure for public business: they will therefore <lb/>
            establish fit laws, and call public assemblies when there is a <lb/>
            necessity; and they will readily let every one partake with <lb/>
            them in the administration of public affairs, as soon as they <lb/>
            possess that fortune which the law requires as a qualification. <lb/>
            [And hence, by the way, it is in the power of every one who <lb/>
            has any thing to have his share in the government.1] For to <lb/>
            exclude any class would be a step towards oligarchy, and for <lb/>
            all to have leisure to attend unless they have a subsistence, <lb/>
            would be impossible. This form of government then, for the <lb/>
            above reasons, is one species of democracy. An­ <lb/>
            other species is distinguished by the prevailing <lb/>
            Another kind. <lb/>
            mode of electing magistrates, in which every one is eligible <lb/>
            to whose birth there are no objections, provided he is able to <lb/>
            find leisure to attend. For this reason, in such a democracy <lb/>
            the supreme power is vested in the laws, as pay is not given. <lb/>
            A third species is, where all freemen have a right <lb/>
            to a share in the government, but where they will <lb/>
            A third kind. <note type="footnote"> 1 Great doubts are entertained as to the genuineness of this sentence <lb/>
            Accordingly we have placed it in brackets, with Bekker andGoëttlib </note> <pb n="140"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK IV. </note> <lb/>
            not accept it for the cause already assigned; for which reason <lb/>
            A fourth kind. <lb/>
            here also the supreme power will be in the Jaw. <lb/>
            A fourth species of democracy is the last estab­ <lb/>
            lished in point of time in the states. For as the cities have <lb/>
            been enlarged far beyond their original size, and as the public <lb/>
            revenue has become considerable, the populace, on account of <lb/>
            their numbers, are admitted to share in the management of <lb/>
            public affairs, and even the poor are at leisure to attend to <lb/>
            them, as they receive pay : 1 nay, they have the greatest leisure <lb/>
            of all, as they are not hindered by having any care of their <lb/>
            own property, as is the case with the rich, who on this ac­ <lb/>
            count often take no part in the public assembly and the courts <lb/>
            of justice; thus the supreme power is lodged in the poor, and <lb/>
            not in the laws. These are the different sorts of democracies, <lb/>
            and such are the causes which necessarily gave birth to them.</p>
          <p>The first kind <lb/>
            of oligarchy.</p>
          <p>But as to the various kinds of oligarchy, the <lb/>
            first is when the greater part are men of moder­ <lb/>
            ate means, and have not too large property; for <lb/>
            this gives each man of property leisure for the management of <lb/>
            public affairs: and, as they are a numerous body, it neces­ <lb/>
            sarily follows, that the supreme power must be in the laws, <lb/>
            and not in the individuals ; for in proportionas theyare far <lb/>
            from a monarchical government, and have not sufficient for­ <lb/>
            tune to neglect their private affairs, while they are too many <lb/>
            to be supported by the public, they will of course determine <lb/>
            to be governed by the laws, and not by each other. But if <note type="footnote"> I " Democracy advanced, as the legal condition on which political rights <lb/>
            were enjoyed was brought within the reach of a more numerous class; <lb/>
            but it could not be considered as complete, so long as any freeman was <lb/>
            debarred from them by poverty. Since, however, the ancient sovereignty <lb/>
            contained several attributes which might be separated, the character of <lb/>
            the constitution depended on the way in which these were distributed. <lb/>
            The state was considered as partaking more of democracy than of oligar­ <lb/>
            chy, when the most important of these rights were shared by all freemen <lb/>
            without distinction, though a part was still appropriated to a number <lb/>
            limited either by birth or fortune.... The principle of legal equality <lb/>
            was more fully carried out, by the introduction of an expedient for level­ <lb/>
            ling as far as possible the inequality of nature, by enabling the poor man <lb/>
            to devote his time without loss, or even with profit, to public affairs. <lb/>
            This was done by giving him wages for his attendance on all occasions <lb/>
            of exercising his franchise ; and as the sum which could be afforded for <lb/>
            this purpose was necessarily small, it attracted precisely the persona <lb/>
            whose presence was least desirable." Thirlwall, ubi supr. </note> <pb n="141"/>

            the men of property in the state are fewer than in <lb/>
            the former case, and if their property is large, <lb/>
            then an oligarchy of the second sort will take <lb/>
            The second <lb/>
            kind. <lb/>
            place; for those who have power will claim a right to lord it <lb/>
            over the others. And, to accomplish this, they will associate <lb/>
            themselves with some who have an inclination for public <lb/>
            affairs, and as they are not yet powerful enough to govern <lb/>
            without law, they will make a law for that purpose. And if <lb/>
            they set themselves, as being fewer, to gain greater fortunes, <lb/>
            the oligarchy will then alter into one of the third <lb/>
            sort, because they keep the offices of state in their <lb/>

            nexions, such a dynasty nearly approaches to a <lb/>

          <p>THERE are also two other states, besides a democracy and an <lb/>

            always esteemed one species of the four sorts ; and thus they <lb/>

            according to the standard adopted. When this was high, and especially <lb/>
            if it was fixed in the produce of land, the constitution differed but little <lb/>

          <p>What an aris­ <lb/>

            1. First kind.</p>
          <p>An aristocracy of which we have already treated <lb/>
            in our first book, is rightly called so; for a state <lb/>
            governed by the best men, upon the most virtuous <lb/>
            principles, and not (so called) according to any arbitrary den­ <lb/>
            nition of good men, has alone a right to be called an aristo­ <lb/>
            cracy ; for it is there only that the good man and the good <lb/>
            citizen are identified ; while in other states men are good only <lb/>
            2. Second kind. <lb/>
            relatively to their own country. Moreover, there <lb/>
            are some other states which are called by the same <lb/>
            name, that differ both from oligarchies and free states, wherein <lb/>
            they choose men for office, not only according to their wealth, <lb/>
            but according to their merit. Now this polity differs from <lb/>
            both of aboveis called an aristocracy : for in those <lb/>
            governments wherein virtue is not their common care, there <lb/>
            are still men of high worth and approved merit. Whatever <lb/>
            How it differs <lb/>
            from a virtuous <lb/>
            democracy. <lb/>
            state, then, as at Carthage, favours the rich, the <lb/>
            virtuous, and the citizens at large, is a sort of <lb/>
            aristocracy: but when only the two latter are <lb/>
            held in esteem, as at Lacedæmon, and the state is jointly <lb/>
            composed of these, it is a virtuous democracy. These are <lb/>
            the two species of aristocracies over and above the first, <lb/>
            3. Third kind. <lb/>
            which is the best of all governments. There is <lb/>
            also a third, which is to be found whenever any <lb/>

          <p>Free states and <lb/>
            tyrannies.</p>
          <p>IT now remains for us to treat of that govern­ <lb/>
            ment which is particularly called a free state, and <lb/>
            also of a tyranny; and we have thus arranged <lb/>
            our method, because, although this, as well as the aristocracies <lb/>
            already mentioned, do not seem excesses, yet, to speak truly, <note type="footnote"> I See Plato's Repub. book viii. chap. 1 and 2, where he describes the <lb/>
            most perfect ideal state as an aristocracy, and then lays down timocracy, <lb/>
            oligarchy, democracy, and tyranny, as the four perversions of it, or cor­ <lb/>
            rupted forms. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 That is, by absolutely good men, and not men who are so called arbi* <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CHAP. VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            they have all departed from a perfect government: and so <lb/>
            they are reckoned among these, and these are their cor­ <lb/>
            rupted forms, as we said at the beginning. It is proper to <lb/>
            mention a tyranny the last of all governments, for it is of all <lb/>
            others the least like a polity, but our treatise is on the subject <lb/>
            of polities. We have said, then, why this arrangement has <lb/>
            been made; but now we must explain what is meant by a <lb/>
            free state. For we shall the better understand <lb/>
            its positive nature now that we have already de­ <lb/>
            scribed an oligarchy and a democracy ;1 for a free <lb/>
            What is a free <lb/>
            state ? <lb/>
            state is indeed nothing more than a mixture of these, and it <lb/>
            has been usual to call those which incline most to a democracy, <lb/>
            free states, and those which incline most to an oligarchy, axis­ <lb/>
            tocracies, because rank and education are generally append­ <lb/>
            ages of the wealthy. Besides, they enjoy those things which <lb/>
            others are often guilty of crimes to procure ; for which reason <lb/>
            men regard them as men of worth, honour, and note. Since, <lb/>
            then, it is the genius of an aristocracy to allot the larger part <lb/>
            of the government to the best citizens, they therefore say that <lb/>
            an oligarchy is chiefly composed of those men who are worthy <lb/>
            and honourable. Now it seems impossible that a state, where <lb/>
            the government is in the hands of the good, should not be well <lb/>
            governed, but ill; or well governed, where the power is in <lb/>
            the hands of the bad. Nor is a government well <lb/>
            constituted because the laws are such, unless they <lb/>
            are observed; for the enforcement of obedience to <lb/>
            The laws alone <lb/>
            no test of a <lb/>
            government. <lb/>
            the laws is one proof of a good constitution in the state: an­ <lb/>
            other is, to have laws by which they shall abide well made; <lb/>
            (for even if they are improper they must be obeyed;) and <lb/>
            this may be done in two ways, either by their being the best <lb/>
            relatively to the particular state, or the best absolutely. An <lb/>
            aristocracy seems most likely to confer the honours of the <lb/>
            state on the virtuous ; for virtue is the object of an aristocracy, <lb/>
            riches of an oligarchy, and liberty of a democracy; for what <lb/>
            is approved of by the majority will prevail in each one of these <lb/>
            three different states; and that which is esteemed by the <lb/>
            greater part of those who compose the community will have <lb/>
            the supreme power. Now what is called a free state prevails <lb/>
            in most communities which are generally made up of rich <lb/>
            and poor, riches and liberty: for among almost all men the <note type="footnote"> 1 See note on the preceding chapter. </note> <pb n="144"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK IT. </note> <lb/>
            rich seem to maintain their position as worthy and honourable <lb/>
            people. But as there are three things which claim an equal <lb/>
            rank in the state, namely, freedom, riches, and merit,—(foi <lb/>
            the fourth, which is called nobility, is consequent on two of the <lb/>
            others, since merit and riches are the origin of nobility)—it is <lb/>
            evident, that the union of the rich and the poor makes up a <lb/>
            free state; but that the union of all three tends to an aristo­ <lb/>
            cracy more than any other, except that state which is truly so, <lb/>
            and which holds the first rank. We have already seen, then, <lb/>
            that there are governments different from a monarchy, a demo­ <lb/>
            cracy, and an oligarchy, and what they are ; and also wherein <lb/>
            both aristocracies differ from each other, and free states from <lb/>
            an aristocracy; and it is evident, that these are not much <lb/>
            unlike each other.</p>

          <p>How a polity <lb/>
            arises.</p>
          <p>NEXT in order to what has been said, let us state <lb/>
            how that government which is peculiarly called a <lb/>
            polity arises, beside a democracy and an oligarchy, <lb/>
            and how it ought to be established ; and this will at the same <lb/>
            time show what are the proper limits by which these govern­ <lb/>
            ments are bounded; for we must mark out wherein they <lb/>
            differ from one another, and then from each of these we must <lb/>
            take as it were a contribution, and so combine them. There . <lb/>
            Modes of <lb/>
            blending states <lb/>
            together. \ <lb/>
            1st mode. <lb/>
            are three ways in which states may be blended <lb/>
            and joined together; for, in the first place, we <lb/>
            may take from both sides whatever the laws of <lb/>
            each have ordered; as for instance, in matters of <lb/>
            judicial trials. For in an oligarchy the rich are fined if they <lb/>
            do not serve as dicasts, but the poor are not paid for their <lb/>
            attendance ; but in democracies they are paid, while the rich <lb/>
            are not fined for neglect. Now each of these points is a <lb/>
            matter which belongs in common to both states; and hence <lb/>
            they are adapted to a free state, which is composed of both. <lb/>
            This, then, is one way in which they may be joined together. <lb/>
            2nd mode. <lb/>
            In the second place, a medium may be taken be­ <lb/>
            tween the different methods which each state lays <lb/>
            down ; for instance, in a democracy the right to vote in the <lb/>
            public assembly is either confined by no census at all, or by <lb/>
            a low one; in an oligarchy it belongs only to those whose <pb n="145"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. IX.] </note> <lb/>
            standard of wealth is high: therefore, as these two practices <lb/>
            are incompatible, a census between each may be established <lb/>
            in such a state. the third method is compounded <lb/>
            of two ordinances, 1 partly from the oligarchic <lb/>
            3rd mode. <lb/>
            principle and partly from the democratic. For instance, as <lb/>
            it seems suitable to a democracy, that the magistrates should <lb/>
            be chosen by lot, but to an aristocracy by vote; and it is <lb/>
            oligarchical to choose them according to a census, while not <lb/>
            to do so is democratical. To copy something from each other, <lb/>
            then, is at once aristocratical and suitable to a free state; <lb/>
            from an oligarchy, their choice of magistrates by vote, but <lb/>
            from a democracy their refusal to impose ;a census. This is <lb/>
            the way blending them : but the best test of a <lb/>
            happy mixture of a democracy and an oligarchy <lb/>
            is, when a person may properly call the same state <lb/>
            both a democracy and an oligarchy; for it is evi- <lb/>
            Test of a free <lb/>
            state or polity <lb/>
            being well de­ <lb/>
            vised. <lb/>
            dent, that those who thus speak of it are led to do so, because <lb/>
            both forms are there well blended together. And indeed this <lb/>
            is common to all means, that the extremes of each side should <lb/>
            be discerned in them; it is the case with the state <lb/>
            of Lacedaemon ; for many strive to maintain that <lb/>
            it is a democracy, because it has many particulars <lb/>
            The Spartan <lb/>
            constitution <lb/>
            instanced. <lb/>
            which follow that form of government; 2 as for instance, in <lb/>
            the first place, in the bringing up of their children. For the <lb/>
            children of both rich and poor are brought up in the same <lb/>
            manner; and they are educated in such a manner that the <lb/>
            children of the poor may partake of it: and the same rules <lb/>
            are observed when they are successively youths and men, <note type="footnote"> 1 Upon the essentially practical character of the Politics of Aristotle, <lb/>

            instance of this characteristic feature. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Upon the constitution of Sparta and the legislation of Lycurgus, the <lb/>

            " At Sparta, as in all other Greek republics, the sovereign power resided <lb/>
            in the Assembly of the people; where a Heracleid, however respected for <lb/>
            his birth, had no advantage in his vote over the common Dorian. In <lb/>
            later times we hear of two Assemblies, a greater and a lesser; but this <lb/>
            appears to have been an innovation, connected with other changes to be <lb/>
            hereafter described." The whole chapter is well worthy of an attentive <lb/>
            perusal, to any one who wishes to gain a real insight into the polity of <lb/>

            there is no distinction between a rich person and a poor one, <lb/>
            and in their public tables the same provision is served to all. <lb/>
            The rich also wear only such clothes as the poorest man <lb/>
            might be able to purchase. Moreover, with respect to two <lb/>
            magistracies of the highest rank, to one they have a right to <lb/>
            elect, and to have a share of the other; for they elect the <lb/>
            Senate 1 and partake in the Ephoralty. Others consider it as <lb/>
            an oligarchy, because it has many oligarchical points; as in <lb/>
            choosing all their officers by vote, and not by lot; in there <lb/>
            being but a few who have a right to judge on capital causes, <lb/>
            A free state <lb/>
            should be in­ <lb/>
            , dependent of <lb/>
            its neighbours. <lb/>
            and in matters of banishment, and the like. In­ <lb/>
            deed, a state which is well composed of two others <lb/>
            ought to show that it resembles them both, and <lb/>
            yet is neither one nor the other. Such a state <lb/>
            ought to have its means of preservation in itself, and not from <lb/>
            without; and when I say in itself, I do not mean that it <lb/>
            should owe this to the forbearance of their neighbours, (for <lb/>
            this may happen to a bad government,) but to the fact that <lb/>
            every member of the community is unwilling that there should <lb/>
            be the least alteration in its constitution. We have then <lb/>
            spoken of the method in which a free state ought to be estab­ <lb/>

            still let it receive its proper place in our plan, since we have <lb/>
            enumerated it also as one form of government. Now, in the <lb/>
            beginning of this work we inquired into the nature of kingly <lb/>
            government, where we entered into a particular examination <lb/>
            of what was most properly called kingly sway, and whether <lb/>
            it was advantageous to a state or not, and what it should be, <lb/>
            Of two kinds. <lb/>
            and whence and how established. We also divided <lb/>
            tyranny into two species, when we were upon the <note type="footnote"> I The Spartan <foreign xml:lang="grc">γερουσία</foreign>, or senate, consisted of 30 members, one <lb/>
            elected from each <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡβή</foreign>, as its representative. The two kings seem always <lb/>
            to have had seats in this representative body, and at most to have had the <lb/>
            privilege of a casting vote, which belonged either to the two kings con. <lb/>
            jointly, or perhaps, (as Thirlwall is inclined to think,) to the king of the <lb/>
            elder house alone. Compare Herod. vi. 57, with Thucyd. i. 20. </note> <pb n="147"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. XI.] </note> <lb/>
            subject of monarchy, because their power somehow or other <lb/>
            easily passes into a kingly government, owing to the fact that <lb/>
            they are both of them established by law; for among some <lb/>
            of the barbarians they elect monarchs with absolute power, <lb/>
            and formerly among the Greeks there were some such, whom <lb/>
            they called Æsymnetes. Now these have certain points of <lb/>
            difference from each other; for they were kingly so far as <lb/>
            they were regulated by law, ruled over voluntary subjects; <lb/>
            but they were tyrannical, because they ruled despotically, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to their own will. There is a third species <lb/>
            of tyranny, which seems to be most properly so <lb/>
            called, the counterpart of kingly power; and this <lb/>
            A third kind of <lb/>
            tyranny. <lb/>
            monarchy must needs be a tyranny, where one rules over his <lb/>
            equals and superiors, without being accountable for his con­ <lb/>
            duct, 1 and whose object is his own advantage, and not the ad­ <lb/>
            vantage of those whom he governs. And hence he rules by <lb/>
            compulsion; for no freeman will ever willingly submit to such <lb/>
            a government.2 These then, and so many, are the different <lb/>
            species of tyrannies, owing to the above-mentioned causes.</p>

            of life in which the greater part of mankind can share, and <lb/>
            that government of which most cities can partake. For as to <lb/>
            those, so called, aristocracies which we have now mentioned, <lb/>
            they either fall beyond the attainment of states,2 or so nearly <lb/>
            resemble that which is properly called a polity, that we shall <lb/>
            treat of them both as one.</p>
          <p>The opinions which we shall pass upon these subjects must <lb/>
            depend upon the same principles: for if what we have said in <lb/>
            our Ethics3 is true, that a happy life must arise from an un­ <lb/>
            interrupted course of virtue, and that virtue consists in a cer­ <lb/>
            tain mean, of necessity the middle life must certainly be the <lb/>
            happiest, the mean being supposed to be attainable by every <lb/>
            one. The boundaries of virtue and vice must also necessarily <lb/>
            be the same in a city and in a polity: for a polity is the very <lb/>
            life of the city. In every state the people are divided into <lb/>
            The middle <lb/>
            state to be <lb/>
            preferred. <lb/>
            three sorts; the very rich, the very poor, and, <lb/>
            thirdly, those who are between them. Since, then, <lb/>
            it is universally admitted that the mean is best, <lb/>
            it is evident, that even in point of fortune, a middle state is <lb/>
            to be preferred; for that state is most apt to submit to rea­ <lb/>
            son. For those who are very handsome, or very strong, or <lb/>
            very noble, or very rich, or, on the contrary, those who are <lb/>
            very poor, or very weak, or very mean, with difficulty obey <lb/>
            it. And this, because the one class is capricious and wicked <note type="footnote"> I Aristotle here tacitly refers to the Ideal Republic of Plato, which <lb/>

            tory or nature to correspond to it. But if we content ourselves with <lb/>
            taking the same terms in a relative sense, ... aristocracy will be that <lb/>

            they hold office as chiefs of a phyle or presidents of the <lb/>
            council ; and these things are both detrimental to the state. <lb/>
            Besides, those who excel in strength, in riches, or friends, or <lb/>
            the like, neither know how, nor are willing, to submit to com­ <lb/>
            mand :-( and this begins at home when they are boys, for there <lb/>
            they are brought up too delicately to be accustomed to obey <lb/>
            their preceptors:)—as for the very poor, their excessive want <lb/>
            reduces them to a state too mean ; so that the one know not <lb/>
            how to command, but only to be commanded as slaves, the <lb/>
            others know not how to submit to any command, but only to <lb/>
            command with despotic power. A city composed of such men <lb/>
            must therefore consist of slaves and masters, not of freemen ; <lb/>
            where one party must hate, and the other despise; and this <lb/>
            is very far removed from friendship and political community; <lb/>
            for a community supposes affection, for men do not even on <lb/>
            the road associate with their enemies. It is also <lb/>
            the aim of a city to be composed as much as pos­ <lb/>
            sible of equals; and this will be most so when <lb/>
            Equality to be <lb/>
            aimed at. <lb/>
            the inhabitants are in the middle state; whence it follows, <lb/>
            that that city must be best framed which is composed of those <lb/>
            who we say are naturally its proper members. It is men of <lb/>
            this station also who are best assured of safety; for they will <lb/>
            neither covet what belongs to others, as the poor do; nor <lb/>
            will others covet what is theirs, as the poor do what belongs <lb/>
            to the rich; and thus, without plotting against any one, and <lb/>
            having any one to plot against them, they will live free from <lb/>
            danger. For which reason Phocylides wisely prayed, <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεγαλοπονηρόι</foreign>. " To sin as it were with a cart-rope." Isa. v. 18. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The <foreign xml:lang="grc">φύλαρχοι</foreign>, generally, were the prefects of any state, as at Epidam­ <lb/>
            nus, where the government was formerly vested in them. See book v. <lb/>
            ch. i. At Athens the officers so called, after the age of Clisthenes, were <lb/>
            ten in number, one for each of the tribes, and were specially charged with <lb/>
            the command and superintendence of the cavalry. Herodotus (v. 19) in­ <lb/>
            forms us that Clisthenes, when he increased the tribes from four to ten, <lb/>
            made ten Phylarchs instead of four. It is however probable that he there <lb/>
            confounds the office of Phylarch with that of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">φμλοβασιλει̃ς</foreign>, who were <lb/>
            four in number. The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλαρχει̃ν</foreign> here is used apparently in a lax <lb/>
            and popular sense, equivalent perhaps to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιστατει̃ν</foreign>, to act as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιστατής</foreign> <lb/>
            over the <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόεδροι</foreign> or body of ten senators who presided over the rest for a <lb/>
            week, one of whom was chosen for every day in the week to preside as <lb/>
            chairman in the senate and the assembly of the people. During his day <lb/>
            of office he kept the public records and seal. </note> <pb n="150"/>

            " The middle state is best; that state be mine, <lb/>
            Whate'er my city be." 1 <lb/>
            It is plain, then, that the most perfect political community <lb/>
            must be amongst those who are in the middle rank, and that <lb/>
            The best state, <lb/>
            where the mean <lb/>
            out-numbers <lb/>
            the extremes. <lb/>
            those states can best be carried on, wherein these <lb/>
            are the majority and outweigh, if possible, both the <lb/>
            other classes; or, if that cannot be, at least then <lb/>
            either of them separate; for being thrown into <lb/>
            the balance it will prevent either excess from preponderating. <lb/>
            It is therefore the greatest happiness of citizens to possess a <lb/>
            moderate and convenient fortune; for when some possess too <lb/>
            much, and others nothing at all, the government must be <lb/>
            either an extreme democracy, or else a pure oligarchy; or, <lb/>
            from the excesses of both, a tyranny ; for this arises from a <lb/>
            headstrong democracy, or an oligarchy, but far more seldom <lb/>
            when the members of the community are nearly on an equality <lb/>
            with each other. We will assign a reason for this when we <lb/>
            come to treat of the alterations which different states are likely <lb/>
            to undergo. But it is clear that the middle state is the best, <lb/>
            for it is alone free from seditions ; for where the middle class <lb/>
            is large, there is less of sedition and insurrection to disturb <lb/>
            the community. And for the same reason extensive govern­ <lb/>
            ments are least liable to these inconveniencies; for there the <lb/>
            middle classes are very numerous; whereas in small ones it is <lb/>
            easy to pass to the two extremes, so as hardly to have any in <lb/>
            a middle state remaining, but the one half are rich, the other <lb/>
            Why democra­ <lb/>
            cies more <lb/>
            stable than <lb/>
            oligarchies. <lb/>
            poor. And from the same principle it comes, that <lb/>
            democracies are more firmly established, and of <lb/>
            longer continuance than oligarchies; but even in <lb/>
            those when there is a want of the proper number <lb/>
            )f men of middling fortune, the poor extend their power too <lb/>
            air, abuses arise, and the government is soon at an end. We <lb/>
            ug ht to consider as a proof of what we now advance, that <lb/>
            lie best lawgivers themselves were those in the middle rank <lb/>
            At life; amongst whom was Solon, as is evident from his <lb/>
            poems, and Lycurgus, (for he was not a king,2) and Charondas, <note type="footnote"> 1 Thus in Eurip.

            remarks of Thirlwall upon the history of that legislator. (History of Gr. <lb/>

            minority of Leobotas, that Lycurgus, governing as regent, employed the <lb/>
            power placed in his hands for the purpose of establishing his own institu-</note> <pb n="151"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. XI.] </note> <lb/>
            and indeed most others. And what has been said will show <lb/>
            us why of so many free states, some have changed to demo­ <lb/>
            cracies, others to oligarchies; for whenever the <lb/>
            number of persons in the middle state has been <lb/>
            too small, those who were the more numerous, <lb/>
            whether the rich or the poor, always overpower <lb/>
            Consequence of <lb/>
            having too <lb/>
            small a middle <lb/>
            class. <lb/>
            them, and assume to themselves the administration of public <lb/>
            affairs; and hence arises either a democracy or an oligarchy. <lb/>
            Moreover, when in consequence of their disputes and quarrels <lb/>
            with each other, either the rich get the better of the poor, or <lb/>
            the poor of the rich, neither of them will establish a free <lb/>
            state; but, as the record of their victory, they adopt one <lb/>
            which inclines to their own principles, and form either a de­ <lb/>
            mocracy or an oligarchy.</p>
          <p>And further, those who gained the leadership <lb/>
            of Greece, had each of them an eye to the re­ <lb/>
            spective forms of government in their own cities, <lb/>
            Policy of the <lb/>
            leading states <lb/>
            of Greece. <lb/>
            and established either democracies or oligarchies, 1 not con­ <lb/>
            sidering what was serviceable to the state, but what was simi­ <lb/>
            lar to their own. And for this reason a government has <lb/>
            never, or very seldom, been established where the supreme <lb/>
            power has been placed amongst those of the middle rank; <lb/>
            and, amongst a few, one man only of those who have yet <lb/>
            been conquerors has been persuaded to give the preference <lb/>
            to this arrangement. It is indeed an established custom with <lb/>
            the inhabitants of most cities, not to desire an equality, but <note type="footnote"> tions at Sparta. This however, as Thirlwall remarks, runs contrary to the <lb/>
            better attested tradition, which makes the lawgiver to have sprung from <lb/>
            the Eurypontid line. It is most probable that Lycurgus was himself the <lb/>
            son of Eunomus, the grandson of Eurypon, who was a king of Sparta, and <lb/>
            of the house of Procles. </note><note type="footnote"> I Compare the assertion of Thucydides, i. 19, who says that the Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians led out their allies " on oligarchic principles, shaping their <lb/>
            line of policy so as to suit their own interests alone." (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κατ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀλιγαρχίαν <lb/>
            σφισὶν αὑτοἵς μόνον ἐπιτηδείως ὅπως πολιτεύσωσι θεραπεύοντες</foreign>.) The <lb/>
            same words, or nearly so, occur again in the same book, chap. 76, where <lb/>
            the Athenians accuse the Spartans of pursuing this line of policy for their <lb/>
            own advantage; and again in chap. 144. One apparent instance to the <lb/>
            contrary we find in the policy of Sparta, where that state, according to <lb/>
            Herodotus, (v. ch. 64,) interfered in the internal affairs of Athens, and <lb/>
            aided them in expelling their tyrant. But even in this case, it is clear <lb/>
            that the Spartans hoped that the establishment of a democracy, in the <lb/>
            place of a tyranny, at Athens, would be the downfal of that state, and <lb/>
            so conduce to their own interests. </note> <pb n="152"/>

            next best, and <lb/>

            submit. Thus from what we have said, it is plain <lb/>
            what is the best state, and why. But with re­ <lb/>
            gard to other polities, since we say that there are <lb/>
            various forms both of democracy and oligarchy <lb/>
            it will not be difficult to judge to which we should give the <lb/>
            first place, to which the second, and which in a consequent <lb/>
            order is better or worse, now that the best form has been <lb/>
            defined: for that must be the best which is nearest to this, <lb/>
            and that the worst which is most distant from the mean, un- <lb/>
            No abstract <lb/>
            rule can be laid <lb/>

            mean by this, that it may happen, that though one <lb/>
            form of government may be better than another, <lb/>
            yet oftentimes nothing prevents another from being preferable <lb/>
            to it in particular circumstances, and for particular purposes.</p>

          <p>What govern­ <lb/>
            ment best suits <lb/>
            particular <lb/>
            cases.</p>
          <p>AFTER what has been said, it follows that we <lb/>
            should now show what and what kind of govern­ <lb/>
            ment is most suitable for particular cases. But <lb/>
            first we must lay down the same maxim as ap­ <lb/>
            plicable to all, that that party which desires to support the <lb/>
            established policy of the state, ought to be superior to that <lb/>
            States made up <lb/>
            of quality and <lb/>
            quantity. <lb/>
            which would alter it. Every city is made up of <lb/>
            quality and quantity: by quality I mean liberty, <lb/>
            riches, education, and nobility, and by quantity <lb/>
            the excess of its population. Now it may so happen, that <lb/>
            quality may exist in one of those parts of which the city is <lb/>
            composed, and quantity in the other; thus, the number of the <lb/>
            low-born may be greater than the number of those of family, <lb/>
            and the number of the poor than that of the rich ; but not so <lb/>
            far that the quantity of the one shall outweigh the quality <lb/>
            These should <lb/>
            be in due pro­ <lb/>
            portion. <lb/>
            of the other. Hence these must be properly ad­ <lb/>
            justed to each other; for where the number of <lb/>
            the poor exceeds the proportion above-mentioned, <lb/>
            there a democracy is wont to rise up, and the democracy will <lb/>
            be of a particular species, according to that class of men which <lb/>
            of dispo- <lb/>
            Effect intnese <lb/>
            two elements. <lb/>
            may happen to be most numerous: thus, should <lb/>
            the number of husbandmen be excessive, it will <lb/>
            be of the best kind; if of mechanics, and those <pb n="153"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. XIII.] </note> <lb/>
            who work for pay, of the worst; in the same manner it may <lb/>
            be of any other set between these two. But where the rich and <lb/>
            the noble prevail more in quality, than they fall short in quan­ <lb/>
            tity, there an oligarchy ensues; and this oligarchy in like <lb/>
            manner may be of different species, according to the nature of <lb/>
            the oligarchical party which prevails. Every le­ <lb/>
            gislator in framing his constitution ought to have <lb/>
            a particular regard to those in the middle rank <lb/>
            The middle <lb/>
            rank to be con. <lb/>
            suIted, <lb/>
            of life; 1 for whether he intends an oligarchy, they should be <lb/>
            the object of his aim; or whether a democracy, he ought to <lb/>
            win these over to the laws. But whenever their number <lb/>
            exceeds that of the two others, or at least over one of them, <lb/>
            it is possible to find stability in the constitution ; for there is <lb/>
            no fear that the rich and the poor should agree to conspire <lb/>
            together against them, for neither of these will choose to serve <lb/>
            the other. But if any seek to fix the administration on a <lb/>
            wider basis, they will find none preferable to this; for to rule <lb/>
            by turns is what the rich and the poor will not submit to, on <lb/>
            account of their distrust of each other. It is <lb/>
            moreover allowed, that an arbitrator is the most <lb/>
            proper person for both parties to trust to; and the <lb/>
            middle class serve as an arbitrator.</p>
          <p>as being a <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαιτήτης</foreign>.</p>
          <p>Those too who would establish aristocratical governments <lb/>
            are mistaken, not only in giving too much power to the rich, <lb/>
            but also in misleading the common people; for in length of <lb/>
            time, out of unreal goods real evils must needs arise ; for the <lb/>
            encroachments of the rich are more destructive to the state <lb/>
            than those of the poor.</p>

          <p>THERE are five particulars, in which, under fair <lb/>
            pretences, they deal craftily with the rights of the <lb/>
            people; and these are their public assemblies, <lb/>
            Points in which <lb/>
            the rich cajole <lb/>
            the poor. <lb/>
            their offices of state, their courts of justice, their military <lb/>
            power, and their gymnastic exercises. With regard to their <lb/>
            public assemblies; in having them open to all, but in fining <lb/>
            the rich only, or a far larger sum, for not attending: with <lb/>
            respect to offices, in permitting the poor to swear off, but not <note type="footnote"> I This would seem, for instance, to have been the distinguishing feature <lb/>
            in the legislation of Solon at Athens, and of king Servius at Rome. </note> <pb n="154"/>

            granting this indulgence to those who come up to the census; <lb/>
            with respect to their courts of justice, in fining the rich for <lb/>
            non-attendance, but the poor not at all; or those a great deal, <lb/>
            and these very little, as was done in the laws of Charondas. <lb/>
            In some places every citizen who is enrolled, has a right to <lb/>
            attend the assemblies and to try causes; and if they do not <lb/>
            do so, a very heavy fine is laid upon them; that through fear <lb/>
            of the fine, they may avoid being enrolled, and that through <lb/>
            not being on the roll, they need not serve in the assembly or <lb/>
            the courts. The same spirit prevails with those who regulate <lb/>
            their bearing arms, and their gymnastic exercises; for tho <lb/>
            poor are excused if they have no arms, but the rich are fined ; <lb/>
            and the same method takes place if they do not attend their gym­ <lb/>
            nastic exercises, for there is no penalty laid on the one, but <lb/>
            there is on the other: in order that the rich may be led to keep <lb/>
            the one, and attend the other, while the poor, through fear of <lb/>
            the penalty, do neither. These are the deceitful contrivances <lb/>
            The devices of <lb/>
            a democracy. <lb/>
            of oligarchical legislators. But contrary devices <lb/>
            prevail in a democracy; for there they make tho <lb/>
            poor a proper allowance for attending the assem <lb/>
            blies and the courts, but give the rich nothing for so doing 1 <lb/>
            and hence it is evident, that if any one would properly blend <lb/>
            these customs together, they must extend both the pay and <lb/>
            the fine to every member of the community, and then every <lb/>
            one would share it, whereas at present the polity is in the <lb/>
            hands of one part only. The citizens of a free state ought to <lb/>
            consist of those only who bear arms: with respect to their <lb/>
            income, it is not easy to determine exactly, and to say that it <lb/>
            Extension of <lb/>
            the franchise. <lb/>
            ought to be so much: but keeping quality in view, <lb/>
            it is fit to make the franchise as extensive as pos­ <lb/>
            sible, so that those who share in it shall out-num­ <lb/>
            ber those who do not; for those who are poor, although they <lb/>
            partake not of the offices of the state, are willing to live <lb/>
            quietly, provided that no one disturbs them in their property. <lb/>
            But this is not an easy matter; for it may not always happen <lb/>
            that those who are at the head of public affairs are of a <lb/>
            humane behaviour. In time of war the poor are accustomed <lb/>
            to show no alacrity except they have provisions found them; <lb/>
            but when they are provided, then indeed they are willing to <lb/>
            fight. In some governments the power is vested not only in <lb/>
            those who bear arms, but also in those who have borne them. <pb n="155"/>

            Among the Malienses, the state was composed of <lb/>
            these latter only, for to all the offices they elected <lb/>
            soldiers who had served their time. And the <lb/>
            first states in Greece which succeeded those where <lb/>
            Gradual rise of <lb/>
            the power of <lb/>
            thp foot-sol­ <lb/>
            diers. <lb/>
            kingly power was established, were governed by the military. <lb/>
            First of all they were governed by the horse,-( for at that <lb/>
            time the strength and excellence of the army depended on the <lb/>
            horse, as the heavy-armed foot were useless without proper <lb/>
            discipline ; but the art of tactics was not known to the <lb/>
            ancients, for which reason their strength lay in their horse:) <lb/>
            -but as the cities grew larger, and depended more on their <lb/>
            foot-soldiers, 1 greater numbers partook of the freedom of the <lb/>
            state; and for this reason, what we call republics were form­ <lb/>
            , erly called democracies. The ancient governments were pro­ <lb/>
            perly oligarchical and monarchical; for on account of the few <lb/>
            persons in each state, they had but a small number of the <lb/>
            middle rank; so that being but few, and used to subordina­ <lb/>
            tion, they more easily submitted to be governed. We have <lb/>
            now shown why there are many sorts of governments, and <lb/>
            others different from those of which we have treated; (for <lb/>
            there are more species of democracies than one, and the like <lb/>
            is true of other forms ;) as also what are their differences, and <lb/>
            whence they arise; and besides this, we have shown which <lb/>
            is the best form, at least in general; and which of the others <lb/>
            is best suited for particular people.</p>

          <p>LET us now again proceed to make some reflec­ <lb/>
            tions, both general and particular, upon each form <lb/>
            of government in due order, beginning with those <lb/>
            principles which appertain to each. Now in all <lb/>
            states there are three particulars, in which the <lb/>
            General re­ <lb/>
            marks on <lb/>
            polities. <lb/>
            Three points to <lb/>
            be considered. <lb/>
            careful legislator ought well to consider what is expedient to <lb/>
            each form of government; and if these are in a proper con- <note type="footnote"> I Compare Thirlwall, History of Greece, i. ch. 8. " The strength of <lb/>
            the Spartan army lay in its heavy-armed infantry; and no other service <lb/>
            was thought equally worthy of the free warrior, because none called forth <lb/>
            courage and discipline in the same degree. Hence little value was set on <lb/>
            the cavalry; and though in the Peloponnesian war it was found neces. <lb/>
            sary to pay greater attention to it, it never acquired any great efficacy or <lb/>
            reputation." </note> <pb n="156"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK IV. </note> <lb/>
            dition, the state must necessarily prosper; and according to <lb/>
            the variation of each of these, one state will differ from the <lb/>
            1. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκκλη­ <lb/>
            σία</foreign>. <lb/>
            2. The officers <lb/>
            of state. <lb/>
            3. The judicial <lb/>
            department. <lb/>
            The public <lb/>
            assembly <lb/>
            considered. <lb/>
            other. The first of these is the assembly for <lb/>
            public affairs ; the second, the officers of the state ; <lb/>
            (that is, who they ought to be, and with what <lb/>
            power they should be invested, and in what man­ <lb/>
            ner they should be appointed;) and the third, the <lb/>
            judicial department. Now it is the proper busi­ <lb/>
            ness of the public assembly1 to determine con­ <lb/>
            cerning war and peace, to make or break off alli­ <lb/>
            ances, to enact laws, to sentence to death, banishment, or <lb/>
            confiscation of goods, and to call the magistrates to account for <lb/>
            their behaviour when in office. Now these powers must ne­ <lb/>
            cessarily be all intrusted to the citizens in general, or all of <lb/>
            them to some, whether it be to one magistrate or to more ; or <lb/>
            different ones to different magistrates, or some to all, but others <lb/>
            One method <lb/>
            (democratical). <lb/>
            to some only. Now that all should be intrusted <lb/>
            with all offices, is in the spirit of a democracy, for <lb/>
            the people aim at such an equality. There are <lb/>
            many methods of delegating these powers to the citizens at <lb/>
            large, one of which is to let them execute them by turn and <lb/>
            not all together, as was done by Telecles the Milesian in his <lb/>
            state ;2 (for in other states the supreme council is composed <lb/>
            of the different magistrates who meet together, and they suc­ <lb/>
            ceed to the offices of the community by proper divisions of <lb/>
            tribes, wards, and by other small distinctions, till each goes <lb/>
            through them;) and to provide that the whole community shall <lb/>
            not meet together, except to enact new laws, or on some matter <lb/>
            of state, or to hear what the magistrates have to propose. An- <lb/>
            A second <lb/>
            method. <lb/>
            other method is for the people to meet in a collective <lb/>
            body, but only for the purpose of holding the co­ <lb/>
            mitia, of making laws, of determining concerning <lb/>
            war or peace, and of inquiring into the conduct of the magis­ <lb/>
            trates, while the remaining part of public business is conducted <lb/>
            by the magistrates, who have their separate departments, and <note type="footnote"> 1 Upon the whole subject of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκκλησία</foreign>, or public assembly, at Athens, <lb/>

            are chosen out of the whole community, by vote or by ballot. <lb/>
            Another method is for the people in general to <lb/>
            meet for the choice of magistrates, and to examine <lb/>
            Third method. <lb/>
            into their conduct, and also to deliberate concerning war and <lb/>
            alliances; but to leave all other things to the magistrates <lb/>
            whoever happen to be chosen, and whose particular employ­ <lb/>
            ments are such as necessarily require persons well skilled in <lb/>
            them. A fourth method is for every person to <lb/>
            meet and deliberate upon every subject, where <lb/>
            Fourth method. <lb/>
            the magistrates can determine nothing of themselves, but only <lb/>
            give their opinions first; and this is the method according to <lb/>
            which the most pure democracy is carried on, which, we say, is <lb/>
            analogous to the proceedings in a dynastic oligarchy and a ty­ <lb/>
            rannic monarchy. These methods, then, are all democratical. <lb/>
            But when the power is in the hands of part of the <lb/>
            community only, it is an oligarchy; and this also <lb/>
            admits of sundry varieties; for whenever the <lb/>
            When the con <lb/>
            stitution is oli­ <lb/>
            garchical. <lb/>
            officers of state are chosen out of those who have a moderate <lb/>
            fortune, and they are more in number, owing to the lowness <lb/>
            of the standard, and when they do not alter that line which <lb/>
            the law has laid down, but carefully follow it, and when all <lb/>
            within the census are eligible, certainly the state is then an <lb/>
            oligarchy, but founded on true principles of government from <lb/>
            its moderation. And when the people in general do not par­ <lb/>
            take of the deliberative power, but certain persons chosen for <lb/>
            that purpose, who govern according to law, as in the previous <lb/>
            case ; this also is an oligarchy. But when those who have <lb/>
            the deliberative power elect each other, and the son succeeds <lb/>
            to the father, and when they can supersede the laws, such a <lb/>
            government is of necessity a strict oligarchy. But <lb/>
            when different persons determine on different <lb/>
            things, as when all decide matters of war and <lb/>
            peace, and inquire into the conduct of their magis- <lb/>
            When it is aris­ <lb/>
            tocratical, or <lb/>
            tending to a <lb/>
            free state. <lb/>
            trates, and while other things are left to different officers, <lb/>
            elected either by vote or lot, then the government is an aris­ <lb/>
            tocracy or a free state. When some things are decided by <lb/>
            officers chosen by vote, and others by officers chosen by lot, out <lb/>
            . of the people in general, or from a certain number elected for <lb/>
            that purpose, or if both the votes and the lots are open to all, <lb/>
            that state is partly an aristocracy, and partly a free govern­ <lb/>
            ment itself. These, then, are the methods in which the de. <pb n="158"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK IV. </note> <lb/>
            liberative power is vested in different states, and each of them <lb/>
            follows the distinctions laid down above.</p>
          <p>Assemblies <lb/>
            serviceable to <lb/>
            a democracy.</p>
          <p>It is advantageous, however, to a democracy <lb/>
            in the pure sense of the word now-a-days, (by <lb/>
            which I mean a state wherein the people at large <lb/>
            have a supreme power even over the laws,) with a view to <lb/>
            holding frequent public assemblies, to imitate the example of <lb/>
            oligarchies in their courts of justice; (for they fine those who <lb/>
            are appointed to try causes, if they do not attend, and the <lb/>
            poor in a democracy are rewarded for their attendance;) I <lb/>
            say it is advantageous to the people to do the same in their <lb/>
            assemblies; and their counsels will be best when all advise <lb/>
            with each other, the citizens with the nobles, and the nobles <lb/>
            with the citizens. It is also advisable to elect, either by vote <lb/>
            or lot, an equal number of both ranks, to take part in the <lb/>
            council. It is also proper, if the common people in the state <lb/>
            are very numerous, either not to pay every one for his attend­ <lb/>
            ance, but such a number only as will make them equal to the <lb/>
            nobles, or to reject the greater part of them by lot. In an <lb/>
            How to act in <lb/>
            an oligarchy as <lb/>
            to assemblies. <lb/>
            oligarchy they should either raise some of the <lb/>
            common people to the council, or else, as is done <lb/>
            in other states, establish a court of officers called <lb/>
            a Provisional Committee, or Guardians of the Laws,1 whose <lb/>
            business it is to propose first what they shall afterwards enact. <lb/>
            By this means the people will have a place in the administra­ <lb/>
            tion of public affairs, without having it in their power to oc­ <lb/>
            casion any disorder in the government. Moreover, the people <lb/>
            may be allowed to have a vote in whatever bill is proposed, <lb/>
            but may not themselves propose any thing contrary to it; or <note type="footnote"> 1 The term <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόβουλοι</foreign> is often used in a looser sense, as applicable to <lb/>
            any body of persons appointed to consult or take measures for the benefit <lb/>
            of the people. In this sense the word is applied to the delegates sent by <lb/>
            the twelve cities of Ionia to attend the Panionian assembly, (Herod. vi. 7,) <lb/>
            and to those sent by the Greek states to the Isthmus (vii. 172). But the <lb/>
            word is also used, like <foreign xml:lang="grc">νομοφύλακες</foreign>, to denote an oligarchical body, in <lb/>
            whom the government of a state was vested, or who exercised at least a con­ <lb/>
            trolling power over the senate and popular assemblies. Such a body would <lb/>
            seem to have existed at Megara, where, although democracy prevailed at an <lb/>
            earlier period, the government became oligarchical before the beginning of <lb/>
            the Peloponnesian war. (See above, book iv. 12.) A body of men, ten <lb/>
            in number, were appointed at Athens, at the expiration of the Sicilian <lb/>
            war, to act as a committee of public safety, under this title. They are <lb/>
            mentioned by Thucydides (viii. 1). </note> <pb n="159"/>

            they may give their advice, while the power of determining <lb/>
            may be with the magistrates only. It is also necessary to fol­ <lb/>
            low a contrary practice to what is established in some democra­ <lb/>
            cies ; for the people should be allowed the power of pardoning, <lb/>
            but not of condemning, but the cause should be referred back <lb/>
            again to the magistrates: whereas the contrary takes place in <lb/>
            some republics; for the power of pardoning is with the few, <lb/>
            but not of condemning, which is always referred to the people <lb/>
            at large. And thus let it stand determined concerning the <lb/>
            deliberative power, and that which is supreme in the state.</p>

          <p>WE now proceed to discuss the choice of magis­ <lb/>
            trates ; for this branch of public business contains <lb/>
            many different parts, as to how many there shall <lb/>
            The choice of <lb/>
            magistrates <lb/>
            considered. <lb/>
            be, what shall be their particular office, and with respect to <lb/>
            time how long each shall continue in place; (for some make <lb/>
            it six months, others less, others for a year, others for a much <lb/>
            longer time;) or whether they shall be perpetual, or for a long <lb/>
            time, or neither; and also whether the same person may fill <lb/>
            the same office several times, or may not be allowed to en­ <lb/>
            joy it even twice, but only once ; and also with respect to the <lb/>
            appointment of magistrates, from whom and by whom they <lb/>
            should be chosen, and in what manner ; for in all these par­ <lb/>
            ticulars we ought properly to be able to distinguish as many <lb/>
            different ways as may be followed ; and then to show which <lb/>
            of these is best suited to such and such governments. Now it <lb/>
            is not easy to determine whom we ought properly to call a <lb/>
            magistrate: for a government requires many persons in office; <lb/>
            but every one of those who is either chosen by <lb/>
            vote or lot is not to be reckoned a magistrate. The <lb/>
            priests, for instance, in the first place; for these <lb/>
            A magistrate <lb/>
            defined, prac­ <lb/>
            tically. <lb/>
            are to be considered as a very different body from civil mags­ <lb/>
            trates : to these we may add the choragi,1 and heralds ; nay, <lb/>
            even ambassadors are elected. There are too some civil em- <note type="footnote"> 1 The choragus was the person on whom fell the burden of one of the <lb/>
            recurring (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγκύκλιοι</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="grc">λειτούϱγιαι</foreign>, called choragia, and was the person <lb/>
            selected by the state to be its representative. He had to provide and to <lb/>
            maintain the chorus, and to procure a <foreign xml:lang="grc">χοροδιδάσκαλος</foreign>, or teacher, whom <lb/>
            he paid for instructing the choreutæ. </note> <pb n="160"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK IV. </note> <lb/>
            ployments which belong to the citizens ; and these are either <lb/>
            when they are all engaged on one business, as when as soldiers <lb/>
            they obey their general, or when part of them only are engaged, <lb/>
            as in governing the women or educating the youth; and also <lb/>
            some economic; for they often elect inspectors of the corn­ <lb/>
            market ; others are servile ; and for these, if they are rich, they <lb/>
            employ slaves. But to speak simply, those are most properly <lb/>
            called magistrates, who are members of the deliberative coun­ <lb/>
            cil, or who decide causes, or are in some command ; the last <lb/>
            more especially, for to command is somewhat peculiar to ma­ <lb/>
            gistracy. But, to speak the truth, this question is of no great <lb/>
            practical consequence ; 1 for as yet no decision has been given <lb/>
            between those who dispute about the term. It admits indeed <lb/>
            another speculative inquiry; but to inquire what officers are <lb/>
            necessary to the being of a state, and how many, and what, <lb/>
            though not necessary, may yet be advantageous in a well- <lb/>
            established government, is a much more useful controversy <lb/>
            with respect to all states in general, as well as to small cities. <lb/>
            Whether one <lb/>
            office should be <lb/>
            given to more <lb/>
            than one <lb/>
            person. <lb/>
            In extensive governments indeed it is possible and <lb/>
            proper too to allot one employment to one person ; <lb/>
            as there are many to serve the public in so nu­ <lb/>
            merous a society, where some may be passed over <lb/>
            for a long time, and others never be in office but once. And <lb/>
            indeed every thing is better done which has the whole atten­ <lb/>
            tion of one person, than when that attention is divided amongst <lb/>
            many. But in small states it is necessary that a few of the <lb/>
            citizens should execute many employments; for, owing to the <lb/>
            scantiness of their numbers, it is not convenient that many of <lb/>
            them should be in office at the same time; for where shall we <lb/>
            find others to succeed them in turn ? Small states too some­ <lb/>
            times want the same magistrates and the same laws as large <lb/>
            ones; but the one often want the same magistrates, but this <lb/>
            happens in the others but once only in a long time; so that dif­ <lb/>
            ferent charges may be intrusted to the same person without <lb/>
            any inconvenience, for they will not interfere with each other <lb/>
            and for want of sufficient members in the community it will <lb/>
            be necessary to make offices like a spit and candlestick in <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδὲν διαφὲρει πρὸς τὰς χρήσεις</foreign>, as opposed to <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὸς τὴν γνω̃σιν</foreign>, i. e. <lb/>
            theoretically and scientifically viewed. In other words, they do not differ <lb/>
            for all practical purposes, and though distinguishable from each other, <lb/>
            they are not divisible. </note> <pb n="161"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. XV.] </note> <lb/>
            one. If we could tell how many magistrates are necessary <lb/>
            in every city, and how many, though not necessary, it is yet <lb/>
            proper to have, we could then the better infer what different <lb/>
            offices it is fitting to assign to one magistrate. It is also <lb/>
            fitting to know what tribunals in different places should have <lb/>
            different things under their jurisdiction, and also what things <lb/>
            should always come under the cognizance of the same magis­ <lb/>
            trate ; for instance, as to decency of manners, whether the clerk <lb/>
            of the market 1 shall take cognizance of it in the market, and <lb/>
            another magistrate in another place, or the same magistrate <lb/>
            every where: or whether a distinction shall be made of the <lb/>
            fact, or of the parties; as for instance, whether there shall <lb/>
            be one judge of all decency, or one when a man is concerned <lb/>
            and another when a woman.</p>
          <p>Further also, in different states, shall the ma­ <lb/>
            gistrates be different or the same in kind ? for ex­ <lb/>
            ample, in a democracy, an oligarchy, an aristo­ <lb/>
            cracy, and a monarchy, shall the same officers <lb/>
            What course is <lb/>
            to be followed <lb/>
            In different <lb/>
            kinds of states. <lb/>
            have the supreme power, though not chosen from equals, or <lb/>
            shall it be different in different governments; as in an aris­ <lb/>
            tocracy the officers of the state are allotted to the educated; <lb/>
            in an oligarchy to those who are rich; in a democracy to the <lb/>
            freemen ? Or shall the magistrates be different, as the com­ <lb/>
            munities differ? For it may happen that the very same <lb/>
            magistracy may be sometimes proper, sometimes otherwise: <lb/>
            in one state it may be necessary that the magistrate have great <lb/>
            powers, in another but small. There are also certain magis­ <lb/>
            trates peculiar to certain states; as the provisional commit­ <lb/>
            tee is not proper in a democracy, but a senate is; for some <lb/>
            order is necessary, whose business shall be to consider and <lb/>
            prepare the bills beforehand, that the people may have <lb/>
            leisure to attend to their own affairs; and when these are <note type="footnote"> 1 The Agoranomi, or clerks of the market, were public functionaries <lb/>
            in almost all the Greek states, whose occupations corresponded for the <lb/>
            most part with those of the Roman ædiles. At Athens their number was <lb/>
            ten; their principal duty was to inspect the market, and to see that all <lb/>
            laws relating to it were duly observed. They had the power of inflicting <lb/>
            summary punishment on all persons convicted of cheating, especially in <lb/>
            the case of using false weights and measures; and on foreigners they <lb/>
            had the right of inflicting corporal chastisement, for which purpose they <lb/>
            would seem to have carried in their hands a whip, as we learn from the <lb/>
            Scholiast on Aristoph. Acham. 688. </note> <note type="footnote"> M </note> <pb n="162"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK IV. </note> <lb/>
            few in number, the state inclines to an oligarchy. The pro­ <lb/>
            visional committee indeed must always be few, so that it is <lb/>
            peculiar to an oligarchy: and where there are both these <lb/>
            offices in the same state, this office is superior to that of the <lb/>
            senator, the one having only a democratical power, the other <lb/>
            an oligarchical. And indeed the power of the senate is lost <lb/>
            in those democracies in which the people meet in one public <lb/>
            assembly and take all the business into their own hands. And <lb/>
            this is likely to happen when the community in general are <lb/>
            either in easy circumstances or paid for their attendance; for <lb/>
            they then have leisure often to meet together and determine <lb/>
            The <foreign xml:lang="grc">παιδόνομος</foreign> <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυναικό­ <lb/>
            νομος</foreign>, where <lb/>
            necessary. <lb/>
            every thing for themselves. A magistrate to control <lb/>
            the boys1 or women, or who takes any department <lb/>
            similar to this, is to be found in an aristocracy, but <lb/>
            not in a democracy; for who can forbid the wives <lb/>
            of the poor from appearing in public ? Neither is such a <lb/>
            magistrate met with in an oligarchy; for the women there <lb/>
            are too delicate to bear control. And thus much for this <lb/>
            subject at present; but we must endeavour to treat at large <lb/>
            of the establishment of magistrates, beginning from first <lb/>
            principles. Now they differ from each other in three ways, <lb/>
            from which, when blended together, arise all the varieties of <lb/>
            Three points of <lb/>
            distinction. <lb/>
            Each of these <lb/>
            again happen <lb/>
            in three ways. <lb/>
            necessity. The first of these differences is in <lb/>
            those who appoint the magistrates, the second <lb/>
            consists in those who are appointed, the third in <lb/>
            the mode of appointment. And each of these <lb/>
            three differ in three ways; for either all the <lb/>
            citizens collectively, or some out of their whole <note type="footnote"> 1The <foreign xml:lang="grc">παιδόνομος</foreign> at Sparta was a magistrate who had the general <lb/>
            superintendence of the education of the boys. His office was held in very <lb/>
            high esteem, and he was always chosen from the noblest citizens. He <lb/>
            had to make a general inspection of the boys, and to punish those who <lb/>
            were negligent and idle: those who were refractory he might even bring <lb/>
            before the Ephors. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυναικόνομοι</foreign> were Athenian magistrates who <lb/>
            superintended the conduct of Athenian women. There were no such <lb/>
            officers at Sparta; whence arose perhaps the laxity of the women, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γυναι­ <lb/>
            κω̃ν ἄνεσις</foreign>,) to which our author in the first book of his present treatise <lb/>
            attributes such serious consequences. Some think that they were first <lb/>
            instituted by Solon, but that their powers were afterwards extended so as <lb/>
            to include the control of men as well, and of repressing all excesses and <lb/>
            indecencies committed in private society. They would appear to have been <lb/>
            ministers of the court of Areopagus, and in this capacity to have taken <lb/>
            care that decency and moderation were observed in private as well as in <lb/>
            public life. </note> <pb n="163"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. xv.] </note> <lb/>
            body, or some out of a particular order in it, may appoint, <lb/>
            according to fortune, nobility, or merit, or some other rule- <lb/>
            (as at Megara, where the right of election was with those who <lb/>
            had returned together to their country, and had reinstated <lb/>
            themselves by force of arms)—and this either by vote or lot. <lb/>
            Again, these several modes may be differently <lb/>
            formed together; as for instance, some magistrates <lb/>
            Or, combined. <lb/>
            may be chosen by part of the community, others by the whole; <lb/>
            some out of part, others out of the whole; some by vote, others <lb/>
            by lot: and each of these different modes admit of a four-fold <lb/>
            subdivision. For either all may elect all by vote, or by lot; <lb/>
            and when all elect, they may either proceed without any distinc­ <lb/>
            tion, or they may elect by a certain division of tribes, wards, <lb/>
            or companies, till they have gone through the whole com­ <lb/>
            munity : and some magistrates may be elected one way, and <lb/>
            others another. Again, if some magistrates are elected either <lb/>
            by vote or lot by all the citizens, or by the vote of some and <lb/>
            the lot of some, or some one way and some another; that is <lb/>
            to say, some by the vote of all, others by the lot of all; there <lb/>
            will then be twelve different methods of electing the magis­ <lb/>
            trates, without blending the two together. Of <lb/>
            these there are two forms adapted to a democracy; <lb/>
            namely, to have all the magistrates chosen out of <lb/>
            Which form <lb/>
            best in a demo­ <lb/>
            cracy. <lb/>
            all the people, either by vote, or by lot, or by both; that is to <lb/>
            say, some of them by lot, and some by vote. In <lb/>
            a free state the whole community should not elect <lb/>
            at the same time, but some out of the whole, or <lb/>
            Which in a <lb/>
            polity. <lb/>
            out of some particular rank; and this either by lot, or vote, <lb/>
            or both: and they should elect either out of the whole com­ <lb/>
            munit, or out of some particular persons in it, and this both <lb/>
            by lot and vote. In an oligarchy it is proper to <lb/>
            choose some magistrates out of the whole body of <lb/>
            the citizens, some by vote, some by lot, others by <lb/>
            Which in an <lb/>
            oligarchy. <lb/>
            both: but to choose by lot is most suitable to that form of <lb/>
            government. In a free aristocracy, some magis­ <lb/>
            trates should be chosen out of the community in <lb/>
            general, others out of a particular rank, or these <lb/>
            Which in an <lb/>
            aristocracy. <lb/>
            by choice, and those by lot. In a pure oligarchy, the mags <lb/>
            trates should be chosen out of certain ranks, and by certain <lb/>
            persons, and some of those by lot, others by both methods; <lb/>

            aristocracy for the whole community to elect their magistrates <lb/>

          <p>The judicial <lb/>
            department <lb/>
            considered.</p>
          <p>OF the three parts of a government, it remains <lb/>
            to consider the judicial; 2 and this also we shall <lb/>
            divide in the same manner as before, into three <lb/>
            parts. And there are three points of distinction; of whom <lb/>
            the judges shall consist, and for what causes, and how chosen. <lb/>
            When I say of whom, I mean whether they shall be the whole <lb/>
            people, or some individuals; by for what causes, I mean, how <lb/>
            many different kinds of courts there shall be; and by how, <lb/>
            Eight different <lb/>
            kinds of courts. <lb/>
            whether they shall be elected by vote or lot. Let <lb/>
            us first determine, how many different kinds of <lb/>
            courts there ought to be. Now these are eight: <lb/>
            the first, is the court of judicial scrutiny; the second, one to <lb/>
            punish those who have injured the public; the third, to take <lb/>
            cognizance of those causes in which the state is a party; the <lb/>
            fourth, to decide between magistrates and private persons who <lb/>
            appeal from a fine laid upon them; the fifth, to determine dis- <note type="footnote"> 1 See note above on the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγοράνομοι</foreign>, p. 161. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 For an adequate explanation of the import of the terms <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικαστής</foreign> and <lb/>

            Roman Antiquities. It is as well to add, that at Athens the Dicasts were <lb/>
            elected by lot to their duties in the Heliastic courts; and that the con­ <lb/>
            ditions of eligibility were, that the individual should be, Istly, a free citi­ <lb/>

            Aristotle here tacitly approves the principle on which the Heliastic courts <lb/>
            were founded, and that in fact the division here given is mainly based <lb/>
            upon it. </note> <pb n="165"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. XVI.] </note> <lb/>
            putes which may arise concerning contracts of great value; and <lb/>
            besides these there must be courts to judge between foreigners, <lb/>
            and of murders, of which there are different species. And <lb/>
            these may all be tried by the same judges or by different <lb/>
            ones ; for there are murders of malice prepense, and of chance­ <lb/>
            medley ; there is also justifiable homicide, where the fact is <lb/>
            admitted, but the legality of it disputed. There is also a <lb/>
            fourth, called at Athens the court of Phreatto,l which deter­ <lb/>
            mines points relating to a murder committed by one who has <lb/>
            run away, to decide whether he shall be allowed to return ; but <lb/>
            such affairs happen very seldom, and then in large cities ; the <lb/>
            seventh court is to determine causes wherein strangers are <lb/>
            concerned, one part if cause is between stranger and stranger, <lb/>
            and another if between a stranger and a citizen. Over and <lb/>
            above all these there is a court for small actions, ranging from <lb/>
            one drachma to five, or a little more ; for these ought also to <lb/>
            be legally determined, and not to be brought before the whole <lb/>
            body of the judges. But let us set aside these matters, both <lb/>
            actions for murder, and those wherein strangers are the par­ <lb/>
            ties ; and let us particularly treat of those courts which more <lb/>
            particularly relate to the affairs of the community, and which, <lb/>
            if not well conducted, occasion seditions and commotions in <lb/>
            the state. Now, of necessity, either all persons, appointed by <lb/>
            vote or by lot, must judge of all these different causes, or <lb/>
            all must judge of all causes, some of them chosen by vote, and <lb/>
            others by lot, or in some causes by vote, in others by lot. <lb/>
            Thus there will be four modes of appointing <lb/>
            judges. There will be just the same number also <lb/>
            if they are chosen out of part of the people only; <lb/>
            Four ways of <lb/>
            appointing <lb/>
            judges. <lb/>
            for again, either the judges of all causes must be chosen out <lb/>
            of that part by vote or lot, or some by lot and some by vote; <lb/>
            or some courts which have cognizance of the same causes <lb/>
            must be formed partly by vote, and partly by lot; by which <lb/>
            means there will be the same number of them also as was <lb/>

            general, and of each state in particular; and what are the <lb/>
            means of saving each form of government from <lb/>
            corruption. And here we ought first to lay down <lb/>
            this principle, that there are many governments, <lb/>
            all of which approve of what is just and equal <lb/>
            according to analogy, 1 and yet fail of attaining <lb/>
            to it, as we have already mentioned. Thus de­ <lb/>
            mocracies have arisen from supposing that those <lb/>
            A principle laid <lb/>
            down. <lb/>
            Two kinds of <lb/>
            equality. <lb/>
            How states <lb/>
            have come to <lb/>
            fail of obtain­ <lb/>
            ing their end. <lb/>
            who are equal in any one thing, are so in every other cir­ <lb/>
            cumstance ; as, because they are equal in liberty, they think <lb/>
            themselves equal in every thing else; and oligarchies, from <lb/>
            supposing that those who are unequal in one thing, are un­ <lb/>
            equal in all; for they deem that when men are unequal in <lb/>
            point of fortune, there can be no equality between them. <lb/>
            Hence it follows, that those who in some respects <lb/>
            are equal with others endeavour to secure an <lb/>
            equality with them in every thing; and those who <lb/>
            Desire of equal­ <lb/>
            ity or superior­ <lb/>
            ity. <lb/>
            are superior to others, endeavour to get still more; and it is <lb/>
            this more which keeps the inequality. Thus though most <lb/>
            states have some notion of what is just, yet they are almost <lb/>
            totally wrong; and, upon this account, when either party has <lb/>
            not that share in the administration which answers to its ex­ <lb/>
            pectations, it becomes seditious. But those who of all others <lb/>
            have the greatest right so to act, are least disposed to do it, <lb/>
            namely, those who excel in virtue; for it is most reasonable <lb/>
            that they alone should be generally superior to the rest. There <lb/>
            are too some persons of distinguished families, who, on account <lb/>
            of that point of superiority, disdain to be on an equality with <lb/>
            others: for those esteem themselves noble who can boast of their <lb/>
            ancestors' merit and fortune; and these, to speak the truth, are <lb/>
            the source and fountain-head from whence seditions arise. Ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly, change? of government take place in two distinct <lb/>
            ways; for at one time they raise seditions for the purpose of <lb/>
            changing the state already established to some other form ; ae <lb/>
            when they propose to erect an oligarchy instead of a democracy, <lb/>
            or a democracy or free state in place of an oligarchy; or an <lb/>
            aristocracy in place of these, or one of the latter instead of an <lb/>
            aristocracy; and at another time without reference to the <lb/>
            established government, which they wish to be still the same, <note type="footnote"> 1 For a further account of this relative justice, the reader is referred to <lb/>

            though they choose to have the sole management of it them- <lb/>

            ing out the <lb/>
            constitution to <lb/>
            the furthest <lb/>
            lengths. <lb/>
            selves, either in the hands of a few, or of one only. <lb/>
            They will also raise commotions concerning the <lb/>
            degree of power to be established; as, for instance, <lb/>
            if the government is an oligarchy, and in the same <lb/>
            manner if it is a democracy, to have it more purely so, or else <lb/>
            to have it less so: and, in like manner, in the case of the other <lb/>
            forms of government, changes arise either to extend or contract <lb/>
            Spirit of change. <lb/>
            their powers, or else to make some alterations in <lb/>
            some parts of it; as to establish or abolish a parti­ <lb/>
            cular magistracy ; as some persons say Lysander endeavoured <lb/>
            to abolish the kingly power in Sparta, and king Pausanias, that <lb/>
            of the Ephors. Thus in Epidamnus there was an alteration <lb/>
            in one part of the constitution, for instead of the Phylarchs 1 <lb/>
            they established a senate. It is also still necessary for all the <lb/>
            magistrates at Athens to attend in the court of Heliæa2 when <lb/>
            any new magistrate is created: the power of the one Archon,3 <lb/>
            Inequality an­ <lb/>
            other cause. <lb/>
            also, in that state partook of the nature of an <lb/>
            oligarchy. Inequality is always the occasion of <lb/>
            sedition, but among those who are not equal, an <lb/>
            unequal treatment is not unfair. Thus kingly power is un­ <lb/>
            equal when it is exercised over equals. Upon the whole it is <lb/>
            this aiming after an equality which is the cause of seditions. <lb/>
            But equality is two-fold, for it is either in number, or in <lb/>
            desert. Equality in number is when two things contain the <lb/>
            same parts or the same quantity; but equality in value is at­ <lb/>
            tained by proportion, as three exceeds two and two exceeds <note type="footnote"> I See note on book iv. chap. 10. </note><note type="footnote"> a For some further notice of the courts of the Heliæa at Athens, see note <lb/>

            sible magistrate, which implies that those who elected him had the power <lb/>

             <pb n="169"/>
            one by the same number; but by proportion four exceeds two <lb/>
            and two one in the same degree, for two is the same part of <lb/>
            four as one is of two, that is to say, they are halves. Now <lb/>
            all agree as to what is absolutely and simply just; but, as <lb/>
            we have already said, they dispute concerning proportionate <lb/>
            value; for some persons, if they are equal in one respect, <lb/>
            think themselves equal in all; others, if they are superior in <lb/>
            one thing, think they may claim the superiority in all. <lb/>
            Hence chiefly there arise two sorts of governments, demo­ <lb/>
            cracy and oligarchy; for nobility and merit are to be found <lb/>
            only amongst a few; 1 but their contraries, amongst the many ; <lb/>
            as there is not one man of nobility and merit in a hundred, <lb/>
            but many without either are every where. But <lb/>
            to establish a government entirely upon either <lb/>
            of these equalities is wrong; as is made clear by <lb/>
            the example of those so established; for none of <lb/>
             <lb/>
            Neither princi- '.pIe <lb/>
            ple of equality <lb/>
            should prevail <lb/>
            exclusively. <lb/>
            them have been stable. And the reason of this is, that it is <lb/>
            impossible that whatever is wrong at the first and in principle <lb/>
            should not at last come to a bad result; and therefore in some <lb/>
            things an equality of numbers ought to take place, in others <lb/>
            an equality in value. However, a democracy is safer and less <lb/>
            liable to sedition than an oligarchy; for in this latter it may <lb/>
            arise from two causes, the few in power conspiring either <lb/>
            against each other, or against the people; but in a democracy, <lb/>
            men conspire only against the few who aim at exclusive <lb/>
            power; but there is no instance worth speaking of where the <lb/>
            people have raised a sedition against themselves. Moreover, <lb/>
            a government composed of men of moderate fortunes comes <lb/>
            much nearer to a democracy than to an oligarchy, and is the <lb/>
            safest of all such states.</p>

              other, and then endeavour to show in what situation people <lb/>
              are who begin a sedition, and for what causes; and, thirdly, <lb/>
              who are the sources of political troubles and mutual quarrels. <lb/>
              1. Under what <lb/>
              circumstances <lb/>
              men are se­ <lb/>
              ditious. <lb/>
              Now, the fact that they are thus or thus disposed <lb/>
              towards a change in government, must be laid <lb/>
              down as one cause, and is one which we have al­ <lb/>
              ready mentioned. For some raise seditions through <lb/>
              desire of equality, if they see those whom they esteem their <lb/>
              equals possessed of more than they have themselves; others do <lb/>
              the same by not being content with equality, but aiming at supe­ <lb/>
              riority, if they think, that while they deserve more than their <lb/>
              inferiors, they have only an equal share with them, or less. <lb/>
              Now, they may pursue their aim either justly or unjustly; <lb/>
              justly indeed when those who are inferior raise sedition for <lb/>
              the sake of equality; unjustly, when those who are equal do <lb/>
              2. For what <lb/>
              reasons. <lb/>
              (Final cause.) <lb/>
              so for superiority. We have then mentioned the <lb/>
              situations in which men will be seditious; but the <lb/>
              causes for which they will be so are profit and <lb/>
              honour, and their contraries ; for, to avoid dishonour or loss <lb/>
              of fortune by fines, either on their own account or that of <lb/>
              their friends, they are apt to raise commotions in the state. <lb/>
              The sources and causes of commotions which dispose men in <lb/>
              the way which we have mentioned, if we take them in one <lb/>
              manner, are seven in number, but in another they are more. <lb/>
              Now two of these are the same with what have been already <lb/>
              mentioned, but they act in a different manner; for on account <lb/>
              of profit and honour men rouse themselves against each other, <lb/>
              not to get the possession of them for themselves, (as was said <lb/>
              above,) but at seeing others, some jastly, and others unjustly, <lb/>
              engrossing them. The other causes are haughtiness, fear, <lb/>
              eminence, contempt, envy of those whose fortunes are beyond <lb/>
              their rank. There are also other things which in a different <lb/>
              manner occasion revolutions, as contention, neglect, want of <lb/>
              numbers, and too great disparity of circumstances.</p>

          <p>IT is almost self-evident what influence ill-treat­ <lb/>
            ment and profit have for this purpose, and how <lb/>
            they are causes of sedition ; for when the magis­ <lb/>
            trates are haughty and grasping, they not only raise <pb n="171"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP, III.] </note> <lb/>
            seditions amongst each other, but against the Profit. <lb/>
            state also which gave them their power; and this their ava­ <lb/>
            rice has two objects, either private property, or the property <lb/>
            of the state. W hat influence belongs to honours, <lb/>
            and how they may occasion sedition, is evident <lb/>
            Honours. <lb/>
            enough; for those who are themselves unhonoured while they <lb/>
            see others honoured, will be ready for any disturbance: and <lb/>
            these things are done unjustly when any one is either hon­ <lb/>
            oured or discarded contrary to his deserts, but justly when <lb/>
            according to them. Excessive honours are also a cause of <lb/>
            sedition, when one person or more are greater than accords <lb/>
            with the state and the power of the government; for then a <lb/>
            monarchy or a dynasty are usually established. On this ac­ <lb/>
            count the ostracism1 was introduced in some places, as at <lb/>
            Argos and Athens: though it is better to guard against such <lb/>
            excess of honours in the founding of a state, than to correct <lb/>
            it afterwards when it has been permitted to take place. <lb/>
            Those who have been guilty of crimes will be the <lb/>
            cause of sedition through fear of punishment; as <lb/>
            will those also who expect an injury, that they <lb/>
            may prevent it before it is inflicted; as was the <lb/>
            Guilt. <lb/>
            Anticipation <lb/>
            of injury. <lb/>
            case at Rhodes,2 when the nobles conspired against the people, <lb/>
            on account of the decrees which they expected would be passed <lb/>
            against them. Contempt also is a cause of sedition <lb/>
            and conspiracies; as in oligarchies, where there <lb/>
            Contempt. <lb/>
            are many who have no share in the administration; for they <lb/>
            fancy that they are superior. The rich also, even in democra­ <lb/>
            cies, thinking lightly of the disorder and anarchy which will <lb/>
            arise, hope to better themselves by the same means; as hap­ <lb/>
            pened at Thebes, after the battle of Oenophyta,3where through <lb/>
            bad administration the democracy was destroyed; as it was <lb/>
            at Megara,4 where the power of the people was lost through <note type="footnote"> 1 For a detailed account of the practice of ostracism at Athens, see <lb/>

            anarchy and disorder. The same thing happened at Syracuse <lb/>
            before the tyranny of Gelo, and at Rhodes before the popular <lb/>
            Disproportion­ <lb/>
            ate increase. <lb/>
            government was overthrown. Revolutions in the <lb/>
            state also arise from a disproportionate increase; <lb/>
            for as the body consists of many parts, it ought to <lb/>
            increase in due proportion, in order to preserve its symmetry, <lb/>
            which will otherwise be destroyed ; as if the foot were to be <lb/>
            four cubits long, and the rest of the body but two palms; it <lb/>
            might otherwise be changed into an animal of a different form, <lb/>
            if it were to increase beyond proportion not only in quantity, <lb/>
            but also in disposition of parts. So also a city consists of parts, <lb/>
            one of which may often increase without notice, as the number <lb/>
            Accident. <lb/>
            of poor in democracies and free states. They will <lb/>
            also sometimes happen by accident, as at Taren­ <lb/>
            tum a little after the Persian wars, where so many of the <lb/>
            nobles were killed in a battle by the Iapyges, that from a free <lb/>
            state the government was turned into a democracy; and at <lb/>
            Argos, where so many of the citizens were killed in Hebdo­ <lb/>
            mal by Cleomenes the Spartan, that they were obliged to <lb/>
            admit several husbandmen 2 to the freedom of the state: and <lb/>
            at Athens, through the unfortunate event of the war by land, <lb/>
            the number of the nobles was much reduced by being chosen <lb/>
            into the troops 3 in the way with Sparta. Revolutions also <lb/>
            sometimes take place in a democracy, though more seldom ; for <lb/>
            where the poor increase faster than men of property, the state <lb/>
            Governments <lb/>
            changed with­ <lb/>
            out seditions; <lb/>
            becomes an oligarchy or dynasty. Governments <lb/>
            also sometimes alter without seditions: by petty <lb/>
            contention, as at Heræa: for which purpose they <lb/>
            changed the mode of election from votes to lots, and thus got <lb/>
            the contentious parties chosen: and by negligence, as when <lb/>
            the citizens admit to state offices men who are not friends to <lb/>
            the constitution : an event which happened at Orus, when the <note type="footnote"> • I iv <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῇ</foreign> ‘<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εβδόῃ</foreign>. The meaning of these words is not quite certain. <lb/>
            It is clear that the ancients were equally in the dark; some of them <lb/>

            others, again, that he alludes to the number slain, which according to <lb/>

            called Trité and Tritæa. This is Goëttling's view of the subject; see <lb/>

            oligarchy of the archons was suppressed at the election of He­ <lb/>
            racleodorus, who changed that form of government into a <lb/>
            democratic free state. Moreover they change by <lb/>
            little and little ; and I mean by this that very <lb/>
            and gradually; <lb/>
            often great alterations silently take place in the form of a <lb/>
            government, when people overlook small matters; as at Am­ <lb/>
            bracia, where the census was originally small, but at last <lb/>
            became nothing at all, as if a little and nothing at all were <lb/>
            nearly or entirely alike. A state also composed <lb/>
            of different nations is liable to seditions until their <lb/>
            differences are blended together; for as a city <lb/>
            by diversity of <lb/>
            race. <lb/>
            cannot be composed of every multitude, so neither can it in <lb/>
            every given time. For this reason all those republics which <lb/>
            have hitherto been originally composed of different people, or <lb/>
            have afterwards admitted their neighbours to the freedom of <lb/>
            their city, have been most liable to revolutions; as <lb/>
            when the Achæans joined with the men of Traezen <lb/>
            in founding Sybaris; for soon afterwards, the <lb/>
            Historical <lb/>
            examples. <lb/>
            former grew more powerful than the Træzenians, and expelled <lb/>
            them from the city; (hence the Sybarites became under sen­ <lb/>
            tence of a curse;) and again, disputes from a like cause happened <lb/>
            at Thurium, between the Sybarites and those who had joined <lb/>
            with them in building the city; for claiming all the country <lb/>
            as their own, they were driven out in consequence. And at <lb/>
            Byzantium the new citizens, being detected in plots against <lb/>
            the state, were driven out of the city by force of arms. The <lb/>
            Antisseans also, having taken in those who were banished <lb/>
            from Chios, afterwards did the same thing ; and also the Zan­ <lb/>
            cleans, after having taken in the people of Samos. The men <lb/>
            of Apollonia on the Euxine, having admitted their sojourners <lb/>
            to the freedom of their city, were troubled with seditions; and <lb/>
            the Syracusans, after the times of their tyrants, having en­ <lb/>
            rolled strangers and mercenaries amongst their citizens,2 quar­ <lb/>
            relled with each other and came to an open rupture: and the <lb/>
            people of Amphipolis, having taken in a colony of Chalcidians, <lb/>
            were the greater part of them driven out of the city by them. <note type="footnote"> 1 Apollonia was the only colony of the Corinthians that lay to the east <lb/>
            of Greece. Its inhabitants were ordered by the Athenians to throw down <lb/>
            their walls shortly before the Peloponnesian war. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Compare Herod, vii. 156. </note> <pb n="174"/>

            causes. <lb/>
            Fancied injus­ <lb/>
            tice. <lb/>
            Many persons occasion seditions in oligarchies, <lb/>
            because they think themselves ill used in not <lb/>
            sharing as equals in the honours of the state with <lb/>
            their equals, as we have already mentioned; but <lb/>
            in democracies the principal people do the same because they <lb/>
            have only an equal share with others who are not equal to <lb/>
            Local situa­ <lb/>
            tion. <lb/>
            them. The situation or the place will also some­ <lb/>
            times occasion disturbances in the state, when the <lb/>
            ground is not well adapted for one city; as at <lb/>
            Clazomenæ, where the people who lived in that part of the <lb/>
            town called Chytrum quarrelled with those who lived in the <lb/>
            island, and the Colophonians with the Notians.1 At Athens <lb/>
            too the disposition of the citizens is not the same ; for those <lb/>
            who live in the Piræeus are more attached to a popular go­ <lb/>
            vernment than those who live in the city. For as the inter- <lb/>
            position of a rivulet, however small, breaks the lines of the <lb/>
            phalanx, so any trifling disagreement becomes the cause of <lb/>
            seditions. The greatest disagreement perhaps then lies be­ <lb/>
            tween virtue and vice, and next to that between poverty and <lb/>
            riches, and so on in order, one difference being greater than <lb/>
            another; and one of these is that which we have mentioned.</p>

          <p>BUT seditions in governments do not arise concerning little <lb/>
            things, but from them; for men quarrel concerning something <lb/>

            of moment. Now trifling quarrels are attended <lb/>
            with the greatest consequences, when they arise <lb/>
            between persons of the first distinction in the <lb/>
            state, as was the case with the Syracusans at a <lb/>
            remote period: for a revolution in the government <lb/>
            was brought about by a quarrel between two young men who <lb/>
            were in office, upon a love affair; for one of them being ab­ <lb/>
            sent, the other, who was a friend of his, seduced his mistress ; <lb/>
            I he in his turn took offence at this, and persuaded his friend's <lb/>
            wife to come and live with him; and upon this they persuaded <lb/>
            the whole city to take part either with the one or the other, <lb/>
            and caused a complete rupture. Every one therefore at the <lb/>
            beginning of such disputes ought to take care to avoid the <lb/>
            consequences, and to smother up all quarrels which may arise <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare Thucyd. iii. 34. </note> <pb n="175"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. IV.] </note> <lb/>
            amongst those in power; for the mischief lies in the begin­ <lb/>
            ning ; for the beginning is said to be " half of the business," 1 <lb/>
            so that what was then but a little fault, will be found to bear <lb/>
            its full proportion to errors in the other parts. Moreover, <lb/>
            disputes between men of note involve the whole city in their <lb/>
            consequences; as in Histiæa, after the Persian war, where <lb/>
            two brothers had a dispute about their paternal estate; he who <lb/>
            was the poorer, because the other had concealed some effects <lb/>
            and some money which his father had found, engaged the <lb/>
            popular party on his side, while the other, who was rich, the <lb/>
            men of fashion. And at Delphic a quarrel about a wedding <lb/>
            was the beginning of all the seditions that afterwards arose <lb/>
            amongst them; for a bridegroom there, being terrified by <lb/>
            some unlucky omen, waited upon the bride, but went away <lb/>
            without marrying her; in resentment for which her relations <lb/>
            put some sacred money into his pocket while he was sacri­ <lb/>
            ficing, and then killed him as a sacrilegious person. At Mi­ <lb/>
            tylenè also a dispute which arose concerning heiresses, was <lb/>
            the beginning of great evils, and of a war with the Athenians, <lb/>
            in which Paches3 took their city; for a man of fortune named <lb/>
            Timophanes left two daughters, and Doxander, being out­ <lb/>
            witted in procuring them in marriage for his two sons, began <lb/>
            a sedition, and excited the Athenians against them, as he was <lb/>
            a public guest of the city.4 There was also a dispute at <lb/>
            Phocaea concerning an heiress between Mnaseas the father of <lb/>
            Mneson, and Euthycrates the father of Onomarchus; and this <lb/>
            strife brought upon the Phocæans the sacred war. The go- <note type="footnote"> 1 See Zellius on Aristotle's Nicomach. Ethics, p. 39. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Upon the constitution of Delphi, see Müller's Dorians, vol. ii. chap. 9, <lb/>

            controlling authority, which extended over every part of the social sys­ <lb/>
            tem." It was the main anchor of the state against democratical in­ <lb/>
            fluences. " The nature of its functions rendered it scarcely possible pre­ <lb/>
            cisely to define their limits; and Solon probably thought it best to let <lb/>
            them remain in that obscurity which magnifies whatever is indistinct." <lb/>

            dissolve the democracy. And at Syracuse, as the victory in <lb/>
            their war with the Athenians was owing to the common people, <lb/>
            they changed their free state into a democracy; and at Chal­ <lb/>
            cis, the people having destroyed the tyrant Phoxus together <lb/>
            with the nobles,1 immediately seized the government; and at <lb/>
            Ambracia also, the people, having expelled the tyrant Peri­ <lb/>
            ander with his party, brought round the supreme power to <lb/>
            themselves. And this in general ought not to be forgotten, <lb/>
            that whosoever has been the real occasion of a state being <lb/>
            powerful, whether private persons, or magistrates, a tribe, or <lb/>
            any part of the citizens, or the multitude, be they who they <lb/>
            will, they become a cause of disputes in the state. For either <lb/>
            some persons, who envy them the honours they have acquired, <lb/>
            will begin to be seditious, or else on account of the dignity <lb/>
            they have acquired, they themselves will not be content with <lb/>
            their former equality. A state is also liable to <lb/>
            commotions, when those parts of it which seem to <lb/>
            be opposite to each other approach close to an <lb/>
            equality, as the rich and the common people; so <lb/>
            Seditions arise <lb/>
            in states when <lb/>
            the middle class <lb/>
            is small: <lb/>
            that the part which is between them both is either nothing at <lb/>
            all, or too little to be worth notice. For if the one party is <lb/>
            so much more powerful than the other as to be evidently <lb/>
            stronger, that other will not be willing to hazard the danger: <lb/>
            for which reason those who are superior in merit never are <lb/>
            the cause of seditions; for they are too few for that purpose <lb/>
            when compared to the many. In general, then, the begin­ <lb/>
            nings and causes of seditions in all states are such as I have <lb/>
            now described, and revolutions in them are brought about in <lb/>
            two ways, either by violence or fraud; and if by <lb/>
            violence, then either at first, or by compelling them <lb/>
            afterwards to submit. They may also be brought <lb/>

          <p>Whence sedi­ <lb/>
            tions arise in a <lb/>
            democracy.</p>
          <p>WE ought now to inquire separately into the <lb/>
            events which will arise from these causes in each <lb/>
            species of government. Democracies will be most <lb/>
            subject to revolutions from the dishonesty of their dema­ <lb/>
            gogues ; for partly by informing against men of property, <lb/>
            and partly by rousing the common people against them, they <lb/>
            induce them to join together, for a common fear will make the <lb/>
            greatest enemies unite :-and this is what any one may con- <lb/>
            Historical ex­ <lb/>
            amples. <lb/>
            tinually see practised in many states. In the <lb/>
            island of Cos,2 for instance, the democracy was <lb/>
            subverted by the wickedness of the demagogues, <lb/>
            for the nobles entered into a combination with each other. <lb/>
            And at Rhodes,3 the demagogues distributed bribes, and so <lb/>
            prevented the people from paying the Trierarchs what was <lb/>
            owing to them ; and the latter were obliged by the number of <lb/>
            actions brought against them, to conspire together and destroy <lb/>
            the popular state. The popular state too was overthrown at <lb/>
            Heraclea, soon after the settlement of the city, by the same <lb/>
            persons; for the citizens of note, being ill treated by them, <lb/>
            quitted the city, but afterwards the exiles banded together <lb/>
            and returned, and overthrew the popular state. Just in the <lb/>
            same manner the democracy was destroyed in Megara; for <lb/>
            there the demagogues, to procure money by confiscations, kept <lb/>
            on driving out the nobles, until the number of those who were <note type="footnote"> 1 Concerning the four hundred, see Thucyd. viii. 48, and following <lb/>

            banished became considerable; and those returned and got the <lb/>
            better of the people in a battle, and so established an olig­ <lb/>
            archy. The like happened at Cyme, during the time of the <lb/>
            democracy which Thrasymachus destroyed; and whoever <lb/>
            considers what has happened in other states may perceive <lb/>
            that revolutions have arisen from the same causes. For often, <lb/>
            to curry favour with the people, they drive the nobles to con­ <lb/>
            spire together, either by dividing their estates, or by obliging <lb/>
            them to spend them on public services, or by publicly impeach­ <lb/>
            ing them, that they may be able to confiscate the fortunes of <lb/>
            the wealthy. In former times, whenever the <lb/>
            same person was both demagogue and general, the <lb/>
            democracies were changed into tyrannies; and in- <lb/>
            The generals <lb/>
            superseded by <lb/>
            demagogues. <lb/>
            deed most of the ancient tyrants were once demagogues. And <lb/>
            there is a reason why such was the case at that time, but not <lb/>
            now; for at that time the demagogues were of the soldiery; (for <lb/>
            they were not as yet powerful by their eloquence;) but now <lb/>
            that the art of oratory is cultivated, the able speakers lead the <lb/>
            people;1 but, as they are unqualified to act in a military <lb/>
            capacity, they cannot impose themselves on the people as ty­ <lb/>
            rants, if we except one or two trifling instances. <lb/>
            Formerly, too, tyrannies were more common than <lb/>
            now, because great powers were more often in­ <lb/>
            trusted to some magistrates then than now; (as <lb/>
            Tyrannies <lb/>
            more frequent <lb/>
            in ancient <lb/>
            times, and why. <lb/>
            to the Prytanes2 at Miletus; for they were supreme in many <lb/>
            things of the last consequence;) and also because at that time <lb/>
            the cities were not of that very great extent, and the people <lb/>
            " in general lived in the country, employed in husbandry, the <lb/>
            leaders of public affairs, if they had a turn for war, tried <lb/>
            to make themselves tyrants. All this they did as soon as <note type="footnote"> 1 In the later period of Athenian history, so paramount was the influence <lb/>
            of oratory, and consequently of the demagogues, but the great generals <lb/>
            frequently retired after successful campaigns, not to Athens, but to some <lb/>
            parts of Egypt or Asia Minor. Thus Conon retired to Cyprus, Iphicratep <lb/>

            they had gained the confidence of the people; and this con­ <lb/>
            fidence was their hatred to the rich. This was the case <lb/>
            of Pisistratus at Athens, when he opposed the Pediæans:1 . <lb/>
            and of Theaganes in Megara, who slaughtered the cattle be­ <lb/>
            longing to the rich, after he had seized those who kept them <lb/>
            by the rive-rside. Theagenes also, on account of having ac­ <lb/>
            cused Daphnæus2 and the rich, was thought worthy of being <lb/>
            raised to a tyranny, for in consequence of these enmities, the <lb/>

            people trusted him as a man of popular principles. <lb/>
            Governments also alter from their ancient demo­ <lb/>
            cratic form into one entirely new; for where magis­ <lb/>
            trates are elected without a fixed income, and the <lb/>
            election is with the people, the aspirants for office,3 to flatter <lb/>
            them, endeavour with all their power to make the people supe. <lb/>
            rior even to the laws. To prevent this entirely, or at least in a <lb/>
            great measure, the magistrates should be elected by the tribes, <lb/>
            and not by the people at large. These are nearly the revolu­ <lb/>
            tions to which democracies are liable, and the causes from <lb/>
            whence they arise.</p>

          <p>How changes <lb/>

            1. By ill-treat. <lb/>
            ment of the <lb/>
            poor.</p>
          <p>THERE are two things which of all others most <lb/>
            evidently occasion a revolution in an oligarchy; <lb/>
            one is, if the people are injuriously treated; for <lb/>
            then every person is a ready champion of sedition, <lb/>
            and more particularly if one of the oligarchy <lb/>
            should happen to be their leader; as Lygdamis,4 at Naxos, who <lb/>
            was afterwards tyrant of that island. Seditions also which <lb/>

            of the rich. <lb/>
            arise from different causes will diner from each <lb/>
            other; . for sometimes a revolution is brought <lb/>
            about by the rich who have no share in the ad­ <lb/>
            ministration, which is in the hands of a very tew indeed: <lb/>
            and this happened in Massilia, 5 and later, and Heraclea, and <note type="footnote">I See Herodot. i. 59, and Thucyd. ii. 55, 56. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See Diodor.

            in other cities. For those who had no share in the govern­ <lb/>
            ment ceased not to raise disputes, till they were admitted to <lb/>
            it; first the elder brothers, and then the younger also: for in <lb/>
            some places the father and son are never in office at the same <lb/>
            time; in others, the elder and younger brother. In the first of <lb/>
            these cities, the oligarchy verged upon a free state. At later <lb/>
            it was changed into a democracy; in Heraclea, from being in <lb/>
            the hands of a few, it came to consist of six hundred. At <lb/>
            Cnidos,l the oligarchy was destroyed by the nobles who quar­ <lb/>
            relled with each other because the government was in the <lb/>
            hands of so few; (for there, as we have just mentioned, if the <lb/>
            father was in office, the son could not be; or, if there were <lb/>
            many brothers, the eldest only;) for the people, taking ad­ <lb/>
            vantage of their disputes, elected one of the nobles for their <lb/>
            general, and got the victory: for a government torn by sedi­ <lb/>
            tions is weak.2 And formerly at Erythræ, during the oli­ <lb/>
            garchy of the Basilidæ, although the state flourished greatly <lb/>
            under their excellent management, yet because they were dis­ <lb/>
            pleased that the power should be in the hands of so few, the <lb/>
            people changed the form of government. Oli­ <lb/>
            garchies also are subject to revolutions, from <lb/>
            those who are in office therein, as well as from <lb/>
            3. By quarrels <lb/>
            among the <lb/>
            rulers. <lb/>
            the quarrels of the leaders of the people. Demagogues are <lb/>
            of two sorts; the one flatter the few when they are in power: <lb/>
            for even among the few there are demagogues; such were <lb/>

            chosen out of men either of great fortune or certain ranks by <lb/>
            the soldiers or by the people ; as was the custom at Abydos. <lb/>
            And when the judicial department is not in the hands of the <lb/>

            causes, and so overturn the government; which happened at <lb/>
            Heraclea in Pontus. And also when some desire to con­ <lb/>
            tract the power of the oligarchy into fewer hands ; for those <lb/>
            who endeavour to support an equality, are obliged to apply <lb/>

            to the people for assistance. An oligarchy is also <lb/>
            subject to revolutions, when the nobility spend <lb/>
            their fortunes in luxury; for such persons are desirous of in­ <lb/>
            novation, and endeavour either to be tyrants themselves, or to <lb/>
            support others in becoming so, as Hipparinus supported Diony­ <lb/>
            sius of Syracuse.1 And at Amphipolis one named Cleotimus <lb/>
            collected a colony of Chalcidians, and when they came, he set <lb/>
            them to quarrel with the rich: and at Ægina, a certain per­ <lb/>
            son who brought an action against Chares, attempted on that <lb/>
            account to alter the government. Sometimes they try to raise <lb/>
            commotions, sometimes they rob the public; whence they <lb/>
            quarrel with each other, or else fight with those who endea­ <lb/>
            vour to detect them; as was the case at Apollonia in Pontus. <lb/>
            But if the members of an oligarchy agree among themselves, <lb/>
            the state is not very easily destroyed from within itself. <lb/>
            Pharsalus is a proof of this, where, though the place is small, <lb/>
            yet the citizens have great power from the prudent use to <lb/>

            which they turn it. An oligarchy also will be <lb/>
            destroyed when they create another oligarchy <lb/>
            within it; that is, when the management of pub­ <lb/>
            lic affairs is in the hands of a few, but unequally <note type="footnote"> who exercised a superintendence over the admission of freemen, and were <lb/>
            elected out of the whole body of the people; and hence they were led to <lb/>
            court the people in a way unfavourable to the interests of the aristocracy. <lb/>
            Goettling, speaking of these offices, says that they seem to have resembled <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">δημιουργοί</foreign> at Larissa, who may possibly be alluded to in book iii. <lb/>

            divided, and when all of the few do not partake of the supreme <lb/>
            power. This happened once at Elis,l where the supreme power <lb/>
            in general was in the hands of a very few, and fewer still gained <lb/>
            places in the senate, which consisted of but ninety, who held <lb/>
            their places for life; and their mode of election was calculated <lb/>
            to maintain a dynasty, like that of the senate at Lacedæmon. <lb/>
            An oligarchy is liable to a revolution both in time of war and <lb/>
            peace ; in war, because, through a distrust in the citizens, the <lb/>
            government is obliged to employ mercenary troops, and the <lb/>
            man to whom they give the command of the army often as­ <lb/>
            sumes the tyranny, as Timophanes did at Corinth; 2 and if <lb/>
            they appoint more than one general, they will very probably <lb/>
            establish a dynasty among themselves; and sometimes, through <lb/>
            fear of this, they let the people in general have some share in <lb/>
            the government, because they are obliged to employ them. <lb/>
            In peace, from their want of confidence in each other, they <lb/>
            will intrust the guardianship of the state to mercenaries and <lb/>
            their general, who will be an arbiter between them, and some­ <lb/>
            times become master of both, a thing which happened at <lb/>
            Larissa, when the Aleuadae had the chief power at Samos.3 <lb/>
            The same thing happened at Abydos, during the time of the <lb/>
            political clubs, among which the party of Iphiades was one. <lb/>
            Commotions also will happen in an oligarchy, if <lb/>
            one party overbears and insults the other, or from <lb/>
            their quarrelling about law-suits or marriages. <lb/>
            6. By personal <lb/>
            contests. <lb/>
            How their marriages, for instance, will have that effect, has <lb/>
            been already shown; and in Eretria, Diagoras destroyed the <note type="footnote"> I In Elis the government resembled that of Sparta, and the Genisia <lb/>
            formed a very important part of the constitution. It consisted of ninety <lb/>
            members, who were chosen for their lifetime from oligarchical families; <lb/>
            but in other respects the election was the same as at Sparta, and there­ <lb/>
            fore they were chosen by the whole people. There was also a larger <lb/>
            council of six hundred, (see Thucyd. v. 47,) which may have been an <lb/>
            aristocratical committee, selected from the popular assembly. Thus <lb/>
            much is clear, that the power of the people was very limited; and that, <lb/>

            to their too despotic spirit: as the oligarchy at <lb/>

            by accident, in what we call a free state, and in <lb/>
            an oligarchy, wherever the senators, judges, and magistrates <lb/>
            are chosen according to a certain census. For it often happens, <lb/>
            that what was fixed as the highest census suitable to that <lb/>
            time, so that a few only could have a share in the government <lb/>
            in an oligarchy, and those of moderate fortunes only in a free <lb/>
            state, becomes so little as the city grows rich through peace <lb/>
            or some other happy cause, that every one's fortune rises to <lb/>
            many times the amount of the census, and so the whole com­ <lb/>

            change sometimes happens by little and little, and insensibly <lb/>
            approaches, and sometimes more quickly. These are the re­ <lb/>
            volutions and seditions that arise in oligarchies, and the causes <lb/>
            to which they are owing: and indeed both democracies and <lb/>
            oligarchies sometimes alter, not into governments of a contrary <lb/>
            form, but into other forms of the same government; as, for <lb/>
            instance, from democracies and oligarchies which place the <lb/>
            supreme power in the law, they come to vest it in the ruling <lb/>

            the administration is in the hands of a few ; not that this <lb/>

            sarily be most likely to happen when the generality of the <lb/>
            people are high-spirited, as thinking themselves equal to each <lb/>
            other in merit; such were those at Lacedæmon, called the <lb/>
            Partheniæ,1 (for these were descendants of citizens,) who <lb/>
            being detected in a conspiracy against the state, were sent as <lb/>
            colonists to Tarentum. They will happen also <lb/>
            when some great men are disgraced by those who <lb/>
            have received higher honours than themselves, <lb/>
            2. By disgrace <lb/>
            of great men. <lb/>
            but to whom they are no ways inferior in abilities, as Ly­ <lb/>

            tious man cannot get into power, as Cinadon, who, in the <lb/>
            reign of Agesilaus, was chief mover of a conspiracy against <lb/>
            the Spartans. And also when some are too poor, and others <lb/>
            too rich, which will most frequently happen in time of war ; as <lb/>
            was the case at Lacedæmon, about the time of the Messenian <lb/>
            war. This is proved by a poem of Tyrtæus, called Eunomia ; <lb/>
            for some persons being reduced by war, desired that the lands <lb/>
            might be divided. They arise also when some person of very <lb/>
            high rank might still be higher if he could rule alone, which <lb/>
            seems to have been the case of Pausanias at Lacedæmon, when <lb/>
            he was their general in the Persian war, and that of Hanno 3 <lb/>
            at Carthage. But free states and aristocracies <lb/>
            are mostly destroyed by a departure from justice <lb/>
            3. By injustice. <lb/>
            in the administration- itself; the cause of this evil at first is <lb/>
            the want of a due mixture of the democratic and oligarchic <lb/>
            principle in a free state; and in an aristocracy from these <lb/>
            causes, and also on account of merit; but chiefly from the <lb/>
            former two, I mean, the undue mixture of the democratic and <lb/>
            oligarchic parts; for these two things are what all free states, <lb/>
            and many of those which we call aristocracies, endeavour to <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Παρθένιαι</foreign>. Children born after marriage, but before the husband <lb/>

            Why a free <lb/>
            state is more <lb/>
            stable than an <lb/>
            aristocracy. <lb/>
            blend into one. For aristocracies differ from what <lb/>
            are called polities in this, the one form is less <lb/>
            stable, and the other more so: for that state which <lb/>
            inclines most to an oligarchy is called an aris­ <lb/>
            tocracy, and that which inclines most to a democracy is called <lb/>
            a free state. And on this account the latter is more secure <lb/>
            than the former; for the greater power is the stronger, and <lb/>
            men are more content to live where they have equality. But <lb/>
            the rich, if the community gives them rank, often endeavour <lb/>
            to insult and to tyrannise over others. On the whole, which­ <lb/>
            ever way a government inclines, towards that it has a tend­ <lb/>
            ency to settle, each party supporting their own men. Thus a <lb/>
            free state will become a democracy; an aristocracy, an oli­ <lb/>
            garchy ; or the contrary, an aristocracy may change into a <lb/>
            democracy, (for the poor, if they think themselves injured, <lb/>
            directly take part with the contrary side, and a free state <lb/>
            When a state <lb/>
            may be called <lb/>
            stable. <lb/>
            into an oligarchy. The only firm state is that <lb/>
            where every one enjoys the equality which befits <lb/>
            his merit, and fully possesses what is his own. <lb/>
            And that of which I have been speaking happened at Thu­ <lb/>
            rium; for the magistrates being elected according to a very <lb/>
            high census, it was altered to a lower one ; and they were sub­ <lb/>
            divided into more courts, but because the nobles possessed all <lb/>
            the land, contrary to law; for the state was too much of an <lb/>
            oligarchy, so that they were able to encroach on the people; <lb/>
            but the people, being well inured to war, so far got the better <lb/>
            of their guards, as to drive out of the country every one who <lb/>
            possessed more than he ought. Moreover, as all aristocracies <lb/>
            are free oligarchies, their nobles are apt to grasp at too much <lb/>
            power; as at Lacedaemon, where property is now in the hands of <lb/>
            a few, and the nobles have too much liberty to do as they please, <lb/>
            and to make such alliances as they please. Thus the state of the <lb/>
            Locrians 1 was ruined from an alliance with Dionysius ; and this <lb/>
            would not have happened in the case of a democracy or a well- <lb/>

            aristocracy <lb/>
            generally gra­ <lb/>

            tempered aristocracy. But aristocracies chiefly ap' <lb/>
            proach to a secret change through being destroyed <lb/>
            by degrees, as we have already said of all go­ <lb/>
            vernments in general. And this happens because <lb/>
            changes are caused by something which is trifling; for when- <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare Diodor. Sicul. xiv. 44. </note> <pb n="187"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            ever they throw aside any thing which in the least regards <lb/>
            the state, afterwards they more readily change something else <lb/>
            of a little more consequence, until they subvert the whole <lb/>
            government. This happened in the state of Thurium ; for as <lb/>
            there was a law that its citizens should serve as soldiers for five <lb/>
            years, some young men of a martial disposition, who were in <lb/>
            great esteem amongst their officers, despising those who had <lb/>
            the management of public affairs, and imagining that they <lb/>
            could easily gain their end, first endeavoured to abolish this law, <lb/>
            with a view of having it declared lawful that the same person <lb/>
            might continue in the military, perceiving that the people <lb/>
            would readily appoint them. Upon this, the magistrates ap­ <lb/>
            pointed to this matter, who are called counsellors, 1 first joined <lb/>
            together with an intention to oppose it, but were afterwards <lb/>
            induced to agree to it, from a belief that, if that law was not <lb/>
            repealed, they would permit the management of all other <lb/>
            public affairs to be in their hands ; but afterwards, when they <lb/>
            endeavoured to restrain some from making fresh changes, they <lb/>
            could do nothing, for the whole form of government was <lb/>
            altered into a dynasty of those who first introduced the innova­ <lb/>
            tions. In short, all governments are liable to be <lb/>
            destroyed either from within or from without; <lb/>
            from without, when a state whose policy is con­ <lb/>
            trary to their own, is near, or even at a distance, <lb/>
            Governments <lb/>
            destroyed from <lb/>
            within, or from <lb/>
            without. <lb/>
            if it has great power. This happened in the case of both the <lb/>
            Athenians and the Lacedæmonians; for the one every where <lb/>
            destroyed the oligarchies, the other the democracies. What <lb/>
            then are the chief causes of revolutions and of dissensions in <lb/>
            governments, has been pretty accurately stated.</p>

          <p>IT follows next that we consider the means of <lb/>
            preserving both governments in general, and each <lb/>
            state in particular. In the first place, then, it is <lb/>
            How govern­ <lb/>
            ments are pre­ <lb/>
            served. <lb/>
            evident, that if we are right as to the causes of their destruction, <lb/>
            we know also the means of their preservation; for things con­ <lb/>
            trary produce contrary effects; but destruction and preserva- <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">σύμβουλοι</foreign>. The meaning of the term in this passage must not be <lb/>

            Danger of neg­ <lb/>
            lecting lesser <lb/>
            matters.. <lb/>
            tion are contrary to each other. In well-tem­ <lb/>
            pered governments it requires much care to watch <lb/>
            that nothing be done contrary to law: and this <lb/>
            ought chiefly to be attended to in matters of small conse­ <lb/>
            quence ; for a small transgression comes on with secret step, <lb/>
            just as in a family small expenses when often repeated con­ <lb/>
            sume a man's income. For the understanding is deceived <lb/>
            thereby, as it were by this sophism,1 " if every part is little, <lb/>
            then the whole is little." Now, this in one sense is true, but <lb/>
            in another it is false, for the whole and all the parts together <lb/>
            are large, though made up of small parts. This first step <lb/>
            therefore in any matter is what the state ought to guard <lb/>
            against. In the next place, no credit ought to be given to <lb/>
            those arguments which are composed to deceive the people ; <lb/>
            for they are confuted by facts. But what we mean by the <lb/>
            sophistical devices of states, has been already mentioned. <lb/>
            How a govern­ <lb/>
            ment is render­ <lb/>
            ed stable. <lb/>
            You may often perceive both aristocracies and <lb/>
            oligarchies continuing firm, not from the stability <lb/>
            of their forms of government, but from the wise <lb/>
            conduct of the magistrates, both towards those who have a <lb/>
            part in the management of public affairs, and those also who <lb/>
            have not: towards those who have not, by never injuring <lb/>
            them, and by introducing those who are of most consequence <lb/>
            amongst them into office, and by never harshly disgracing <lb/>
            those who are desirous of honour, or injuring the multitude <lb/>
            for the sake of gain; towards themselves and those who have <lb/>
            a share, by behaving justly towards each other. For that <lb/>
            equality which the favourers of a democracy seek to establish <lb/>
            in the state, is not only just, but convenient also, amongst <lb/>
            those who are of the same rank. And for this reason, if the <lb/>
            administration is in the hands of the many, several rules <lb/>
            By making the <lb/>
            terms of office <lb/>
            short. <lb/>
            which are established in democracies will be very <lb/>
            useful; as to let no one continue in office longer <lb/>
            than six months, so that all of the same rank may <lb/>
            have their turn ; for between these there is a sort of demo­ <lb/>
            cracy, for which reason demagogues are most likely to arise <lb/>
            up amongst them, as we have already mentioned. Besides, <lb/>
            by this means both aristocracies and democracies will be the <lb/>
            less liable to be corrupted into dynasties. And this, because <note type="footnote"> I This is the well-known fallacy of "Compositio et Divisio." See <lb/>
            Whately's Logic, book iii. section 11. </note> <pb n="189"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. VIII. ] </note> <lb/>
            it will not be easy for those who are magistrates for a short <lb/>
            time, to do as much mischief as they could in a long time; for <lb/>
            it is from hence that tyrannies arise in democracies and oli­ <lb/>
            garchies ; for either those who are most powerful in each <lb/>
            state establish a tyranny, as the demagogues in the one and <lb/>
            the despots in the other, or else this is done by the chief ma­ <lb/>
            gistrates when they are long in power. Govern­ <lb/>
            ments are preserved, not only by having the <lb/>
            means of their corruption at a great distance, but <lb/>
            sometimes also by its being very near them ; for <lb/>
            By being very <lb/>
            far from, or <lb/>
            near to, the <lb/>
            means of cor­ <lb/>
            ruption. <lb/>
            those who are in continual fear, keep a stricter hand over <lb/>
            the state;1 for which reason it is necessary for those who <lb/>
            have the care of the constitution to be able to awaken the <lb/>
            fears of the people, that they may preserve it, and not to be <lb/>
            remiss in protecting the state, as a night watch, but to make <lb/>
            the distant danger appear at hand. Great care ought also to <lb/>
            be used to endeavour to restrain by law the quarrels and dis­ <lb/>
            putes of the nobles, as well as to prevent those who are not <lb/>
            already engaged in them, from taking a part in them: for to <lb/>
            perceive an evil at its very first approach is not the lot of <lb/>
            every one, but of the politician. To prevent any alteration <lb/>
            taking place in an oligarchy or free state, on account of the <lb/>
            census, if that happens to continue the same while the quantity <lb/>
            of money is increased, it is useful to take a general account <lb/>
            of the whole amount of it in former times, to compare it with <lb/>
            the present, and to do this every year in those cities where <lb/>
            the census is taken yearly, in larger communities <lb/>
            once in three or five years; and if the whole <lb/>
            should be found much larger or much less than <lb/>
            By continual <lb/>
            revision of the <lb/>
            census. <lb/>
            it was at the time when the census was first established in the <lb/>
            state, let there be a law either to extend or contract it accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, if it increases making the census many times larger, <lb/>
            and if it decreases, smaller. For if this latter be not done in <lb/>
            oligarchies and free states, a dynasty is apt to arise in the <lb/>
            one, an oligarchy in the other: if the former be not done, a <lb/>
            free state will be changed into ademocracy, and oligarchies <lb/>
            into free states or democracies. It is a general <lb/>
            maxim in democracies, oligarchies, monarchies, <lb/>
            and indeed in all governments, not to let any one- <lb/>
            Bychecking <lb/>
            excessive <lb/>
            honour, <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare the phrase of Thucyd., (ii. 13,) <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ τω̃ν ξυμμάχων δια χειρός</foreign> </note> <pb n="190"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK V. </note> <lb/>
            acquire a rank far superior to the rest of the community, but <lb/>
            rather to endeavour to confer moderate honours for a con­ <lb/>
            tinuance, than great ones for a short time; (for the latter <lb/>
            spoil men, and it is not every one who can bear prosperity:) <lb/>
            but if this rule is not observed, let not those honours which <lb/>
            were conferred all at once, be all at once taken away, but <lb/>
            and excessive <lb/>
            power. <lb/>
            rather by degrees. But, above all things, let this <lb/>
            regulation be made by the law, that no one shall <lb/>
            have too much power, by means either of his <lb/>
            fortune or of his friends ; but, if he has, for his excess therein, <lb/>
            let it be contrived that he shall be removed from the country. <lb/>
            Now, as many persons stir up seditions that they may enjoy <lb/>
            their own manner of living, there ought to be a particular officer <lb/>
            By keeping <lb/>
            watch over the <lb/>
            citizens. <lb/>
            to inspect the manners of all those whose lives <lb/>
            are contrary to the interests of their own state, <lb/>
            whether it be an oligarchy, a democracy, or any <lb/>
            of the other forms of government. For the same reason, <lb/>
            watch should be kept in turn over those who are most pros­ <lb/>
            perous in the city; and the means of remedy for this is by <lb/>
            appointing those who are in the opposite scale to the business <lb/>
            and offices of the state. By opposite I mean, men of cha­ <lb/>
            racter and the common people, the poor and the rich. It is <lb/>
            By increasing <lb/>
            the middle <lb/>
            rank. <lb/>
            well also to blend both these into one body, and <lb/>
            to increase the numbers of the middle ranks ; and <lb/>
            this will prevent those seditions which arise from <lb/>
            an inequality of condition. But above all, in every state, itis <lb/>
            By excluding <lb/>
            venality. <lb/>
            necessary, both by the laws and every other method, <lb/>
            that matters be so ordered as to shut out venality <lb/>
            from state offices ; and this ought particularly to <lb/>
            be studied in an oligarchy. For then the people will not be <lb/>
            so much displeased when excluded from a share in the go­ <lb/>
            vernment—(nay, they will rather be glad to have leisure to <lb/>
            attend their private affairs )-as if they suspect that the <lb/>
            officers of the state steal the public money; then indeed they <lb/>
            grieve on two accounts, because they are deprived both of <lb/>
            Way of blend­ <lb/>
            ing an aristo- <lb/>
            state honours and of profit. There is one method <lb/>
            of blending together a democracy and an aristo- <note type="footnote"> I The allusion is to honourable banishment.-An instance in point <lb/>
            would be that of Pompey, who was sent out to clear the sea of pirates, <lb/>
            as a pretext, but in reality because the citizens were afraid of his influ­ <lb/>
            ence at Rome. </note> <pb n="191"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            cracy at the same time, if any one should choose <lb/>
            to form such a state; 1 for it would be possible to <lb/>
            admit both the rich and the poor to enjoy what <lb/>
            cracy and a <lb/>
            democracy to­ <lb/>
            gether. <lb/>
            they desire. For to admit all to a share in the government, <lb/>
            is democratical; but to reserve offices for the rich is aristo­ <lb/>
            cratical. This will be done by allowing no public employ­ <lb/>
            ment whatsoever to be attended with any emolument; for the <lb/>
            poor will not desire to be in office when they can gain nothing <lb/>
            by it, but had rather attend to their own affairs; the rich <lb/>
            however will choose it, as they want nothing which belongs <lb/>
            to the community. Thus the poor will increase their fortunes <lb/>
            by being wholly employed in their own concerns; and the <lb/>
            principal part of the people will not be governed by the lower <lb/>
            sort. To prevent the exchequer from being defrauded, let <lb/>
            all public money be delivered out openly in the face of all the <lb/>
            citizens, and let copies of the accounts be deposited in the dif­ <lb/>
            ferent wards, tribes, and divisions. But, as the magistrates <lb/>
            execute their offices without pay, the law ought to provide <lb/>
            proper honours for those who execute them well. In demo­ <lb/>
            cracies also it is necessary that the rich should be protected, <lb/>
            not only by not permitting their lands to be divided, but not <lb/>
            even the produce of them, which in some states is done im­ <lb/>
            perceptibly. It would be also better if the people would pre­ <lb/>
            vent them, when they offer to exhibit a number of unnecessary <lb/>
            and yet expensive entertainments 2 of plays, torch-races, and <lb/>
            the like. But in an oligarchy it is necessary to take great <lb/>
            care of the poor, and to allot them public employments which <lb/>
            are profitable ; and, if any of the rich insult them, to let their <lb/>
            punishment be severer than if they insulted one of their own <note type="footnote"> 1 An instance of this, perhaps, may be found in the Roman state as <lb/>

          <p>Qualifications <lb/>
            of a statesman.</p>
          <p>THERE are three qualifications necessary for those <lb/>
            who intend to fill the first departments in go­ <lb/>
            vernment ; first of alL an affection1 for the estab­ <lb/>
            lished constitution; in the second place, abilities wholly equal <lb/>
            to the business of their office ; in the third, virtue and justice <lb/>
            correspondent to the nature of that particular state in which <lb/>
            they are placed; for if justice is not the same in all states, it <lb/>
            is evident that there must be different species of it. There <lb/>
            may be some doubt, when all these qualifications do not meet <lb/>
            in the same person, in what manner the choice shall be made ; <lb/>
            as for instance, suppose that one person is an accomplished <lb/>
            general, but a bad man, and no friend to the constitution, <lb/>
            while another is just, and a friend to it, how ought the choice <lb/>
            to be made ? We should then consider, of two qualities, which <lb/>
            of them the generality possess in a greater, and which in a less, <lb/>
            Of the choice of <lb/>
            a general; <lb/>
            degree. For this reason, in the choice of a general <lb/>
            we should regard his courage more than his cha­ <lb/>
            racter, as the more uncommon quality; as fewer <lb/>
            men partake of military skill than of virtue: but, to protect <lb/>
            of that of a <lb/>
            statesman. <lb/>
            the state or manage the finances, the contrary rule <lb/>
            should be followed; for these require greater vir­ <lb/>
            tue than that which the generality possess, but <lb/>
            mere knowledge is common to all. It may be questioned, if a <lb/>
            man has abilities for statesmanship, and is well affected to the <lb/>
            constitution, what occasion is there for being virtuous, since <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare Thucyd. ii. chap. 60, where Pericles lays claim to the pos­ <lb/>
            session of <foreign xml:lang="grc">εύνοια, φϱόνησις</foreign>, and apEri, the three causes of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ήθικὴ πίστις</foreign>, <lb/>
            according to Aristotle. See Rhet. ii. 1. </note> <pb n="193"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. IX.] </note> <lb/>
            these two things alone are sufficient to render him useful to <lb/>
            the public ? But it is of use, because those who possess the <lb/>
            above qualities are often deficient in prudence ; for, as men <lb/>
            often neglect their own affairs, though they know them, and <lb/>
            love themselves, so nothing will prevent them from being dis­ <lb/>
            posed towards the commonwealth in the same manner. In <lb/>
            short, whatever is contained in the laws, and which we allow <lb/>
            to be useful to states, all contributes to preserve the state; <lb/>
            but its principal support (as has been often urged) <lb/>
            is to secure that the number of those who desire <lb/>
            to preserve it shall be greater than of those who wish <lb/>
            He should re­ <lb/>
            gard the <lb/>
            middle class. <lb/>
            to destroy it. Above all things, one must not be forgotten, <lb/>
            though it is forgotten by many governments which are now <lb/>
            corrupted, namely, the mean. For many things which seem <lb/>
            favourable to a democracy, destroy a democracy, and many <lb/>
            which seem favourable to an oligarchy, tend to destroy it. <lb/>
            Those who think this the only virtue, extend it to an excess ; <lb/>
            for they do not consider that as a nose which varies a little from <lb/>
            perfect straightness, either towards being aquiline or flat, may <lb/>
            yet be beautiful and agreeable to look at, but that still if any <lb/>
            one extend this variation too far, first of all the properties of <lb/>
            the part itself will be lost, till at last it can hardly be <lb/>
            admitted to be a nose at all, on account of the excess of the <lb/>
            rise or sinking-that thus, I say, it is with other parts of the <lb/>
            human body. So also the same thing is true with respect to <lb/>
            the other states ; for both an oligarchy and a democracy may <lb/>
            vary somewhat from their most perfect form, and yet be well <lb/>
            constituted; but if any one endeavours to extend either of <lb/>
            them too far, at first he will make the government worse, but <lb/>
            at last he will bring it to no government at all.1 <lb/>
            The lawgiver and the politician, then, should know <lb/>
            well what preserves and what destroys the demo­ <lb/>
            cracy of the people or the oligarchy of the few ; <lb/>
            He should <lb/>
            study what <lb/>
            preserves a <lb/>
            state. <lb/>
            for neither the one nor the other can possibly continue without <lb/>
            both rich and poor: but that whenever an entire equality of <lb/>
            circumstances prevails, the state must necessarily become of <lb/>
            another form; so that those who destroy these laws 2 which <note type="footnote"> 1 See above note on book ii. chap. 5. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 rove <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμους</foreign>. See Goëttling's note, where he defends this reading <lb/>

            authorize an inequality, destroy the government. Errors are <lb/>
            also made both in democracies and oligarchies: in democracies, <lb/>
            when demagogues make the common people superior to the <lb/>
            laws; for thus, by setting them at variance with the rich, they <lb/>
            divide one city into two; whereas they always ought to in­ <lb/>
            cline to speak in favour of the rich. In oligarchies, on the <lb/>
            contrary, the oligarchic party should speak in favour of the <lb/>
            people. The oaths also which they take in an oligarchy ought <lb/>
            to be contrary to what they now are; for, at present, in some <lb/>
            places they swear, " I will be adverse to the common people, <lb/>
            and contrive all I can against them whereas they ought <lb/>
            rather to suppose and pretend the contrary, and openly to sig­ <lb/>
            nify in their oaths that they will not injure the people. But <lb/>
            Education of <lb/>
            the young a <lb/>
            great preserva­ <lb/>
            tive. <lb/>
            of all things hitherto mentioned, that which con­ <lb/>
            tributes most to preserve the state is, what is now <lb/>
            most despised, to educate children with reference <lb/>
            to the state; for the most useful laws, and most <lb/>
            approved by every statesman, will be of no service, if the <lb/>
            citizens are not accustomed to and brought up in the princi. <lb/>
            pIes of the constitution; of a democracy, if that form is by <lb/>
            law established; or an oligarchy, if it be an oligarchy. For <lb/>
            if there is such a thing as incontinence in an individual, there <lb/>
            And to be di­ <lb/>
            rected towards <lb/>
            the good of the <lb/>
            state. <lb/>
            is also in a city. But to educate a child in a way <lb/>
            fitting to the state, is not to do such things as will <lb/>
            gratify those who have the power in an oligarchy, <lb/>
            or who desire a democracy, but to do those things <lb/>
            whereby they will be able to conduct respectively either of <lb/>
            these forms of governments. But now the children of the <lb/>
            magistrates in an oligarchy are brought up delicately, and the <lb/>
            children of the poor are made hardy with exercise and labour; so <lb/>
            that they are both desirous of change, and able to promote it. <lb/>
            In democracies of the purest form a method is pursued which <lb/>
            is contrary to their welfare ; the reason of which is that they <lb/>
            define freedom wrongly. Now, there are two things which <lb/>
            seem to be the limits of a democracy, that the people in gene­ <lb/>
            ral are supreme, and enjoy freedom; for that which is just <lb/>
            seems to be equal, and it is just that what the people deter- <lb/>
            What true <lb/>
            liberty is. <lb/>
            mine should be supreme. Now, their freedom <lb/>
            and equality consists in every one's doing as he <lb/>
            pleases. So that, in such a democracy every one <pb n="195"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. X.] </note> <lb/>
            may live as he likes; " as leads his bent," 1 to use the words <lb/>
            of Euripides. But this is wrong, for no one ought to think <lb/>
            it slavery, to live in conformity with government, but pro­ <lb/>
            tection. The causes, then, of corruption in different states, <lb/>
            and the means of their preservation and continuance, to speak <lb/>
            simply, are such as we have related.</p>

          <p>IT now remains that we speak of monarchy, the <lb/>
            causes of its corruption, and the means of preserv- <lb/>
            Of monarchy. <lb/>
            ing it. And indeed almost the same things which have been <lb/>
            said of other governments are incident to kingdoms and tyran­ <lb/>
            nies ; for a kingdom partakes of the nature of an aristocracy; but <lb/>
            a tyranny is formed from the worst species of oligarchy and de­ <lb/>
            mocracy. F or this reason it is the most mj urious to <lb/>
            its subjects, as being composed of two bad forms, <lb/>
            and retains all the corruptions and the defects of <lb/>
            A tyranny em­ <lb/>
            bodies two bad <lb/>
            principles. <lb/>
            both these states. Now the source of these two kinds of mon­ <lb/>
            archy arises from principles contrary to each other: for a <lb/>
            kingdom is formed to protect the better sort of people against <lb/>
            the multitude, and a king is appointed out of the better sort, <lb/>
            who are chosen either for their superior virtue, and actions <lb/>
            flowing from virtuous principles, or else from their superiority <lb/>
            of noble descent; but a tyrant is chosen out of the meanest <lb/>
            populace, as an enemy to the higher class, that the common <lb/>
            people may not be oppressed by them. And this is clear from <lb/>
            experience, ror the generality of tyrants were <lb/>
            indeed mere demagogues, who gained credit with <lb/>
            the people by inveighing against the nobles. <lb/>
            Some tyrannies were established in this manner, <lb/>
            Who tyrants <lb/>
            are; and how <lb/>
            they gain their <lb/>
            power. <lb/>
            when the cities were already considerably enlarged; others, <lb/>
            before that time, by kings who exceeded their hereditary <lb/>
            power, from a desire of governing despotically; while others <lb/>
            were founded by those who were elected to the superior offices <lb/>
            of state ; (for formerly the people appointed officers for life to <lb/>
            be at the head of civil and religious affairs;) and some were <note type="footnote">1 This reference to Euripides is uncertain at the best. Aristotle may <lb/>

              founded by the oligarchs, who chose one out of their body, <lb/>
              with the supreme power over the highest magistrates. By all <lb/>
              these means it was easy to establish a tyranny, if they chose <lb/>
              it; for their power was ready at hand, because they were <lb/>
              either kings, or else in possession of the honours of state. <lb/>
              Historical <lb/>
              examples. <lb/>
              Thus Pheidon1 at Argos and others became ty­ <lb/>
              rants, having enjoyed originally the kingly power; <lb/>
              while Phalaris, 2 and others in Ionia, from holding <lb/>
              state honours. Panætius at Leontium, Cypselus at Corinth, <lb/>
              Pisistratus at Athens, Dionysius at Syracuse, and others, <lb/>
              acquired their tyrannies by having been demagogues. A <lb/>
              How mon­ <lb/>
              archies are <lb/>
              gained. <lb/>
              kingdom, as we have said, partakes much of the <lb/>
              nature of an aristocracy, and is bestowed accord­ <lb/>
              ing to private worth, or character for virtue, or <lb/>
              rank, or beneficent actions, or to these joined with power. <lb/>
              For all persons have gained this power as having benefited <lb/>
              cities and states, or as being able so to do; some by prevent­ <lb/>
              ing a people from falling into slavery by war, as Codrus, and <lb/>
              some by freeing them from it, as Cyrus; or by having founded <lb/>
              cities or colonized a country, as the kings of Sparta, Macedon, <lb/>
              and the Molossians. A king desires to be the guardian of his <lb/>
              people, that those who have property may suffer no wrong, <lb/>
              and that the people in general may live free from injury; but <lb/>
              a tyrant, as has been often said, has no regard to the common <lb/>
              good, except for his own advantage. His only object is <lb/>
              pleasure, but that of a king is virtue. A tyrant therefore is <lb/>
              ambitious of engrossing wealth, but a king rather of honour. <lb/>
              The guards too of a king are citizens, but those of a tyrant <lb/>
              Symptoms of a <lb/>
              tyranny. <lb/>
              are foreigners. That a tyranny contains what­ <lb/>
              ever is bad both in a democracy and an oligarchy <lb/>
              is evident; from an oligarchy it has gain for its <lb/>
              end, (for thus only will the tyrant be sure of the continuance <lb/>
              of his guards and his luxuries ;) and it puts no confidence in <lb/>
              the people, and therefore deprives them of the use of. arms: <lb/>
              it is also common to both an oligarchy and a tyranny to per­ <lb/>
              secute the people, and to disperse the population. It borrows <note type="footnote"> 1 Pheidon of Argos must not be confounded with Pheidon the Corin­ <lb/>

              from a democracy its quarrels with the nobles, and the fact <lb/>
              that it destroys them publicly and privately, or drives them <lb/>
              into banishment, as rivals and an obstacle to the government; <lb/>
              hence naturally arise conspiracies, as the one party desires <lb/>
              to govern, and the others are not willing to be slaves. Hence <lb/>
              the advice of Periander to Thrasybulus to take off the tallest <lb/>
              stalks,1 hinting thereby, that it was necessary from time to <lb/>
              time to make away with the most eminent citizens. We ought <lb/>
              then in reason, as has been already said, to account for the <lb/>
              changes which are incident to a monarchy, from the same <lb/>
              causes which produce them in other states; for it <lb/>
              is on account of injury, terror, and contempt, that <lb/>
              many of its subjects conspire against a monarchy. <lb/>
              But of all wrongs, injurious contempt has most <lb/>
              The same <lb/>
              causes destroy <lb/>
              a monarchy as <lb/>
              destroy other <lb/>
              states. <lb/>
              influence on them for that purpose; sometimes it is owing to <lb/>
              their being deprived of their private fortunes. The dissolu­ <lb/>
              tion too of a kingdom and a tyranny are generally the same; <lb/>
              for monarchs abound in wealth and honour, which all are de­ <lb/>
              sirous to obtain. Of plots, some aim at the life of those who <lb/>
              govern, but others at their government. Those formed on <lb/>
              account of injury aim at their persons. Injury may be owing <lb/>
              to many causes, and either of these is a sufficient cause to <lb/>
              excite anger; and most of those who are led by anger join in <lb/>
              a conspiracy, for the sake not of their own advancement, but <lb/>
              of revenge. Thus the plot against the children of <lb/>
              Pisistratus arose from the fact that they affronted <lb/>
              the sifter of Harmodius, and insulted him also 2 <lb/>
              Historical <lb/>
              examples. <lb/>
              for Harmodius resented the injury done to his sister, and <lb/>
              Aristogiton the injury done to Harmodius. A conspiracy <lb/>
              was also formed against Periander, the tyrant of Ambracia, <lb/>
              because while drinking with a favourite youth, he asked him <lb/>
              if he were as yet with child by him. Philip too was slain <lb/>
              by Pausanias, for permitting him to be affronted by Attalus; <lb/>
              as was Amyntas the Little, by Dardas, for insulting him on <lb/>
              account of his age; and the Eunuch,4 by Evagoras the Cy­ <lb/>
              prian, for in revenge for having taken his son's wife away <lb/>
              from him, he slew him as having been injured by him. <note type="footnote"> 1 Herod. i. ch. 20. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The story is told by Herodotus (book v. ch. 55, etc.); compare <lb/>

          <p>And many attacks have been made on tyrants owing to <lb/>
            some such personal insult offered by them, as that of Cratæus1 <lb/>
            on Archelaus; for his familiarity always disgusted him; so <lb/>
            that even a small pretext became a sufficient plea, namely, <lb/>
            that he did not give him one of his daughters to wife, as he <lb/>
            had promised. For being entangled in a war against Sirrha <lb/>
            and Arrhabæus, he gave his elder daughter to the king of <lb/>
            Elimæa, and his younger to the son of Arnagentas, thinking <lb/>
            that he would thus have less strife with the son of Cleopatra. <lb/>
            But the real origin of his estrangement was his disgust at <lb/>
            certain familiarities. And Hellanocrates of Larissa joined <lb/>
            with him in his attack for the same reason ; for when, in his <lb/>
            intercourse with him, he did not fulfil his promise, he thought <lb/>
            that the intercourse took place as an act not of affection but of <lb/>
            insult. Parrhon and Heraclides of Ænos, too, slew Cotys, in <lb/>
            order to be revenged for the injury offered to their father; <lb/>
            and Adamas revolted from Cotys, considering that he had <lb/>
            been insulted; for he had been castrated by him when a boy.</p>
          <p>Many also who have had their bodies scourged with stripes, <lb/>
            through resentment have either killed or conspired against <lb/>
            their injurers, even when they were in office and in possession <lb/>
            of royal dynasties; as, at Mitylene, Megacles joined with his <lb/>
            friends and killed the Penthelidæ, who used to go about strik­ <lb/>
            ing those they met with clubs. Thus, in later times, Smerdis <lb/>
            killed Penthilus, for whipping him and permitting his wife to <lb/>
            drag him by the feet. Decamnichus also was the chief cause of <lb/>
            the conspiracy against Archelaus, for he was the first to urge <lb/>
            others to the assault: the occasion of his resentment was his <lb/>
            having delivered him to Euripides the poet to be scourged ; <lb/>
            for Euripides was greatly offended with him, for having said <lb/>
            something of the foulness of his breath. And many others <lb/>
            have been killed or conspired against for such reasons as these. <lb/>
            In like manner through terror: for terror is one of the causes <lb/>
            mentioned above, and this as well in monarchies as in other <lb/>
            states. Thus Artabanes conspired against Xerxes through <lb/>
            fear of being accused to him about Darius, whom he had hung <lb/>
            without his orders, supposing that he would obtain pardon, <lb/>
            and that the king would forget the matter, on account of the <lb/>
            splendid banquet which he gave him. Some kings have been <lb/>
            killed through contempt; as some one conspired against Sar- <note type="footnote"> I Compare Plato, Alcib. ii. 7. </note> <pb n="199"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. X.] </note> <lb/>
            danapalus, having seen him spinning with his women, if the <lb/>
            story be true which historians relate of him; but if it is not <lb/>
            true of him, it may very probably be true of some one else. <lb/>
            Dion also conspired against Dionysius the- Younger, because <lb/>
            he saw his subjects desirous of the deed, and that he himself <lb/>
            was always drunk. And even some of a man's friends will <lb/>
            do this if they despise him; for from being trusted by him, they <lb/>
            think that they shall not be found out. Those also who think <lb/>
            they shall gain his throne will conspire against a king some­ <lb/>
            how or other through contempt; for as they are powerful <lb/>
            themselves, and despise the danger, on account of their <lb/>
            strength, they will readily attempt it. Thus generals at the <lb/>
            head of an army will endeavour to dethrone the monarch, as <lb/>
            Cyrus did Astyages, despising both his manner of life and his <lb/>
            forces ; because the latter were inactive, and his life effemin­ <lb/>
            ate: thus Seuthes the Thracian, who was general to Amado­ <lb/>
            cus,2 conspired against him. Sometimes men enter into con­ <lb/>
            spiracies, on account of more than one of these reasons, as <lb/>
            through contempt and desire of gain ; as Mithridates conspired <lb/>
            against Ariobarzanes. Those also who are of a bold dispo­ <lb/>
            sition, and have gained military honours amongst kings, on <lb/>
            this account of all others most frequently engage in sedition; <lb/>
            for strength and courage united inspire great bravery: when <lb/>
            therefore these join in one person, he will be ready for con­ <lb/>
            spiracies, as he will easily conquer. Those who conspire <lb/>
            against a tyrant through ambition, have a different motive in <lb/>
            view from what we have already mentioned ; for they do not <lb/>
            attack tyrants as some do, seeing before them great gains and <lb/>
            vast honours; it is not thus that any of those who conspire <lb/>
            through ambition engage in the dangerous enterprise, but the <lb/>
            others do so for the aforesaid reason, while these engage in <lb/>
            this, as they would in any other noble action, that they may <lb/>
            be illustrious and distinguished among others, and so destroy <lb/>
            a tyrant, not wishing to gain a tyranny, but renown. No <lb/>
            doubt the number of those who act upon this principle is <lb/>
            very small, for we must suppose they regard their own safety <lb/>
            as nothing in case they should not succeed; and they must <lb/>
            embrace the opinion of Dion, (which few can do,) when he <lb/>
            made war upon Dionysius with a very few troops; for he said, <note type="footnote"> 1 See Herodot. book i. ch. 127—129. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Compare Xenoph. Anab. vii. 2. </note> <pb n="200"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK V. </note> <lb/>
            that let the advantage he made be ever so little, it would <lb/>
            satisfy him to have gained it; and that should it be his lot to <lb/>
            die the moment he had gained footing in his country, he should <lb/>
            A tyranny de­ <lb/>
            stroyed by ex­ <lb/>
            temal violence; <lb/>
            think this death glorious. A tyranny also is ex­ <lb/>
            posed in one way to destruction, just as each of <lb/>
            the other states are, from without, if there be <lb/>
            some hostile power superior to it. For it is evident that the <lb/>
            wish to subvert it will exist, owing to the opposition of prin­ <lb/>
            ciples, and all who can, will carry into effect what they desire. <lb/>
            And some states are opposed to others, as a democracy to a <lb/>
            tyranny; as says Hesiod,l <lb/>
            " Potters with potters clash <lb/>
            for the extreme of a democracy is a tyranny; a kingly power <lb/>
            is opposed to an aristocracy, from their different forms of <lb/>
            government... For this reason the Lacedaemonians destroyed <lb/>
            very many tyrannies; as did the Syracusans, during the <lb/>
            and from <lb/>
            within. <lb/>
            prosperity of their state. And in one way they <lb/>
            are destroyed from within, when those who have <lb/>
            no share in the power brine about a revolution, as <lb/>
            that which happened to Gelo, and lately to Dionysius; to the <lb/>
            first, by means of Thrasybulus, the brother of Hiero, who <lb/>
            flattered Gelo's son, and urged him to lead a life of pleasure, <lb/>
            that he might govern himself; but the family joined together, <lb/>
            and endeavoured to support the tyranny and expel Thrasybu­ <lb/>
            lus; but those of them who combined together seized the <lb/>
            opportunity and expelled the whole family. Dion made war <lb/>
            against his relation Dionysius, and being assisted by the <lb/>
            people, first expelled him, and afterwards was killed. As <lb/>
            there are two causes which chiefly induce men to conspire <lb/>
            against tyrannies, namely, hatred and contempt, one of these, <lb/>
            namely, hatred, seems necessarily to belong to tyrants, but con­ <lb/>
            tempt also is often the cause of their destruction. For though, <lb/>
            for instance, those who have raised themselves to the supreme <lb/>
            power, have generally preserved it, still those who have re­ <lb/>
            ceived it from them, to speak the truth, almost immediately <lb/>
            all lose it; for, by falling into an effeminate way of life, they <lb/>
            soon grow despicable, and offer many opportunities to con­ <lb/>
            spirators. Part of their hatred we may very fitly ascribe to <lb/>
            anger; for in some cases it becomes their motive to the same <note type="footnote"> I See Op. 1. 25. </note> <pb n="201"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. X.] </note> <lb/>
            actions ; for it often urges them to act more powerfully than <lb/>
            hatred, and they proceed with greater vehemence against <lb/>
            those whom they attack, as this passion is not under the di­ <lb/>
            rection of reason. But it happens that persons especially <lb/>
            yield to this passion on account of injury; a matter which oc­ <lb/>
            casioned the fall of the Pisistratids and of many others. But <lb/>
            hatred is still more powerful; for anger is accompanied with <lb/>
            grief, which prevents the entrance of reason; but hatred is <lb/>
            free from grief. In short, whatever causes may be assigned <lb/>
            as the destruction of a pure and unmixed oligarchy, and of an <lb/>
            extreme democracy, the same may be applied to a tyranny; <lb/>
            for these are distinct forms of tyranny. But a <lb/>
            kingdom is very seldom destroyed by any outward <lb/>
            attack; for which reason it is generally very <lb/>
            stable; but it has the greatest number of causes <lb/>
            Why a king­ <lb/>
            dom seldom <lb/>
            destroyed by <lb/>
            external vio­ <lb/>
            lence. <lb/>
            of subversion within. Of these, two are especial causes; the <lb/>
            one, when those who share in the regal power excite a sedition, <lb/>
            the other, when they endeavour to establish something more <lb/>
            like a tyranny by assuming greater power than the law gives <lb/>
            them. A kingdom, indeed, is never erected in <lb/>
            our times, but rather monarchies1 and tyrannies; <lb/>
            for a kingly government is one that is voluntarily <lb/>
            Why kingdoms <lb/>
            are seldom <lb/>
            met with. <lb/>
            submitted to, and its power is supreme in great matters : but <lb/>
            now a days many are equal, and there are none in any respect <lb/>
            so much better than others as to be qualified for the great­ <lb/>
            ness and dignity of government over them. On this account, <lb/>
            then, these equals will not willingly submit to be commanded ; <lb/>
            but if any one assumes the government, either by force or <lb/>
            fraud, this is a tyranny. But in the case of he­ <lb/>
            reditary kingdoms, we must add one cause of <lb/>
            destruction to that which we have mentioned <lb/>
            above; namely, that many who enjoy it are proper <lb/>
            An additional <lb/>
            cause of ruin <lb/>
            to hereditary <lb/>
            kingdoms. <lb/>
            objects of contempt, and that they are insolent, though the <lb/>
            power which they have gained is not despotic, but merely <lb/>
            kingly. Such a state is soon destroyed; for a king ceases to <lb/>
            exist if the people will not obey, but a tyrant still rules, though <note type="footnote"> 1 What Aristotle means by a kingdom, as distinct from a monarchy, <lb/>
            is clear from this passage. The test of a kingdom is the voluntary sub. <lb/>
            mission of its subjects; <lb/>

            they will not. These and other such like things are the causes <lb/>
            of the destruction of monarchies.</p>

          <p>How mon­ <lb/>
            archies are <lb/>
            preserved; <lb/>
            by due limita­ <lb/>
            tion.</p>
          <p>BUT, to speak simply, it is clear that monarchies <lb/>
            are preserved by means contrary to these. But <lb/>
            to speak of each separately: a kingdom will stand <lb/>
            by keeping the king's power within moderate <lb/>
            bounds. For by how much the less extensive <lb/>
            their power is, by so much the longer will their entire go­ <lb/>
            vernment of necessity continue; for they become less despotic, <lb/>
            and more upon an equality of condition with their subjects; <lb/>
            and on that account they are the less envied by them. It was <lb/>
            on this account that the kingdom of the Molossi continued so <lb/>
            long, and that of the Lacedæmonians,1 owing to the fact that <lb/>
            their government from the beginning was divided into two <lb/>
            parts, and also to the moderation introduced into the other <lb/>
            parts of it by Theopompus, and especially to his establishment <lb/>
            of the Ephors; for by taking something from the power, he <lb/>
            increased the duration of the kingdom, so that in some mea­ <lb/>
            sure he made it not less but greater. As they say he replied <lb/>
            to his wife,2 when she asked him if he was not ashamed to de­ <lb/>
            liver down his kingdom to his children less than what he had <lb/>
            received from his ancestors; " No," answered he, " for I give <lb/>
            it them more lasting." But tyrannies are preserved in two <lb/>
            ways most opposite to each other, one of which is, when the <lb/>
            power is delegated from one to the other; and in this manner <lb/>
            most tyrants govern in their states. Report says that Peri­ <lb/>
            ander founded many of these. There are also many of them <lb/>
            to be met with amongst the Persians. What has been already <lb/>
            mentioned is conducive, as far as any thing can be, to the <lb/>
            Tyranny is to <lb/>
            be preserved <lb/>
            by the disunion <lb/>
            of its subjects; <lb/>
            preservation of a tyranny, namely, to keep down <lb/>
            those who rise too high, to take off those who are <lb/>
            of an aspiring tone, to allow no public meals, no <lb/>
            clubs, no education, nor any thing at all, but to <lb/>
            guard against every thing which is wont to give rise to high <lb/>
            spirits or mutual confidence; not to suffer schools or learned <lb/>
            meetings of those who have leisure for discussion, and to en­ <lb/>
            deavour by every means possible to keep all the people <note type="footnote"> - See above, book ii. chap. 2. </note><note type="footnote">2 See Pluto Lyc. 7. </note> <pb n="203"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. XI.] </note> <lb/>
            strangers to each other; for knowledge increases mutual con­ <lb/>
            fidence ; 1 and to oblige all strangers to appear in public, and <lb/>
            to live near the city gate,2 that all their actions may be sum­ <lb/>
            ciently seen, and that by being kept like slaves they may be <lb/>
            accustomed to be humble. In short, to imitate every thing <lb/>
            which the Persians and Barbarians do, to support slavery; (for <lb/>
            all their policy is the same;) and to endeavour to know what <lb/>
            3very single subject chooses to do and say, and for this pur­ <lb/>
            pose to employ spies: such were those women whom the Sy­ <lb/>
            racusans called <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ποταγωγίδες</foreign>.3 Hiero also used to send out <lb/>
            listeners, wherever there was any meeting or conversation; <lb/>
            for the people dare not speak with freedom for fear of such <lb/>
            persons; and if any one speaks out, there is the less chance <lb/>
            of concealment; and to endeavour that the whole community <lb/>
            should mutually accuse and come to blows with each other, <lb/>
            friend with friend, the commons with the nobles, and the rich <lb/>
            with each other. It also suits a tyranny to reduce its sub­ <lb/>
            jects to poverty, that they may not be able to compose a guard, <lb/>
            and that, being employed in procuring their daily <lb/>
            bread, they may have no leisure to conspire against <lb/>
            their tyrants. The pyramids of Egypt are a proof <lb/>
            by keeping the <lb/>
            people poor <lb/>
            and employed; <lb/>
            of this, and the votive edifices of the Cypselidæ, and the tem­ <lb/>
            ple of Olympian Zeus built by the Pisistratidæ, and the works <note type="footnote"> 1 It was for this reason that the policy prevailed so extensively with <lb/>
            the Persians and other Eastern despots of transferring whole tribes from <lb/>
            their original homes to another locality. The phrase expressing this is <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">άνασπαστοὺς ποιει̃ν</foreign>, which occurs so often in Herodotus, as in ii. 93; <lb/>
            iv. 204, etc. The cases of Eretria, Cyrene, Miletus, the Ionians, and the <lb/>
            Pæonians (v. 12) are well known in profane history; not to mention the <lb/>
            lase of the Israelites in the Old Testament. With regard to the senti­ <lb/>
            ment that " knowledge inspires confidence," compare the words of Butler, <lb/>
            Analogy, Part i. chap. 3,) " If the soul be naturally immortal, and this <lb/>
            tate be a progress to a future one, .... good men may naturally <lb/>
            unite not only amongst themselves, but also with other orders of virtuous <lb/>
            beings in that future state. For virtue, from the very nature of it, is a <lb/>
            principle and bond of union, in some degree, amongst all who are endued <lb/>
            with it and known to each other." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See Xenoph. Cyr. vii. 8. </note><note type="footnote">3 See Plutarch Dion. 28. They were eaves-droppers and busy-bodies, <lb/>
            who hung about the court and person of a tyrant, and reported to him <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [BOOK V. </note> <lb/>
            of Polycrates at Samos ; for all these have the same effect, to <lb/>
            keep the people well employed and poor.1 It is necessary <lb/>
            also to multiply taxes, as at Syracuse in the time of Dionysius,2 <lb/>
            who in five years collected all the private property of his sub­ <lb/>
            jects into his coffers. A tyrant also should endeavour to en­ <lb/>
            gage his subjects in a war, that they may have employment <lb/>
            and may be for ever dependent upon their general. A king <lb/>
            is preserved by his friends; but it is the part of a tyrant to <lb/>
            place no confidence in friends, as every one desires to dethrone <lb/>
            him, and these have it specially in their power. All those <lb/>
            things also which belong to an extreme democracy may be <lb/>
            done in a tyranny; as for example, the giving great licence to <lb/>
            the women in the house, that they may reveal their husbands' <lb/>
            secrets, and great indulgence to slaves for the same reason. <lb/>
            For neither slaves nor women conspire against tyrants; but <lb/>
            when they are treated with kindness, both of them are of ne­ <lb/>
            cessity favourers of tyrants and to extreme democracies; and <lb/>
            the people too in such a state desire to rule alone. For which <lb/>
            reason, flatterers are in repute with both; the demagogue in <lb/>
            the democracy, for he is the proper flatterer of the people; <lb/>
            and among tyrants, the man who will servilely bend to them; <lb/>
            for this is the business of flatterers. And for this reason ty­ <lb/>
            rants always love bad men, for they rejoice in being flattered, <lb/>
            a thing to which no man of a liberal spirit will submit; for <lb/>
            the virtuous love others, but they flatter none. Bad men too <lb/>
            are fit for bad purposes ; "like to like,"3 as the proverb says. <lb/>
            A tyrant also should show no favour to a man of worth or a <lb/>
            freeman; for he thinks that no one deserves these names but <lb/>
            himself; for he who supports his own dignity, and is a friend <lb/>
            to freedom, encroaches upon the superiority and the despotism <lb/>
            of the tyrant: such men, therefore, they naturally hate, as <note type="footnote"> 1 The Cloaca Maxima at Rome, built under the tyranny of the Tar­ <lb/>

            destructive to their government. A tyrant also <lb/>
            should rather admit strangers than citizens to his <lb/>
            table and familiarity, for thelatter are his ene­ <lb/>
            by preferring <lb/>
            strangers to <lb/>
            citizens. <lb/>
            mies, but the others have no design against him. These and <lb/>
            such like matters are marks oF a tyranny, and tend to preserve <lb/>
            its power, for it has no lack of villany. But all these things, <lb/>
            so to say, may be comprehended in three divisions <lb/>
            for there, are three objects which tyranny has in <lb/>
            view; one of which is.that the citizens shall be <lb/>
            The three ob­ <lb/>
            jects of a ty­ <lb/>
            rant. <lb/>
             <lb/>
            of abject dispositions; for men of abject spirits never would <lb/>
            conspire against any one. The second is, that they shall have <lb/>
            no confidence in each other: for while none feel confidence in <lb/>
            themselves, the tyrant issafe from overthrow. For which <lb/>
            reason they are always at enmity withmen of merit, as hurt­ <lb/>
            ful to their government; not only because they scorn to be <lb/>
            governed despotically, but also because they are trustworthy <lb/>
            towards themselves and towards others, and because they will <lb/>
            not inform against their associates, nor aany one else. The <lb/>
            third is, that they shall be without the meana of doing any <lb/>
            thing ; for no one undertakes what is impossible for him to <lb/>
            perform; so that without power a tyranny can never be de­ <lb/>
            stroyed. [These then are the three objects to which the <lb/>
            wishes of tyrants incline; for all their tyrannical plans tend <lb/>
            to promote one of these ends, that their people may have nei­ <lb/>
            ther mutual confidence, nor power, nor boldness of spirit.] 1 <lb/>
            Such, then, is one of the two methods of preserving <lb/>
            tyrannies, the other proceeds in a way nearly con­ <lb/>
            trary to what has been already described; and <lb/>
            it may be discerned from considering the causes <lb/>
            Another <lb/>
            method of pre­ <lb/>
            serving a ty­ <lb/>
            ranny ; <lb/>
            which destroy a kingdom: for as one cause of that lies in <lb/>
            bringing the government nearer to a tyranny, so the safety of a <lb/>
            tyranny consists in making the government more nearly like that <lb/>
            of a king; taking good care of only one thing, namely, the <lb/>
            power; that not only the willing, but the unwilling also, shall <lb/>
            submit to it; for if he once lose this, his tyranny is at an end. <lb/>
            This, then, must be kept as the foundation, but <lb/>
            in other particulars the tyrant ought partly to act <lb/>
            and partly to affect to seem like a king; first, by <lb/>
            by affecting <lb/>
            the style of a <lb/>
            king. <lb/>

            not making such profuse presents as will offend the people, <lb/>
            while the money is taken out of the hard labour of their own <lb/>
            hands, and given in profusion to mistresses, foreigners, and <lb/>
            actors; as also by keeping an exact account both of what they <lb/>
            receive and pay, a practice which some tyrants ere this have <lb/>
            followed, though ruling on this plan they seem rather masters <lb/>
            of families than tyrants ; nor need a tyrant ever fear lest he <lb/>
            shall lack money, while he have the supreme power in his <lb/>
            own hands. It is also much better for those tyrants who quit <lb/>
            their kingdom, to go without money, than to leave behind <lb/>
            them the money which they have hoarded; for their regents <lb/>
            will be much less desirous of making innovations; and these <lb/>
            guardians are more to be dreaded than the citizens by tyrants <lb/>
            while absent: for some of the citizens go out with him, but <lb/>
            these regents are left behind. He should also endeavour to <lb/>
            appear to collect taxes and to require public services only for <lb/>
            purposes of the state, that whenever they are wanted they <lb/>
            may be ready in time of war; and particularly to take care <lb/>
            that he appear to collect and keep them, not as his own pro- <lb/>

            character of a <lb/>
            tyrant. <lb/>
            perty, but as that of the public. His appearance <lb/>
            also should not be harsh, but noble, so that those <lb/>
            who meet him shall look on him with veneration <lb/>
            rather than with fear; but this will not be easily accomplished <lb/>
            if he is easily despised. If, therefore, he will not study to <lb/>
            acquire any other virtue, yet he ought to aim at political <lb/>
            ability, and at impressing on others that opinion of himself. <lb/>
            He should also take care not to appear to be guilty of the <lb/>
            least offence against modesty towards the young of either sex, <lb/>
            neither himself, nor any of those who are about him: and not <lb/>
            to permit the women of his own family to treat others haughtily, <lb/>
            for the haughtiness of women has been the ruin of many ty­ <lb/>
            rannies. With respect to the pleasures of sense, he ought to <lb/>
            act apart, directly contrary to the practice of some tyrants at <lb/>
            present; for they do not only continually indulge themselves <lb/>
            in them from early morning, and for many days together, but <lb/>
            they seem also to desire to have other witnesses of their con­ <lb/>
            duct, that they may admire them as happy and fortunate. <lb/>
            But the tyrant ought especially to be moderate in these, and, if <lb/>
            not, at least to appear to others to avoid them ; for it is not the <lb/>
            sober man who is exposed either to plots or contempt, but the <lb/>
            drunkard; not the early riser, but the sluggard. His conduct <pb n="207"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. XI.] </note> <lb/>
            in general should also be contrary of almost all that is re­ <lb/>
            ported of former tyrants; for he ought to improve and adorn <lb/>
            his city, so as to seem a guardian and not a tyrant. More­ <lb/>
            over, he ought always to seem to pay particular attention to <lb/>
            the worship of the gods, for from persons of such a character, <lb/>
            men entertain less fears of suffering any thing contrary to the <lb/>
            law, while they suppose that he who governs them is religious <lb/>
            and reverences the gods; 1 and they will be less inclined to <lb/>
            raise seditions against such a tyrant, as one who has the gods <lb/>
            on his side: but this must be so done as to give no suspicion <lb/>
            of hypocrisy. He should also show such respect to men of <lb/>
            merit in any line, that they shall not think that they could be <lb/>
            more honoured, if their fellow-citizens were members of a free <lb/>
            state. He should also distribute all such honours from him­ <lb/>
            self, but every censure should come through other officers and <lb/>
            the courts of law. It is also a common preservative of all <lb/>
            monarchies not to make one person too great; but if any, then <lb/>
            more than one; for they will act as a guard upon each other. <lb/>
            If however it is necessary to intrust any large powers to one <lb/>
            person, then he should take care that he be not one of an ardent <lb/>
            spirit; for such a disposition is upon every opportunity most <lb/>
            ready to rebel; and, if it should seem necessary to deprive <lb/>
            any one of his power, it is well to do it by degrees, and not <lb/>
            to reduce him all at once. It is also necessary to <lb/>
            abstain from all kinds of insolence, more particu­ <lb/>
            larly from corporal punishment, and from wanton <lb/>
            A tyrant should <lb/>
            abstain from <lb/>
            acts of violence. <lb/>
            conduct towards young men. And especially must he be <lb/>
            careful in this respect with regard to men of honour; for as <lb/>
            those who love money are touched to the quick when any <lb/>
            thing affects their property, so are men of honour and prin­ <lb/>
            ciple when they receive any disgrace. Therefore a tyrant <lb/>
            ought either never to employ personal punishment, or if he <lb/>
            does, he should let it be only in a paternal manner, and not <lb/>
            with insult. His intercourse too with young men should <lb/>
            arise from amatory causes and not from authority; and upon <lb/>
            the whole he should atone for any seeming disgrace by bestow­ <lb/>
            ing greater honours. But of all persons who are most likely <lb/>
            to entertain designs against the person of a tyrant, those are <lb/>
            chiefly to be feared and guarded against, who regard as nothing <lb/>
            the loss of their own lives, so that they can but destroy him; <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεισιδαίμων</foreign>. See Acts, chap. xvii. 22. </note> <pb n="208"/>

            they ought therefore to beware of those who think either <lb/>
            themselves affronted, or those who are dear to them; for those <lb/>
            who are excited by anger to revenge, regard as nothing their <lb/>
            own persons ; for, as Heraclitus says, it is dangerous to fight <lb/>
            with an angry man, for he will purchase his object with his <lb/>
            A tyrant should <lb/>
            side with the <lb/>
            powerful party. <lb/>
            life. As all cities are composed of two sorts of <lb/>
            persons, the rich and the poor, it is necessary <lb/>
            that both these should think that they are equally <lb/>
            protected by him who governs them, and that the one party <lb/>
            should not have it in their power to injure the other; <lb/>
            but that the tyrant should attach to himself that party <lb/>
            which is the most powerful. For if he does this, he will have <lb/>
            no occasion either to set free his slaves, or to deprive the <lb/>
            citizens of their arms ; for the strength of either of the parties <lb/>
            added to his own will be enough to render him superior to <lb/>
            any conspirators.-But it would be superfluous to go through <lb/>
            all such particulars as these; for the rule of conduct which <lb/>
            the tyrant ought to pursue is evident enough ; and that is, to <lb/>
            affect the character not of a tyrant, but of a guardian and <lb/>
            king; not the plunderer, but the protector of his subjects; and <lb/>
            to aim at the middle rank in life, not one superior to all <lb/>
            others; he should, therefore, associate his nobles with him, <lb/>
            and flatter his people. For thus his government will not only <lb/>
            be of necessity more honourable, and worthy of imitation, (as <lb/>
            it will by ruling over men of worth, and not abject wretches, <lb/>
            who perpetually both hate and fear him,) but it will be also <lb/>
            more durable. Let him also frame his life so that his man­ <lb/>
            ners may be in accordance with virtue, or at least half good, <lb/>
            and not wholly wicked, but only in part.</p>

          <p>Oligarchy and <lb/>
            tyranny of <lb/>
            short duration. <lb/>
            Examples.</p>
          <p>INDEED an oligarchy and a tyranny are of all go­ <lb/>
            vernments of the shortest duration. The tyranny <lb/>
            at Sicyon, it is true, was the most lasting; for it <lb/>
            remained in the hands of Orthagoras2 and his <note type="footnote"> I See Zellius ad Arist. Eth. Nicom. ii. 3, p. 67. ' </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See Müller's Dorians, vol. i. book i. ch. 8. " In the instance of <lb/>
            Sicyon, as in many others, the tyrant was the leader of the lower classes, <lb/>
            who were opposed to the aristocracy. It was in this character that Or. <lb/>
            thagoras came forward, who, not being of an ancient family, was called </note> <pb n="209"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. XII.] </note> <lb/>
            sons for a hundred years. The reason of this fact was, that <lb/>
            they ruled their subjects with moderation, and were in <lb/>
            many particulars obedient to the laws; Clisthenes too was <lb/>
            an able general, and so never fell into contempt; and they <lb/>
            took great care in most matters to be popular. Clisthenes, at <lb/>
            any rate, is reported to have presented a person with a crown, <lb/>
            who adjudged the victory to another ; and some say, that it is <lb/>
            the statue of the judge who so decided which is placed in the <lb/>
            Agora. They say also that Pisistratus submitted to be sum­ <lb/>
            moned upon a charge into the court of Areopagus. The <lb/>
            second in duration was the tyranny of the Cypselidæ at Cor­ <lb/>
            inth, which continued seventy-three years and six months ; for <lb/>
            Cypselus was tyrant there thirty years, Periander forty-four, <lb/>
            and Psammetichus, the son of Gordias, three years. 1 And <lb/>
            the reason of this was that Cypselus was a popular man, and <lb/>
            continued in his government without guards ; and Periander <lb/>
            ruled like a tyrant, but then he was an able general. The <lb/>
            third was that of the Pisistratidæ2 at Athens; but it was not <lb/>
            continual: for Pisistratus himself was twice expelled during <lb/>
            his tyranny; so that out of thirty-three years he was only <lb/>
            fifteen in power, and his son eighteen ; so that the whole time <lb/>
            amounted to thirty-five years. Of the rest we shall mention <lb/>
            that of Hiero and Gelo at Syracuse ;3 but even this did not <note type="footnote"> by the nobles a cook. But, notwithstanding its low origin, the family of <lb/>
            this person maintained a supremacy at Sicyon longer than any other; <lb/>
            according to Aristotle, for a century; as they did not maltreat the citizens, <lb/>
            and upon the whole respected the laws : their succession is Orthagoras, <lb/>
            Andreas, Myron, Aristonymus, and Cleisthenes; of whom, however, the <lb/>
            second and fourth never ascended the throne, or only reigned for a short <lb/>
            time. This series, however, is not quite certain, as Herodotus (vi. 126) <lb/>
            goes only as far as Andreas." </note><note type="footnote"> 1 In order to make the total of years agree with the duration of the <lb/>

            disagreement is to be found in the fact that Psammetichus was not one of <lb/>
            the Cypselidae, and hence is not reckoned in the computation of Aristotle <lb/>

            continue long, for both their reigns together were only <lb/>
            eighteen years ; for Gelo, having reigned seven years, died in <lb/>
            the eighth year of his tyranny, and Hiero in his tenth. <lb/>
            Thrasybulus too was expelled in his eleventh month, and the <lb/>
            greater part of other tyrannies have continued a very short time.</p>
          <p>We have now gone through nearly all the general causes of <lb/>
            corruption and means of preservation both in free states and <lb/>
            Why great men <lb/>
            seldom arise. <lb/>
            monarchies. In the Republic of Plato Socrates <lb/>
            treats upon the changes incident to different go­ <lb/>
            vernments; but his discourse is faulty; for he <lb/>
            does not particularly mention to what changes the best and <lb/>
            first form of polity is liable; for he only assigns the general <lb/>
            cause, that nothing is immutable, but that in a fixed course of <lb/>
            time every thing alters ;2 and that the principle of these changes <lb/>
            is to be found in those things of which the sesqui-tertian pro­ <lb/>
            geny, conjoined with the pentad land thrice increased], affords <lb/>
            two harmonies. He says also that this happens when the num­ <lb/>
            ber of this diagram becomes solid, in consequence of nature pro­ <lb/>
            ducing sometimes bad men and sometimes those who are made <lb/>
            better by education.3 And in saying this, probably, he is not <lb/>
            wrong ; for it may be that there are some persons, whom it is <lb/>
            impossible by any education to make into good men. But <lb/>
            Plato's cycle <lb/>
            of govern­ <lb/>
            moots faulty. <lb/>
            why should this change be more peculiar to what <lb/>
            he calls the best-formed government, than to all <lb/>
            other forms, and indeed to all other things that <lb/>
            exist? And with respect to time, which he assigns as the <lb/>
            . cause of the alteration of all things, we find, that things which <lb/>
            did not begin to exist at the same time, cease to be at the <note type="footnote"> 1 See Plato's Rep. viii. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Plato asserts, what Aristotle probably would not deny, that there is a <lb/>
            sort of fixed cycle or <foreign xml:lang="grc">περίοδος</foreign> in all human matters, and that consequently <lb/>
            great men, like comets, appear upon the stage of the world only at distant <lb/>
            intervals. The same sentiment apparently is placed in the mouth of Solon <lb/>
            by Herodotus, (i. 32,) where he says to Crcesus, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πα̃ς ἐστὶ α̃νθρωπος συμ­ <lb/>

            same time; so that, if any thing came into beginning the day <lb/>
            before the solstice, it must alter at the same time. Besides, <lb/>
            why should such a form of government be changed into the <lb/>
            Lacedsemonian ? for, in general, when governments alter, they <lb/>
            alter into the contrary species to what they before were, and <lb/>
            not into one like their former. And this reasoning holds true <lb/>
            of other changes ; for he says, that from the Lacedæmonian <lb/>
            form it changes into an oligarchy, and from thence into a de­ <lb/>
            mocracy, and from a democracy into a tyranny: but yet some­ <lb/>
            times the contrary change takes place; as from a democracy into <lb/>
            an oligarchy, rather than into a monarchy. With respect to <lb/>
            a tyranny, he omits to say whether there will be any change <lb/>
            in it or not, and for what reason; or, if so, into what other <lb/>
            state it will pass. But the reason of this is, that that could <lb/>
            not easily have laid the matter down, for a tyranny is an in­ <lb/>
            determinate government; and, according to him, every state <lb/>
            ought to alter into the first and most perfect form; for thus <lb/>
            the continuity and circle would be preserved. But one ty­ <lb/>
            ranny often changes into another; as at Sicyon, from Muro <lb/>
            to Clisthenes; or into an oligarchy, as did that of Antileon at <lb/>
            Chalets; or into a democracy, as that of Gelo at Syracuse; <lb/>
            or into an aristocracy, as that of Charilaus at Lacedæmon, <lb/>
            and at Carthage. An oligarchy is also changed into a ty­ <lb/>
            ranny : such was the rise of almost all the ancient tyrannies <lb/>
            in Sicily: at Leontium, into the tyranny of Panætius; at <lb/>
            Gela. into that of Cleander: at Rhegium, into that of Anax­ <lb/>
            ilaus; and the like in many other cities. It is <lb/>
            absurd also to suppose that a state is changed into <lb/>
            an oligarchy, because those who are in power are <lb/>
            Further de­ <lb/>
            fects in his <lb/>
            theory. <lb/>
            avaricious and greedy of money, and not because those who <lb/>
            are by far richer than their fellow-citizens think it unfair <lb/>
            that men who have nothing should have an equal share in the <lb/>
            state with themselves who possess so much; for in many oli­ <lb/>
            garchies it is not allowable to be employed in money-getting, <lb/>
            and there are many laws to prevent it. But in Carthage, <lb/>
            which is a democracy, money-getting is allowed, and yet their <lb/>
            form of government remains unaltered. It is also absurd to <lb/>
            say, that in an oligarchy there are two cities, one of the poor, <lb/>
            and another of the rich; for why should this happen to them <lb/>
            more than to the Lacedaemonians, or to any other state where <lb/>
            all possess not equal property, or where all are not equally <pb n="212"/>
            <note type="margin"> fBOOK VI. </note> <lb/>
            good ? For though no one member of the community should <lb/>
            be poorer than he was before, yet an oligarchy may change <lb/>
            to a democracy, if the poor chance to outnumber the rest; and <lb/>
            from a democracy to an oligarchy, if the rich chance to be <lb/>
            more powerful than the poor, and the one too negligent, and <lb/>
            the other industrious : and though these changes are owing to <lb/>
            many causes, yet he mentions but one only, that the citizens <lb/>
            become poor by luxury and payment of interest; as if at first <lb/>
            they were all rich, or the greater part of them. But this is <lb/>
            false. The truth is, that when some of the principal rulers <lb/>
            lose their fortunes, they will endeavour to bring about a revo* <lb/>
            lution ; but when others do so, nothing of consequence will <lb/>
            follow; nor when such states alter, do they change into a <lb/>
            democracy more than into any other form. Besides,1 if they <lb/>
            share not in the honours of the state, or if they are ill-used <lb/>
            and insulted, they will endeavour to raise seditions and bring <lb/>
            about a revolution, although they may not squander their for­ <lb/>
            tunes, that they may be allowed to do as they like: and the <lb/>

            the other states, it will not be amiss at the same time to con­ <lb/>
            sider any thing which remains to be said1 concerning either of <lb/>
            them, and to assign to them that mode of conduct which is <lb/>
            peculiar and advantageous to each ; and also to <lb/>
            inquire into the combinations of all the different <lb/>
            modes of government which we have mentioned ; <lb/>
            Different com­ <lb/>
            binations of <lb/>
            governments. <lb/>
            for as these are blended together, governments shift their <lb/>
            form, so as from an aristocracy to become an oligarchy, and <lb/>
            from a free state to become a democracy. Now, by those <lb/>
            combinations2 of governments which ought to be examined, <lb/>
            though as yet we have not done so, I mean, whether the deli­ <lb/>
            berative department and election of magistrates is regulated <lb/>
            in a manner correspondent to an oligarchy, and the judicial <lb/>
            to an aristocracy, or this and the deliberative part only like an <lb/>
            oligarchy, and the election of magistrates like an aristocracy; <lb/>
            or whether in any other manner every thing is not regulated <lb/>
            in conformity to the nature of the government. We have al­ <lb/>
            ready considered indeed what particular sort of democracy is <lb/>
            fitted to a particular city, and also what particular oligarchy <lb/>
            to a particular people; and of the other states, what is ad­ <lb/>
            vantageous to each. But nevertheless it is also necessary, not <lb/>
            only to show clearly which of these governments is best for <lb/>
            a state, but also briefly to inquire how we ought to arrange <lb/>
            both these and the other forms of government. And, first, <lb/>
            let us speak of a democracy; this will at the same <lb/>
            time show clearly the nature of its opposite, which <lb/>
            some persons call an oligarchy; and in doing this <lb/>
            The component <lb/>
            parts of a de­ <lb/>
            mocracy. <lb/>
            we must take into account all the parts of a democracy and <lb/>
            every thing that is connected therewith. For from the manner <lb/>
            in which these are compounded together, different species of <lb/>
            democracies arise; and hence it is that they are more than <lb/>
            one, and of various natures. Now, there are two causes <lb/>
            whence it arises that there are many kinds of democracy; one <note type="footnote"> 1 Having stated the (i on tents of the preceding books, Aristotle goes on <lb/>
            to consider the different kinds of governments distinguished by the same <lb/>
            specific name, and also " to consider any thing which remains to be said <lb/>
            concerning them "-words sufficient to show (according to Gillies) that <lb/>
            this and the preceding book are supplemental. The present editor how­ <lb/>
            ever considers it best to adhere to the old-established order. </note><note type="footnote"> * Aristotle says that the results of these <foreign xml:lang="grc">συνδυασμοὶ</foreign> or combinations <lb/>
            of different elements, constitute a subject which was not sufficiently at­ <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [BOOK VL </note> <lb/>
            of which is that which we have already mentioned, namely, <lb/>
            These differ in <lb/>
            different coun­ <lb/>
            tries. <lb/>
            there being different sorts of people - for in one <lb/>
            country the people are husbandmen, in another <lb/>
            mechanics and hired servants. Now, if the first of <lb/>
            these is added to the second, and the third to both of them, the <lb/>
            democracy will not only differ in the particular of better or <lb/>
            worse, but in the fact that it is no longer the same govern­ <lb/>
            ment. The other cause is that of which we are now about to <lb/>
            speak. The different matters which are connected with de­ <lb/>
            mocracies, and seem to be proper to this form of government, <lb/>
            by being combined together, produce changes in democracies; <lb/>
            for some few particulars will attend on one form, on another <lb/>
            more, and on a third all. It is useful also to be acquainted <lb/>
            with each particular, if any one would found any state of <lb/>
            which he may happen to approve, for the purpose of amending <lb/>
            it. For all founders of states endeavour to comprehend within <lb/>
            their own plan every thing of nearly the same kind with it; <lb/>
            but in doing this they are mistaken in the manner which we <lb/>
            have already described in treating of the preservation and de­ <lb/>
            struction of governments. I will now speak of the first prin­ <lb/>
            ciples, and character, and aims of such polities.</p>

          <p>Liberty the <lb/>
            end of a de­ <lb/>
            mocracy.</p>
          <p>Now the very foundation 1 of a democratical state <lb/>
            is liberty, and people have been accustomed to <lb/>
            say this, as if under this government alone could <lb/>
            men have a share of liberty ; for they affirm, that this is the <lb/>
            end proposed by every democracy. But it is one element of <lb/>
            liberty to govern and be governed in turns; for, according to <lb/>
            the justice which prevails in a democracy, equality is mea­ <lb/>
            sured by numbers, and not by worth ; and, as justice is such, it <lb/>
            is necessary that the supreme power should be vested in the <lb/>
            people, and that what the majority determine should be deemed <lb/>
            final and just; for they say that every single citizen ought to <lb/>
            possess equality. So that in a democracy the poor ought to <lb/>
            have more power than the rich, as being the greater number, <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὐπόθεσις</foreign>. This word is used in the same sense in book ii. chap. 5, <lb/>
            where Aristotle says that the faulty reasoning of Socrates arises on ac­ <lb/>
            count of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν ὑπόθεσιν οὐκ ὖρθήν</foreign>. " He is wrong in his first prim­ <lb/>
            ciple at starting." </note> <pb n="215"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. II.] </note> <lb/>
            and that which is decreed by the majority is supreme. This, <lb/>
            then, is one mark of liberty, which all framers of <lb/>
            a democracy lay down as a criterion of that state: <lb/>
            another is, that every one may live as he likes; <lb/>
            Tests of a de­ <lb/>
            mocracy. <lb/>
            for this, they say, is a right peculiar to liberty, since he is a <lb/>
            slave who must live as he likes not. This, then, is the second <lb/>
            criterion of a democracy. Hence arises the claim to be under <lb/>
            no subjection to any one upon any account except by rotation. <lb/>
            This also is conducive to that equality which is in accordance <lb/>
            with liberty. These things being premised, and such being <lb/>
            the government, such rules as the following must <lb/>
            be observed in it: that all the magistrates should <lb/>
            be chosen out of all the people, and all to com- <lb/>
            Rules for the <lb/>
            administration <lb/>
            of a democracy. <lb/>
            mand each, and each in his turn all; that all the magistrates <lb/>
            should be chosen by lot to all offices, except perhaps to those <lb/>
            only which require some particular skill and experience; that <lb/>
            no census, or a very small one, should be required to qualify <lb/>
            a man for any office; that no one should be employed in the <lb/>
            same office twice, or very seldom, only in few posts except <lb/>
            in the army; that all their appointments should be limited to <lb/>
            a very short time. or at least as many as possible.; that the <lb/>
            judges shall ue chosen from the whole community for all <lb/>
            causes, or for most, even those of the highest importance; as <lb/>
            for example, that concerning the magistrates' accounts and <lb/>
            public affairs, as well as private contracts, the popular assem­ <lb/>
            bly shall be supreme in all matters; and that no magistrate <lb/>
            but that of the highest authority shall be supreme in any point, <lb/>
            or only in the most trifling matters.. Of all ma­ <lb/>
            gistracies a popular assembly is best suited to a <lb/>
            The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκκλησια</foreign>. <lb/>
            democracy, where the whole community is not paid for attend­ <lb/>
            ance ; for in that case it gradually loses its power; for if they <lb/>
            be well paid, the people bring all causes before themselves by <lb/>
            appeal, as we have already mentioned in the preceding part of <lb/>
            our treatises In the next place, the citizens <lb/>
            should be paid, all of them, if possible, as members <lb/>
            Public pay. <lb/>
            of the assembly, or as judges, or magistrates; but, if this cannot <lb/>
            be done, at least the magistrates, the judges, the senators, and <note type="footnote"> I This is the only intelligible reading of the passage as it stands in <lb/>

            Eligibility of <lb/>
            all to office. <lb/>
            Moreover, as an oligarchy is defined by the no­ <lb/>
            bility, fortune, and education of its members ; so, <lb/>
            on the contrary, a democracy is a government in <lb/>
            the hands of men of low birth, poverty, and vulgar employ- <lb/>

            government has been long changed into a demo­ <lb/>
            cracy, they should endeavour by degrees to diminish its power, <lb/>
            and also elect by lot instead of vote. These things then, ap­ <lb/>
            pertain to all democracies; and they arise from that kind of <lb/>
            justice which is suited to those governments; (that is, that <lb/>
            all its members shall enjoy an equality according to number;) <lb/>
            which seems chiefly to constitute a democracy, or government <lb/>

            means to <lb/>

            rich should have no more share in the govern­ <lb/>
            ment than the poor, nor be alone in power; but <lb/>
            that all should be equal according to number; for thus, they <lb/>

          <p>IN the next place we inquire, how they shall at­ <lb/>
            tain this equality.3 Shall the fortune of five hun­ <lb/>
            dred be divided amongst a thousand, and these <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristotle here enumerates <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰς ἀρχὰς, τὰ δικαστήρια</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν βουλήν</foreign>, <lb/>
            that is, magistrates invested respectively with executive, judicial, and <lb/>
            deliberative powers; who, as well as the citizens at large, convened in <lb/>
            their <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκκλησιαι κύριαι</foreign>, or stated assemblies, ought, according to the prin­ <lb/>
            ciples of simple democracy, to be paid for their political labours. But if <lb/>
            the public revenues cannot suffice for this profusion of expense, then those <lb/>
            magistrates at least must be remunerated, whose uninterrupted functions <lb/>
            require that they should mess together. And with them it would appear <lb/>
            that Aristotle means to class, as to this particular, the citizens convened <lb/>

            thousand have equal power with the five hundred ? or shall <lb/>
            we establish our equality in another manner, dividing as be­ <lb/>
            fore, and afterwards taking an equal number both out of the <lb/>
            five hundred and the thousand, and then investing them with <lb/>
            the power of creating the magistrates and judges ? Is this <lb/>
            state then established according to perfect democratical justice, <lb/>
            or rather that which is guided by numbers only ? For the <lb/>
            defenders of a democracy say, that that is just which the ma­ <lb/>
            jority approve of; but the favourers of an oligarchy say, that <lb/>
            that is just which seems right to the wealthier part; and that <lb/>
            we ought to be directed by the amount of property. But <lb/>
            both the propositions are unequal and unjust, for if we agree <lb/>
            with what the few propose, we erect a tyranny;—(for if it <lb/>
            should happen, that one individual has more than the rest who <lb/>
            are rich, according to oligarchical justice this man alone has a <lb/>
            right to the supreme power;)—but if superiority of numbers <lb/>
            is to prevail, injustice will then be done, by confiscating the <lb/>
            property of the rich, who are few, as we have already said. <lb/>
            What then that equality shall be, which both parties will <lb/>
            admit, must be collected from the definition of right which is <lb/>
            common to them both ; for they both say, that what the ma­ <lb/>
            jority of the state approves ought to be estab­ <lb/>
            lished.1 Be it so, but not entirely; but, since a <lb/>
            city happens to be made up of two different ranks <lb/>
            By vote of the <lb/>
            majority. <lb/>
            of people, the rich and the poor, let that be established which <lb/>
            is approved of by both of these, or by the greater part; but, <lb/>
            should contrary sentiments arise, let that be established which <lb/>
            shall be approved of by the greater part, and by those who <lb/>

          <p>Democracy of <lb/>
            four kinds. <lb/>
            The best kind.</p>
          <p>THERE are four kinds of democracies. The best <lb/>
            of them is that which is first in order, as has been <lb/>
            said in a former place; and this also is the most <lb/>
            ancient of them all. I call that the first which <lb/>
            every one would so place, if he were to divide the people ; for <lb/>
            the best part of these are the husbandmen. A democracy <lb/>
            may be framed where the majority live by tillage or pastur­ <lb/>
            age : for, as their property is but small, they have no leisure <lb/>
            perpetually to hold public assemblies, but are continually <lb/>
            employed in following their own business, not having other­ <lb/>
            wise the means of living ; nor are they desirous of what an­ <lb/>
            other enjoys, but prefer to follow their own business rather <lb/>
            than meddle with state affairs, and accept offices which will be <lb/>
            attended with no great profit. For the greater part of man­ <lb/>
            kind are desirous of riches rather than honour. And here <lb/>
            is one proof: for they submitted to tyrannies in ancient <lb/>
            times, and now they submit to oligarchies, if no one hinders <lb/>
            them in their usual occupations, or deprives them of their pro­ <lb/>
            perty ; for some of them soon get rich, and others are removed <lb/>
            The right of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἵρεσις</foreign> and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐθύνη</foreign>. <lb/>
            from poverty. Besides, their right of electing <lb/>
            magistrates and of calling them to account, will <lb/>
            satisfy them, if they feel any desire of honours. <note type="footnote"> great historian has here exactly understood the meaning of Aristotle, see <lb/>
            Goëttling's note in loco. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 This lamentation is often made by the historians of Rome. Compare <lb/>
            for instance Liv. iii. 65: " Sed alter semper ordo gravis alterius modes­ <lb/>
            tiæ erat. Ade<foreign xml:lang="grc">ό</foreign> moderatio tuendæ libertatis, dum æquari velle simulando <lb/>
            ita se quisque extollit, ut deprimat alium, in difficili est: cavendoque no <lb/>
            metuant homines, metuendos ultro se efficiunt: et injuriam a nobis re* <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CHAP. IV.] </note> <lb/>
            For in some democracies, though the right of electing the ma­ <lb/>
            gistrates is not in hands of the commonalty, yet it is invested <lb/>
            in part of that body chosen to represent them, as was the case <lb/>
            at Mantinæa; and it is sufficient for the people at large to pos­ <lb/>
            sess the deliberative power. Now this we ought to consider <lb/>
            as a species of democracy; and for this reason it is proper and <lb/>
            also customary for that democracy of which we have now been <lb/>
            treating, to have a power of choosing their magistrates, and of <lb/>
            censuring them, and of sitting in judgment upon all causes: <lb/>
            but that the chief magistrates should be elected <lb/>
            according to a certain census, higher according to <lb/>
            the rank of their office, or else not by a census at all, <lb/>
            but merely according to their abilities. A state thus <lb/>
            A census de­ <lb/>
            sirable in the <lb/>
            chief magis­ <lb/>
            tracies. <lb/>
            constituted must be well constituted ; for the magistracies will <lb/>
            always be filled with the best men ; for the people will acquiesce, <lb/>
            and will feel no envy against their betters; and these and the <lb/>
            nobles should be content with this part in the administration ; <lb/>
            for they will not be governed by their inferiors. They will <lb/>
            also rule justly, as others will censure their conduct; for it is <lb/>
            serviceable to the state to have them dependent upon others, <lb/>
            and not to be permitted to do whatsoever they choose ; for the <lb/>
            power of doing whatever a man pleases affords no possible <lb/>
            check against that evil particle which is in every man. It is <lb/>
            necessary, therefore, and useful to the state, that its offices <lb/>
            shall be filled by the principal persons whose characters are <lb/>
            unblemished, and that the people shall not be oppressed. It is <lb/>
            now evident that this is the best species of demo­ <lb/>
            cracy, and on what account; because the people <lb/>
            are of a particular character. In order to turn <lb/>
            the populace to husbandry, some of those laws <lb/>
            which were observed in many ancient states are <lb/>
            all of them useful: as, for instance, on no account <lb/>
            Why this is the <lb/>
            best demo­ <lb/>
            cracy. <lb/>
            A community <lb/>
            of husband­ <lb/>
            men ; <lb/>
            to permit any one to possess more than a certain quantity of <lb/>
            land, or within a certain distance from the city. Formerly <lb/>
            also, in some states, no one was allowed to sell his original <lb/>
            lot of land. There is also a law, which they call a law of <lb/>
            Oxylus,1 the effect of which is, to forbid any one to add by <lb/>
            usury to his income arising from land. We ought also to <lb/>
            steer by the law of the Aphytæans,2 as useful towards our <note type="footnote"> 1 King of the Elians. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 In some editions they are called Aphetali. Plutarch, in Lysand. ? </note> <pb n="220"/>

            present purpose. For they had but very little ground, while <lb/>
            they were a numerous people, and at the same time were all <lb/>
            husbandmen, and so did not include all their lands within the <lb/>
            census, but divided them in such a manner, that, according <lb/>
            to the census, the poor had more power than the rich. Next <lb/>
            and of shep­ <lb/>
            herds. <lb/>
            to the commonalty of husbandmen is one of shep­ <lb/>
            herds, where they live off their herds ; for they <lb/>
            have many things in common with husbandry, and <lb/>
            by their habits of life they are excellent ly qualified to make <lb/>
            good soldiers, being stout in body, and able to continue in the <lb/>
            Other kinds <lb/>
            worse. <lb/>
            open air all night. The generality of the people <lb/>
            of whom the other democracies are composed, are <lb/>
            much worse than these; for their lives are wretch­ <lb/>
            ed, nor is there room for virtue in any business which they <lb/>
            take in hand, whether they be mechanics, petty traders, or <lb/>
            hired servants. And, moreover, as all this sort of men <lb/>
            frequent the exchange and the citadel, in a word, they can <lb/>
            readily attend the public assembly; whereas the husbandmen, <lb/>
            being more dispersed in the country, cannot so easily meet <lb/>
            together, nor are they as desirous as the others of meeting <lb/>
            The best site <lb/>
            for a good de­ <lb/>
            mocracy. <lb/>
            thus. When a country happens to be so situated <lb/>
            that a great part of the land lies at a distance from <lb/>
            the city, there it is easy to establish a good demo­ <lb/>
            cracy, or a free state,1 for the people in general is obliged to <lb/>
            form its settlements in the country; so that it will be neces­ <lb/>
            sary in such a democracy, though there may be a town popu­ <lb/>
            lation near, never to hold an assembly unless the inhabitants <lb/>
            of the country attend. We have shown, then, in what manner <lb/>
            the first and best democracy ought to be established, and it <lb/>
            will be equally evident as to the rest; for it is necessary to <lb/>
            make a correspondent deviation, always separating the worst of <lb/>
            The worst form <lb/>
            of democracy. <lb/>
            the people from the rest. But the last and worst <lb/>
            form is that which gives a share to every citizen; <lb/>
            a thing which few cities can bear, nor is it easy to <lb/>
            preserve it for long, unless well supported by laws and manners. <note type="footnote"> 444, calls them Aphygæi. They inhabited the peninsula Pallene in the <lb/>

            We have already noticed almost every cause that can destroy <lb/>
            either this or any other state. Those who have <lb/>
            taken the lead in such a democracy have endea­ <lb/>
            voured to establish it, and to make the people <lb/>
            powerful, by collecting together as many persons <lb/>
            Methods by <lb/>
            which this <lb/>
            form is brought <lb/>
            about. <lb/>
            as they could, and giving them their freedom, not only legiti­ <lb/>
            mately but naturally born, and also if either of their parents <lb/>
            were citizens, that is to say, on the father or mother's side. This <lb/>
            method is better suited to this state than any other: and thus <lb/>
            the demagogues have been wont to manage. They ought, how­ <lb/>
            ever, not to collect thus any longer than the common people are <lb/>
            superior to the nobles and those of the middle rank, and then <lb/>
            to stop; for, if they proceed further, they will make the state <lb/>
            disorderly, and excite the nobles to feel indignant at the power <lb/>
            of the common people ; which was the cause of the insurrection <lb/>
            at Cyrene:1 for a little evil is overlooked, but when it becomes <lb/>
            great, it strikes the eye. It is moreover very useful, in such <lb/>
            a state, to adopt the means which Clisthenes used at Athens, <lb/>
            when he was desirous of increasing the power of the people, <lb/>
            and as those did who established the democracy in Cyrene ; <lb/>
            that is, to institute many tribes and fraternities, and to reduce <lb/>
            the religious rites of private persons to a few, and those com­ <lb/>
            mon; and every means is to be contrived to associate and <lb/>
            blend the people together as much as possible; and that all <lb/>
            former customs be broken through. Moreover, whatsoever <lb/>
            practice belongs to a tyranny, seems adapted to a democracy <lb/>
            of this species ; as for instance, the licentiousness of the slaves, <lb/>
            the women, and the children ; (for this to a certain degree is <lb/>
            useful in such a state;) and also to overlook every one's living <lb/>
            as they choose. For many will support such a government as <lb/>
            this: for it is more agreeable to many to live without any con­ <lb/>
            trol than with moderation.</p>

            be constituted ever so badly, there is no difficulty in its con - <lb/>
            tinuing for two or three days: they should therefore endeavour <lb/>
            to procure its safety by all those ways which we have de­ <lb/>
            scribed in assigning the causes of the preservation and <lb/>
            destruction of governments; avoiding what is hurtful, and <lb/>
            framing such laws, both written and unwritten, as shall con­ <lb/>
            tain those things which chiefly tend to the preservation of the <lb/>
            state; and they should not suppose that any thing is useful <lb/>
            either for a democratic or an oligarchic form of government, <lb/>
            which contributes to make it more purely so, but what will <lb/>
            Faults in ex­ <lb/>
            isting demo­ <lb/>
            cracies. <lb/>
            contribute to its duration. But our demagogues <lb/>
            at present, to flatter the people, occasion frequent <lb/>
            confiscations in the courts. For which reason <lb/>
            those who have the welfare of the state really at heart should <lb/>
            act on the opposite side, and enact a law to prevent forfeitures <lb/>
            from being divided amongst the people or paid into the trea­ <lb/>
            sury, but to have them set apart for sacred uses. For those <lb/>
            who are of a bad disposition would not then be the less <lb/>
            cautious, as their punishment would be the same; and the <lb/>
            community would not be so ready to condemn those on whom <lb/>
            they sit in judgment, when they are about to get nothing by <lb/>
            it. They should also take care that the causes which are <lb/>
            brought before the public should be as few as possible, and <lb/>
            punish with the utmost severity those who bring an action <lb/>
            against any one without cause; for it is not the commons, but the <lb/>
            nobles, whom they are wont to prosecute. But in all things the <lb/>
            citizens of the same state ought to be affectionate to each other, <lb/>
            or at the least not to treat those who have the chief power in <lb/>
            Regulations to <lb/>
            be observed in <lb/>
            popular assem­ <lb/>
            blies. <lb/>
            it as their enemies. Now, as the democracies <lb/>
            which have been lately established are very nu­ <lb/>
            merous, and it is difficult to get the common <lb/>
            people to attend the public assemblies unless they <lb/>
            are paid for it, this is against the interest of the nobles, when <lb/>
            there is not a sufficient public revenue. For the deficiencies <lb/>
            must be necessarily made up by taxes, confiscations, and fines <lb/>
            imposed by corrupt courts of justice: things which have already <lb/>
            destroyed many democracies. Whenever, then, the revenues of <lb/>
            the state are small, there should be but few public assemblies; <lb/>
            and the courts of justice should have extensive jurisdiction, <lb/>
            but continue sitting a few days only; for by this means the <lb/>
            rich will not fear the expense, although they receive nothing <pb n="223"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. V.] </note> <lb/>
            for their attendance, though the poor do; and judgment also <lb/>
            will be given much better; for the rich will not choose to be <lb/>
            long absent from their own affairs, but will willingly be so <lb/>
            for a short time. And, when there are sufficient revenues, a <lb/>
            different conduct ought to be pursued from what the dema­ <lb/>
            gogues at present follow; for now they divide the surplus of <lb/>
            the public money amongst the poor; these receive it, and <lb/>
            again want the same supply; while the giving such help to <lb/>
            the poor is like pouring water into a sieve. But <lb/>
            the true patriot in a democracy ought to take care <lb/>
            that the majority are not too poor, for this is the <lb/>
            cause of rapacity in that government. He should <lb/>
            Each of the <lb/>
            poor should be <lb/>
            made inde. <lb/>
            pendent. <lb/>
            endeavour, therefore, that they may enjoy a lasting plenty ; <lb/>
            and as this also is advantageous to the rich, what can be saved <lb/>
            out of the public money should be put by, and then divided at <lb/>
            once among the poor, if possible, in such a quantity as may <lb/>
            enable every one of them to purchase a little field; or, if that <lb/>
            cannot be done, at least to give each of them enough to pro­ <lb/>
            cure the implements of trade and husbandry; and if there is <lb/>
            not enough for all to receive so much at once, then to divide <lb/>
            it acording to tribes, or any other allotment. In the mean <lb/>
            time, let the rich pay them for the necessary attendance, and <lb/>
            cease from lavishing them on useless shows. And something like <lb/>
            this was the manner in which they manage at Carthage, and <lb/>
            so preserve the affections of the people; for, by continually <lb/>
            sending some of their community into colonies, they procure <lb/>
            plenty. It is also worthy of a sensible and generous nobility <lb/>
            to divide the poor amongst them, and to induce them to work <lb/>
            by supplying them with what is necessary; or to imitate the <lb/>
            conduct of the people at Tarentum:1 for by permitting the <lb/>
            poor to partake in common of every thing which is needful for <lb/>
            them, they gain the affections of the commonalty. They have <lb/>
            also two different ways of electing their mags­ <lb/>
            trates ; for some are chosen by vote, others by <lb/>
            lot; by the last, that the people at large may have <lb/>
            Election of <lb/>
            magistrates. <lb/>
            some share in the administration; by the former, that the <lb/>
            state may be well governed. It is also possible to accomplish <lb/>
            the same thing, if of the same magistrates some are cho3en <note type="footnote"> I Upon the constitution of Tarentum, see Müller's Dorians, vol. ii. <lb/>

          <p>The constitu­ <lb/>
            tion of an <lb/>
            oligarchy.</p>
          <p>FROM what has been already said, it will be almost <lb/>
            manifest how an oligarchy ought to be founded. <lb/>
            For it is right to draw conclusions from things <lb/>
            which are contrary, and to frame every species of oligarchy <lb/>
            by a kind of analogy, corresponding to some opposite species <lb/>
            of democracy.</p>
          <p>The best kind.</p>
          <p>The purest and best-framed oligarchy is one <lb/>
            which approaches most nearly to what we call a <lb/>
            free state ; in which there ought to be two different standards <lb/>
            of income, the one made high, the other low. From those who <lb/>
            are within the latter, the ordinary officers of the state ought <lb/>
            to be chosen; from the former, the supreme magistrates: nor <lb/>
            should any ore be excluded from a part of the administration <lb/>
            who is within the census; which should be so regulated that <lb/>
            the commonalty who are included in it should, by that means, <lb/>
            be made superior to those who have no share in the govern­ <lb/>
            ment. For those who are to take their share in public affairs <lb/>
            ought always to be chosen out of the better sort of the people. <lb/>
            The next kind. <lb/>
            Much in the same manner ought the next kind of <lb/>
            oligarchy to be established, by drawing the rule a <lb/>
            little tighter; but as to that which is most opposite to a pure <lb/>
            The worst. <lb/>
            democracy, and approaches nearest to a dynasty <lb/>
            and a tyranny, as it is of all others the worst, so <lb/>
            it requires the greatest care and caution to preserve it. For <lb/>
            as bodies of sound and healthy constitutions, and ships which <lb/>
            are well manned and well adapted for sailing, can bear many <lb/>
            defects without perishing thereby, while a diseased body, or <lb/>
            a leaky ship with an indifferent crew, cannot support the least <lb/>
            shock; just so the worst-established governments want the <lb/>
            Tests of sta­ <lb/>
            bility in a de­ <lb/>
            mocracy and <lb/>
            an oligarchy. <lb/>
            most careful attention. A number of citizens is <lb/>
            the preservation of a democracy; for they are a <lb/>
            body opposed to those rights which are founded <lb/>
            in rank; while on the contrary, the preservation <lb/>
            of an oligarchy depends upon the due regulation of the dif­ <lb/>
            ferent orders in the society.</p><pb n="225"/>

          <p>As the greater part of the community is divided <lb/>
            into four sorts of people, husbandmen, mechanics, <lb/>
            petty traders, and hired servants; and, as those <lb/>
            Where an oli­ <lb/>
            garchy can be <lb/>
            established. <lb/>
            who are useful in war may likewise be divided into four sorts, the <lb/>
            horseman, the heavy-armed soldier, the light-armed, and the <lb/>
            sailor; wherever the nature of the country admits of a great <lb/>
            number of horse, there a powerful oligarchy may be easily <lb/>
            established. For the safety of the inhabitants depends upon <lb/>
            a force of that sort; but those who can support the expense <lb/>
            of horsemen must be persons of some considerable fortune. <lb/>
            Where the troops are chiefly heavy-armed, there an inferior <lb/>
            oligarchy may be established; for a heavy-armed force is com­ <lb/>
            posed more out of the rich than the poor, but the light-armed <lb/>
            and the sailors always contribute to support a democracy. <lb/>
            But where the number of these is very great, and a sedition <lb/>
            arises, the other parts of the community fight at a disadvan­ <lb/>
            tage ; but a remedy for this evil is to be learned from skilful <lb/>
            generals, who always mix a proper number of light-armed <lb/>
            soldiers with their horse and heavy-armed. For it is in this <lb/>
            way that the populace get the better of the men of fortune in <lb/>
            an insurrection; for being lighter, they are easily a match for <lb/>
            the horse and the heavy-armed. So that for an oligarchy to <lb/>
            form a body of troops from these is to form one against itself. <lb/>
            But as a city is composed of different ages, some young and <lb/>
            some old, the fathers should teach their sons, while they are <lb/>
            still very young, the light and easy exercises; and when they <lb/>
            are grown up from childhood, they should be perfected in war­ <lb/>
            like exercises in general. Now, the admission of <lb/>
            the people to any share in the government, as I <lb/>
            said before, should be either regulated by a census, <lb/>
            or else, as at Thebes, allowed to those who for a <lb/>
            How to regu­ <lb/>
            late the ad­ <lb/>
            mission of the <lb/>
            people to office. <lb/>
            certain time have ceased from any mechanic employment; or <lb/>
            as at Massalia, where they are chosen according to their worth, <lb/>
            whether citizens or foreigners. With respect to the magis­ <lb/>
            trates of the highest rank, which it may be necessary to have <lb/>
            in the state, their services to the public should be strictly laid <lb/>
            down, to prevent the common people from being desirous of a <lb/>
            share, and also to induce them to regard their magistrates <note type="footnote"> Q </note> <pb n="226"/>
            <note type="margin"> LBOOK VI. </note> <lb/>
            with favour, as men who pay a large price for their honours. <lb/>
            It is also fitting that the magistrates, upon entering into office, <lb/>
            should make magnificent sacrifices, and erect some public <lb/>
            structure, that the people, partaking of the entertainment, and <lb/>
            seeing the city ornamented with votive gifts in their temples <lb/>
            and public structures, may see with pleasure the stability of the <lb/>
            government: the nobles will thus gain lasting records of their <lb/>
            generosity. But now this is not the conduct of those who <lb/>
            are at present at the head of an oligarchy, but quite the con­ <lb/>
            trary ; for they are not more desirous of honour than of gain ; <lb/>
            for which reason such oligarchies may more properly be called <lb/>
            little democracies. Let it then suffice to have laid down thus <lb/>
            much as to the principles on which a democracy and an oli­ <lb/>
            garchy ought to be established.</p>

          <p>What magis­ <lb/>
            tracies are ne­ <lb/>
            cessary.</p>
          <p>AFTER what has been said, it follows next to dis­ <lb/>
            tinguish accurately concerning the magistracies; <lb/>
            of what nature they should be, how many, and <lb/>
            for what purpose, as I have already mentioned: for without <lb/>
            the necessary magistrates no state can exist, nor without those <lb/>
            who contribute to its dignity and good order can it exist hap­ <lb/>
            pily. Now it is necessary, that in small states the magistrates <lb/>
            should be few, in large ones many; it is well also to know <lb/>
            what offices it is suitable to join together, and what ought to <lb/>
            be separated.</p>
          <p>Inspectors of <lb/>
            the market.</p>
          <p>The first thing necessary is to establish proper <lb/>
            regulations in the markets ; for which purpose a <lb/>
            certain officer should be appointed, to inspect all <lb/>
            contracts, and to preserve good order; for, of necessity, in <lb/>
            almost every city there must be both buyers and sellers, to <lb/>
            supply each others' mutual wants, and this is the readiest <lb/>
            means towards independence ; for the sake of which men seem <lb/>
            first to have joined together in one community.2 A second <note type="footnote"> 1 The learned Schneider admonishes the reader that there is evidently <lb/>
            an omission here, and that in this place we ought to look for Aristotle's <lb/>
            complete statement of doctrine with reference to the constitution of aristo. <lb/>
            cracies, free states, and monarchies. But the reader has already been <lb/>
            warned of the fragmentary character of the present treatise of our author. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Compare book i. chap. 2, and Nicom. Eth. book v. chap. 6. </note> <pb n="227"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            care, and nearly related to the first, is to have an <lb/>
            eye both to the public and private edifices in the <lb/>
            city, that they may be ornamented; and also to <lb/>
            Of tl e public <lb/>
            buildings, etc. <lb/>
            take care of all buildings which are likely to fall, and of the <lb/>
            repair of highways; and also to see that the land-marks <lb/>
            between different estates are preserved, that they may live <lb/>
            free from disputes, and all other business of a like nature. <lb/>
            Now such an office as this is called by most an inspectorship <lb/>
            of the city, and the business itself may be divided into several <lb/>
            branches, over each of which in populous cities they appoint a <lb/>
            separate person; one to inspect the buildings, another the foun­ <lb/>
            tains, and another the harbours. There is a third office, most <lb/>
            necessary, and very like the last, and conversant nearly about <lb/>
            the same objects; only its sphere lies in the country and the <lb/>
            suburbs of the city. These officers some persons <lb/>
            call inspectors of the lands, and others, inspectors <lb/>
            Of lands. <lb/>
            of the woods; these then are three matters of care. But there <lb/>
            must also be another magistracy appointed, to receive the <lb/>
            public revenue, from whose safe-keeping it is to be delivered <lb/>
            out to those who are in the different departments <lb/>
            of the state; these are called receivers or quæstors. <lb/>
            Quæstors. <lb/>
            There must also be another, before whom all private contracts <lb/>
            and sentences of courts shall be enrolled; and before these <lb/>
            same, as well as the magistrates, must be brought all indictments <lb/>
            and openings of pleadings. Sometimes this employment is <lb/>
            divided amongst many, but there is one supreme <lb/>
            over the rest; these are called proctors, notaries, <lb/>
            and other like names. Next to these is an <lb/>
            officer, whose business is of all others the most <lb/>
            Notaries, etc. <lb/>
            Court for the <lb/>
            recovery of <lb/>
            fines. <lb/>
            necessary, and yet most difficult; namely, the exaction of <lb/>
            penalties from those who are condemned, the recovery of <lb/>
            fines, and the charge of the persons of prisoners. This office <lb/>
            is very difficult, on account of the odium attending it, so that <lb/>
            no one will engage in it unless it is made very profitable, nor, <lb/>
            if he does, will he be willing to execute it according to law; <lb/>
            but it is most necessary, as it is of no service to pass judgment <lb/>
            in any cause, except that judgment is carried into execution; <lb/>
            for if human society cannot subsist without actions at law, <lb/>
            it certainly cannot exist without the infliction of penalties. <lb/>
            For this reason it is best that this office should not be executed <lb/>
            by one person, but by some of the magistrates of other courts. <note type="footnote"> Q 2 </note> <pb n="228"/>
            <note type="margin"> [ BOOK VI. </note> <lb/>
            In like manner, endeavour should be made that the levying of <lb/>
            fines which are ordered by the judges, shall be divided <lb/>
            amongst different persons. And further, that different magis­ <lb/>
            trates shall judge different causes; new judges trying novel <lb/>
            matters in preference; and as to those which are already ruled, <lb/>
            let one person pass sentence, and another see it executed; as, <lb/>
            for instance, let the curators of the public buildings execute <lb/>
            the sentence which the inspectors of the markets have passed, <lb/>
            and conversely in other cases ; for in proportion as less odium <lb/>
            attends those who carry the laws into execution, by so much <lb/>
            the easier will they gain their proper end. Therefore for the <lb/>
            same persons to pass the sentence and to execute it, will sub­ <lb/>
            ject them to double hatred; and if the same judges pass sen­ <lb/>
            tence in all cases, they will be considered as the enemies of <lb/>
            all. And in many places a different magistrate has custody <lb/>
            of the prisoner, while another sees execution done upon him ; <lb/>
            as the eleven at Athens: for which reason it is prudent to se­ <lb/>
            parate these offices, and to seek out a plea for arranging this <lb/>
            matter. For it is no less than any matter of care already <lb/>
            mentioned; for it so happens that men of character will de­ <lb/>
            cline accepting this office, and worthless persons cannot pro­ <lb/>
            perly be intrusted with it, as being themselves rather in want <lb/>
            of a guard, rather than qualified to guard others. This, there­ <lb/>
            fore, ought by no means to be a separate office from others ; <lb/>
            nor should it be permanently allotted to any individuals, but <lb/>
            to the young men; and where there is a band of young men <lb/>
            or a city guard, the youths ought in turns to take these offices <lb/>
            upon them. These, then, as the most necessary magistrates, <lb/>
            ought to be first mentioned; next to these are others no less <lb/>
            necessary, but of much higher rank, for they ought to be men <lb/>
            Warders of <lb/>
            the city. <lb/>
            of great skill and fidelity. Such would be those <lb/>
            magistrates which have the guard of the city, and <lb/>
            provide every thing necessary for war; whose bu­ <lb/>
            siness it is, both in war and peace, to defend the walls and gates, <lb/>
            and to take care to muster and marshal the citizens. Over <lb/>
            Military <lb/>
            officers. <lb/>
            all these there are sometimes more officers, some­ <lb/>
            times fewer; thus, in little cities there is one su­ <lb/>
            preme over all, whom they call either general or <lb/>
            polemarch ; but where there are horse and light-armed troops, <lb/>
            and bowmen, and sailors, they sometimes place over each of <lb/>
            these distinct commanders, called navarchs, hipparchs, and <pb n="229"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            taxiarchs; who again have others under them, as trierarchs, <lb/>
            lochagi, and phylarchs, according to their different divisions; <lb/>
            all of which join together to make one body, appertaining to <lb/>
            the military department. But since some of the magistrates, <lb/>
            if not all, have business with the public money, it is necessary <lb/>
            that there should be other officers, whose employment shall <lb/>
            be nothing else than to take an account of what they have, <lb/>
            and to correct any mismanagement therein ; and these they <lb/>
            call auditors, or legistæ, or inquisitors, or scrutineers. But, <lb/>
            besides all these magistrates, there is one who is <lb/>
            supreme over them all, who very often has in his <lb/>
            The premier. <lb/>
            own power the disposal both of the public revenue and taxes; <lb/>
            who presides over the people, when the supreme power is in <lb/>
            them; for the magistrate who has a power to summon them <lb/>
            together, must be supreme head of the state. These are <lb/>
            sometimes called probuli, because they preadvise; <lb/>
            but, where there are many, they are more proper- <lb/>
            Probuli. <lb/>
            ly called a council. These are nearly all the civil magistrates <lb/>
            which are requisite to a government: but there are other per­ <lb/>
            sons, whose business is confined to religion ; as the <lb/>
            priests, and those who have to take care of the <lb/>
            Priests. <lb/>
            temples, that they are kept in proper repair, or, if they <lb/>
            fall down, that they may be rebuilt; and whatever else be­ <lb/>
            longs to public worship. This charge is sometimes intrusted <lb/>
            to one person, as in small cities; in others it is delegated to <lb/>
            many, and these distinct from the priesthood, as the builders <lb/>
            or keepers of holy places, and officers of the sacred revenue. <lb/>
            Next to these are those who are appointed to have the general <lb/>
            care of all the public sacrifices, which the law does not intrust <lb/>
            to the priests, but which have their high rank as being offered <lb/>
            on the common hearth of the city ; and some call them <lb/>
            archons, some kings, and others again prytanes. To sum up <lb/>
            in few words the different magistracies which are <lb/>
            necessary in these matters, these are either con- <lb/>
            Various others. <lb/>
            cerned with religion, with war, with taxes and expenditure, <lb/>
            with markets and public buildings, with harbours and high­ <lb/>
            ways. Belonging to the courts of justice there are scribes, to <lb/>
            enrol private contracts; and there mus also be some to see <lb/>
            to executions, and guards over the prise - ; there are also <lb/>
            courts of inquiry and scrutiny, to pass the magistrates' ac <lb/>
            counts; and lastly, others to watch over the deliberative element <pb n="230"/>

            Superintend­ <lb/>
            ents of the <lb/>
            women, <lb/>
            youths, and <lb/>
            education. <lb/>
            are very attentive to good order, require parti­ <lb/>
            cular magistrates; such as those who have the <lb/>
            government of the women, who are to see the <lb/>
            laws are executed; who take the care of the boys, <lb/>
            and preside over their education. To these may be added, <lb/>
            those who haye the care of the gymnastic exercises, the the­ <lb/>
            atres, and every other public spectacle which there may hap <lb/>
            pen to be. Some of these however clearly do not concern the <lb/>
            people at large, as the governors of the women; for the poor <lb/>
            are obliged to employ their wives and children in servile <lb/>
            offices, for want of slaves. But as there are three magistrates <lb/>
            to whom some states intrust the supreme power, namely, <lb/>
            What officers <lb/>
            suit the three <lb/>
            forms of go­ <lb/>
            vernment. <lb/>
            guardians of the laws,2 preadvisers,3 and senators; <lb/>
            guardians of the laws suit best to an aristocracy, <lb/>
            preadvisers to an oligarchy, and a senate to a de­ <lb/>
            mocracy. And thus much has been said by way <lb/>
            of an outline concerning all magistrates. <note type="footnote"> 1 In this obscure and difficult passage, in which Aristotle seems to al­ <lb/>
            ternate between loose and technical terms, the editor has followed the <lb/>
            reading of Bekker, with the single exception of rejecting the icat before <lb/>
            the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρός εὐθύνας</foreign>. This he prefers to the proposed reading of <lb/>
            Goëttling, <foreign xml:lang="grc">και προσευθύνας</foreign>,. In the earlier part of the sentence Schneider, <lb/>
            followed by Coraës and Goëttling, read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπολογισμοὺς</foreign> instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιλο­ <lb/>
            γισμούς</foreign>. But in a later edition G. recalls his assent in the following <lb/>
            terms, which are here transcribed. " Aristoteles hie de magistratu loqui­ <lb/>
            tur, cujus fidei commissa est exquisitio gesti a ceteris magistratibus mu­ <lb/>
            neris. Magistratus autem in defendendis (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπολογισμοι̃ς</foreign>) iis occupatus <lb/>

            that this name denotes certain magistrates of high authority, who exer­ <lb/>
            cised a control over the whole body of the magistrates and people, and <lb/>
            whose duty was to see that the laws were dnly administered and obeyed. <lb/>
            Mention is made of this office at Sparta and elsewhere; but no such body <lb/>
            existed at Athens, as it would have been incompatible with the demo­ <lb/>
            cratic genius of its constitution, at least when vested in the hands of a <lb/>
            single person. The office of guardian of the laws, in part at least, seems <lb/>
            to have been discharged at Athens by the Areopagus. At a later period <lb/>
            an inferior office under this name is said to have been devised at Athens. ^ </note><note type="footnote"> 3 <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόβουλοι</foreign>. These officers Gillies compares with the " lords of ar­ <lb/>

          <p>HE who proposes to make the fitting inquiry as <lb/>
            to which form of government is the best, ought <lb/>
            first to determine what manner of living is most <lb/>
            eligible ;2 for while this remains uncertain, it will <lb/>
            The most eli­ <lb/>
            gible life to be <lb/>
            considered by <lb/>

            also be equally uncertain what government is best. For, un­ <lb/>
            less some unexpected accident interfere, it is probable that <lb/>
            those who enjoy the best government, will live best according <lb/>
            to existing circumstances; he ought, therefore, first to come <lb/>
            to some agreement as to the manner of life which, so to speak, <lb/>
            is most desirable for all; and afterwards, whether this life is <lb/>
            the same or different in the individual and the member of a <note type="footnote"> 1 This and the following book are placed by Gillies as the fourth and <lb/>
            fifth. The fifth and sixth books (called by him the seventh and eighth) <lb/>
            are regarded by him as supplemental to the rest. He thus defends his re­ <lb/>
            arrangement of the treatise, and traces the connexion between its several <lb/>
            parts. " In the first book of his Politics, Aristotle examines the origin of <lb/>
            society and government, the essential distinction of ranks in a common­ <lb/>
            wealth, and the best plans of political economy. In the second, he de­ <lb/>
            scribes the most admired schemes of policy, either delineated by philoso­ <lb/>
            phers or instituted by legislators. In the third, (of which a considerable <lb/>
            part is now lost,) he explains the nature and principles of the various <lb/>
            governments existing in Greece and in the ancient world, whether repub­ <lb/>
            lican or monarchical; bestowing just and liberal praise where praise <lb/>
            seemed to be due; but declaring himself not to be completely satisfied <lb/>
            with any thing that philosophers had devised, legislators prescribed, or <lb/>
            that time and chance had produced, he proceeds in this fourth (commonly <lb/>
            published as the seventh) book, to exhibit the result of his own reflections <lb/>
            concerning the great question, what form of government is the best ? This <lb/>
            problem, he observes, cannot be solved abstractedly; because government <lb/>
            being an arrangement, the best government must be the best arrangement, <lb/>
            and this must be that form which the materials to be arranged are the <lb/>
            jest fitted to receive and to preserve." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 In order to find what is <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἱρετωτάτη πολιτεια</foreign>, Aristotle considers first <lb/>
            the practical question on which it must depend, viz. what is <foreign xml:lang="grc">αιρετώτατος <lb/>
            βιος</foreign>. In both the one and the other, that will be the best which is the best <lb/>
            under existing circumstances. Now in his Rhetoric, (book i. chap. 5,) to <lb/>
            which he here alludes as one of his exoteric treatises, Aristotle divides all <lb/>
            goods into, 1. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ ἐκτός</foreign>. 2. ra lv <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̃ σώματι</foreign>. 3. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ ἐν τη̃ ψύχη</foreign>. Each <lb/>
            and all of them, though they do not constitute happiness, are yet necessary <lb/>
            to its perfection, as every one but a fool will admit: the only difference <lb/>
            will be concerning the proportion of each kind which is necessary. </note> <pb n="232"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK VII. </note> <lb/>
            state. Deeming then that we have already sufficiently shown <lb/>
            what sort of life is best, in our popular discourses on that <lb/>
            subject, we must now make use of what we there said.1 Cer­ <lb/>
            Three causes of goods necessary for happiness.<lb/>
            tainly no one ever called in question the pro­ <lb/>
            priety of one of the divisions; namely, that as <lb/>
            there are three kinds of things good for man, <lb/>
            namely, what is external, what belongs to the body,<lb/>
            and to the soul, it is evident that all these must conspire to <lb/>
            make men truly happy. For no one would say that a man was <lb/>
            happy who had nothing of fortitude or temperance, justice or <lb/>
            prudence, but was afraid of the flies that flew round him; or <lb/>
            who would abstain from nothing, if he chanced to be desirous <lb/>
            of meat or drink, or who would murder his dearest friend for a <lb/>
            farthing; or, in like manner, one who was in every particular <lb/>
            as wanting and misguided in his understanding as an infant <lb/>
            or a maniac. These truths are so evident that all must agree <lb/>
            to them, though some may dispute about the quantity and the <lb/>
            degree: for they may think, that a very little amount of virtue <lb/>
            is sufficient for happiness; but as to riches, property, power, <lb/>
            honour, and all such things, they endeavour to increase them <lb/>
            without bounds. But to such we say, that it is easy to prove, <lb/>
            from what experience teaches us concerning these cases, that <lb/>
            it is not through these external goods that men acquire virtue, <lb/>
            The truly happy life depends on virtue and wisdom.<lb/>
            but through virtue that they acquire them.2 As <lb/>
            to a happy life, whether it is to be found in <lb/>
            pleasure or in virtue, or in both, certain it is that it <lb/>
            <lb/>
            belongs more frequently to those whose morals are <lb/>
            most pure, and whose understandings are best cultivated, and <lb/>
            who preserve moderation in the acquisition of external goods, <lb/>
            than to those who possess a sufficiency of external good things, <note type="footnote"> 1 He refers to Rhet. book i. chap. 5. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 That virtue is more essential than external goods to <unclear>εὔ</unclear> <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξη̃ν</foreign>, is proved <lb/>
            in two ways: <lb/>
            1. Practically: <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ ἐκτός</foreign> ayaQa are caused and preserved by virtue, not <lb/>
            virtue by them. <lb/>
            &amp; Theoretically: (a) <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ ἐκτός</foreign> ayaQa have a limit and excess; not so <lb/>
            virtue. <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">β</foreign>) The soul is superior to the body ; but qualities &lt; <lb/>
            differ in relative importance according to the <lb/>
            importance of the subject in which they reside. <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γ</foreign>) External goods exist for the sake of the soul, not <lb/>
            the contrary. For happiness depends upon the <lb/>
            exercise of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρετὴ</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">φρόνησνς</foreign>. </note> <pb n="233"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. I.] </note> <lb/>
            but are deficient in the rest. And that such is the case will <lb/>
            be clearly seen by any one who views the matter with reflec­ <lb/>
            tion. For whatsoever is external has its boundary, as a <lb/>
            machine; and whatsoever is useful is such that its excess is <lb/>
            either necessarily hurtful, or at best useless to the possessor. <lb/>
            But every good quality of the soul, the higher it is in degree, <lb/>
            becomes much the more useful, if it is permitted on this sub­ <lb/>
            ject to adopt the word 11 useful" as well as " noble." It is also <lb/>
            evident that the best disposition of each thing will follow in <lb/>
            the same proportion of excess, as the things themselves, of <lb/>
            which we allow they are accidents, differ from each other in <lb/>
            value. So that if the soul is more noble than any outward <lb/>
            possession, or than the body, both in itself and with respect to <lb/>
            us, it must be admitted, of course, that the best disposition of <lb/>
            each must follow the same analogy. Besides, it is for the <lb/>
            sake of the soul that these things are desirable, and it is on <lb/>
            this account that wise men should desire them, and not the <lb/>
            r soul for them. Let us therefore be well agreed that so much <lb/>
            of happiness falls to the lot of every one as he possesses of <lb/>
            virtue and wisdom, and in proportion as he acts according to <lb/>
            their dictates ; since for this we have the example of the <lb/>
            God Himself, who is completely happy, not from any exter­ <lb/>
            nal good, but in Himself, and because He is such by nature. <lb/>
            For good fortune is something of necessity different from hap­ <lb/>
            piness, as every external good of the soul is produced by chance <lb/>
            or by fortune; but it is not from fortune that any one is just <lb/>
            or wise. Hence it follows, as established by <lb/>
            the same reasoning, that the state which is best, . <lb/>
            and acts best, will be happy: for no one can fare <lb/>
            The best and happiest state<lb/>
            well who acts not well; nOr can the actions either of man or <lb/>
            city be praise-worthy without virtue and wisdom. But valour, <lb/>
            \ justice, and wisdom have in a state the same force and form as <lb/>
            in individuals; and it is only as he shares in these virtues that <lb/>
            each man is said to be just, wise, and prudent.</p>
          <p>Thus much then may suffice to be said by way of introduc­ <lb/>
            tion ; for we cannot refrain from touching on this subject in our <lb/>
            discourse, though we could not go through all the details <lb/>
            which belong to it; for that business properly belongs to an­ <lb/>
            other inquiry. But let us at present lay down so much, that <lb/>
            a manis happiest life, both as an individual and as a citizen, <lb/>
            is a life of virtue, so far accompanied by external goods as to <pb n="234"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK VII. </note> <lb/>
            be able to perform virtuous actions. But if there are any who <lb/>
            still dispute the matter, and are not persuaded by what we <lb/>
            have said, we will consider them hereafter, but at present we <lb/>
            shall proceed according to our intended method.</p>

          <p>The happiness <lb/>
            of the indi­ <unclear/> <lb/>
            vidual and of <lb/>
            the state the <lb/>
            same.</p>
          <p>IT now remains for us to say whether the happi­ <lb/>
            ness of any individual and of a city1 is the same <lb/>
            or different. But this also is evident; for all <lb/>
            would confess that it is the same. For whosoever <lb/>
            supposes that riches will make a person happy, must place <lb/>
            the happiness of the city in riches, if it possesses them; those 1 <lb/>
            who prefer a life which enjoys tyrannic power, will also think <lb/>
            that the city which has many others under its command is <lb/>
            most happy: thus, also, if any one approves a man for his vir­ <lb/>
            tue, he will think the most worthy city the happiest. But here <lb/>
            Two questions. <lb/>
            1. Is political <lb/>
            or private life <lb/>
            the better ? <lb/>
            there are two particulars which require consider­ <lb/>
            ation, one of which is, whether it is the most <lb/>
            eligible life to be a member of the community and &lt; <lb/>
            enjoy the rights of a citizen, or to live as a stranger, <lb/>
            without interfering in public affairs; and also what form of <lb/>
            2. What is the <lb/>
            best form of <lb/>
            government? <lb/>
            government and what disposition of the state we <lb/>
            ought to consider the best; whether the whole <lb/>
            community should be eligible to a share in the <lb/>
            administration, or only the greater part, and some only. As <lb/>
            this, therefore, is a subject of political examination and spe­ <lb/>
            culation, and not what concerns the individual, and as this is <lb/>
            The former <lb/>
            deferred. <lb/>
            the view which we have at present chosen, the <lb/>
            one of these would be foreign to our purpose,2 <lb/>
            but the other is proper to our present design. <note type="footnote"> I The object of Plato in his Republic was to arrive at what is good for <lb/>
            the individual through the medium of what is good for the state; the <lb/>
            method of Aristotle would be as nearly as possible the converse of this. <lb/>
            We do not, however, accurately know how far Plato all along had in <lb/>
            view a different object, namely, to disprove the sophistical notion that <lb/>
            happiness and virtue depend mainly on keeping up the outward sem­ <lb/>
            blance of it. { </note><note type="footnote"> 2 As not being strictly in accordance with the practical character of the <lb/>
            present treatise. Still Aristotle enters into the question as a <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάρεργον</foreign>. <lb/>
            Since virtues are twofold, 1. Political or practical, 2. Theoretical or con­ <lb/>
            templative, is a political or contemplative life preferable ? The man who <lb/>
            follows the latter kind of life objects to the politician, that his life is </note> <pb n="235"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. II.] </note> <lb/>
            Now it is evident that that government must be the best, which <lb/>
            is so established that every one therein may have it in his <lb/>
            power to act most virtuously and live happily: but some, who <lb/>
            admit that a life of virtue is most eligible, still doubt which is <lb/>
            preferable, a public life of active virtue, or one entirely dis­ <lb/>
            engaged from what is without, and spent in contemplation; <lb/>
            which some say is the only one worthy of a philosopher. And <lb/>
            one of these two different modes of life, both now and formerly, <lb/>
            seem to have been chosen by all those who were the most <lb/>
            ambitious of virtue; I mean the political or the philosophic <lb/>
            lite. And yet it is of no little consequence on <lb/>
            which side the truth lies; for a man of sense must <lb/>
            naturally direct his aim to the better mark; and <lb/>
            Different opi­ <lb/>
            nions on the <lb/>
            latter question. <lb/>
            not only individuals, but the state also, should do the same. <lb/>
            Some think that a tyrannical government over our neighbours <lb/>
            is accompanied with the greatest injustice; but that a politi­ <lb/>
            cal rule over them is not unjust: but that still is a restraint <lb/>
            on the tranquillity of political life. Others chance to hold, as <lb/>
            it were, the contradictory opinion, and think that an active <lb/>
            and political life is the only life for man; for that private <lb/>
            persons have no opportunity of practising any one virtue, more <lb/>
            than they have who are engaged in the public management of <lb/>
            the state. These are their sentiments; others say, that a tyran­ <lb/>
            nical and despotical mode of government is the only happy one; <lb/>
            for even among some free states the object of their laws seems <lb/>
            to be this, to tyrannise over their neighbours. So that poli­ <lb/>
            tieal institutions, wheresoever dispersed among the greater <lb/>
            part of mankind, if they have any one common object in view, <lb/>
            all of them aim at this, to conquer and govern. As for ex­ <lb/>
            ample, at Lacedæmon and in Crete, the education of their <lb/>

            a state of war. Besides, among all nations, those who have <lb/>
            power enough to enslave others, are honoured on that account ;1 <note type="footnote">attended with injustice in certain cases. He answers, that it is only in <lb/>
            political life that scope for certain particular virtues is found. Others <lb/>
            hold that despotic rule over as many subjects as possible is the best thing. <lb/>
            But this surely cannot be true; for no other art endeavours to effect its <lb/>
            end by force, but to provide fit and proper means. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 " The institutions of Rome had not acquired that celebrity which <lb/>

            as were the Scythians, Persians, Thracians, and Gauls; and <lb/>
            with some there are laws whose end is to excite the virtue of <lb/>
            courage; thus they tell us, that at Carthage they allowed every <lb/>
            person to wear as many rings for distinction as he had served <lb/>
            campaigns. There was also a law in Macedon, that a man, <lb/>
            who had not himself killed an enemy, should be obliged to <lb/>
            wear a halter round his neck. Among the Scythians, at a fes­ <lb/>
            tival, none were permitted to drink out of the cup which was <lb/>
            carried about who had not done the same thing. Among the <lb/>
            Iberians, a warlike nation, they erect as many columns upon <lb/>
            a man's tomb as he has slain enemies; and among different <lb/>
            nations different things of this sort prevail, some of them <lb/>
            established by law, others by custom. Probably it may seem <lb/>
            absurd to those who are willing to inquire, whether it is the <lb/>
            business of a legislator to be able to point out by what means <lb/>
            a state may govern and tyrannise over its neighbours, whether <lb/>
            they will, or will not. For how can that which is itself un­ <lb/>
            lawful belong either to the politician or legislator ? but it is <lb/>
            unlawful to rule not only justly but unjustly also; for a con­ <lb/>
            quest may be unjustly made. But we see nothing of this in <lb/>
            the other sciences; for it is the business neither of the phy­ <lb/>
            sician nor of the pilot to use either persuasion or force, the one <lb/>
            to his patients, the other to his passengers. And yet many <lb/>
            seem to think that a despotic government is a political one, and <lb/>
            what they do not allow to be just or proper, if exercised over <lb/>
            themselves, they will not blush to exercise over others ; for <lb/>
            they endeavour to be justly governed themselves, but thin it <lb/>
            of no consequence whether others are ruled justly or not :1 and <lb/>
            this is absurd except where there are beings which nature in­ <lb/>
            tended to rule, and others which as naturally obey. And there­ <lb/>
            fore, since this is the case, no one ought to assume it over all in <lb/>
            general, but over those only who are the proper objects of it ;2 <lb/>
            just as no one should hunt men either for food or sacrifice, but <note type="footnote">above all nations in the world, by the nice gradation, as well as by the <lb/>

            be very happy in itself, while it enjoys a good <lb/>

            evident therefore that all the business of war is to be con­ <lb/>
            sidered as commendable, not as a final end, but as the means <lb/>
            of procuring it. It is the duty of a good legs­ <lb/>
            lator to examine carefully into his state, and the <lb/>
            nature of man, and every community, and to see <lb/>

            which results from it. In this respect some laws and customs <lb/>
            differ from others. It is also the duty of a legislator, if he <lb/>
            has any neighbouring states, to consider in what manner he <lb/>
            shall oppose each of them, or how he shall conduct himself <lb/>
            suitably to each. But as to what should be the final end at <lb/>

          <p>WE will now speak to those who, while they agree that a <lb/>
            life of virtue is most eligible, yet differ in the use of it, <lb/>
            addressing ourselves to both these parties ; for <lb/>
             <lb/>
            there are some who disapprove of all political <lb/>
            governments, and think that the life of one who is <lb/>
            really free is different from the life of a citizen, <lb/>
            Different <lb/>
            opinions as to <lb/>
            complete <lb/>
            freedom. <lb/>
            and of all others most eligible: while others, again, think that <lb/>
            the life of a citizen is the best; and that it is impossible for him <lb/>
            who does nothing to be well employed; but that virtuous <lb/>
            activity and happiness are the same thing. Now both parties <lb/>
            in some particulars say what is right, in others what is wrong ; <lb/>
            thus, it is true that the life of a freeman is better than the life <lb/>
            of a slave, for a slave, as a slave, is employed in nothing <lb/>
            noble; for the common servile employments which he is com­ <lb/>
            manded to perform have nothing honourable in them. But, <lb/>
            on the other hand, it is not true that a submission <lb/>
            to every sort of government is slavery; for the <lb/>
            government of freemen differs not less from the <lb/>
            Not all sub. <lb/>
            mission it <lb/>
            slavery.</p><pb n="238"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> [BOOK VII. </note> government of slaves, than slavery and freedom differ from <lb/>
            each other in their nature; and how they differ has been <lb/>
            already mentioned in our first book.1 To prefer idleness to <lb/>
            activity is also wrong, for happiness consists in action, and <lb/>
            many noble ends are produced by the actions of the just and <lb/>
            wise. From what we have already determined on this subject, <lb/>
            some one probably may think, that supreme power is of all <lb/>
            things best, for thus is a man enabled to perform very many <lb/>
            useful services. So that he who can obtain this power ought <lb/>
            not to give it up to another, but rather to seize it: and, for <lb/>
            this purpose, the father should have no attention or regard for <lb/>
            his son, or the son for his father, or friend for friend; for <lb/>
            what is best is most eligible: but to be in prosperity is the <lb/>
            best. What these persons advance might probably be true, <lb/>
            if the supreme good were certainly theirs who plunder and use <lb/>
            violence to others. But it is most unlikely that it should be <lb/>
            so; for it is a mere false supposition: for it does not follow, <lb/>
            that their actions are honourable who thus assume the supreme <lb/>
            power over others, unless they are by nature as superior to <lb/>
            them as a man to a woman, a father to a child, a master to a <lb/>
            slave. So that he who so far forsakes the path of virtue can <lb/>
            never return back so far as he has departed from it. For <lb/>
            amongst equals whatever is fair and just ought to be recipro­ <lb/>
            cal ; for this is equal and right; but that equals should not <lb/>
            share with equals, or like with like, is contrary to nature; and <lb/>
            Who is by <lb/>
            nature fitted <lb/>
            to rule. <lb/>
            whatever is contrary to nature is not right. If, <lb/>
            therefore, there is any one superior to the rest of <lb/>
            the community in virtue and abilities for active <lb/>
            life, him it is proper to follow, and him it is right to obey: <lb/>
            but he must have not virtue alone, but also the power according <lb/>
            to which he may be capable of acting. If, then, we are right <lb/>
            in what we have now said, it follows, that happiness consists <lb/>
            in virtuous activity, and that with respect to the state, <lb/>
            'as well as to the individual, an active life is the best. Not <lb/>
            that an active life must necessarily refer to other persons,3 as <note type="footnote"> 1 See book i. chaps. 5, 6, and 7. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The two imaginary disputants concerning virtue are evidently partly <lb/>
            right and partly wrong: the advocate of the contemplative life is right in <lb/>
            supposing that a life of mere contemplation is better than to rule over <lb/>
            slaves; wrong in imagining (as he would seem to imagine) that all <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχή</foreign> <lb/>
            is of necessity despotic in its nature. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 It is not true to assert that practical life needs to have reference to </note> <pb n="239"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. IV.] </note> <lb/>
            some think, or that those studies alone are practical which <lb/>
            are pursued for the sake of what results from acting. But <lb/>
            this is much more true of those self-dependent contemplations <lb/>
            and discursive energies which subsist for their own sakes. <lb/>
            For virtuous activity is their end, so that it is <lb/>
            something practical; nay, those who contrive the <lb/>
            plan which others follow are more particularly <lb/>
            In what the <lb/>
            happiness of a <lb/>
            state consists. <lb/>
            said to act, and are superior to the workmen who execute <lb/>
            their designs. But it is not necessary that states which <lb/>
            choose to have no intercourse with others should remain in­ <lb/>
            active ; for the several members thereof may have mutual in­ <lb/>
            tercourse with each other; and there are many opportunities <lb/>
            for this among the different citizens. The same thing is true <lb/>
            in like manner of every individual; for, were it otherwise, <lb/>
            neither could the God nor the universe be perfect; but neither <lb/>
            of these can have any external actions, over and above their <lb/>
            own proper energies. Hence it is evident that that very same <lb/>
            life which is happy for each individual, is happy also for the <lb/>
            state and for every member of it.</p>

          <p>As what has already been said finishes the pre­ <lb/>
            face of this subject, and as we have considered at <lb/>
            large the nature of all other states,1 it now remains <lb/>
            Constitution of <lb/>
            the ideal state. <lb/>
            that I should first say what ought to be the form laid down <lb/>
            as that of the state which is in accordance with our idea; for <lb/>
            no good state can exist without a proportionate supply of <note type="footnote">others, or that the best <foreign xml:lang="grc">διάνοιαι</foreign> lead to some result beyond themselves; <lb/>
            for the best are complete in themselves, and look to no further object. <lb/>
            So also states, though isolated, need not therefore be <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄπρακτοι</foreign>, because <lb/>
            they have few or no external relations. The deity himself has none, and <lb/>
            yet he is not without an object for his energies.-It must be remarked <lb/>
            here that the Christian religion, by unfolding the doctrine of the Blessed <lb/>
            Trinity, shows us how God, though perfect in His own nature, finds an <lb/>
            object in Himself; and by the doctrine of the Atonement, has taught us <lb/>
            further still, that God has an external object of His love in man. </note><note type="footnote"> I Aristotle here refers to the third book of this present treatise, where <lb/>
            he gives the formal cause of the best form of government. He now <lb/>
            considers its material cause (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκ</foreign> <unclear>τiναιν)</unclear>, the number of its citizens, its ter­ <lb/>
            ritory, etc. The practical character Df his inquiry is marked by the words <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μηὃὲν μέντοι ἀδύνατον</foreign>. </note> <pb n="240"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK VII. </note> <lb/>
            what is necessary. Many things therefore ought to be pre­ <lb/>
            viously laid down as objects desirable, but none of them such <lb/>
            as are impossible ; I mean, relative to the number of citizens, <lb/>
            and the extent of the territory. For as other artificers, such <lb/>
            as the weaver and the shipwright, ought to have such ma­ <lb/>
            terials as are fit for their work, (since in proportion as they are <lb/>
            better, by so much superior will the work itself necessarily <lb/>
            be;) so also ought the legislator and politician to endea­ <lb/>
            vour to procure proper materials for the business they have <lb/>
            The number of <lb/>
            the people, <lb/>
            in hand. Now the first and principal instrument <lb/>
            of the politician is the number of the people; he <lb/>
            should therefore know how many and what they <lb/>
            naturally ought to be; in like manner as to the country, how <lb/>
            large and of what kind it ought to be. Most persons think, <lb/>
            that it is necessary for a city to be large in order to be happy ;l <lb/>
            but even should this be true, still they cannot tell what is a <lb/>
            large one, and what a small one. For they estimate its great­ <lb/>
            ness according to the multitude of its inhabitants; but they <lb/>
            ought rather to look to its strength than to its numbers. For <lb/>
            a state has a certain object in view, so that the state which is <lb/>
            most able in itself to accomplish this end, this we ought to <lb/>
            consider the greatest; as a person might say that Hippocrates <lb/>
            was a greater physician, though not a greater man, than one <lb/>
            that is, of the <lb/>
            citizens. <lb/>
            who was taller than him in person. But even if <lb/>
            it were proper to determine the strength of the <lb/>
            city from the number of its inhabitants, it should <lb/>
            never be inferred from the multitude in general who may <lb/>
            happen to be in it—(for in a city there must necessarily be <lb/>
            many slaves, sojourners, and foreigners)—but from those who <lb/>
            are really part of the state, and properly constitute the mem­ <lb/>
            bers of it. A multitude of these is indeed a proof that the <lb/>
            city is large, but where a large number of mechanics dwell, <lb/>
            and but few soldiers, such a state cannot be great; for a <lb/>
            great city and a populous one are not the same thing. This <lb/>
            too is evident from the fact that it is very difficult, if not impos­ <lb/>
            sible, properly to govern a very numerous body of men; for <lb/>
            of all the states which appear well governed, we find not one <note type="footnote"> I The proper size of a city is to be judged by considering its <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔργον</foreign>, <lb/>
            namely, the making its members happy and independent, and whether it <lb/>
            is fitted to accomplish this end. </note> <pb n="241"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. IV.] </note> <lb/>
            where the rights of a citizen are laid open to the entire mul. <lb/>
            titude.I And this is also made evident by proof from the <lb/>
            nature of the thing; for as law is a certain order, <lb/>
            so good law is of course a certain good order; but <lb/>
            too large a multitude is incapable of this. For <lb/>
            It should not <lb/>
            be too large <lb/>
            nor too small; <lb/>
            this is in very truth the prerogative of that Divine Power <lb/>
            which comprehends the universe. Not but that, as quantity <lb/>
            and greatness are usually essential to beauty, the perfection <lb/>
            of a city consists in its being large, if only consistent with that <lb/>
            order already mentioned. But still there is a determinate size <lb/>
            to all cities, as well as every thing else, whether animals, <lb/>
            plants, or machines; for each of these have their proper <lb/>
            powers, if they are neither too little nor too large; but when <lb/>
            they have not their due growth, or are badly constructed,—(as <lb/>
            a ship a span long is not properly a ship, nor one of two fur­ <lb/>
            longs length, but only when it is of a fit size; for either <lb/>
            from its smallness or from its largeness, it will make all sail­ <lb/>
            ing hopeless;)—so is it with a city. One that is too small has <lb/>
            not in itself the power of self-defence, but this power is es­ <lb/>
            sential to a city : one that is too large is capable of self-defence <lb/>
            in what is necessary, in the same way as a nation, but then it <lb/>
            is not a city; for it will be very difficult to find a form of go­ <lb/>
            vernment for it. For who would choose to be the general of <lb/>
            such an unwieldy multitude, or who could be their herald but <lb/>
            a. Stentor ? The first thing therefore necessary is. <lb/>
            that a city should consist of the lowest numbers <lb/>
            which will be sufficient to enable the inhabitants <lb/>
            to live happily in their political community. And <lb/>
            but such as <lb/>
            will enable the <lb/>
            inhabitants to <lb/>
            live happily, <lb/>
            it follows, that the more the inhabitants exceed that necessary <lb/>
            number, the greater will the city be. But, as we have already <lb/>
            said, this must not be without bounds; but what is the pro­ <lb/>
            per limit of the excess,2 experience will easily show, and this <note type="footnote"> I The evil arising from having cities of too great a size is here proved <lb/>
            in two ways : 1st, practically; no well ruled cities are over large. 2nd, <lb/>

            be well and adequately superintended by human means; and when this <lb/>
            is the case, the city becomes out of all proportion. Like beauty, and like <lb/>
            the plot of a poem,—(see Poetics, chap. vii.)—a city should be as large <lb/>
            as possible, consistently with being <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐσύνοπτος</foreign>, and not so small as tc <lb/>

            experience is to be collected from the actions both of the go­ <lb/>
            vernors and the governed. Now, as it belongs to the first <lb/>
            to direct the inferior magistrates and to act as judges, it fol­ <lb/>
            lows that they can neither determine causes with justice, nor <lb/>
            issue their orders with propriety, without they know the cha­ <lb/>
            racters of their fellow-citizens: so that whenever this happens <lb/>
            to be impossible in these two particulars, the state must of <lb/>
            necessity be badly managed; for in both of them it is unjust <lb/>
            to determine too hastily, and without proper knowledge, which <lb/>
            must evidently be the case where the number of the citizens <lb/>
            is too many. Besides, it is more easy for strangers and so­ <lb/>
            journers to assume the rights of citizens, as they will easily <lb/>

            is that wherein the numbers are the greatest pos­ <lb/>
            sible, that they may be the better able to be suffi­ <lb/>
            cient in themselves, while they are not too large to be under <lb/>
            the eye of the magistrates. And thus let us determine the <lb/>
            extent of a city.</p>

          <p>The best state <lb/>
            would be one <lb/>
            self-dependent <lb/>
            for provisions;</p>
          <p>THE above may readily be applied to a country ; <lb/>
            for as to what soil it should have, it is clear that <lb/>
            every one will praise it in proportion as it is suf­ <lb/>
            ficient in itself. For which purpose such a country <lb/>
            must of necessity supply its inhabitants with all the necessaries <lb/>
            of life; for it is the having these in plenty, without any want, <lb/>
            and of adequate <lb/>
            extent. <lb/>
            which makes them content. As to its extent, it <lb/>
            should be such as may enable the inhabitants to <lb/>
            live at their ease with freedom and temperance. <lb/>
            Whether we have done right or wrong in fixing this limit to the <lb/>
            territory, shall be considered more minutely hereafter,1. when <lb/>
            we come particularly to inquire into property, and as to the <lb/>
            amount of fortune requisite, and how and in what manner a <note type="footnote"> To this end it is necessary that all the citizens should be known. This <lb/>

            ought to be the limits of national wealth; but in the work as it now <lb/>

            by Aristotle in his Politics, which are not any where answered; which <lb/>

            man ought to employ it. For many doubts are started as to <lb/>
            this question, while men strive to bring it on either side to an <lb/>
            excess, the one of severity, the other of indulgence. What <lb/>
            the situation of the country should be, is not difficult to de­ <lb/>
            termine ; but in some particulars respecting this point, we <lb/>
            ought to be advised by those who are skilful in military af­ <lb/>
            fairs. It should be difficult of access to an ene­ <lb/>
            my, but easy of egress to the inhabitants; and, <lb/>
            Its situation. <lb/>
            as we said that the number of inhabitants ought to be such <lb/>
            as can come under the eye of the magistrate, so should it be <lb/>
            with the country; for by that means the country is easily <lb/>
            defended. As to the position of the city, if one could place <lb/>
            it to one's wish, it ought to lie well both for sea and land. <lb/>
            One situation which it ought to have has been already men­ <lb/>
            tioned ; for it should be so placed as easily to give assistance <lb/>
            to all parts, and also to receive the necessaries of life from <lb/>
            every quarter; as also it should be accessible for the carriage <lb/>
            of wood, or any other materials of the like kind which may <lb/>
            happen to be in the country.</p>

          <p>BUT with respect to placing a city in communica­ <lb/>
            tion with the sea, there are some who have many <lb/>
            doubts whether it is serviceable or hurtful to well- <lb/>
            Drawbacks of <lb/>
            a maritime po­ <lb/>
            sition. <lb/>
            regulated states ;l for they say, that it becomes the resort of <lb/>
            persons brought up under a different system of government, <lb/>
            and so is far from serviceable to the state, towards the pre­ <lb/>
            servation of law and the increase of population ; for a multi­ <lb/>
            tude of merchants must necessarily arise from trading back­ <lb/>
            wards and forwards upon the seas, which will hinder the <lb/>
            city from being well governed. But if this incon­ <lb/>
            venience does not arise, it is evident that it is better <lb/>
            Its advantages. <lb/>
            both for safety, and also for the acquisition of the necessaries <lb/>
            of life, that both the city and the country should be near the <note type="footnote"> 1 Intercourse with foreign nations is apt to create a desire of change, <lb/>
            and to bring into the country a large admixture of foreigners. But if <lb/>
            none of these ill effects arise, it is better on other accounts for a state to <lb/>
            have the sea within reach, for the sake of a ready supply of necessary ar­ <lb/>
            tides; besides, it affords a double chance in time of war. The foreign <lb/>
            traffic, however, should be co :fined as nearly as possible to the necessaries <lb/>
            of life. </note><note type="footnote"> R2 </note> <pb n="244"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK VII. </note> <lb/>
            sea. For in order to bear up against wars, it is necessary to <lb/>
            be able to bring up forces both by land and by sea; and in <lb/>
            order to damage the invaders, if it is not possible to do so <lb/>
            both ways, still either course is available if they possess both. <lb/>
            It is also necessary for them to import from abroad what does <lb/>
            not grow in their own country, and to export the superfluous <lb/>
            productions; for a city ought to traffic to supply its own wants, <lb/>
            and not the wants of others: for those who themselves furnish <lb/>
            an open market for every one, do it for the sake of gain ; but <lb/>
            as to the city which ought not to take part in this ambitious <lb/>
            trading, it ought not to encourage the growth of such a mart. <lb/>
            Now, as we see that many places and cities have docks and <lb/>
            harbours lying very convenient for the city, while those who <lb/>
            frequent them have no communication with the citadel, and <lb/>
            yet they are not too far off, but are surrounded by walls and <lb/>
            other such-like fortifications, it is evident, that, if any good <lb/>
            arises from such an intercourse, the city will perceive it, but <lb/>
            if any thing hurtful, it will be easy to restrain it by a law; <lb/>
            declaring and deputing who ought to have a trading inter- <lb/>
            Naval power, <lb/>
            how great. <lb/>
            course with each other, and who ought not. As <lb/>
            to a naval power, it is by no means doubtful that <lb/>
            it is necessary to have one to a certain degree; <lb/>
            and this not only for the sake of the city itself, but also be­ <lb/>
            cause it may be necessary to appear formidable to some of the <lb/>
            neighbouring states, or to be able to assist them as well by <lb/>
            sea as by land. But in order to know how great that power <lb/>
            should be, we must look into the condition of the state, and if <lb/>
            it shall show such vigour as to enaole her to take the lead of <lb/>
            other communities, it is necessary that her force should cor­ <lb/>
            respond with her actions. As for that multitude of people <lb/>
            which arises around a maritime power, they are by no means <lb/>
            necessary to a state, nor ought they to make a part of the <lb/>
            citizens.1 For the mariners and infantry who have the chief <note type="footnote"> 1 " Maritime power was so grossly abused by the ancient republics, that <lb/>
            it is continually branded by moralists as producing vile and versatile <lb/>

            engagement. But when there are many of the surrounding <lb/>
            inhabitants and husbandmen, there they will always have a <lb/>
            number of sailors: as we now see happens to some states ; at <lb/>
            Heraclea, for instance, where they man many triremes, though <lb/>
            the extent of their city is much more easily measured than <lb/>
            some others. And thus let it suffice that we have determined <lb/>
            concerning the country, the port, the city, the sea, and a <lb/>
            maritime power: as to the number of the citizens, we have <lb/>
            already said what the limit ought to be.</p>

          <p>WE now proceed to point out of what natural dis­ <lb/>
            position the citizens ought to be: but this surely <lb/>
            any one would easily perceive who casts his eye <lb/>

            of citizens. <lb/>
            over those states of Greece which bear a high repute, and in­ <lb/>
            deed over all the habitable world, as it is divided among the <lb/>
            nations. Those who live in cold countries,1 as the north of <lb/>
            Europe, are full of courage, but wanting in understanding and <lb/>
            in art; therefore they remain free for a long time; but, not <lb/>
            being versed in the political science, they cannot reduce their <lb/>
            neighbours under their power. But the Asiatics, whose un­ <lb/>
            derstandings are quick, and who are conversant in the arts, are <lb/>
            deficient in courage ; and therefore they continue to be always <lb/>
            conquered, and the slaves of others. But the <lb/>
            Greeks, placed as it were between these two parts, <lb/>
            partake of the nature of both, so as to be at the <lb/>
            same time both courageous and intellectual; for <lb/>

            tions of sailors, being naturally directed against foreign enemies, are less <lb/>

            enjoyed by Greece in comparison with the countries which lie far to the <lb/>

            2000 years, to the whole of Europe, except perhaps the very northernmost <lb/>
            parts. For some remarks on the advantageous influence of the temperate <lb/>
            zone in the formation of national character, the reader is referred to Pro­ <lb/>

            which reason Greece continues free, and governed in the best <lb/>
            manner possible, and capable of commanding the whole world, <lb/>
            could it be combined into one system of policy.1 The races <lb/>
            of the Greeks have the very same difference among them­ <lb/>
            selves : for part of them possess but one of these qualities, <lb/>
            whereas in the other they are both happily blended together. <lb/>
            Hence it is evident, that those persons ought to be both intel­ <lb/>
            ligent and courageous who will be readily obedient to a legis- <lb/>
            The military. <lb/>
            later, whose object is virtue.As to what some <lb/>
            persons say, that the military must be friendly <lb/>
            towards those whom they know, but severe towards those whom <lb/>
            they know not, it is courage which makes any one lovely; <lb/>
            for that is the faculty of the soul on account of which we <lb/>
            most admire. As a proof of this, our resentment rises higher <lb/>
            against our friends and acquaintance than against those whom <lb/>
            we know not: for which reason Archilochus, properly accus­ <lb/>
            ing his friends, addresses the irascible part of his soul, and <lb/>
            says, " Art thou not strangled by these friends ? " The spirit <lb/>
            of freedom and command also is inherited by all who are of <lb/>
            this disposition; for courage is commanding and invincible. <lb/>
            It also is not right for any one to say, that you should be <lb/>
            severe to those you know not; for this behaviour is proper <lb/>
            for no one: nor are those who are of a noble disposition harsh <lb/>
            in their manners, excepting only towards insurers ; and when <lb/>
            they are particularly so, it is, as has been already said, against <lb/>
            their friends, when they think they have injured them. And <lb/>
            this is agreeable to reason: for when those who think they <lb/>
            ought to receive a favour from any one do not receive it, <lb/>
            beside the injury done them, they consider what they are <lb/>
            deprived of. Hence the saying, <lb/>
            " Cruel the wars of brethren are;" <note type="footnote"> 1 " Aristotle maintained in a former chapter that a commonwealth had <lb/>
            its limits in point of populousness; and endeavoured to point out with suf­ <lb/>
            ficient accuracy for all practical purposes what these limits were. In the <lb/>
            passage before us he says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">γένος 'Ελλήνων δυνάμενον ἄρχειν πάντων, <lb/>
            μιἄς</foreign> Tvyxavov <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολιτείας</foreign>, ' That the Greeks would be able to command <lb/>
            all nations, if they had the same form of government.' In fact, the ex­ <lb/>
            treme difference in the forms of government in Greece, was the great <lb/>
            obstacle to their national union in one political confederacy ; which is the <lb/>
            thing here intended by Aristotle; since, according to the principles above <lb/>
            explained, Greece was far too populous to be happily united in one com­ <lb/>

            and this, <lb/>
            " Those who have greatly loved do greatly hate." <lb/>
            And thus we have nearly determined how many the members <lb/>
            of a state ought to be, and what their natural disposition; as <lb/>
            also how large, and of what sort, their country should be; <lb/>
            and I say " nearly," because we ought not to require the same <lb/>

          <p>As in other naturally constituted bodies, those <lb/>
            things are not admitted to be parts of them with­ <lb/>
            out which the whole would not exist; so also it is <lb/>
            evident, that in a political state every thing that <lb/>
            Many things <lb/>
            necessary to a <lb/>
            state, but are <lb/>
            not parts of it. <lb/>
            is necessary thereunto is not to be considered as a part of it, <lb/>
            nor of any other community, from whence one genus is made. <lb/>
            For one thing ought to be common and the same to the com­ <lb/>
            munity, whether they partake of it equally or unequally, as, <lb/>
            for instance, food, land, or the like; but when one thing is for <lb/>
            the benefit of one person, and another for the benefit of an­ <lb/>
            other, in this there is nothing like a community, excepting <lb/>
            that one makes it and the other uses it. As, for instance, <lb/>
            between any instrument employed in making any work, and <lb/>
            the workmen, as there is nothing common between the house <lb/>
            and the builder, but the art of the builder is employed on the <lb/>
            house. Thus property is necessary for states, but <lb/>
            property is no part of the state, though many <lb/>
            species of it have life ; but a city is a community <lb/>
            Property a case <lb/>
            in point. <lb/>
            of equals, for the purpose of enjoying the best life possible. <lb/>
            But happiness is the best: and this consists in the perfect <lb/>
            practice of virtuous energies. As, therefore, some persons <lb/>
            have great, others little or no share in this, it is evident, that <lb/>
            this is the cause of the difference which exists between the <lb/>
            different cities and communities there are to be found; for <lb/>
            while each of these seeks after what is best by various and <lb/>
            different means, they give rise to different modes of living and <lb/>
            different forms of government. We are now to consider what <lb/>
            those things are without which a city cannot possibly exist <lb/>

            &lt;ary to a state. <lb/>
            1. Food. <lb/>
            2. Arts. <lb/>
            3. Arms. <lb/>
            rent in it. And this we shall more plainly under­ <lb/>
            stand, if we know the number of things necessary <lb/>
            to a city. First, the inhabitants must have food i <lb/>
            secondly, arts, for many instruments are necessary <lb/>
            in life: thirdly, arms, for it is necessary that the <lb/>
            community should have an armed force within themselves, both <lb/>
            to support their government against the disaffected of them­ <lb/>
            selves, and also to defend it from those who seek to attack it <lb/>
            4. Revenue. <lb/>
            5. Religion. <lb/>
            6. Courts. <lb/>
            from without: fourthly, a certain revenue, as well <lb/>
            for the internal necessities of the state, as for the <lb/>
            business of war: fifthly, and indeed chief of all, <lb/>
            the care of the service of the gods: sixthly in <lb/>
            order, but most necessary of all, a court to determine both <lb/>
            civil and criminal causes. These things are matters which are <lb/>
            absolutely required, so to speak, in every state; for a city is <lb/>
            a number of people, not accidentally met together, but with a <lb/>
            purpose of insuring to themselves sufficient independency and <lb/>
            self-protection ; and if any thing necessary for these purposes <lb/>
            is wanting, it is impossible that in such a situation these ends <lb/>
            can be obtained. It is necessary therefore that a city should <lb/>
            be composed with reference to these various trades ; for this <lb/>
            purpose a proper number of husbandmen are necessary to <lb/>
            procure food; as also artificers and soldiers, and rich men, and <lb/>
            priests, and judges, 1 to determine what is necessary and be­ <lb/>
            neficial.</p>

          <p>Ought all to <lb/>
            share these <lb/>
            employments, <lb/>
            or not ?</p>
          <p>HAVING determined thus far, it remains that we <lb/>
            consider whether all ought to share these different <lb/>
            employments; (for it is possible for the same <lb/>
            persons always to be husbandmen, artificers, <lb/>
            judges, or counsellors ;) or whether different persons ought to <lb/>
            be appointed to each of those employments which we have <lb/>
            already mentioned; or whether some of them should be appro­ <lb/>
            priated to particular persons, and others common to all. But <lb/>
            this does not take place in every state; for, as we have already <lb/>
            said, it is possible that all may be shared by all, or not by all, <note type="footnote"> I Under the term " judges," our author intends to comprehend, not <lb/>
            merely those who take cognizance of matters of contention between indi. <lb/>
            viduals, but also those who are engaged in questions of public expediency. </note> <pb n="249"/>

            but only by some; and this makes one government to differ <lb/>
            from another: for in democracies the whole community par­ <lb/>
            takes of every thing, but in oligarchies it is different.</p>
          <p>Since we are inquiring what is the best go­ <lb/>
            vernment possible, and as it is admitted to be that <lb/>
            in which the citizens are happy, and that, as we <lb/>
            have already said, it is impossible to obtain hap- <lb/>
            Trades and <lb/>
            arts to be for­ <lb/>
            bidden to the <lb/>
            noble. <lb/>
            piness without virtue; it follows, that in the best governed <lb/>
            states, where the citizens are really men of intrinsic and not <lb/>
            relative goodness, none of them should be permitted to exer­ <lb/>
            cise any low mechanical employment or trainee as being <lb/>
            ignoble and destructive to virtue: neither should they who <lb/>
            are destined for office be husbandmen; for leisure is necessary <lb/>
            in order to improve in virtue, and to perform the duty which <lb/>
            they owe to the state. But since the soldiery, and <lb/>
            the senate which consults, and the judge who de­ <lb/>
            cides on matters of law, are evidently necessary to <lb/>
            the community, shall they be allotted to different <lb/>
            Different qua­ <lb/>
            lifications for <lb/>
            a soldier, sena­ <lb/>
            tor, and judge. <lb/>
            persons, or shall they both be given to the same person ? This <lb/>
            too is clear: for in some cases the same persons may execute <lb/>
            them, in others they should be different; for where the dif­ <lb/>
            ferent employments require different abilities, as when prac­ <lb/>
            tical wisdom is wanting for one, but energy for the other, <lb/>
            there they should be allotted to different persons. But where <lb/>
            it is evidently impossible that those who are able to do violence <lb/>
            and to impede matters, should always be under command, <lb/>
            there these different employments should be trusted to one <lb/>
            person; for those who have arms in their hands have it in <lb/>
            their option whether the supreme power shall remain or no. <lb/>
            It remains, then, that we should intrust the go­ <lb/>
            vernment to these two parties; but not at the <lb/>
            same time, but as nature directs; what requires <lb/>
            When and how <lb/>
            they may be <lb/>
            combined. <lb/>
            energy, to the young; what requires practical wisdom, to the <lb/>
            old. Thus each will be allotted the part for which they are <lb/>
            fit according to their different merits. It is also necessary <lb/>
            that the landed property should belong to these men; for it <lb/>
            is necessary that the citizens should be rich, and these are the <note type="footnote"> I In the best state, happiness is the chief object. This cannot be at­ <lb/>
            tained except by individual virtue. And virtue, according tc Aristotle, <lb/>
            cannot belong to any one who leads a life of any servile kind, as such an <lb/>
            one can have no leisure for acquiring virtue. </note> <pb n="250"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK VII. </note> <lb/>
            men proper for citizens; for no low mechanic ought to be <lb/>
            admitted to the rights of a citizen, nor any other sort of <lb/>
            people, whose employment is not productive of virtue. This <lb/>
            is evident from our first principle ; for to be happy it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary to be virtuous; and no one should say that a city is <lb/>
            happy so long as he considers only one part of its citizens, but <lb/>
            he must look to the whole body. It is evident, therefore, that <lb/>
            the landed property should belong to these, though it may be <lb/>
            necessary for them to have for husbandmen, either slaves, bar- <lb/>
            The order of <lb/>
            priests to be <lb/>
            distinct. <lb/>
            barians, or servants. There remains of the classes <lb/>
            of the people already enumerated, one only, that <lb/>
            of the priests; for these evidently compose a rank <lb/>
            by themselves; for the priests are by no means to be reckoned <lb/>
            amongst the husbandmen or the mechanics; for it is fitting <lb/>
            that the gods should be reverenced by the citizens. And since <lb/>
            the itizens have been divided into two orders, namely, the <lb/>
            military and the council, and since it is proper to offer due <lb/>
            worship to the gods, and since it is necessary that those who <lb/>
            are employed in their service should have nothing else to do, <lb/>
            let those who are ripe in years be set aside for the business of <lb/>
            the priesthood. We have now shown what is necessary to <lb/>
            the existence of a city, and of what parts it consists; and that <lb/>
            husbandmen, mechanics, and the class of mercenary servants <lb/>
            are necessary to a city; but that the parts of it are the sol­ <lb/>
            diery and the councillors. Each of these also is separated <lb/>
            from the other; the one indeed always, but the other only in <lb/>
            part.</p>

          <p>IT seems neither now nor very lately to have become known <lb/>
            to those philosophers who have made politics their study, that <lb/>
            a city ought to be divided by families into different orders of <lb/>
            men; and that the husbandmen and soldiers should be kept <lb/>
            separate from each other; a custom which is even to this day <lb/>
            preserved in Egypt and in Crete also; Sesostris having <lb/>
            founded it in Egypt, Minos in Crete. The common meals <lb/>
            seem also to have been an ancient regulation, and to have <lb/>
            been established in Crete during the reign of Minos, and in a <lb/>
            still more remote period in Italy. For it is said by those who <lb/>
            are the best versed in the annals of the people who dwell <pb n="251"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. X.] </note> <lb/>
            there, that one Italus was ring of Ænotria,1 and that from <lb/>
            him the people changed their names, and were called Italians <lb/>
            instead of Ænotrians, and that part of Europe was called <lb/>
            Italy, which is bounded by the Scylletic gulf on the one side, <lb/>
            and the Lametic2 on the other, the distance between which is <lb/>
            about half a day's journey. Now this Italus, as they relate, <lb/>
            made husbandmen of the JEnotrians, who were formerly <lb/>
            shepherds, and gave them other laws, and especially was the <lb/>
            first who established the common meals; for which reason <lb/>
            some of his descendants still use them, and observe some of <lb/>
            his laws. The Opici inhabit that part which lies towards the <lb/>
            Tyrrhenian Sea, who both now are and formerly were called <lb/>
            Ausonians. The Chaonians inhabited the part toward Iapy­ <lb/>
            gia and the Ionian Sea, which is called the Syrtis. These <lb/>
            Chaonians were descended from the Ænotrians. Hence arose <lb/>
            the custom of common meals, but the separation of the citizens <lb/>
            into different families came from Egypt: for the reign of <lb/>
            Sesostris is of much higher antiquity than that of Minos. As <lb/>
            we ought to think that most other things were often found <lb/>
            out in a long time, nay, times without number—(for reason <lb/>
            teaches us that want would make men first invent that which <lb/>
            was necessary, and, when that was obtained, then those things <lb/>
            which were requisite for the conveniencies and ornament of <lb/>
            life )-so should we conclude the same with respect to a <lb/>
            political state. But every thing in Egypt is a proof of the <lb/>
            great antiquity of these customs; for the people of Egypt seem <lb/>
            to be the most ancient of all others, and yet they have ac­ <lb/>
            quired laws and political order. We should therefore make <lb/>
            a proper use of what is told us concerning states, and en­ <lb/>
            deavour to find out what others have omitted.3 We have <note type="footnote"> 1Comp. Virgo Æn. i. 1. 530 : <lb/>

            The husband­ <lb/>
            men a separate <lb/>
            order. <lb/>
            already said, that the landed property ought to <lb/>
            belong to the military and those who partake of <lb/>
            the government of the state; and that therefore <lb/>
            the husbandmen should be a separate order of people ; and <lb/>
            how large, and of what nature, the country ought to be. We <lb/>
            will therefore first treat of the division of the land, and of <lb/>
            the husbandmen, how many, and of what sort they ought to <lb/>
            be; since we by no means hold that property ought to be <lb/>
            common, as some persons have said, 1 but only by way of friend­ <lb/>
            ship it should be made common, so as to let no citizen want <lb/>
            subsistence. As to common meals, it is in general agreed <lb/>
            that they are proper in well-regulated cities; but on account <lb/>
            of what reasons we also approve of them shall be mentioned <lb/>
            hereafter. They are things of which all the citizens ought to <lb/>
            partake; but it will not be easy for the poor, out of what is <lb/>
            their own, to contribute as much as is enjoined, and to supply <lb/>
            their own house besides. The expense also of religious <lb/>
            The land to be <lb/>
            divided into <lb/>
            public and <lb/>
            private. <lb/>
            worship should be defrayed by the whole state. Of <lb/>
            necessity therefore the land ought to be divided <lb/>
            into two parts, one of which should belong to the <lb/>
            community in general, the other to the individuals <lb/>
            separately. Each of these parts should again be subdi­ <lb/>
            vided into two: and half of that which belongs to the public <lb/>
            should be appropriated to maintain the worship of the gods, <lb/>
            The situation <lb/>
            of that which <lb/>
            is in private <lb/>
            hands. <lb/>
            the other half to support the common meals. Half <lb/>
            of that which belongs to the individuals should be <lb/>
            at the extremity of the country, the other half <lb/>
            near the city; so that these two portions being <lb/>
            allotted to each person, all would partake of land in both <lb/>
            places, which would be both equal and right; and induce <lb/>
            them to act more in concert in any war with their neighbours. <lb/>
            For when the land is not divided in this manner, one party <lb/>
            neglects the inroads of the enemy on the borders, the other <lb/>
            makes it a matter of too much consequence, and more than is <lb/>
            fair. For which reason, in some places there is a law, which <lb/>
            forbids the inhabitants of the borders to have any vote in the <note type="footnote"> upon the constitutions of the various states of Greece. His remark above, <lb/>
            to the effect that most things have been invented and have been suffered <lb/>
            to fall into disuse, will remind the reader of the wise saying of Solomon. <lb/>

            council when they are debating upon a war made against <lb/>
            them, as their private interest might prevent their voting <lb/>
            impartially. Thus, therefore, the country ought to be divided, <lb/>
            and for the reasons before mentioned. But those <lb/>
            who are to act as husbandmen, if choice be <lb/>
            allowed, should by all means be slaves, nor all of <lb/>
            the same nation, nor men of any spirit: for thus <lb/>
            The tillers of <lb/>
            the ground <lb/>
            should be kept <lb/>
            as serfs. <lb/>
            they will probably be industrious in their business, and safe <lb/>
            from attempting any novelties. Next to these, barbarian <lb/>
            servants are to be preferred, similar in natural disposition to <lb/>
            those we have already mentioned. Of these, some who are to <lb/>
            cultivate the private property of the individual, should belong <lb/>
            to that individual, and those who are to cultivate the public ter­ <lb/>
            ritory should belong to the public. In what manner these <lb/>
            slaves ought to be used, and for what reason it is very proper <lb/>
            that they should have liberty held out to them as a reward <lb/>
            for their services, we will mention hereafter.</p>

          <p>WE have already mentioned, that the city should communi­ <lb/>
            cate both with the continent and the sea, and with the adjoin­ <lb/>
            ing territory equally, as much as possible. There <lb/>
            are these four things of which we should be par­ <lb/>
            ticularly desirous in the position of the city with <lb/>
            respect to itself. In the first place, as to health, <lb/>
            as the first thing necessary. Now a citv which <lb/>
            The situation <lb/>
            of the city <lb/>
            should be <lb/>
            chosen with <lb/>
            regard to, <lb/>
            1. Health. <lb/>
            <lb/>
            fronts the east and receives the winds which blow from thence <lb/>
            is esteemed most healthful; next to this a northern position <lb/>
            is to be preferred, as best in winter. It should next be con­ <lb/>
            trived, that it may have a proper situation for the business of <lb/>
            government, and for defence in war; that in war the citizens <lb/>
            may have easy access to it, but that it may be difficult of access <lb/>
            to the enemy, and hardly to be taken. In the next place, that <lb/>
            there may be a suitable supply of water and rivers near at <lb/>
            hand; but if those cannot be found, very large and immense <lb/>
            cisterns must be prepared to save rain water, so that there <lb/>
            may be no want of it when cut off from the country in time of <lb/>
            war. And as great care should be taken of the health of the <lb/>
            inhabitants, the first thing to be attended to is that the city <lb/>
            should have a good situation and a good position ; the second <pb n="254"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK VII. </note> <lb/>
            is, that they may have good water to drink, and this must not <lb/>
            be taken care of as a secondary matter. For what we chiefly <lb/>
            and most frequently use for the support of the body, must <lb/>
            principally contribute to its health; and this is the influence <lb/>
            which the air and water naturally have. For this reason, in <lb/>
            all wise governments, the water ought to be appropriated to <lb/>
            different purposes if they are not equally good; and, if there <lb/>
            is not a plenty of both kinds of water, that which is to drink <lb/>
            should be separated from that which is for other uses. As to <lb/>
            2. Strength of <lb/>
            position. <lb/>
            fortified places, what is suitable to some govern­ <lb/>
            ments is not equally suited to all; as, for instance, <lb/>
            a lofty citadel is proper for a monarchy and an <lb/>
            oligarchy, but a city built upon a plain suits a democracy; <lb/>
            neither of these for an aristocracy, but rather many strong <lb/>
            places. As to the form of private houses, those are thought <lb/>
            to be best, and most useful for their different purposes, which <lb/>
            are separate from each other, and built in the modern manner, <lb/>
            after the plan of Hippodamus. But for safety in time of war, <lb/>
            on the contrary, they should be built as they formerly were; <lb/>
            for they were such that strangers could not easily find their <lb/>
            way out of them, and the method of access to them such as an <lb/>
            enemy who assailed them could with difficulty find. A city, <lb/>
            therefore, should have both these sorts of buildings; and this <lb/>
            may easily be contrived, if any one will so regulate them as <lb/>
            the planters do their rows of vines ; not making the buildings <lb/>
            throughout the city detached, but only in some parts of it; <lb/>
            for thus elegance and safety will be equally consulted. With <lb/>
            Fortification <lb/>
            necessary. <lb/>
            respect to walls, those who say that a courageous <lb/>
            people ought not to have any, form their ideas <lb/>
            from antiquated notions ; particularly, as we may <lb/>
            see those cities which pride themselves herein confuted by <lb/>
            facts. It is indeed disreputable for those who are equal, or <lb/>
            nearly equal, to the enemy, to endeavour to save themselves <lb/>
            by taking refuge within their walls; but since it is possible, <lb/>
            and very often happens, that those who make the attack are <lb/>
            too powerful for the courage of those few who oppose them to <lb/>
            resist, if they would be saved, and not encounter much suffer­ <lb/>
            ing and insolence, it must be thought the part of a good soldier <lb/>
            to make the fortification of the walls such as to give the best <lb/>
            protection, more especially since so many missile weapons and <lb/>
            machines have been ingeniously invented to besiege cities. In- <pb n="255"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. XII.] </note> <lb/>
            deed to neglect surrounding a city with a wall would be similar <lb/>
            to choosing a country which is easy of access to an enemy, or <lb/>
            levelling the eminences of it; or as though an individual should <lb/>
            not have a wall to his house, as if those who dwelt in it were <lb/>
            likely to be cowards. Nor should this be left out of our ac­ <lb/>
            count, that those who have a city surrounded with walls, may <lb/>
            act both ways, either as if it had, or as if it had not; but <lb/>
            where it has not, they cannot do this. If this be true, not <lb/>
            only is it necessary to have walls, but care must be taken that <lb/>
            they may be a proper ornament to the city, as well as a de­ <lb/>
            fence in time of war, not only according to the old methods, <lb/>
            but also according to modern improvements. For as those <lb/>
            who make offensive war seek by what means they can gain <lb/>
            advantages over their adversaries, so for those who are upon <lb/>
            the defensive, some means have been already found out, and <lb/>
            others they ought scientifically to devise, in order to defend <lb/>
            themselves; for people seldom attempt to attack those who are <lb/>
            well prepared.</p>

          <p>AND as it is necessary that the citizens in general <lb/>
            should eat at public tables, and as it is necessary <lb/>
            that the walls should have bulwarks and towers <lb/>
            Syssities on <lb/>
            the ramparts. <lb/>
            at proper distances, it is evident that the nature of the case <lb/>
            demands that they prepare some of the public tables in the <lb/>
            towers. And these indeed any one could arrange for this <lb/>
            purpose ornamentally. But the temples for public <lb/>
            worship, and the hall for the public tables of the <lb/>
            Temples. <lb/>
            chief magistrates, ought to be built in proper places, and con­ <lb/>
            tiguous, except those temples which the law or the oracle from <lb/>
            the god orders to be separate from all other buildings. And <lb/>
            the site of these should be so conspicuous, that they may have <lb/>
            an eminence which will give them the advantage of distinc­ <lb/>
            tion, and this, too, near that part of the city which is best for­ <lb/>
            titled. Adjoining to this place there ought to <lb/>
            be a large square, like that which they call in <lb/>
            Thessaly the square of freedom, in which nothing <lb/>
            An open square <lb/>
            for the nobles. <lb/>
            is permitted to be bought or sold; into which no low mechanic <lb/>
            or husbandman, or any such person, should be permitted to <lb/>
            enter, unless commanded by the magistrates. It <lb/>
            will also be an ornament to this place, if the gym- <lb/>
            Gymnastic ex­ <lb/>
            ercises. <pb n="256"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK VII. </note> <lb/>
            nastic exercises of the elders are performed in it. For it is <lb/>
            proper that for the performance of these exercises the citizens <lb/>
            should be divided into distinct classes, according to their ages, <lb/>
            and that the young persons should have proper officers to be <lb/>
            with them, and that the seniors should be with the magistrates; <lb/>
            for the presence of the magistrates before their eyes would <lb/>
            Another square <lb/>
            for trade. <lb/>
            greatly inspire true modesty and ingenuous fear. <lb/>
            There ought to be another square separate from <lb/>
            this, for buying and selling, which should be so <lb/>
            situated as to be commodious for the reception of goods both <lb/>
            by sea and by land. As the citizens may be divided into ma­ <lb/>
            gistrates and priests, it is proper that the public tables of the <lb/>
            priests should be in buildings near the temples. Those of the <lb/>
            magistrates who preside over contracts, indictments, and such <lb/>
            like, and also over the markets and the public streets, should <lb/>
            be near the square, or some public way, I mean the square <lb/>
            where things are bought and sold; for we intend the other <lb/>
            for those who are at leisure, and this for necessary business.</p>
          <p>The surround­ <lb/>
            ing country.</p>
          <p>The same order which I have directed here, should <lb/>
            be observed also in the country; for there also <lb/>
            their magistrates, such as the surveyors of the <lb/>
            woods, and overseers of the grounds, must necessarily have <lb/>
            their common tables and their towers, for the purpose of pro­ <lb/>
            tection against an enemy. There ought also to be temples <lb/>
            erected at proper places, both to the gods and the heroes. <lb/>
            But it is unnecessary to dwell longer and most minutely on <lb/>
            these particulars; for it is by no means difficult to plan these <lb/>
            things, but it is rather so to carry them into execution; for <lb/>
            the theory is the child of our wishes, but the practical part <lb/>
            must depend upon fortune; for which reason let us dismiss <lb/>
            the matter without saying any thing further upon such sub­ <lb/>
            jects.</p>

          <p>The popula­ <lb/>
            tion.</p>
          <p>BUT concerning the state itself, we must say of <lb/>
            what numbers and of what sort of people it ought <lb/>
            to consist, that the state may be happy and well <lb/>
            administered. As there are two particulars on which the <lb/>
            perfection of every thing depends, one of these is, that the <lb/>
            object and end of the actions proposed should be proper; <pb n="257"/>
            <note type="footnote"> CHAP. XIII.] </note> <lb/>
            the other, to find the courses of conduct which lead to that <lb/>
            end]For it may happen that these may either agree or dis­ <lb/>
            agree with each other; for sometimes the end which men <lb/>
            propose is good, but in taking the means to obtain it they may <lb/>
            err; at other times they may have all the proper means in <lb/>
            their power, but they have proposed to themselves a bad <lb/>
            end; and sometimes they may mistake in both: as in the art <lb/>
            of medicine, physicians sometimes do not know in what con­ <lb/>
            dition the body ought to be, in order to be healthy; and <lb/>
            sometimes they do not hit well upon the means which are <lb/>
            productive of their intended aim. In every art and science, <lb/>
            therefore, we should be master of this knowledge, namely, as <lb/>
            to the proper end, and as to the means of obtaining it. Now <lb/>
            it is evident that all persons are desirous to live well, and be <lb/>
            happy; but that some have the means of so doing in their <lb/>
            own power, others not; and this either through nature or <lb/>
            fortune. For much external assistance is necessary to a happy <lb/>
            life; but less to those who are of a good, than to those who <lb/>
            are of a bad, disposition. There are others who, though they <lb/>
            have the means of happiness in their own power, do not rightly <lb/>
            seek for it. But since our proposed object is to inquire what <lb/>
            government is best, namely, that by which a state may be <lb/>
            best administered, and that state would seem best administered. <lb/>
            where the people are the happiest, it is evident <lb/>
            that the nature of happiness is a thing which <lb/>
            ought not to escape us. Now, we have already <lb/>
            What happi­ <lb/>
            ness is. <lb/>
            said in our treatise on Ethics,1 (if there be any use in what <lb/>
            we there said,) that happiness consists in the energy and per- v <lb/>
            feet practice of virtue,2 and this not relatively, but simply. I <lb/>
            mean by relatively, what is necessary in some certain circum­ <lb/>
            stances ; by simply, what is good in itself. Of the first sort <lb/>
            are just punishments and restraints in a just cause; for they <lb/>
            arise from virtue, and are necessary, and on that account are <lb/>
            virtuous: (though it is more desirable, that neither any state <lb/>
            or any individual should stand in need of such things :) but <note type="footnote"> 1Aristotle's reference is to Ethic. Nicom. book i. chap. 7. </note><note type="footnote"> 2If the excellence of the state depends on the attainment of happiness <lb/>
            by the citizens who are its members, we must then know what happiness <lb/>
            is. Now it is defined elsewhere as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνεργεία κατ' ἀρετὴν τελείαν</foreign> : and <lb/>
            these words clearly imply and suppose some external advantages. Many <lb/>
            consequently suppose that these external things constitute happiness. </note><note type="footnote"> 8 </note> <pb n="258"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK VII. </note> <lb/>
            those actions which are directed to procure either honours or <lb/>
            wealth are simply best. For the one are eligible as tending <lb/>
            to remove an evil: these actions, on the contrary, are the <lb/>
            foundation and means of producing relative good. A worthy <lb/>
            How far virtue <lb/>
            is necessary, <lb/>
            and how far <lb/>
            external goods. <lb/>
            man indeed will bear poverty, disease, and other <lb/>
            unfortunate accidents, with a noble mind, but <lb/>
            happiness consists in the contrary to these. Now <lb/>
            we have already determined in our treatise on <lb/>
            Ethics, 1 that he is a man of worth who considers what is <lb/>
            ✓ good because it is virtuous, as what is simply good: it is evi­ <lb/>
            dent, therefore, that the using these things in such a manner <lb/>
            must be worthy and simply good. This has led some persons <lb/>
            to conclude that the cause of happiness was external goods; <lb/>
            which would be as if any one should attribute to the lyre <lb/>
            itself a brilliant and noble performance, and not to the art <lb/>
            itself. It necessarily follows from what has been said, that <lb/>
            some things should be ready at hand and others procured by <lb/>
            the legislator: for which reason, we earnestly wish that the <lb/>
            constitution of the state may have those things which are <lb/>
            under the dominion of fortune-( for over some things we <lb/>
            admit her to be supreme) ;-but for a state to be worthy and <lb/>
            great is not the work of fortune only, but of knowledge and <lb/>
            deliberate choice as well. But for a state to be worthy, it is <lb/>
            necessary that those citizens who are in the administration <lb/>
            should be worthy also: but in our city every citizen has a <lb/>
            share in the state. And so we must consider how a man may <lb/>
            become worthy. For if the whole body could become worthy, <lb/>
            and not some individuals only, it would be more desirable; for <lb/>
            then it would follow, that what might be done by one, might <lb/>
            Influence of <lb/>
            nature, habit, <lb/>
            and reason on <lb/>
            mankind. <lb/>
            be done by all.2 Men are worthy and good in <lb/>
            three ways; and these are, by nature, by custom, <lb/>
            by reason. In the first place, each one ought to <lb/>
            be born a man, and not any other animal; that is <lb/>
            to say, he ought to be of a particular disposition both in body <lb/>
            and soul. But as to some things, it avails not to be born with <note type="footnote"> 1Aristotle refers here to the Nicom. Ethics, book ii. chap. iv. </note><note type="footnote"> 2It is better for the state that its citizens should possess these virtues <lb/>
            in their individual, than in their collective, capacity. For upon their <lb/>
            possession individually it will soon follow that they will be in the pos­ <lb/>
            session of all. A somewhat similar form of expression occurs in Thucy­ <lb/>
            dides, (ii. 60,) in the speech of Pericles, who speaks of the condition of a <lb/>
            city, <foreign xml:lang="grc">καθ' ἔκαστου τω̃ν πολιτω̃ν εὐπραγου̃σαν, ἀθρόαν δε σφαλλομένην</foreign> </note> <pb n="259"/>

            them, for custom makes great alterations : for there are some <lb/>
            things in nature capable of alteration either way, and which <lb/>
            are fixed by custom, either for the better or the worse. Now, <lb/>
            other animals live chiefly a life of mere nature, and in very <lb/>
            few things according to custom ; but man lives according to <lb/>
            reason also, with which he alone is endowed; wherefore he <lb/>
            ought to make all these accord with each other: for if they <lb/>
            are persuaded that it is best to follow some other way, men <lb/>
            oftentimes act contrary to nature and custom. What men <lb/>
            ought naturally to be, in order to make good subjects in a <lb/>
            legislative community, we have already determined ; the rest <lb/>
            of this discourse, therefore, shall be upon educa­ <lb/>
            tion : for some things men learn by habit, others <lb/>
            by hearing them. <lb/>

            Education. <lb/>
            must next consider whether both the rulers and the ruled <lb/>
            ought to be the same persons for life, or dif­ <lb/>
            ferent ; for it is evident that the mode of educa­ <lb/>
            tion should follow in accordance with this distinc­ <lb/>
            tion. Now, if one man differed from another as <lb/>
            much as we believe the gods and heroes differ. <lb/>
            A previous <lb/>
            question : <lb/>
            ought the <lb/>
            rulers and the <lb/>
            ruled always to <lb/>
            continue so t <lb/>
            from men, in the first place being far their superiors in the <lb/>
            body, and secondly in the soul, so that the superiority of the <lb/>
            governors over the governed might be evident beyond a doubt, <lb/>
            it is certain, that it would be better for the one always to <lb/>
            govern, the other always to be governed.1 But, as this is <lb/>
            not easy to obtain, and as kings are not so superior to those <lb/>
            they govern as Scylax informs us they are in India, it is evi­ <lb/>
            dent, that for many reasons it is necessary that all in their <note type="footnote"> 1 The sum is this; although abstractedly it would be the best thing for <lb/>
            a state that it should be ruled by some one manifestly superior to the rest, <lb/>
            like a god or a hero, yet practically,--as it is impossible to find such a <lb/>
            person,-in ordinary cases the citizens ought to take their turns in ruling <lb/>
            and being ruled. Still, no doubt, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄρχοντες</foreign> ought to differ in virtue <lb/>
            from the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχόμενοι</foreign>. And nature, by the analogy of other cases, solves <lb/>
            this difficulty, for she distinguishes the old from the young by a variety <lb/>
            of excellencies. </note><note type="footnote"> s 2 </note> <pb n="260"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK VII. </note> <lb/>
            turns should share both in governing and in being governed; <lb/>
            for it is just that those who are equal should have every thing <lb/>
            alike; and it is difficult for a state to continue which is <lb/>
            founded in injustice. For all those in the country who are <lb/>
            desirous of innovation, will apply themselves to such persons <lb/>
            as are under the government of the rest; but it is impossible <lb/>
            that the number of individuals in a state will be so great as to <lb/>
            get the better of all these. But that the governors ought to <lb/>
            excel the governed is beyond a doubt; the legislator there­ <lb/>
            fore ought to consider, how this shall be, and how it may be <lb/>
            contrived that all shall have their equal share in the adminis- <lb/>

            wholly. <lb/>
            tration. Now with respect to this point we have <lb/>
            already spoken. For nature herself has directed <lb/>
            us in our choice, laying down the self-same dis­ <lb/>
            tinction, when she has made some young, others old; the first <lb/>
            of whom it becomes to obey, the latter to command. For no <lb/>
            one when he is young is offended at his being under govern­ <lb/>
            ment, or thinks himself too good for it; more especially when <lb/>
            he considers that he himself shall receive the same tribute, when <lb/>
            he shall arrive at a proper age. In some respects it must <lb/>
            be acknowledged that the governors and the governed are <lb/>
            Consequently <lb/>
            the education <lb/>
            of the two <lb/>
            classes will be <lb/>
            partly the same <lb/>
            and partly not. <lb/>
            the same, in others they are different; it is there­ <lb/>
            fore necessary that their education should be in <lb/>
            some respect the same, in others different: just <lb/>
            as they say that he who will be a good governor, <lb/>
            ought first to learn to obey. Now, of govern­ <lb/>
            ments, as we have already said, some are instituted for the <lb/>
            sake of him who commands, others for him who obeys: of <lb/>
            the first sort is that of the master over the servant; of the <lb/>
            latter, that of freemen over each other. Now, some things <lb/>
            which are commanded differ from others, not in the business, <lb/>
            but in the end proposed thereby: for which reason many <lb/>
            tvorks, even of a servile nature, are not disgraceful for young <lb/>
            freemen to perform; for many things which are ordered to <lb/>
            be done are not honourable or dishonourable so much in their <lb/>
            own nature as in the end proposed, and in the reason for <lb/>
            which they are undertaken. Since, then, we have determined <lb/>
            that the virtue of a good citizen and good governor is the <lb/>
            same as of a good man, and that every one before he com­ <lb/>
            mands should have first obeyed, it is the business of the legia- <pb n="261"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. XIV. J </note> <lb/>
            later to consider how his citizens may be good <lb/>
            men, what education is necessary to that purpose, <lb/>
            and what is the ultimate object of the best-spent <lb/>
            life.1 Now the soul of man may be divided into <lb/>
            Education the <lb/>
            province of the <lb/>
            legislator, and <lb/>
            why. <lb/>
            two parts ;2 that which has reason itself, and that which has <lb/>
            not, but is capable of obeying its dictates: and according to the <lb/>
            virtues of these two parts a man is said to be good. But in <lb/>
            which of these the end subsists, will not be difficult for those <lb/>
            to determine who adopt the division which we have already <lb/>
            given; for the inferior always exists for the sake of the superior; <lb/>
            and this is equally evident both in the works of art, as well as <lb/>
            in those of nature? but that is superior which has reason. <lb/>
            Reason itself also is divided into two parts, in the manner we <lb/>
            usually divide it, namely, the theoretic and the practical; which <lb/>
            division therefore seems necessary for this part also. The same <lb/>
            analogy holds good with respect to actions; of which those <lb/>
            which are of a superior nature ought always to be chosen by <lb/>
            those who have it in their power; for that is always most <lb/>
            eligible to every one, which is the highest attainable end. <lb/>
            Now life is divided into labour and rest, war and peace; and <lb/>
            of what we do, the objects are partly necessary and useful, <lb/>
            partly noble: and we should give the same preference to <lb/>
            these, that we do to the different parts of the soul, and its <lb/>
            actions; as war to procure peace; labour for the sake of rest; <lb/>
            and the useful for the noble. The politician, there­ <lb/>
            fore, who composes a body of laws, ought to ex­ <lb/>
            tend his legislation to every thing, the different <lb/>
            parts of the soul, and their actions; more par- <lb/>
            The politician <lb/>
            ought to be <lb/>
            acquainted <lb/>
            with the whole <lb/>
            nature of man. <lb/>
            ticularly to those things which are of a superior nature, and <lb/>
            ends; and, in the same manner, to the lives of men, and <lb/>
            their different actions. They ought to be fitted both for <note type="footnote"> 1The connexion is as follows. " Since the virtue of the best ruler is, <lb/>
            to some extent at least, the same as that of the best subject, we must see <lb/>
            what course of instruction will tend to make him good. Now as the soul <lb/>
            is divided into two parts, the irrational and the rational, the latter is su­ <lb/>
            perior ; and this is again divided into two parts, the theoretic and the prac­ <lb/>
            tical, of which the latter is inferior to the former, and consequently must be <lb/>
            made subservient to it. So also <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀσχολία</foreign> must contribute towards <foreign xml:lang="grc">σχολή</foreign>, <lb/>
            and war towards peace. This is the right principle to be kept in view in <lb/>
            the education of the young, but it is neglected in almost all states." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 For this two-fold division of the soul, the reader must refer to Aris. <lb/>

            Education <lb/>
            should tend <lb/>
            to what is noble <lb/>
            as well as what <lb/>
            is useful. <lb/>
            labour and war, but rather for rest and peace; <lb/>
            and also to do what is necessary and useful, but <lb/>
            still more what is noble. It is to those objects <lb/>
            that the education of the children ought to tend, <lb/>
            and that of all those ages which require education. But <lb/>
            those of the Grecian states which now seem best governed, <lb/>
            and the legislators who founded those states, appear not to <lb/>
            have framed their polity with a view to the best end, nor to <lb/>
            every virtue, in their laws and education; but meanly to have <lb/>
            attended to those which are useful and productive of gain. <lb/>
            And nearly of the same opinion with these are some persons <lb/>
            Wrong end of <lb/>
            the Spartan <lb/>
            constitution. <lb/>
            who have written lately; for, by praising the <lb/>
            Lacedaemonian state, they show that they approve <lb/>
            of the intention of the legislator in making war <lb/>
            and victory the end of his government.1 But that this is con­ <lb/>
            trary to reason, is easily proved by argument, and has already <lb/>
            been proved by facts. But as the generality of men desire to <lb/>
            have command over the many, because thus they have every <lb/>
            thing desirable in the greater abundance; so Thibron and <lb/>
            each of those others who have written on the state of Lace­ <lb/>
            daemon seem to approve of their legislator, for having pro­ <lb/>
            cured them an extensive command, by inuring them to all <lb/>
            sorts of dangers. And yet it is evident, since the Lacedae­ <lb/>
            monians no longer have the supreme power, that neither are <lb/>
            they happy, nor was their legislator wise. This also is ridi­ <lb/>
            culous, that while they preserved an obedience to his laws, <lb/>
            and no one opposed their being governed by them, they have <lb/>
            thrown away the means of living honourably. But these <lb/>
            people understand not rightly what sort of government it is <lb/>
            which the legislator ought to hold in esteem; for a govern­ <lb/>
            ment of freemen is nobler than despotic power, and more <lb/>
            consonant to virtue. Moreover, neither should a city be <lb/>
            thought happy, nor should a legislator be commended on this <lb/>
            account, because he has trained the people so as to overpower <lb/>
            their neighbours. For in this there is a great inconvenience : <lb/>
            since it is evident, that upon this principle every citizen who <lb/>
            can, must endeavour to procure the supreme power in his own <note type="footnote"> 1 Upon the merits and demerits of the Spartan constitution, the reader <lb/>
            will do well to bestow a very careful attention on the immortal work of <lb/>

            city; and this is the crime of which the Lacedaemonians <lb/>
            accuse Pausanias, though he enjoyed such great honours. <lb/>
            But no part of such reasoning and such laws is either political, <lb/>
            or useful, or true: but a legislator ought to instil into the <lb/>
            minds of men those laws which are most useful for them, <lb/>
            both in their public and private capacities. As <lb/>
            to training a people for war, this ought to be the <lb/>
            care of a legislator, not in order that they may <lb/>

            ing. <lb/>
            enslave their inferiors, but that they may not themselves be <lb/>
            reduced to slavery by others. In the next place, he should <lb/>
            take care, that they seek to take the lead for the benefit of <lb/>
            those who are under them, and not to exercise a despotism over <lb/>
            all. In the third place, that those only are slaves who are fit <lb/>
            to be only so. Reason indeed concurs with experience in <lb/>
            showing, that all the attention which the legislator pays to <lb/>
            the business of war, and all other rules which he lays down, <lb/>
            should have for their object rest and peace. Since most of <lb/>
            such states as the above are preserved by war; but, as soon <lb/>
            as they have acquired a supreme power over those around <lb/>
            them, are ruined. For during peace, like a sword, they lose <lb/>
            their brightness: the fault of which lies in the legislator, who <lb/>
            never taught them how to be at rest.</p>

          <p>As there seems to be the same end common to a <lb/>
            man both as an individual and a citizen, and as of <lb/>
            necessity a good man and a good citizen must have <lb/>
            the same object in view; it is evident that all the <lb/>
            Rest and peace <lb/>
            an end to states <lb/>
            as to individu­ <lb/>
            als. <lb/>
            virtues which lead to rest are necessary; for, as we have often <lb/>
            said, the end of war is peace, and of labour, rest. But both <lb/>
            those virtues whose object is rest, and those also whose object <lb/>
            is labour, are necessary for a liberal life and rest; for we <lb/>
            want a supply of many necessary things, in order that we may <lb/>
            be at rest. A city therefore ought to be temperate, brave, <lb/>
            and patient; for, according to the proverb, " Rest is not for <lb/>
            slaves;" but those who cannot bravely face danger are the <lb/>
            slaves of those who attack them. Bravery, therefore, and <lb/>
            patience are necessary for labour, philosophy for rest, and <lb/>
            temperance and j ustice at both times; but these chiefly in <pb n="264"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK VII. </note> <lb/>
            time of peace and rest. For war obliges men to be just and <lb/>
            temperate, but the enjoyment of pleasure and peaceful repose <lb/>
            is more apt to produce insolence. Those indeed who are easy <lb/>
            in their circumstances, and enjoy every thing that can make <lb/>
            them happy, have great occasion for the virtues of temperance <lb/>
            and justice. Thus, if there are, as the poets tell us, any in­ <lb/>
            habitants in the Happy Isles, to these a higher degree of phi­ <lb/>
            . losophy, temperance, and justice will be necessary, as they <lb/>
            live at their ease, in the full plenty of all such pleasures. It <lb/>
            Peaceful vir­ <lb/>
            tues therefore <lb/>
            superior to <lb/>
            warlike ones. <lb/>
            is evident therefore, that a share of these virtues <lb/>
            is necessary in every state that would be happy <lb/>
            or worthy; for he who is worthless can never <lb/>
            enjoy real good, much less is he qualified to be at <lb/>
            rest; but can appear good only by labour and being at war, <lb/>
            but while at peace and at rest, the meanest of men. And for <lb/>
            this reason virtue should not be cultivated as among the La­ <lb/>
            cedaemonians ; for they do not differ from others in considering <lb/>
            different things from others as the chiefest good, but in ima­ <lb/>
            gining that this good is to be procured by one particular virtue. <lb/>
            But since these are greater goods, hence it is evident that the <lb/>
            enjoyment of these is greater than that of those virtues, and <lb/>
            that it is so for its own sake; but how and by what means <lb/>
            this is to be effected, must now be scientifically considered. <lb/>
            We have already assigned three causes on which it will de­ <lb/>
            pend, nature, custom, and reason, and we have shown what <lb/>
            sort of men nature must produce for this purpose; it remains <lb/>
            then as to education, that we determine with which we shall <lb/>
            first begin, reason or custom. For these ought always to con­ <lb/>
            spire in the most entire harmony with each other; for it may <lb/>
            happen, that reason may miss the best end proposed, and yet <lb/>
            be corrected by custom. In the first place, then, it is evident <lb/>
            that in this, as in other things, its beginning arises from some <lb/>
            principle, and its end also arises from another principle, which <lb/>
            is itself an end. Now, with us, reason and intelligence are <lb/>
            the end of nature; our production, therefore, and the care of <lb/>
            our habits, ought to be accommodated to both these. In the <lb/>
            next place, as the soul and the body are two distinct things, <lb/>
            so also we see that the soul is divided into two parts, the rea­ <lb/>
            soning and unreasoning, with their habits; and these are two <lb/>
            Our lower fa- in number, one belonging to each part, namely, <lb/>
            sulties to be re- appetite and intelligence; and, as the body is in <pb n="265"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. XVI.] </note> <lb/>
            production before the soul, so is the unreasoning <lb/>
            part of the soul before the reasoning. And this <lb/>
            is evident; for anger, will, and desire are to be <lb/>
            garded before, <lb/>
            and for the <lb/>
            sake of, our <lb/>
            higher ones. <lb/>
            seen in children nearly as soon as they are born; but reason <lb/>
            and intelligence spring up as they go on to maturity. The <lb/>
            body, therefore, necessarily demands our care previous to the <lb/>
            soul; next the appetites, for the sake of the mind; the body, <lb/>
            for the sake of the soul.</p>

          <p>SINCE then the legislator ought to take care that <lb/>
            the bodies of the children are as perfect as possi­ <lb/>
            ble, his first attention ought to be given to matri- <lb/>
            Marriage an <lb/>
            object of con- ' <lb/>
            sideration. <lb/>
            mony; at what time and in what condition it is proper that <lb/>
            the citizens should engage among themselves in the nuptial con­ <lb/>
            tract. Now, with respect to this alliance, the legislator ought <lb/>
            to consider the parties and their time of life, that they may cor­ <lb/>
            respond in their ages, and that their bodily powers may not be <lb/>
            different; that is to say, the man being still able <lb/>
            to beget children, but the woman too old to bear <lb/>
            them; or, on the contrary, the woman being young <lb/>
            Fit age of the <lb/>
            parties. <lb/>
            enough to produce children, but the man too old to be a father; <lb/>
            for from such a situation discords and disputes continually <lb/>
            arise. In the next place, with respect to the succession of <lb/>
            children, there ought not to be too great an interval of time <lb/>
            between them and their parents ; for, when there is, the pa­ <lb/>
            rent can receive no benefit from his child's affection, or the <lb/>
            child any advantage from his father's protection. Neither <lb/>
            should the difference in years be too little, as great inconve­ <lb/>
            niences may arise from it; for proper reverence is not shown <lb/>
            to such parents, by a boy who considers his father as nearly his <lb/>
            equal in age, and disputes are wont to arise in the management <lb/>
            of the family. But, to return to the point of our digression, care <lb/>
            ought to be taken that the bodies of the children may be such <lb/>
            as will answer the expectations of the legislator; and this also <lb/>
            will be effected by the same means. Since the season for the <lb/>
            production of children is determined, generally speaking, at <lb/>
            seventy years of age for the man, and for the woman at fifty, the <lb/>
            entering into the marriage state, as far as time is concerned, <lb/>
            should be regulated within these periods. It is extremely bad <pb n="266"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK VII. </note> <lb/>
            for the production of children that the father be too young ; for <lb/>
            in all animals whatsoever the offspring of the young are imper­ <lb/>
            fect, and they are more likely to beget females than males, and <lb/>
            diminutive also in size. The same thing of course necessarily <lb/>
            holds true with regard to men ; as a proof of this, in those cities <lb/>
            where the men and women usually marry very young, the <lb/>
            people in general are very small and ill-formed ; in childbirth <lb/>
            also the women suffer more, and more of them die. And thus <lb/>
            some persons tell us the oracle at Træzen should be explained, <lb/>
            as if it referred to the many women who were destroyed by <lb/>
            too-early marriages, and not to their gathering their fruits <lb/>
            too soon. It is also conducive to temperance not to marry too <lb/>
            soon; for women who marry early are apt to be intemperate. <lb/>
            It also prevents the bodies of men from acquiring their full <lb/>
            size, if they marry before their growth is completed; for there <lb/>
            is a determinate period, beyond which there is no further in­ <lb/>
            crease. For this reason the proper time for a woman to marry <lb/>
            is eighteen, for a man thirty-seven, a little more or less; for <lb/>
            when they marry at that time their bodies are in perfection, <lb/>
            and they will also together cease to have children at a proper <lb/>
            time. And moreover with respect to the succession of the <lb/>
            children, if they have them at the time which may reasonably <lb/>
            be expected, they will be just arriving at perfect manhood when <lb/>
            their parents are sinking down under the load of seventy years. <lb/>
            Thus much then we have said as to the time which is proper <lb/>
            Proper season <lb/>
            of the year, <lb/>
            for marriage ; but moreover a proper season of <lb/>
            the year should be observed, as many persons do <lb/>
            now, appropriating the winter for this matter. <lb/>
            The married couple ought also to regard the precepts of phy­ <lb/>
            sicians and naturalists, for physicians speak sufficiently as to <lb/>
            the periods of the year which suit the body, and philosophers <lb/>
            praise the northern rather than the southern winds, both of <lb/>
            whom have treated on the procreation of children. As to <lb/>
            what is the fit disposition of body for the children which <lb/>
            are to be born, we will now set aside the question, as it will <lb/>
            better suit to speak of it when we treat of the education of <lb/>
            children; but it is enough to draw out a slight sketch at pre­ <lb/>
            and conditipn <lb/>
            of the body. <lb/>
            sent. Now, the habit of. body belonging to a <lb/>
            wrestler is not suited to political life, nor to health, <lb/>
            nor to the procreation of children; nor is an infirm <lb/>
            habit or too much dispirited by misfortunes, but one between <pb n="267"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. XVI.] </note> <lb/>
            both of these. The man ought to have a habit of labour, but <lb/>
            not of too violent labour; nor should that be confined to one ob­ <lb/>
            ject only, as that of a wrestler; but to such things as are <lb/>
            proper for freemen. These things are equally necessary both <lb/>
            for men and women. It is right also that women with child <lb/>
            should take care of their bodily health, not living without ex­ <lb/>
            ercise, nor using too spare a diet; and this it will be easy for <lb/>
            the legislator to effect, if he commands them once every day <lb/>
            to repair to the regular worship of the gods who are honoured <lb/>
            as presiding over matrimony. But, contrary to what is pro­ <lb/>
            per for the body, the mind ought to be kept as tranquil as <lb/>
            possible; for as plants partake of the nature of the soil, so do <lb/>
            children receive much of the disposition of the mother. With <lb/>
            respect to the exposing or bringing up of children, let it be a <lb/>
            law, that nothing imperfect or maimed shall be brought up; <lb/>
            but to avoid an excess of population, let some law <lb/>
            be laid down, if it be not permitted by the customs <lb/>
            and habits of the people, that any of the children <lb/>
            Checks to po­ <lb/>
            pulation. <lb/>
            born shall De exposed ; or a limit must be fixed to the po­ <lb/>
            pulation of the state. Bat if any parents have more chil­ <lb/>
            dren than the number prescribed, before life and sensation <lb/>
            begins, an abortion must be brought about; for what is <lb/>
            right and contrary to right in such a case is determined <lb/>
            by sensation and life. And as the proper time has been <lb/>
            pointed out for a man and a woman to enter into the mar­ <lb/>
            riage state, so also let us determine how long it is advan­ <lb/>
            tageous for the community that they should continue to beget <lb/>
            children; for as the children of those who are too young are <lb/>
            imperfect both in body and mind, so also those whose parents <lb/>
            are too old are weak in both. While therefore the intellect <lb/>
            continues in perfection, which (as some poets say, who reckon <lb/>
            the different periods of life by sevens) is up to fifty years, or <lb/>
            four or five more, the children may be equally perfect; but <lb/>
            when the parents are past that age, it is better they should <lb/>
            abstain from sexual intercourse, openly at least; but after that <lb/>
            time intercourse should be continued only for the sake of <lb/>
            health or some other cause. With respect to any connexion <lb/>
            between a man and a woman, when either of the. parties are <lb/>
            betrothed, let it be held in utter detestation on any pretext <lb/>
            whatsoever; but should any one be proved guilty of such a <pb n="268"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK vn. </note> <lb/>
            thing after the marriage is consummated, let his infamy be as <lb/>

          <p>The rearing of <lb/>
            children. <lb/>
            1. Bodily. <lb/>
            BUT when a child is born, it must be supposed <lb/>
            that the strength of its body will depend greatly <lb/>
            upon the quality of its food. Now whoever will <lb/>
            examine into the nature of animals, and also observe those <lb/>
            people who are very desirous their children should acquire a <lb/>
            warlike habit, will find that they feed them chiefly with <lb/>
            abundance of milk, as being best accommodated to their bodies, <lb/>
            but without wine, to prevent any distempers. Those motions <lb/>
            also which are natural to their age are very serviceable; and <lb/>
            to prevent any of their limbs from being crooked, on account <lb/>
            of their extreme ductility, some people even now use parti­ <lb/>
            cular machines in order that their bodies may not be distorted. <lb/>
            It is also useful to inure them to the cold when they are very <lb/>
            little ; for this is very serviceable for their health, and also most <lb/>
            useful for the business of war. For this reason it is cus­ <lb/>
            tomary with many of the barbarians to dip their children in <lb/>
            rivers, when the water is cold; with others, to clothe them <lb/>
            very slightly, as among the Celts; for whatever it is possible to <lb/>
            accustom children to, it is best to accustom them to it from the <lb/>
            first, but to do it by degrees. Besides, children have naturally <lb/>
            a habit of loving the cold, on account of their natural heat. <lb/>
            The earliest age, then, ought to be regarded with such and <lb/>
            similar attention. During the next period to this, which con­ <lb/>
            tinues till the child is five years old, it is best to teach him <lb/>
            nothing at all, not even necessary labour, lest it should hinder <lb/>
            his growth; but he should be accustomed to use so much motion <lb/>
            as to avoid an indolent habit of body; and this he will acquire by <lb/>
            various means, and among others by play; his play also ought <lb/>
            to be neither illiberal, nor too laborious, nor lazy. Their go­ <lb/>
            t Mental vernors and preceptors also should take care what <lb/>
            sort of tales and stories it may be proper for them <lb/>
            to hear; for all these ought to pave the way for their future <note type="footnote"> I To this chapter Aristotle refers by anticipation in book ii. chap. 10. <lb/>
            where he says, " whether he (Minos) in this did well or ill, we shall have <lb/>
            another opportunity of considering." </note> <pb n="269"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. xvn.] </note> <lb/>
            instruction; for which reason the generality of their play <lb/>
            should be imitations of what they are afterwards to do seri <lb/>
            ously. They too do wrong who forbid by laws the disputes <lb/>
            and little troubles between boys, for they contribute to in­ <lb/>
            crease their growth. For they act as a sort of exercise to the <lb/>
            body, and the struggles of the heart, and the compression of <lb/>
            the spirits, give strength to those who labour, which happens <lb/>
            to boys in their disputes. The preceptors also ought to have <lb/>
            an eye upon their manner of life, and those with whom they <lb/>
            converse; and to take care that they are as little as possible <lb/>
            in the company of slaves. At this time and till <lb/>
            they are seven years old, it is necessary that they <lb/>
            should be educated at home. It is also very pro­ <lb/>
            per to banish, both from their hearing and sight, <lb/>
            every thing which is illiberal and the like. In- <lb/>
            Home training. <lb/>
            Every thing in­ <lb/>
            decent to be <lb/>
            kept from <lb/>
            children. <lb/>
            deed it is as much the business of the legislator, as any thing <lb/>
            else, to banish every indecent expression out of the state; for <lb/>
            from a permission to speak whatever is shameful, very quickly <lb/>
            arises the doing it, and this particularly with young people. <lb/>
            For which reason let them never speak nor hear any such <lb/>
            thing; but if it appears that any freeman has done or said <lb/>
            any thing that is forbidden, before he is of age to be thought <lb/>
            fit to partake of the common meals, let him be punished by <lb/>
            disgrace and stripes; but if a person above that age does so, <lb/>
            let him be treated as you would a slave, on account of his <lb/>
            being infamous. Since we forbid his speaking every thing <lb/>
            which is forbidden, it is necessary that he neither see obscene <lb/>
            stories or pictures; 1 the magistrates therefore are to take care, <lb/>
            that there are no statues or pictures of any thing of this na­ <lb/>
            ture, except only to those gods to whom the law permits them, <lb/>
            and to which the law allows persons of a certain age to pay <lb/>
            their devotions, for themselves, their wives, and children. It <lb/>
            should also be forbidden by law for young persons <lb/>
            to be present either at Iambics or comedies, before <lb/>
            Plays. <lb/>
            they are arrived at that age when they are allowed to partake <lb/>
            of the pleasures of the table ; indeed a good education will <lb/>
            preserve them from drunkenness and from all the evils which <lb/>
            attend on these things. We have at present just cursorily <note type="footnote"> I Compare Juv. Sat. xiv. 1. 44: <lb/>
            " Nil dictu fædum visuve ea limina tangat <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [BOOK VIII. </note> <lb/>
            touched upon this subject; it will be our business hereafter, <lb/>
            when we properly come to it, to determine whether this care <lb/>
            of children is unnecessary, or, if necessary, in what manner it <lb/>
            must be done; at present we have only mentioned it as ne­ <lb/>
            cessary. Probably the saying of Theodorus, the tragic actor, <lb/>
            was not a bad one, 11 That he would permit no one, not even <lb/>
            the meanest actor, to go upon the stage before him, that he <lb/>
            might first engage the ear of the audience." The same thing <lb/>
            happens both in our connexions with men and things; what <lb/>
            we meet with first pleases best. And for this reason children <lb/>
            should be kept strangers to every thing which is bad, more <lb/>
            particularly whatsoever is loose and offensive to good man­ <lb/>
            ners. When five years are accomplished, the two next may be <lb/>
            very properly employed in being spectators of those exercises <lb/>
            which they will afterwards have to learn. There are two <lb/>
             <lb/>
            Two periods of <lb/>
            education. <lb/>
            periods into which education ought to be divided, <lb/>
            according to the age of the child ; the one is, from <lb/>
            his being seven years of age to the time of boy­ <lb/>
            hood; the other, from thence till he is one and twenty. For <lb/>
            those who divide ages by the number seven are in general <lb/>
            wrong; it is much better to follow the division of nature; for <lb/>
            every art and every instruction is intended to complete what <lb/>
            nature has left defective. We must first then consider, if any <lb/>
            regulation whatsoever is requisite for children; in the next <lb/>
            place, whether it is advantageous to make it a common care, <lb/>
            or that every one should act therein as he pleases, as is the <lb/>
            general practice in most cities ; and, in the third place, what <lb/>
            it ought to be.</p>

          <p>No one can doubt that the legislator ought greatly <lb/>
            to interest himself in the care of youth; for, <lb/>
            where it is neglected, it is hurtful to the city.' <lb/>
            For every state ought to be governed according <note type="footnote"> 1 The indispensable nature of education for the young is proved by the <lb/>
            fact that many states have suffered from the absence of it. And it must </note> <pb n="271"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. II.] </note> <lb/>
            to its particular nature; for the character of each government <lb/>
            is that which peculiarly marks it, and as this originally estab­ <lb/>
            lished it, so it usually preserves it. For instance, a demo­ <lb/>
            cratic character preserves a democracy, the oligarchic an oli­ <lb/>
            garchy, but universally the best character tends to produce <lb/>
            the best government. Besides, as in every business and art <lb/>
            there are some things necessary to the performance of their <lb/>
            several works which men must learn first, and to which they <lb/>
            must be accustomed; so it is evident that the same thing is <lb/>
            necessary towards the practice of virtue. As <lb/>
            there is one end in view in every city, it is evident <lb/>
            that education ought to be one and the same in <lb/>
            Education the <lb/>
            same in all <lb/>
            states. <lb/>
            all; and that this should be a common care, and not that of <lb/>
            each individual, as it now is, when every one takes care of his <lb/>
            own children separately, and each parent in private teaches <lb/>
            them as he pleases, but the training of what belongs to all ought <lb/>
            to be in common. Besides, no one ought to think that any <lb/>
            citizen belongs to him in particular, but to the state in general; <lb/>
            for each one is a part of the state, and it is the natural duty <lb/>
            of each part to regard the good of the whole; and <lb/>
            for this the Lacedæmonians may be praised, for <lb/>
            they give the greatest attention to education, and <lb/>
            The Spartan <lb/>
            system praised. <lb/>
            they make it public. It is evident then, that laws should be <lb/>
            laid down concerning education, and that it should be public.</p>

            which they chance to be members. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 " The constitution " (of Dorian states), says Muller, " was formed <lb/>

            view to utility, <lb/>
            or to virtue ? <lb/>
            now-a-days there are doubts concerning the busi. <lb/>
            ness of it, as all people do not agree in those <lb/>
            things they would have a child taught, both with respect to <lb/>
            their improvement in virtue, and a happy life: nor is it clear, <lb/>
            whether the object of it should be to improve the intellect, or <lb/>
            to rectify the morals. The view gained from the present <lb/>
            mode of education is confused, and we cannot determine with <lb/>
            certainty whether it is right to instruct a child in what will <lb/>
            be useful to him in life ; or in that which tends to virtue, and i <lb/>
            is really excellent: for all these things have their separate <lb/>
            defenders. As to virtue, there is no particular in which they <lb/>
            all agree : for as all do not equally esteem all virtues, it <lb/>
            reasonably follows that they will not cultivate the same. It <lb/>
            is evident, that out of the number of useful things, what is <lb/>
            necessary ought to be taught to all: but that which is neces- <lb/>
            Freemen to be <lb/>
            debarred from <lb/>
            illiberal arts. <lb/>
            sary tor one is not necessary tor all; for as there <lb/>
            ought to be a distinction between the employ­ <lb/>
            ment of a freeman and a slave, the freeman should <lb/>
            be taught every thing useful, which will not make him who <lb/>
            knows it mean.1 But every work is to be esteemed mean, <lb/>
            and every art, and every discipline as well, which renders the <lb/>
            body, the mind, or the understanding of freemen unfit for the <lb/>
            habit and practice of virtue. For which reason all those arts <lb/>
            which tend to deform the body are called mean, and all those <lb/>
            employments which are exercised for gain ; for they take off <lb/>
            from the leisure of the mind, and render it sordid. There <lb/>
            are also some liberal arts, which are not improper for freemen <lb/>
            to apply to in a certain degree; but all sedulous endeavour <lb/>
            to acquire a perfect skill in them, is exposed to the faults I <lb/>
            have just mentioned. For there is a great deal of difference <lb/>
            in the reason for which any one does or learns any thing: for <lb/>
            it is not illiberal to engage in it for the sake of oneself, or <lb/>
            of one's friend, or in the cause of virtue ; while, at the same <lb/>
            time, to do it for the sake of another, may seem to be acting <lb/>
            the part of a servant and a slave. The modes of instruction <lb/>
            which now prevail, as we said before, seem to partake of both <lb/>
            these parts. <note type="footnote"> I The test to be applied is the tendency of any thing to incapacitate for <lb/>
            virtue those who learn it. But even illiberal sciences may be pursued <lb/>
            up to a certain point; so long as the motive on which they are studied is <lb/>
            a liberal one, and they are not pursued for the sake of gain. </note></p><pb n="273"/>

          <p>THERE are as nearly as possible four things which <lb/>
            it is usual to teach children :1 reading, gymnastic <lb/>
            exercises, and music, to which (in the fourth place) <lb/>
            Four things to <lb/>
            be taught <lb/>
            children. <lb/>
            some add painting. Reading and painting they teach as be­ <lb/>
            ing both of them of great and various use in life, and gymnastic <lb/>
            exercises, as tending to produce courage. As to <lb/>
            music, some persons may entertain a doubt, since <lb/>
            most persons now use it for the sake of pleasure: <lb/>
            but those who originally made it part of eduea- <lb/>
            Music to be <lb/>
            taught, as a <lb/>
            means of em­ <lb/>
            ploying leisure <lb/>
            well. <lb/>
            tion, did so because, as has been already said, nature requires <lb/>
            not only that we should be properly employed, but that we <lb/>
            should be able to enjoy leisure honourably: for this (to repeat <lb/>
            what we have already said) is of all things the principal. But, <lb/>
            though both labour and rest are necessary, yet the latter is <lb/>
            preferable to the former; and by all means we ought to learn <lb/>
            what we should do when at rest: for surely we ought not to <lb/>
            employ that time in play; for then play would be the neces­ <lb/>
            sary business of our lives. But since this cannot be, play is <lb/>
            more necessary for those who labour than for those who are <lb/>
            at rest; for he who labours requires relaxation ; and this play <lb/>
            will supply. For as labour is attended with pain and con­ <lb/>
            tinued exertion, on this account it is necessary that play <lb/>
            should be introduced, under proper regulations, as a medicine: <lb/>
            for such an employment of the mind is a relaxation to it, and <lb/>
            combines ease with pleasure. Now rest in itself seems to par­ <lb/>
            take of pleasure, and happiness, and an agreeable life: but this <lb/>
            cannot be theirs who labour, but theirs who are at rest; for he <lb/>
            who labours, labours for the sake of some end which he has not <lb/>
            attained; but happiness is an end which all persons think is <lb/>
            attended with pleasure, and not with pain. Now <lb/>
            all persons do not agree in making this pleasure <lb/>
            consist in the same thing; for each one has his <lb/>
            Different <lb/>
            standards of <lb/>
            pleasure. <lb/>
            particular standard, corresponding to his own habits; but the <lb/>
            best man proposes the best pleasure, and that which arises <lb/>
            from the noblest actions. So that it is evident, that to live a <lb/>
            life of rest, there are some things which a man must learn <note type="footnote"> I Compare Diodorus Siculus, vol. i. p. 486. </note><note type="footnote"> T </note> <pb n="274"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK VIII. </note> <lb/>
            and be instructed in; and that the object of this learning and <lb/>
            this instruction is only their acquisition : but the learning and <lb/>
            instruction which is given for labour, has for its object other <lb/>
            Music taught <lb/>
            among the <lb/>
            ancients. <lb/>
            things. For this reason the ancients made <lb/>
            music a part of education ; not as a thing neces­ <lb/>
            sary, (for it is not of that nature,) nor as a thing <lb/>
            useful, as reading is, towards the common course of lite, or <lb/>
            for managing of a family, or for learning any thing as useful <lb/>
            in public life. Painting also. seems useful, to enable a man <lb/>
            to judge more accurately of the productions of the finer arts. <lb/>
            Nor is it like the gymnastic exercises, which contribute to <lb/>
            health and strength; for neither of these things do we see <lb/>
            produced by music. There remains for it, then, to be the <lb/>
            employment of our rest, and this is the end which they had <lb/>
            in view who introduced it; for they thought it a proper em­ <lb/>
            ployment for freemen, and to them they allotted it; as Homer <lb/>
            sings : <lb/>
            " How right to call Thalia to the feast! "1 <lb/>
            and, addressing some others, he says: <lb/>
            "The bard was call'd, to ravish every ear <lb/>
            and, in another place, he makes Ulysses say, that the happiest <lb/>
            part of man's life is, <lb/>
            " When at the festal board in order placed, <lb/>
            They listen to the song."2</p>
          <p>A liberal edu­ <lb/>
            cation over and <lb/>
            above mere <lb/>
            utility.</p>
          <p>It is evident then, that there is a certain educa­ <lb/>
            tion in which a child may be instructed, not as <lb/>
            useful, nor as necessary, but as noble and liberal; <lb/>
            but whether this is one or more than one, and of <lb/>
            what sort, and how it is to be taught, shall be considered here­ <lb/>
            after. We have now gone so far on our way as to show that <lb/>
            we have the testimony of the ancients in our favour, by what <lb/>
            they have handed down to us upon education; for music makes <lb/>
            this plain. Moreover, it is necessary to instruct children in <lb/>
            what is useful, not only on account of its being useful in it­ <lb/>
            self, as, for instance, to learn to read, but also as the means of <lb/>
            acquiring other different sorts of instruction. Thus, they <note type="footnote"> 1This line, as well as the following, does not occur in the Homeric <lb/>
            poems as they have come down to us at the present day. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Horn. Odyss. ix. 7. </note> <pb n="275"/>

            should be instructed in painting, not only to pre­ <lb/>
            vent their being mistaken in purchasing pictures, <lb/>
            or in buying or selling of vases, but more particu- <lb/>
            Painting why <lb/>
            useful. <lb/>
            larly as it makes them judges of the beauties of the human <lb/>
            form; for to be always hunting after the profitable ill agrees <lb/>
            with great and freeborn souls. But as it is evident that a <lb/>
            child should be taught morals before reasoning, and that his <lb/>
            body should be cultivated before his intellect, it is plain that <lb/>
            boys should be first put under the care of the different masters <lb/>
            of the gymnastic arts, both to form the constitution of their <lb/>
            bodies and to teach them their exercises.</p>

          <p>Now of those states which seem to take the <lb/>
            greatest care of their children, some aim at pro­ <lb/>
            ducing in them a habit framed by athletic exer- <lb/>
            Bodily train­ <lb/>
            ing of children. <lb/>
            cises, though these both prevent the growth, and hurt the <lb/>
            form of their bodies.1 But into this fault the Lacedaemonians <lb/>
            did not fall; for they made their children fierce by painful <lb/>
            labour, considering this to be chiefly useful to inspire them <lb/>
            with courage. Though, as we have already often <lb/>
            said, this is neither the only thing, nor the prin- <lb/>
            Its end. <lb/>
            cipal thing, necessary to attend to. And even with respect to <lb/>
            this, they do not thus attain its end; for we do not find either <lb/>
            in other animals, or in other nations, that courage necessarily <lb/>
            attends the most cruel, but rather the milder, and those who <lb/>
            have the dispositions of lions. For there are many people, <lb/>
            who are eager both to kill men, and to devour human flesh, <lb/>
            as the Achaeans, and Heniochi 2 in Pontus, and many others <lb/>
            in Asia; some of whom are as bad, and others worse, than <lb/>
            these, who indeed live by free booting, but are men of no <lb/>
            courage. Nay, we know that the Lacedaemonians themselves, <note type="footnote"> 1 The Spartans do not indeed hurt the growth of the bodies of their <lb/>
            youth; but still, by exclusive attention to bodily training, they brutalize <lb/>
            their citizens; and this is not productive of the higher kind of bravery. <lb/>
            To neglect all mental training is to render the citizens mean and vile : <lb/>
            but with children, the body and the mind must not be exercised at the <lb/>
            same time. Upon the general subject of Spartan education, see Miiller's <lb/>

            while they continued those painful labours, were superior to <lb/>
            all others, though now they are inferior to many, both in war <lb/>
            and gymnastic exercises; for they did not acquire their su­ <lb/>
            periority by training their youth to these exercises, but be­ <lb/>
            cause, being disciplined themselves, they were opposed to those <lb/>
            who were not disciplined at all. What is fair and honourable <lb/>
            ought then to take the foremost place in education ; for it is <lb/>
            not a wolf, nor any other wild beast, that will brave any <lb/>
            Not to be <lb/>
            severed from <lb/>
            mental train­ <lb/>
            ing. <lb/>
            noble danger, but rather a good man. So that 1 <lb/>
            those who permit boys to engage too earnestly in <lb/>
            these exercises, while they do not take care to <lb/>
            instruct them in what is necessary to do, render <lb/>
            them too mean to speak the truth, and accomplished only in <lb/>
            one duty of a citizen, but in every other respect good for <lb/>
            nothing, as reason evinces. Nor should we form our judg­ <lb/>
            ments from past events, but from what we see at present: for <lb/>
            now they have rivals in their mode of education, whereas <lb/>
            formerly they had not. That gymnastic exercises, then, are <lb/>
            useful, and in what manner, is admitted; for during youth, <lb/>
            it is very proper to go through a course of those which are <lb/>
            most gentle, omitting that violent diet and those painful <lb/>
            exercises which are prescribed as necessary; that there may <lb/>
            be nothing to prevent the growth of the body. And it is <lb/>
            no small proof that they have this effect, that amongst the <lb/>
            Olympic victors we can scarce find two or three who have <lb/>
            gained a victory, both when boys and men, because the ne­ <lb/>
            cessary exercises they went through when young deprived <lb/>
            Age for bodily <lb/>
            training. <lb/>
            them of their strength. When they have allotted <lb/>
            three years from the time of boyhood to the other <lb/>
            parts of education, they are then of a proper age <lb/>
            to submit to labour and a regulated diet. For it is impos­ <lb/>
            sible for the mind and body both to labour at the same time; <lb/>
            as each labour is productive of contrary evils ; the labour of <lb/>
            the body preventing the progress of the mind, and the mind <lb/>
            of the body.</p>

          <p>Doubts re­ <lb/>
            specting <lb/>
            music.</p>
          <p>WITH respect to music we have already suggested <lb/>
            some doubts; so that it will be proper to go over <lb/>
            again more particularly what we then said, which <pb n="277"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. V.] </note> <lb/>
            may serve as an introduction to what any person may choose <lb/>
            to say upon it by way of remark.1 For it is no <lb/>
            easy matter distinctly to point out what power it <lb/>
            has, nor on what accounts one should apply it, <lb/>
            1. Is it to be <lb/>
            regarded as a <lb/>
            mere pastime ? <lb/>
            whether as an amusement and refreshment, like sleep or wine ; <lb/>
            -( for these are nothing serious, but pleasing, and the " killers <lb/>
            of care," as Euripides says ;2 for which reason they class <lb/>
            them in the same order, and use for the same purpose all <lb/>
            these, namely, sleep, wine, and music; and to these some add <lb/>
            dancing ;)—or shall we rather suppose that music <lb/>
            has a tendency to produce virtue, having a power, <lb/>
            as the gymnastic exercises have, to form the body <lb/>
            2. Or has it <lb/>
            any moral <lb/>
            effects ? <lb/>
            in a certain way, anu to influence me manners, so as to ac­ <lb/>
            custom its professors to rejoice rightly ? Or shall we say, <lb/>
            that it is of any service in the conduct of life, and an assistant <lb/>
            to prudence ? for this also is to be regarded as a third pro­ <lb/>
            perty attributed to it. Now it is evident that boys are not to <lb/>
            be instructed in it as play; for those who learn do not play, <lb/>
            for to learn is accompanied by pain: neither is it proper to <lb/>
            permit boys at their age to enjoy perfect leisure; for to cease <lb/>
            from education is by no means fit for what is as yet imperfect. <lb/>
            But it may be thought that the earnest attention of boys is be­ <lb/>
            stowed on this art for the sake of that amusement which they <lb/>
            will enjoy when they come to be men and completely formed; <lb/>
            but, if this is the case, why are they themselves to learn it, <lb/>
            and not follow the practice of the kings of the Medes and <lb/>
            Persians, who enjoy music by hearing others play, and so <lb/>
            gain a share of pleasure and instruction ? For of necessity <lb/>
            those must be better skilled therein, who make this science <lb/>
            their particular study and business, than those who have only <lb/>
            spent so much time at it as is sufficient just to learn the <lb/>
            principles of it. But if it is fit that children should toil at <lb/>
            such matters, they ought also to learn the art of cookery ; but <lb/>
            this is absurd. The same doubt occurs, if music has a power <lb/>
            of improving the manners; for why should they on this ac­ <lb/>
            count themselves learn it, and not learn to rejoice rightly and <note type="footnote"> I There is here a possible allusion to the Poetics of Aristotle, where <lb/>
            the question is further considered. See chapter 1. </note><note type="footnote"> 2The allusion possibly is to his play of the Bacchæ, 1. 382, etc.<lb/>

              <note type="margin"> [BOOK vIi. </note> <lb/>
              to be able to form a judgment, by hearing others, as the <lb/>
              Lacedaemonians ? For without having ever learnt music, they <lb/>
              are yet able to judge accurately, as men say, what melody is <lb/>
              good and what is bad. The same reasoning may be applied <lb/>
              if music is supposed to be the amusement of those who live <lb/>
              an elegant and easy life; for we ask why should they learn <lb/>
              themselves, and not rather enjoy the benefit of others' skill ? <lb/>
              Analogy drawn <lb/>
              from the gods. <lb/>
              Let us here consider what is our belief of the <lb/>
              immortal gods in this particular. Now we find * <lb/>
              the poets never represent Jupiter himself as sing­ <lb/>
              ing and playing; nay, we ourselves treat the professors of <lb/>
              these arts as mean people, and say, that no man would prac­ <lb/>
              tise them but a drunkard or a buffoon. But probably we may <lb/>
              consider this subject more at large hereafter. The first <lb/>
              question is, whether music is or is not to make a part of <lb/>
              education ? and of these three things which have been started <lb/>
              in discussion, which is it able to effect ? Is it to instruct, to <lb/>
              amuse, or to employ leisure ? Now all three ends are pro­ <lb/>
              perly allotted to it, for it appears to partake of them all: for <lb/>
              play is necessary for relaxation, and relaxation is pleasant, as <lb/>
              it is a medicine for that uneasiness which arises from labour. <lb/>
              It is admitted also that a happy life must be an honourable <lb/>
              one, and a pleasant one too, since happiness consists in both <lb/>
              these; and we all agree, that music is one of the most pleas­ <lb/>
              ing things, whether alone or accompanied with a voice; as <lb/>
              Musæus says, <lb/>
              " Music, man's sweetest joy <lb/>
              for which reason it is justly admitted into every company <lb/>
              and every happy life, as having the power of inspiring joy. <lb/>
              So that from this any one may suppose that it is fitting to in- <lb/>
              It is harmless <lb/>
              and conducive <lb/>
              to the end of <lb/>
              life. <lb/>
              struct young persons in it. For all those pleasures <lb/>
              which are harmless are not only conducive to the <lb/>
              final end of life, but serve also as relaxations; <lb/>
              and, as men but rarely attain that final end, they <lb/>
              often cease from their labour, and apply themselves to amuse­ <lb/>
              ment, with no further view than to acquire the pleasure <lb/>
              attending it. It is therefore useful to enjoy some such <lb/>
              pleasures as these. There are some persons who make play <lb/>
              and amusement their end, and probably that end has some <lb/>
              pleasure annexed to it, but not what should be: but while <pb n="279"/>
              <note type="margin"> CHAP. V. </note> <lb/>
              men seek the one, they accept the other for it. Because there <lb/>
              is some likeness in human actions to the end: for the end is <lb/>
              pursued for the sake of nothing else that attends it, but for <lb/>
              itself only; and pleasures like these are sought for, not on <lb/>
              account of what follows them, but on account of what has <lb/>
              gone before them, as labour and grief. For this reason they <lb/>
              seek for happiness in these sort of pleasures ; and that this is S <lb/>
              the reason any one may readily perceive. That music should <lb/>
              be general, not on this account only, but also as it is very <lb/>
              serviceable towards relaxation from labour, probably no one <lb/>
              doubts. We should also inquire, then, whence this arises; <lb/>
              for it is too noble in its nature to be ultimately intended for <lb/>
              this purpose ; and we ought not only to partake of the com­ <lb/>
              mon pleasure arising from it—(of which all have the sensa­ <lb/>
              tion, for music naturally gives pleasure, and therefore the use <lb/>
              ofit is agreeable to all ages and all dispositions);—but also <lb/>
              to examine if it tends in any way to improve our manners ✓ <lb/>
              and our souls. And this will be easily known, <lb/>
              if we feel our dispositions any way influenced <lb/>
              thereby: and that they are so is evident from <lb/>
              Moral effects <lb/>
              of music. <lb/>
              many other instances, as well as from the music at the <lb/>
              Olympic games; and this confessedly fills the soul with en­ <lb/>
              thusiasm : but enthusiasm is an affection of the soul which <lb/>
              strongly agitates the disposition.1 Besides, all <lb/>
              those who hear any imitations sympathize there­ <lb/>

              The power of <lb/>
              imitation, <lb/>
              without rhythm or verse. Moreover, as music chances to be <lb/>
              one of those things which are pleasant, and as virtue itself <lb/>
              consists in rightly enjoying, loving, and hating, it is evident <lb/>
              that we ought not to learn, or accustom ourselves to any <lb/>
              thing so much as to judge right, and to rejoice in honourable <lb/>
              manners and noble actions. But anger and mildness, courage <lb/>

              sitions of the mind, are most naturally imitated by music and <lb/>
              poetry. This is plain from experience, for when we hear these <lb/>
              our very soul is altered; and he who is affected either with <lb/>
              joy or grief by the imitation of any objects, is in very nearly <lb/>
              the same situation as if he was affected by the objects them­ <lb/>
              selves. Thus, if any person is pleased with seeing a statue <lb/>
              of any one, on no other account but its beauty, it is evident <lb/>
              that the sight of the original, from whence it was taken, <lb/>
              to be found <lb/>
              only in the <lb/>
              hearing. <lb/>
              would also be pleasing. Now it happens that in <lb/>
              the other senses there is no imitation of manners; <lb/>
              that is to say, in the touch, and the taste; in the <lb/>
              objects of sight, a very little: for these are merely repre­ <lb/>
              sentations of things, and the perceptions which they excite <lb/>
              are in a manner common to all. Besides, statues and paint­ <lb/>
              ings are not properly imitations of manners, but rather signs <lb/>
              and marks which show that the body is affected by some <lb/>
              passion. However, the difference is not great, yet young <lb/>
              men ought not to view the paintings of Pause, but of Polyg­ <lb/>
              notus, or any other painter or statuary who expresses man­ <lb/>
              ners.1 But in poetry and music there are imitations of man­ <lb/>
              ners ; and this is evident, for different harmonies differ from <lb/>
              each other so much by nature, that those who hear them are <lb/>
              differently affected, and are not in the same disposition of <lb/>
              mind when one is perfomed as when another is; the one, <lb/>
              The Lydian, <lb/>
              Doric, and <lb/>
              Phrygian <lb/>
              measures. <lb/>
              for instance, occasions grief, and contracts the <lb/>
              soul, as the mixed Lydian: others soften the <lb/>
              mind, and as it were dissolve the heart: others <lb/>
              fix it in a firm and settled state. Such is the <lb/>
              power of the Doric music only; while the Phrygian fills the <lb/>
              soul with enthusiasm, as has been well described by those <lb/>
              who have written philosophically upon this part of education; <lb/>
              for they bring examples of what they advance from the things <lb/>
              themselves. The same holds true with respect to rhythms; <lb/>
              some fix the disposition, others occasion a change in it; some <lb/>
              act more violently, others more liberally. From what has <lb/>
              been said it is evident what an influence music has over the <lb/>
              dispositionof the mind, and how variously it can fascinate it: <lb/>
              and if it can do this, most certainly it is what youth ought <note type="footnote"> 1Compare our author's Poetics, chap. 6. olov <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ τω̃ν γραφεων Ζευξις</foreign> </note><figure type="illustration">

              able, but music is naturally one of the most agreeable things ; <lb/>
              and there seems to be a certain connexion between harmony <lb/>
              and rhythm; for which reason some wise men held the soul <lb/>
              itself to be harmony, others, that it contains it.</p>

          <p>WE will now determine, whether it is proper that <lb/>
            children should be taught to sing and play upon <lb/>
            any instrument, a matter of doubt which we started <lb/>
            before. Now it is clear that it makes a great deal <lb/>
            Should chil­ <lb/>
            dren be taught <lb/>
            to sing and <lb/>
            play? <lb/>
            of difference in qualifying persons for any art, if the person <lb/>
            himself learns the practical part of it; for it is a thing very <lb/>
            difficult, if not impossible, for men to be good judges of what <lb/>
            they cannot do themselves. It is also very ne­ <lb/>
            cessary that children should have some amusing <lb/>
            employment. For which reason the rattle of Ar- <lb/>
            They need <lb/>
            amusement. <lb/>
            chytas seems well contrived, which they give children to play <lb/>
            with, to prevent their breaking those things which are about <lb/>
            the house; for owing to their youthful age they cannot sit <lb/>
            still. This therefore is a toy well adapted to infants, and in­ <lb/>
            struction ought to be their rattle as they grow up; <lb/>
            hence it is evident, that they should be so taught <lb/>
            music as to be able to practise it. Nor is it diffi- <lb/>
            Reasons why <lb/>
            music is suited <lb/>
            to children. <lb/>
            cult to say what is becoming or unbecoming of their age, or <lb/>
            to answer the objections which some make to this employment <lb/>
            as mean and low.1 In the first place, since it is <lb/>
            necessary for them to practise in order that they <lb/>
            may be judges of the art, this, then, should be <lb/>
            Popular objec­ <lb/>
            tion to music <lb/>
            answered. <lb/>
            done when they are young; but when they are grown older <lb/>
            they may be spared the practical part, while they are able to <lb/>
            judge of excellence in the art, and to take a proper pleasure <lb/>
            in it, from the knowledge they acquired of it in their youth. <note type="footnote"> 1 These two answers may be put thus: 1. It is not <foreign xml:lang="grc">βἀναυσον</foreign> to learn, <lb/>
            for it is well for the young to be able to judge of music, though they do <lb/>
            not practise it when they grow up. 2. It does not make them <foreign xml:lang="grc">βάναυσοι</foreign> <lb/>
            to learn; for such a brancn of education will not be, and must not be, <lb/>
            allowed to interfere with other branches, or to render the body unfit for <lb/>
            warlike exercises. </note> <pb n="282"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK VIII. </note> <lb/>
            Another popu­ <lb/>
            lar objection <lb/>
            answered. <lb/>
            As to the censure which some persons throw upon <lb/>
            music, as making men mean and low, it is not <lb/>
            difficult to answer it, if we will but consider how <lb/>
            far we propose that those who are to be educated so as to be­ <lb/>
            come good citizens, should be instructed in this art, and with <lb/>
            what music and what rhythms they should be acquainted ; and <lb/>
            also on what instruments they should learn to play; for in <lb/>
            these there is probably a difference. Here then is the proper <lb/>
            Limitations ne­ <lb/>
            cessary. <lb/>
            answer to that censure, for it must be admitted, <lb/>
            that in some cases nothing can prevent music <lb/>
            being attended to a certain degree with the bad <lb/>
            effects ascribed to it; it is therefore clear, that the learning <lb/>
            of it should never prevent the business of riper years, nor <lb/>
            render the body ignoble and unfit for the business of war or <lb/>
            the state; so that it should be practised by the young, and <lb/>
            used by the aged as a means to further instructions. And <lb/>
            what we want would happen in reference to music, if they <lb/>
            are not employed in those parts of it which are the objects <lb/>
            of dispute between the masters in that science, and perform <lb/>
            such pieces as excite wonder from the difficulty of their exe­ <lb/>
            cution ; and which, transferred from the public games, are <lb/>
            now become a part of education. But let them learn so much <lb/>
            of it as to be able to receive proper pleasure from excellent <lb/>
            music and rhythms, and not that common part of music in <lb/>
            which some of the brute animals take delight, and also slaves <lb/>
            and boys. It is therefore plain what instruments they should <lb/>
            Why the flute <lb/>
            and harp are <lb/>
            not proper for <lb/>
            children. <lb/>
            use : thus, they should never be taught to play <lb/>
            upon the flute, or any other instrument which re­ <lb/>
            quires great skill, as the harp, or the like, but on <lb/>
            such as will make them good judges of music or <lb/>
            any other branch of instruction. Besides, the flute is not a <lb/>
            moral instrument, but rather one that will inflame the pas­ <lb/>
            sions, and is therefore rather to be used when the soul is to <lb/>
            be animated, than when instruction is intended. Let me add <lb/>
            also, that there is something therein which is quite contrary to <lb/>
            what education requires; as the player on the flute is pre­ <lb/>
            vented from speaking. For this reason our forefathers very <lb/>
            properly forbade the use of it to youth and freemen, though <lb/>
            they themselves at first used it; for when their riches pro­ <lb/>
            cured them greater leisure, they grew more animated in the <lb/>
            cause of virtue; and both before and after the Persian wars, <pb n="283"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. VII.] </note> <lb/>
            their noble actions so exalted their minds that they attended <lb/>
            to every part of education; selecting no one in particular, but <lb/>
            endeavouring to collect the whole. And hence they intro­ <lb/>
            duced flute-playing also, and joined it with their other branches <lb/>
            of instruction. At Lacedaemon the choragus himself played <lb/>
            on the flute for his choir; and it was so common at Athens, <lb/>
            that almost every freeman understood it; as is evident from <lb/>
            the tablet which Thrasippus dedicated when he was choragus, <lb/>
            but afterwards they rejected it as dangerous; for they had <lb/>
            become better judges of what tended to promote virtue, and <lb/>
            what did not. For the same reason many of the ancient in­ <lb/>
            struments were thrown aside, as the magadis and the lyre; as <lb/>
            also such as tended to inspire those who played on them with <lb/>
            pleasure, and all which required a scientific finger. What <lb/>
            the ancients tell us by way of fable, of the flute, is indeed <lb/>
            very rational; namely, that after Minerva had found the flute <lb/>
            she threw it away; nor are they wrong who say, that the <lb/>
            goddess disliked it because it deformed the face of him who <lb/>
            played on it; not but that it is more probable that she rejected <lb/>
            it, as the knowledge thereof contributed nothing to the im­ <lb/>
            provement of the mind. Now, we regard Minerva as the in­ <lb/>
            ventress of arts and sciences. As we do not approve that a <lb/>
            child should be taught to use and play on instruments like a <lb/>
            master,-( and by this we mean that which is suited for contests <lb/>
            in the art; for he who plays in this way plays not to improve <lb/>
            himself in virtue, but to please those who hear him, and this <lb/>
            in a common way,)—therefore we think the practice of it unfit <lb/>
            for freemen, but then it should be confined to hired persons ; <lb/>
            for it usually gives people sordid notions, as the end they have <lb/>
            in view is bad. For the impertinent spectator is accustomed <lb/>
            to make them change their music, so that it forces the artists <lb/>
            who attend to him to mould their manners and their bodies <lb/>
            according to his motions.</p>

          <p>WE must now further enter into an inquiry con­ <lb/>
            cerning harmony and rhythm; whether all sorts Harmony and rhythm. <lb/>
            of these are to be employed in education, or <note type="footnote"> I On the subject of the Doric chorus see Müller's Dorians, vol. ii. book <lb/>

            whether a selection must be made; and also whether we <lb/>
            should give the same distinctions for those who are engaged <lb/>
            in music as part of education, or whether there is something <lb/>
            different from these two. Now, as all music consists in me­ <lb/>
            lody and rhythm, 1 we ought not to be unacquainted with the <lb/>
            power which each of these has in education ; as also whether <lb/>
            we should rather choose music in which melody prevails, or <lb/>
            rhythm. But as we consider that many things have been well <lb/>
            written upon these subjects, not only by some musicians of <lb/>
            the present age, but also by some philosophers, who are per­ <lb/>
            fectly skilled in that part of music which belongs to educa­ <lb/>
            tion ; we will refer those who desire a very particular know­ <lb/>
            ledge of it to those writers, and shall only treat of it in general <lb/>
            Common divi­ <lb/>
            sion of melody. <lb/>
            terms, speaking only in outline concerning it. <lb/>
            Melody is divided by some philosophers, of whose <lb/>
            notions we approve, into moral, practical, and that <lb/>
            which fills the mind with enthusiasm; they also allot to each <lb/>
            of these a particular kind of harmony which naturally cor­ <lb/>
            responds to it; and we say that music should not be applied <lb/>
            to one purpose only, but to many; both for instruction, and <lb/>
            purifying the soul;—(we now use the word purifying at pre­ <lb/>
            sent without any explanation, but shall speak more at large <lb/>
            of it in our Poetics;)—and in the third place, as an agreeable <lb/>
            manner of spending the time and a relaxation from any un- <lb/>
            Harmonies ex­ <lb/>
            pressing moral <lb/>
            feelings to be <lb/>

            easiness of the mind. It is evident, then, that all <lb/>
            harmonies are to be used, but not for all purposes.; <lb/>

            and enthusiastic, to please the ear, when others <lb/>
            play. For that passion, which is to be found very strong in <lb/>
            some souls, is to be met with also in all; but the difference <lb/>

            in Buckley's edition. " Rhythm differs from metre, inasmuch as rhythm <lb/>
            is proportion applied to any motion whatever ; metre is proportion ap­ <lb/>
            plied to the motion of words spoken. Thus in the drumming of a march, <lb/>
            or in the dancing of a hornpipe, there is rhythm, though no metre. In <lb/>
            Dryden's celebrated ode there is metre as well as rhythm, because with <lb/>
            the rhythm the poet has associated certain words. And hence it follows, <lb/>
            that though all metre is rhythm, yet all rhythm is not metre." See Har­ <lb/>
            ris's Philol. Inquiries, (p. 67,) where he also observes, very truly, that no <lb/>
            English word expresses rhythmus better than the word time. (Twining on <lb/>

            degree, as pity, fear, and enthusiasm; the latter of which is <lb/>
            so powerful in some as to overpower the soul: and yet we <lb/>
            see those persons, by the application of sacred music to soothe <lb/>
            their mind, rendered as sedate and composed as if they had <lb/>
            employed the art of the physician. Now this very same thing <lb/>
            must necessarily happen to the compassionate, the fearful, and <lb/>
            all those who are subdued by their passions ; nay, all persons, <lb/>
            as far as they are affected with those passions, admit of the <lb/>
            same cure, and are restored to tranquillity with pleasure. In <lb/>
            the same manner, all music which has the power <lb/>
            of purifying the soul, affords man a harmless <lb/>
            pleasure. Such therefore should be the harmony <lb/>
            and such the music which those who contend with <lb/>
            The music <lb/>
            which purifies <lb/>
            the soul is <lb/>
            good. <lb/>
            each other in the theatre should exhibit. But as the audience <lb/>
            is composed of two sorts of people, the free and the well in­ <lb/>
            structed, the rude, the mean mechanics, and hired servants, <lb/>
            and a whole herd of the like, there must be some music <lb/>
            and some spectacles to please and soothe them. For as their <lb/>
            minds are as it were perverted from their natural habits, so <lb/>
            also is there an unnatural harmony and overcharged music <lb/>
            which is accomodated to their taste: but what is according to <lb/>
            nature gives pleasure to every one; and therefore those who <lb/>
            are to contend upon the theatre, should be allowed to use this <lb/>
            species of music. But in education a moral kind of melody <lb/>
            and harmony should be used; and this is the Doric, as we <lb/>
            have already said, or any other which is approved by those <lb/>
            philosophers who are skilful in that music which is to be em­ <lb/>
            ployed in education. But Socrates, in the Re­ <lb/>
            public of Plato, is very wrong, when he permits <lb/>
            only the Phrygian music to be used besides the <lb/>

            this respect. <lb/>
            Doric,1 particularly as amongst other instruments he banishes <lb/>
            the flute. For the Phrygian music has the same power in <lb/>
            harmony as the flute has amongst the instruments ; for they <lb/>
            are both pathetic and raise the mind. This is proved by the <lb/>
            practice of the poets, for in their Bacchanal songs, or whenever <lb/>
            they describe any violent emotions of the mind, the flute is <note type="footnote"> 1 See Plato, Rep. book iii. chap. 10. These two strains are mentioned <lb/>
            together by Horace, (Epod. ix. 5, 6,) <lb/>

            Hâc Dorium, illis barbarum." <lb/>
            Upon the subject of the Dorian, Lydian, and Phrygian measures, it will <lb/>
            be of advantage to the general reader to consult Müller's Dorians, vol. ii. <lb/>

            the instrument which they chiefly use; and the Phrygian <lb/>
            The Dithy­ <lb/>
            ramb. <lb/>
            harmony is most suitable to these subjects. Now, <lb/>
            it is allowed by general consent, that the Dithy­ <lb/>
            rambic measure is Phrygian; and those who are <lb/>
            conversant in studies of this sort bring many proofs of the <lb/>
            fact. As, for instance, when Philoxenus endeavoured to com­ <lb/>
            pose Dithyrambic music for Doric harmony, he naturally fell <lb/>
            back again into Phrygian, as being best fitted for that pur- <lb/>
            Character of <lb/>
            Doric music. <lb/>
            pose. Now every one indeed agrees, that the <lb/>
            Doric music is most serious,and attest to inspire v <lb/>
            courage: and, as we always commend the middle <lb/>
            as being between the two extremes, and the Doric has this <lb/>
            relation with respect to other harmonies, it is evident that in <lb/>
            this rather than in any other should the youth be instructed. <lb/>
            There are two points to be taken into consideration, both <lb/>
            what is possible, and what is proper; every one then should <lb/>
            chiefly endeavour to possess himself of those things which <lb/>
            contain both these qualities. But this is to be regulated by <lb/>
            different times of life; for instance, it is not easy for those <lb/>
            who are advanced in years to sing such pieces of music as <lb/>
            require very high notes, for nature points out to them those <lb/>
            which are gentle and require little strength of voice. For <lb/>
            this reason some who are skilful in music justly find fault <lb/>
            with Socrates,1 because he would forbid the youth to be in­ <lb/>
            structed in gentle harmony ; as if, like wine, it would intoxi­ <lb/>
            cate them. It does not, however, cause men to be Bacchanals, <lb/>
            but languid, for it is wine rather which renders men Baccha­ <lb/>
            nals. These, therefore, and such-like melodies, are what <lb/>
            should employ those who are grown old. Moreover, if there <lb/>
            is any harmony which is proper for a child's age, as being at <lb/>
            the same time elegant and instructive, as the Lydian of all <lb/>
            others seems chiefly to be, [this is to be adopted also. <lb/>
            The three <lb/>
            boundaries of <lb/>
            education. <lb/>
            These then are to be laid down as it were the <lb/>
            three boundaries of education, namely, modera­ <lb/>
            tion, possibility, and decency. <note type="footnote"> 1 Socrates was wrong upon his own principles in retaining the Dorian <lb/>
            and Phrygian music, as they were of a very opposite character; espe­ <lb/>
            cially as he rejected the flute, which was the instrument most nearly <lb/>
            corresponding to the Phrygian melodies, both being of an Orgiastic na­ <lb/>
            ture ; whereas the Dorian is a grave melody, and. is calculated to inspire <lb/>
            a bold and manly character. </note></p>

          <p>THE economical and political science 1 differ not <lb/>
            only in the same degree as a house and a city, (for <lb/>
            these constitute the subject matter of them both,) <lb/>
            but also in that political rule involves a plurality <lb/>
            Difference be­ <lb/>
            tween <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὶκονο­ <lb/>

            τική</foreign>. <lb/>
            of governors, while economic rule is monarchical. Now in <lb/>
            some of the arts a division is made, and it does not belong to <lb/>
            the same art to make a thing and to use what is made, as for <lb/>
            example, a lyre and flutes. It is however the province of the <lb/>
            political science to constitute a city from the very first, and <lb/>
            when constituted to turn it to a proper use; so that it is clear <lb/>
            that it would naturally be the province of economic science <lb/>
            both to found a house and to make use of it. Now <lb/>
            a city2 is such a collection of these houses and <lb/>
            land and wealth, as brings about an independent <lb/>
            A <foreign xml:lang="grc">πόλις</foreign> and an <lb/>

            trasted. <lb/>
            and happy life. And this is clear from the fact that when­ <lb/>
            ever the citizens are unable to attain this end, the community <lb/>
            is dissolved. And further, this is the end for which they com­ <lb/>
            bine : but that for the sake of which any thing exists and is <lb/>
            produced, is its essence; so that evidently economics are prior <lb/>
            to politics in the order of nature, for their end is prior, and a <lb/>
            house or family is a part of a city. We must therefore look <lb/>
            into the economical science, and see what is its end. <note type="footnote"> I For a full explanation of the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολιτική</foreign>, and the relation in which <lb/>

          <p>THE component parts of a house are a man and <lb/>
            property. But since the nature of any thing is <lb/>
            first scientifically seen in its minutest parts,1 the <lb/>
            same would be the case with regard to a house ; so that accord­ <lb/>
            ing to Hesiod it will be requisite that there should be, <lb/>
            " First house, then wife, then oxen for the plough; " 2 <lb/>
            for of these the first is requisite for the sake of food, and the <lb/>
            Need of rules <lb/>
            respecting a <lb/>
            wife. <lb/>
            other two belong to freemen. So that it would <lb/>
            be necessary to lay down good regulations con­ <lb/>
            cerning the association of a wife; and this is to <lb/>
            provide one of a fit and proper character. But with regard <lb/>
            to property, the first attention should be paid to that which is <lb/>
            in accordance with nature; but by nature agriculture is first, <lb/>
            next come all those things which are derived from the earth, <lb/>
            such as mining and other arts of the like kind. But agri- <lb/>

            attended to. <lb/>
            culture should be ranked first because it is just;3 <lb/>
            for it does not derive its profits from men, either <lb/>
            with their consent, like petty traffic and the mer­ <lb/>
            cenary arts, or without their consent, like the arts which per­ <lb/>
            tain to war. Further also, agriculture is natural, for naturally <lb/>
            every existing thing derives its nourishment from its mother, <lb/>
            and so consequently men derive it from the earth.4 Moreover <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare the opening words of Pol. i. chap. 2, " Now if any one <lb/>
            would watch the parts of a state from the very first as they rise into ex­ <lb/>

              it contributes much towards fortitude; for it does not make <lb/>
              the body unserviceable, like the illiberal arts, but renders it <lb/>
              fit to live and labour in the open air, and to run the risks of ' <lb/>

          <p>BUT as to man, the first object of his care should <lb/>
            be respecting a wife ; for the society which exists <lb/>
            between the male and female is above all others <lb/>
            The necessity <lb/>
            of a wife. <lb/>
            natural. For it is laid down by us elsewhere, 1 that nature <lb/>
            aims at producing many such creatures as the several kinds of <lb/>
            animals; but it is impossible for the female to accomplish this <lb/>
            without the male, or the male without the female, so that the <lb/>
            society between them exists of necessity. In all other animals <lb/>
            indeed, this association is irrational, and exists only so far as <lb/>
            they possess a natural instinct, and for the sake of procreation <lb/>
            alone. But in the milder and more intelligent animals, this <lb/>
            bond more nearly approaches perfection; for there seem to be <lb/>
            in them more signs of mutual assistance and good-will, and of <lb/>
            co-operation with each other. But this is espe­ <lb/>
            cially the case with man, because the male and tie.The conjugal <lb/>
            female here co-operate not only for the sake of <lb/>
            existence, but of living happily. And the procreation of chil­ <lb/>
            dren is a means not only of subserving nature, but also of <lb/>
            solid benefit; for the labour which they expend during their <lb/>
            season of vigour upon their helpless young is given back to <lb/>
            them in the decay of age, from their children who are then in <lb/>
            vigour. And at the same time, by this continual cycle, nature <lb/>
            provides for the continuance of the race as a species, since she <lb/>
            cannot do so numerically. Thus divinely predisposed towards <lb/>
            such a society is the nature of both the male and the female. <lb/>
            For the sexes are at once divided, in that neither Distinct duties <lb/>
            of them have powers adequate for all purposes, of the sexes. <note type="footnote"> A commentary on the idea may be found in the story of L. Junius Bru­ <lb/>
            tus, as related in Liv. i. 56. " Ex infimo specu vocem redditam ferunt <lb/>
            Imperium summum Romeo habebit, qui vestrum primus, o juvenes, oscu <lb/>

            nay, in some respects even opposite to each other, though they <lb/>
            tend to the same end. For nature has made the one sex stronger <lb/>
            and the other weaker, that the one by reason of fear may be <lb/>
            more adapted to preserve property, while the other, by reason <lb/>
            of its fortitude, may be disposed to repel assaults; and that <lb/>
            the one may provide things abroad, while the other preserves <lb/>
            them at home. And with respect to labour, the one is by na­ <lb/>
            ture capable of attending to domestic duties, but weak as to <lb/>
            matters out of doors ; the other is ill-adapted to works where <lb/>
            repose is necessary, but able to perform those which demand <lb/>
            exercise. And with respect to children, the bearing of them <lb/>
            belongs to one sex, but the advantage of them is common to <lb/>
            both; for the one has to rear them, and the other to educate <lb/>
            them.</p>

          <p>The husband'a <lb/>
            duty towards <lb/>
            his wife.</p>
          <p>FIRST of all, then, certain laws are to be observed <lb/>
            towards a wife, and especially to refrain from in­ <lb/>
            juring her; for thus neither will a man be injured <lb/>
            himself. And this is suggested by the common law of nature, <lb/>
            (bidding us,) as the Pythagoreans say, " not to injure a sup­ <lb/>
            pliant torn away from the hearth;" but the injuries inflicted <lb/>
            by a husband are his liaisons out of doors. But as to inter­ <lb/>
            course, the wife ought to be able to rest in the absence of her <lb/>
            husband, and accustomed to be content whether he is with <lb/>
            her or away from home. Well then has Hesiod said, <lb/>
            " A maiden wed, and wholesome laws instil; " 1 <lb/>
            for dissimilarity of manners is most apt to interrupt affection. <lb/>
            With respect to ornament, however, they ought not to ap­ <lb/>
            proach each other with any studied affectation in their man­ <lb/>
            ners or in their persons ; for the society which is accompanied <lb/>
            with studied ornament differs in no respect from that of tra­ <lb/>

          <p>BUT of property, the first and most necessary part is that <lb/>
            which is best and chiefest; and this is man. <lb/>
            Hence it is necessary to obtain worthy slaves. <lb/>
            But there are two kinds of slaves, a steward and <lb/>
            Good slaves <lb/>
            also necessary. <lb/>
            a drudge. But since we see that modes of education form the <lb/>
            characters of the young, it is necessary when you have pro­ <lb/>
            cured them to rear up those to whose care liberal offices are <lb/>
            to be committed.! And the conduct of a master <lb/>
            towards his slaves should be such as not to suffer <lb/>
            them to be insolent or negligent; and to those <lb/>
            Their treat­ <lb/>
            ment. <lb/>
            who are more liberal than others, he ought to give a share of <lb/>
            honour, and to the working slaves a sufficiency of food. And <lb/>
            since the drinking of wine makes even freemen insolent, and <lb/>
            since many nations even of freemen abstain from it, (as the <lb/>
            Carthaginians when on service,) it is clear that they should <lb/>
            be allowed to partake of it either not at all or very seldom. <lb/>
            But as there are three things [to be regarded], work, punish­ <lb/>
            ment, and food, to give them food unaccompanied by work or <lb/>
            punishment, is wont to cause insolence; but to give them <lb/>
            labour and punishment without food is tyrannical, and makes <lb/>
            them unable to work. It remains, therefore, to give them <lb/>
            employment and sufficient food; for it is not possible to rule <lb/>
            over them without giving a recompence; but the recompence <lb/>
            of a slave is his food. But as other men become <lb/>
            worse when they get nothing by being better, and <lb/>
            when no rewards are given for virtuous or vicious <lb/>

            actions, so it is with slaves. And hence we must look closely <lb/>
            into their character, and distribute or withhold every thing <lb/>
            according to merit, both food and clothing, leisure and pun­ <lb/>
            ishments ; imitating both in word and in deed the faculty of <lb/>
            physicians, by way of a remedial measure, considering that <lb/>
            food, owing to its being continual, has nothing remedial in it. <lb/>
            But those races of slaves will be best adapted for work which <lb/>
            are not excessively cowardly or daring, for both of the latter <lb/>

          <p>BUT there are four qualities pertaining to the <lb/>
            master of a household which he ought to possess <lb/>
            respecting riches. For he ought to be able to <lb/>
            procure them, and also to preserve them; but if <lb/>
            not, then there is no profit in procuring them; for this is but <lb/>
            " to draw water in a sieve and a perforated tub," as the pro­ <lb/>
            verb has it. Moreover he ought to be apt in applying what <lb/>
            he possesses to the purposes of ornament and use, for it is on <lb/>
            this account that we need such a thing as wealth. The several <lb/>
            kinds of his possessions ought moreover to be divided, and there <lb/>
            ought to be more of them fruitful than unfruitful. His em­ <lb/>
            ployments also ought to be so divided as not to incur risks <lb/>

            countries con­ <lb/>
            sidered. <lb/>
            with all his property at the same time. And tor <lb/>
            the purpose of preserving his property, it is ex­ <lb/>
            pedient to use the Persian and Lacedæmonian cus­ <lb/>
            toms. The Athenian economy also is useful, for <lb/>
            they sell their produce, and buy [what they want]; and so <lb/>
            there is no need for storing and warehousing in families of <lb/>
            small means. The Persian custom is that the master shall <lb/>
            order and inspect every thing with his own eye, as Dion said <lb/>
            of Dionysius; for no one takes the same care of what belongs <lb/>
            to his neighbour as he does of his own property; so that it is <lb/>
            necessary for a master himself to inspect every thing as far as <lb/>
            possible. The saying of the Persian and the African too is to the <lb/>
            A master <lb/>
            should super­ <lb/>
            intend all <lb/>
            things. <lb/>
            purpose; for the former, on being asked what was <lb/>
            the best thing to fatten a horse, answered, " The <lb/>
            eye of his master;" and the African being asked <lb/>
            what was the best manure, replied, 11 The foot- <pb n="295"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. VI.] </note> <lb/>
            steps of the landowner." Some things therefore should be in­ <lb/>
            spected by the master himself, and some by his wife, according <lb/>
            as the employments of housekeeping are divided between them. <lb/>
            And this is to be done but seldom in small establishments, but <lb/>
            often in those where a steward is employed. For it is not <lb/>
            possible to imitate well, unless a good model is proposed, <lb/>
            either ir. other things or in the matter of a stewardship; so <lb/>
            that it is impossible for stewards to be careful, where the masters <lb/>
            are careless. But since these things are both honourable in <lb/>
            respect of virtue, and useful towards economy, it is requisite <lb/>
            that masters should rise before their slaves and go to rest later, <lb/>
            and that a house, like a city, should never be left unguarded; <lb/>
            and what ought to be done should be omitted neither by day <lb/>
            nor by night. It is likewise well to rise before <lb/>
            daybreak; for this contributes to health, wealth, <lb/>
            Useful effects <lb/>
            of early rising. <lb/>
            and wisdom. Where then the establishment is <lb/>
            small, the Athenian method of disposing the fruits <lb/>
            of the earth is useful; but in great ones a division <lb/>

            and close in­ <lb/>
            spection. <lb/>
            must be made between the yearly and monthly expenditure; <lb/>
            and in like manner with respect to vessels in daily or oc­ <lb/>
            casional use; and these things must be given over to the <lb/>
            stewards. And besides this, these matters should be reviewed <lb/>
            at intervals of time, that it may be known what is preserved <lb/>
            and what is wanting. But with respect to the possessions <lb/>
            themselves, the house should be furnished with a view to both <lb/>
            health and comfort. And by 11 possessions," I mean what is <lb/>
            advantageous towards producing crops and clothing, and what <lb/>
            suits for preserving dry or moist fruits; and by other pos­ <lb/>
            sessions, what places are accommodated to the reception of ani­ <lb/>
            mate and inanimate things, whether slaves or freemen, women <lb/>
            or men, strangers or citizens. And with reference <lb/>
            to comfort and health, the house should be situated <lb/>
            so as to be airy in summer, and sunny in the win- <lb/>

            doorkeeper would seem to be useful; he may be one who is <lb/>
            useless for other employments, except to watch over what is <lb/>
            brought in or carried out of the house. And for the ready <lb/>
            use of utensils the Lacedæmonian method is serviceable; for <lb/>
            every thing there must lie in its own place, for thus it will be <lb/>

          <p>Portrait of a <lb/>
            good wife.</p>
          <p>A GOOD and perfect wife ought to be mistress of <lb/>
            every thing within the house, and to have the care <lb/>
            of every thing according to fixed laws ; allowing <lb/>
            no one to come in unbidden by her husband, and especially <lb/>
            keeping on her guard against every thing which can be noised <lb/>
            abroad relating to a woman's dishonour. So that if any mis­ <lb/>
            chance has happened within doors, she alone ought to know <lb/>
            about it; but when those who have come in have done any <lb/>
            thing wrong, the husband should bear the blame. And she <lb/>
            should manage the expenses laid out upon such festivals as <lb/>
            her husband has agreed with her in keeping, and make an <lb/>
            outlay of clothes and other ornaments on a somewhat lesser <lb/>
            scale than is encouraged by the laws of the state; considering <lb/>
            that neither splendour of vestments, nor pre-eminence of <lb/>
            beauty, nor the amount of gold, contributes so much to the <lb/>
            commendation of a woman, as good management in domestic <lb/>
            affairs, and a noble and comely manner of life; since all such <lb/>
            array of the soul is far more lovely, and has greater force <lb/>
            (than any thing besides), to provide herself and her children <lb/>
            true ornament till old age. A wife therefore ought to inspire <lb/>
            herself with confidence, and perpetually to be at the head of <lb/>
            domestic affairs. For it is unseemly for a man to know all <lb/>
            Her conduct <lb/>
            towards her <lb/>
            husband. <lb/>
            that goes on in the house ; in all respects indeed <lb/>
            she ought to be obedient to her husband, and not <lb/>
            to busy herself about public affairs, nor to take <lb/>
            part in matrimonial concerns. And when it is time to give <note type="footnote"> I The first book of the Economics of Aristotle is clearly imperfect, as <lb/>
            it only opens the subject of economy so far as it appertains to domestic <lb/>
            affairs, and then concludes most abruptly. The Greek text of the latter <lb/>
            part of the book which follows here, would seem to have perished at a <lb/>
            very early period; and accordingly this part of the treatise has existed <lb/>
            only in the shape of a Latin translation made from the original text by <lb/>
            Aretinus, which has been rendered back into Greek by Tussanus, and is <lb/>

            means in these respects she should obey her husband. And <lb/>
            she ought to show herself a fellow-counsellor to her husband. <lb/>
            so as to assent to what pleases him, remembering that it is <lb/>
            less unseemly for a husband to take in hand domestic matters, <lb/>
            than for a wife to busy herself in affairs out of doors. But <lb/>
            the well-ordered wife will justly consider the behaviour of her <lb/>
            husband as a model of her own life, and a law to herself, in­ <lb/>
            vested with a divine sanction by means of the marriage tie <lb/>
            and the community of life. For if she can persuade herself to <lb/>
            bear her husband's ways patiently, she will most easily manage <lb/>
            matters in the house; but if she cannot, she will have greater <lb/>
            difficulty. So that it will be seemly for her to show herself of one <lb/>
            mind with her husband, and tractable, not only when her hus­ <lb/>
            band is in good luck and prosperity, but also when he is in <lb/>
            misfortune; and when good fortune has failed him, or sick­ <lb/>
            ness has laid hold of his bodily frame, or when he has been <lb/>
            deprived of his senses, she ought gently and sympathetically <lb/>
            to yield in any matter which is not base and unworthy; but <lb/>
            if her husband has been ailing and made a mistake, she ought <lb/>
            not to keep it on her mind, but to lay the blame on disease or <lb/>
            ignorance. For in proportion as she is now more careful to <lb/>
            give way, so much the more gratitude will her husband feel <lb/>
            towards her, when his ailment has passed by; and if she fails <lb/>
            to obey him when he commands something which is unseemly, <lb/>
            he will be able to pardon her with a better grace when he re­ <lb/>
            covers. Observing such rules as these, the wife ought to <lb/>
            show herself even more obedient to the rein than if she had <lb/>
            entered the house as a purchased slave. For she has been <lb/>
            bought at a high price, for the sake of sharing life and bear­ <lb/>
            ing children; than which no higher or holier tie can pos­ <lb/>
            sibly exist. Further, if the husband with whom <lb/>
            she has lived should fare amiss, her merit would <lb/>
            In adversity. <lb/>
            not otherwise reach the same pitch of fame and of good report. <lb/>
            It is no small thing indeed to make a good use of prosperity, <lb/>
            but it is a far greater thing to endure the contrary lot in a <lb/>
            fitting manner. For in every way it is the mark of a lofty <lb/>
            mind to show no signs of depression under great sufferings <lb/>
            and injuries. It is indeed much to be desired that nothing of <lb/>
            the kind should happen to her husband; but if any thing of <lb/>
            an adverse nature should surprise him, she ought straightway <pb n="298"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK It </note> <lb/>
            to consider that she will gain far higher praise if she directs <lb/>
            Examples of <lb/>
            noble matrons. <lb/>
            matters successfully; recalling to her mind the <lb/>
            fact that neither would Alcestis have gained such <lb/>
            renown, nor Penelope have been deemed worthy <lb/>
            of so much praise, had they respectively lived with their bus­ <lb/>
            bands in prosperous circumstances; and that it is the suffer­ <lb/>
            ings of Admetus and Ulysses which have given to them an <lb/>
            everlasting fame. For by preserving faith and justice in the <lb/>
            midst of their own husbands' misfortunes, they have gained a <lb/>
            deserved reputation. For it is easy to find persons who will <lb/>
            share prosperity; but, except a very few and very good ones, <lb/>
            women are not willing to share misfortunes. For all these <lb/>
            reasons it behoves each woman above all things to honour her <lb/>
            husband, and not to despise him if a sacred sense of respect <lb/>
            and wealth, which, according to Orpheus, is " the child of con­ <lb/>
            fidence," does not attend him. A wife, then, ought carefully <lb/>
            to preserve herself in such customs and laws as these.</p>

            education of a bride, so that the children may be born of the <lb/>
            best possible mother. For the husbandman neglects nothing <lb/>
            so as to cast his seed upon the richest and best wrought <lb/>
            ground, considering that it is from such a soil that he will here­ <lb/>
            after reap the fairest fruits; and if any violence threatens, he <lb/>
            fights against his enemy, and deliberately chooses to die rather <lb/>
            than endure to see it ravaged; and such a disposition as this <lb/>
            is praised by most persons. And as such is the care which <lb/>
            is spent by us on the support of our bodies, what manner of <lb/>
            men ought we to show ourselves on behalf of our children and <lb/>
            of the mother that is to rear them ? Ought we not most readily <lb/>
            to strain every nerve ? For in this way alone does the constitu­ <lb/>
            tion of man's nature, which is mortal, attain to prosperity, <lb/>
            and the prayers of parents all tend to this one end. And <lb/>
            hence, whoever cares not for this, is sure to be regardless of <lb/>
            the gods. It was for the sake of the gods, then, <lb/>
            who were present to him when he offered the mar­ <lb/>
            riage sacrifice, that he not only took to himself a <lb/>
            Sanctity of <lb/>
            marriage. <lb/>
            wife, but also (what is far more) gave himself over to his <lb/>
            bride to honour her next to his own parents. But that which <lb/>
            is most precious in the eyes of a prudent wife, is to see her <lb/>
            husband preserving himself entirely for her, thinking of no <lb/>
            other woman in comparison with her, and regarding herself, <lb/>
            above all other women, as peculiarly his own, and faithful <lb/>
            towards him. For in proportion as a wife perceives that she <lb/>
            is faithfully and justly cared for, so much the more will she <lb/>
            exert her energies to show herself such. Whoever therefore <lb/>
            is prudent, will not fail to remember with how much honour <lb/>
            it becomes him to requite his parents, his wife, and his chil­ <lb/>
            dren, in order that he may gain the name of one who is just <lb/>
            and upright in distributing to each their due. For every one <lb/>
            is indignant beyond measure at being deprived of that which <lb/>
            belongs to himself in a peculiar manner; and there is no one <lb/>
            who is content at being deprived of his own property, though <lb/>
            one were to give him plenty of his neighbour's goods. And <lb/>
            in very truth nothing is so peculiarly the property of a wife as <lb/>
            a chaste and hallowed intercourse. And hence <lb/>
            it would not befit a prudent man to cast his seed, <lb/>
            wherever chance might take it, lest children should <lb/>
            Evils of pro­ <lb/>

            his legitimate sons; and by this the wife is robbed of her con- <pb n="300"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK L </note> <lb/>
            jugal rights, the children are injured, and above all, the hus­ <lb/>
            band himself is enveloped in disgrace. He ought therefore <lb/>
            to approach his wife with much self-restraint and decency, and <lb/>
            to maintain modesty in his words, and in his deeds a regard to <lb/>
            what is lawful and honest, and in his intercourse he should be <lb/>
            true and discreet. And to little errors, even though they be <lb/>
            voluntary, he ought to vouchsafe pardon ; and if she has made <lb/>
            any mistake through ignorance, he ought to advise her, and <lb/>
            not to inspire her with fear, except such as is accompanied <lb/>
            with reverence and respect. For such treatment would be <lb/>
            more suited to mistresses at the hands of their gallants. Yet, <lb/>
            Reverence and <lb/>
            fear. <lb/>
            nevertheless, justly to love her husband with re­ <lb/>
            verence and respect, and to be loved in turn, is <lb/>
            that which befits a wife of gentle birth, as to <lb/>
            her intercourse with her own husband. For tear is of two <lb/>
            kinds; the one kind is reverent and full of respect; such is <lb/>
            that which good sons exhibit towards their parents, and well- <lb/>
            ordered citizens towards those who rule them in a kindly <lb/>
            spirit. But the other kind is attended by hatred and aver­ <lb/>
            sion : such is that which slaves feel towards their masters, <lb/>
            and citizens towards unjust and lawless tyrants. Furthermore, <lb/>
            the husband ought to choose the best course out of all that we <lb/>
            have said above, and so to conciliate his wife to himself, and <lb/>
            to make her trustworthy and well disposed, as that whether <lb/>
            her husband be present or absent, she will be equally good, <lb/>
            while he can turn his attention to public matters: so that <lb/>
            even in his absence she may feel that no one is better, nor <lb/>
            more suited to herself, nor more nearly bound to her, than her <lb/>
            own husband: and that he may always direct his energies to <lb/>
            the public good, and show from the very first that such is the <lb/>
            case, even though she may be very young and quite inex­ <lb/>
            perienced in such matters. For if the husband should ever <lb/>
            begin such a course of conduct as this, and show himself to <lb/>
            be perfect master of himself, he would be the best guide of <lb/>
            the entire course of his life, and he would teach his wife to <lb/>
            adopt a similar mode of action.</p>

          <p>Homer joins <lb/>
            love and rever­ <lb/>
            ence.</p>
          <p>FOR even Homer would not praise either love 'or <lb/>
            fear apart from respect, but every where he in- <pb n="301"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. IX.] </note> <lb/>
            troduces friendship accompanied with modesty and reverence. <lb/>
            At all events he represents Helen as regarding Priam with <lb/>
            this kind of fear: for he says, <lb/>
            " Step-father dear, <lb/>
            Thou in mine eyes art honoured and revered:"1 <lb/>
            and by this he means nothing else except that her love is <lb/>
            accompanied with respect. And again, Ulysses thus ad­ <lb/>
            dresses Nausicaa, <lb/>
            " Lady, 1 do admire thee and revere." 2 <lb/>
            Homer accordingly considers that these are the mutual terms <lb/>
            on which a husband and wife should stand. For no one ad­ <lb/>
            mires and reverences his inferior; but such feelings arise only <lb/>
            in regard to beings superior to each other in nature, and more <lb/>
            friendly disposed; and further, in the case of persons inferior <lb/>
            to others in wisdom towards their superiors. Such were the <lb/>
            sentiments which Ulysses cherished towards Penelope, and <lb/>
            long as he was absent from his home, he did not fail in his <lb/>
            duty. Agamemnon, indeed, for the sake of <lb/>
            Chryseis, did err against his own wedded wife, <lb/>
            Agamemnon. <lb/>
            for he dared to say in the assembly of the Greeks, that a cap­ <lb/>
            tive lady, and in no way distinguished for her natural qua­ <lb/>
            lities, but rather (to speak plainly) sprung of barbarian origin, <lb/>
            was in no way inferior to Clytemnestra :3 and as he already <lb/>
            had sons born of her, he would seem to have acted amiss in <lb/>
            this matter. And how could he have been right, consider­ <lb/>
            ing that he took to himself Chryseis by force as a concubine, <lb/>
            even before he could know how she was disposed towards <lb/>
            him ? But, Ulysses, when the daughter of Atlas <lb/>
            earnestly besought him that he would remain with Ulysses. <lb/>
            her, promising that she would render him immortal, was not <lb/>
            willing even for the sake of this boon to give up the love and <lb/>
            affection and confidence of his wife, considering that immor­ <lb/>
            tality would be a severe infliction upon him as the price of <lb/>
            living on with villany.4 No, nor did he choose to live on <note type="footnote"> 1 11. iii. 172. </note><note type="footnote">2 Od. vi. 168. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 This refers to the well-known lines in II. A. 1. 113, etc. </note> <figure type="illustration">

              with Circe, although she promised to restore his companions ; <lb/>
              but he answered that nothing in his own eyes could be more <lb/>
              sweet than his country, rough and rugged though it were; <lb/>
              and he desired far more to behold his mortal wife and child, <lb/>
              than himself to possess immortality: and thus he continued to <lb/>
              preserve fidelity towards his wife firm and inviolate. So that, <lb/>
              as we might expect, he received a like return from his wife. <lb/>
              And further, too, in his speech addressed to Nausicaa, the <lb/>
              poet shows that he praises above all things the chaste inter­ <lb/>
              course between a husband and wife. For he there 2 prays the <lb/>
              gods that they will grant to her both her husband and home <lb/>
              and concord, and this of no common kind, but perfect. For <lb/>
              he says, <lb/>
              " There is no fairer thing, <lb/>
              Than when the lord and lady with one soul <lb/>
              One home possess."' <lb/>
              Here then, as is clear, the poet praises the mutual concord of <lb/>
              husband and wife, and that too not the mere agreement upon <lb/>
              servile matters, but that which is justly and harmoniously <lb/>
              based on intellect and prudence. For the words 11 possessing <lb/>
              one home with one soul," show this. Again, the same hero <lb/>
              says, that while such concord flourishes between a husband <lb/>
              and his wife, <lb/>
              " Comes many a tear to foes, much joy to friends."4</p>
          <p>Advantages of <lb/>
            domestic <lb/>
            concord.</p>
          <p>And the generality agree with him as speaking <lb/>
            truly. For when a man and his wife harmoniously <lb/>
            co-operate in the same concerns, it needs must <lb/>
            follow that the sentiments of both are the same. And in the <lb/>
            next place, gaining power by concord, they deprive their ene­ <lb/>
            mies of all hope of success, and they can assist their friends; <lb/>
            but when they are at variance with each other, then their <lb/>
            friends too are divided, and they especially feel their power­ <lb/>
            lessness. And hence the poet clearly admonishes the husband <lb/>
            and wife that they ought by no means to join together in <lb/>
            matters of villany and shame, but in matters just and right <lb/>
            to assist each other, by unity of purpose; and first of all in <lb/>
            every way to take care of their parents, the man regarding <lb/>
            those of his wife no less than his own, and the wife those of <note type="footnote"> 1 The story of Circe is given by Homer in Odyss. book x. 136—574. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Od. vi. 181. </note><note type="footnote">3 Od. vi. 182—185. </note><note type="footnote">4 Ibid. </note> <pb n="303"/>

            her husband. In the next place, it would be necessary for <lb/>
            both to take care of their children, friends, and fortunes, and <lb/>
            of the entire household, as being their common property, en­ <lb/>
            deavouring to outstrip each other in zeal and attentiveness, <lb/>
            that each may become the author of as much good as possible, <lb/>
            and may prove himself better and more scrupulously just: as <lb/>
            also to dismiss all haughtiness, and to adopt habits of industry, <lb/>
            and so with gentle and kindly rule to regulate the house; so <lb/>
            that when they are now arrived at old age, having bade fare­ <lb/>
            well to the duties of economy, and being freed from their <lb/>
            passions, they may be able to give, each to the other and to <lb/>
            their children, an account of their stewardship, as to which of <lb/>
            the two has throughout bestowed greater attention to the <lb/>
            management of their home, and so may know at once whether <lb/>
            misfortune has come by chance or success by merit. And <lb/>
            whichever has excelled in these respects, will obtain from the <lb/>
            gods one gift, the greatest of all. For, as Pindar says, <lb/>
            " Sweet hope that cheers the heart, bears company, <lb/>
            And proves the nurse of age." 1 <lb/>
            And also he will obtain another piece of good fortune, namely, <lb/>
            to be cherished in old age by his children. On this account, <lb/>
            both in public and private life, it would become the man who <lb/>
            would pass a happy life, to have a regard for all the gods and <lb/>
            his fellow-men, and especially for his wife, his children, and <lb/>
            his parents.</p>

            Four kinds of <lb/>
            economy. <lb/>
            are four kinds of economy, the regal, the satra­ <lb/>
            pical, the political, and the domestic; for all others, <lb/>
            as we shall find, fall under one or other of these <lb/>
            heads. But of these the greatest and most simple is the regal; <lb/>
            the most varied and easiest is the political; but the private is <lb/>
            of all of the least importance and most various. They must <lb/>
            of necessity have very many points in common with each other ; <lb/>
            but we must look to those points which belong to each of them <lb/>
            The regal. <lb/>
            distinctively. First, then, let us consider the re­ <lb/>
            gal. This kind, indeed, is general in its force, <lb/>
            and it contains four species, one concerning money, another <lb/>
            concerning exports, a third concerning imports, while a fourth <lb/>
            relates to expenditure. And to speak of these severally ; by <lb/>
            that which concerns money I mean, what coin should be raised <lb/>
            or lowered in price, and when ; and by that which refers to <lb/>
            exports and imports, when and what it will be profitable to <lb/>
            receive from the satraps in office, and to dispose for sale; and <lb/>
            as to expenditure, I mean what retrenchments must be made <lb/>
            and when, and whether we must contribute money towards <lb/>
            expenses, or those articles which are purchaseable by money. <lb/>
            The satrapical. <lb/>
            Its six <lb/>
            divisions. <lb/>
            And secondly, the satrapical. This embraces <lb/>
            six kinds of revenue, from the soil, from the pe­ <lb/>
            culiar productions of the country, from trade, from <lb/>
            tolls, from cattle, and from all other sources. <lb/>
            And of these kinds the best is that concerned with the pro­ <lb/>
            duce of land, (and this is what some call tithe,' and others <lb/>
            tenths ;) while next ranks that which is concerned with pecu­ <lb/>
            liar productions, as for example, with gold, or silver, or brass, <lb/>
            where they are severally found; thirdly comes that which has <lb/>
            to do with traffic; fourthly, that which arises from vegetable <lb/>
            produce and market tolls; while fifth is that which is con­ <lb/>
            cerned with cattle, and which is called usufruct or tithe; and <lb/>
            last in order is that derived from other sources, and which is <lb/>
            known by the names of a poll tax, or handicraft tax. But <lb/>
            thirdly, [let us consider] the political economy: <lb/>
            The political. and of this, the best is the income which arises <lb/>
            from the peculiar productions of the soil; next, that which <lb/>
            comes from traffic and carriage of goods; and then, that which <lb/>
            is derived from matters of every-day life. Fourth and last <note type="footnote"> 1 In this sense the word occurs in Herod. iv. 198, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκφόρια τον̃ κάρπον̃</foreign>. </note> <pb n="305"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. II.] </note> <lb/>
            comes the domestic economy; and this is the reverse of simple, <lb/>
            owing to the fact that a house cannot of necessity be managed <lb/>
            with a view to one single aim, and it is the least of all, because <lb/>
            its incomings and outgoings are on a small scale. And under <lb/>
            this kind of economy the least is an income derived from land, <lb/>
            secondly, from matters of daily life, and thirdly, from money. <lb/>
            And apart from these points (there is) a matter which belongs <lb/>
            in common to every kind of economy, and which we must <lb/>
            regard not as a casual matter, but as one which specially be­ <lb/>
            longs to this last kind; namely, that the expenses do not <lb/>
            exceed the incomings.</p>
          <p>Since, then, we have mentioned the divisions <lb/>
            ( of economy), next we must again ascertain, as to <lb/>
            the satrapy or the city about which we are con- <lb/>
            Practical <lb/>
            considerations. <lb/>
            sidering, whether it is able to bear all these kinds of expendi­ <lb/>
            ture which we have just now distinguished, or the greatest <lb/>
            of them. After this, which of the means of revenue either <lb/>
            do not exist at all, but yet may be made available, or are at <lb/>
            present small, and yet are capable of augmentation ; and out <lb/>
            of the present expenses, which and what amount may be re­ <lb/>
            moved without doing harm. We have spoken, then, as to the <lb/>
            various kinds of economy and their separate parts: but what­ <lb/>
            ever has been effected by any ancient writers as to the supply <lb/>

            from each individual, and ordered them to earn money with <lb/>
            the remainder. And when the year came round again he <lb/>
            did the very same thing; and so in ten years the result was, <note type="footnote"> I See Pol. v. 11, note, page 204. </note><note type="footnote"> X </note> <pb n="306"/>

          <p>Of the Clazo­ <lb/>
            menians.</p>
          <p>THE people of Clazomenæ, too, being afflicted <lb/>
            with famine and in want of money, decreed that <lb/>
            those private individuals who had any oil should <lb/>
            lend it to the city a!- a certain interest: now this fruit abounds <lb/>
            in their country. And having hired vessels from the lenders, <lb/>
            they sent them off to the marts from which they had their <lb/>
            supply of corn, leaving the value of the oil as a pledge. And <lb/>
            as they owed their soldiers pay to the amount of twenty <lb/>
            talents, and were not able to furnish it, they gave the ge­ <lb/>
            nerals four talents a year by way of interest. But when they <lb/>
            cut off nothing from the former debt, and were always ex­ <lb/>
            pending money to no purpose, they coined some money of iron <lb/>
            to stand in place of silver to the amount of twenty talents, <lb/>
            and giving silver to all the richest men in the state upon a <lb/>
            proportionate scale, they took back from them an equivalent. <lb/>
            So the private citizens had money to spend upon their daily <lb/>
            wants, and the city was freed from its debt. And, secondly, <lb/>
            out of their revenues they paid them the interest due, and <lb/>
            continually dividing it they gave a share to each, and called <lb/>
            in the iron coinage.</p>

          <p>THE Selybrians were in want of money; and as <lb/>
            there was a law among them not to export corn in <lb/>
            a season of famine, and they had stores of corn of <lb/>
            the preceding year, they passed a decree that private persons <lb/>
            should give up their corn to the state at the fixed price, each <lb/>
            leaving behind a year's supply: then they gave leave to any <lb/>
            one who chose to export it, affixing to it such a price as <lb/>
            seemed good to them. <note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕθηκε, κ. τ</foreign>. X. In that case the conjunction <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὲ</foreign> must be expunged, and <lb/>

            sessed, and having ordered them to pay the sum of silver <lb/>
            which was necessary from the pillars of the temple, they <lb/>

          <p>DIONYSIUS of Syracuse, wishing to collect toge­ <lb/>
            ther some money, called an assembly, and said <lb/>
            that he had seen Demeter, who bade him offer at <lb/>
            Of Dionysius <lb/>
            at Syracuse. <lb/>
            her temple the ornaments of the women. He said that he for <lb/>
            his part had done this with the ornaments of the women in <lb/>
            his own family, and he urged the others to do the same, lest <lb/>
            some vengeance from the gods should befall them ; and as for <lb/>
            the man who refused to do thus, he declared that he should be <lb/>
            deemed guilty of sacrilege. And when all had brought what­ <lb/>
            ever they possessed, through fear of the goddess and himself, <lb/>
            he dedicated all the ornaments to the goddess, and took it <lb/>
            back himself as a loan from the goddess. And as time went <lb/>
            on, and the women were beginning to wear gold again, he <lb/>
            ordered that all women who wished to wear it should offer a <lb/>
            certain specified sum at the temple. And being about to build <lb/>
            some triremes, he knew that he should be in want of money. <lb/>
            So he convened an assembly, and said that a certain city was <pb n="314"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK II </note> <lb/>
            on the point of being betrayed to him, but that he wanted mo­ <lb/>
            ney for that purpose; and he urged the citizens each to bring <lb/>
            him 2 staters: and they brought them. And after an inter­ <lb/>
            val of two or three days, he pretended to have failed of his <lb/>
            purpose, and having praised them, he gave back to each <lb/>
            what they had brought. And by so doing, he gained over the <lb/>
            citizens to his cause. Then they brought contributions again, <lb/>
            thinking that they should get back their money; but he took <lb/>
            them and kept them for the purpose of his ship-building. <lb/>
            And when he was short of money he coined some of tin, and <lb/>
            having convened an assembly, he spoke much on behalf of the <lb/>
            new coinage: and they passed a decree, even against their <lb/>
            will, that each would consider what he should take of it as <lb/>
            silver, and not a baser metal. Again, being in want of money, <lb/>
            he urged the citizens to bring in their contributions: but they <lb/>
            said that they had nothing to give. Accordingly he brought <lb/>
            out the domestic utensils from his own house, as though obliged <lb/>
            to do so for want; and when the Syracusans bought them, he <lb/>
            wrote down what each bought, and as soon as they had put <lb/>
            down the money, he ordered them each to carry back the <lb/>
            vessel which he had bought. And as the citizens, owing to <lb/>
            the property taxes, were unable to keep cattle, he said that he <lb/>
            now had enough for such and such a purpose, and that there­ <lb/>
            fore those who had any cattle should henceforth be free of tax. <lb/>
            And when many of them soon got cattle under the idea that <lb/>
            they should have them free of tax, as soon as he thought a fit <lb/>
            occasion was come, he ordered them to assess their value and <lb/>
            laid a tax upon them. The citizens accordingly were indig­ <lb/>
            nant at the deceit of Dionysius, so they began to slaughter and <lb/>
            sell them. And when, to meet this, he ordered them to <lb/>
            slaughter only as much as was wanted from day to day, they <lb/>
            in turn accounted them as victims; but he forbade them to <lb/>
            sacrifice any female. Again, when he was in want of money, <lb/>
            he bade all the families of orphans to send him in a list of <lb/>
            their property; and when others had sent in their inventory, <lb/>
            he was satisfied with the enjoyment of their property until <lb/>
            they severally arrived at full age. And having surprised <lb/>
            Rhegium, he collected an assembly, and said that they might <lb/>
            very justly have been reduced by him to slavery, but that now <lb/>
            he was willing to let them off on receiving the amount which <lb/>
            they had spent upon the war, and 3 minæ besides for each <pb n="315"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. XXII. XXIII.] </note> <lb/>
            individual. But the Rhegians brought to light all their hidden <lb/>
            treasures, and the poor borrowed from the rich and from the <lb/>
            strangers, and so brought him the money which he demanded. <lb/>
            And when he had taken this from them, he nevertheless sold <lb/>
            their persons, and seized upon all their disclosed treasures <lb/>
            which up to that time had been concealed. And having bor­ <lb/>
            rowed money from the citizens upon a promise of restoring it, <lb/>
            when they began to demand it back, he bade them bring him <lb/>
            all the silver that they each possessed, threatening them with <lb/>
            death as the punishment, in case they failed to do so. And <lb/>
            when the money was brought, he stamped it anew, and gave <lb/>
            out the drachma of the value of two drachmas, and they <lb/>
            brought back to him the debt which was previously owing. <lb/>
            And sailing to Tyrrhenia with a hundred ships, he took out <lb/>
            of the temple of Leucothea gold and silver, and other orna­ <lb/>
            ments, to no inconsiderable amount. And the sailors brought <lb/>
            it all back, supposing that when they had brought half of it, <lb/>
            they would have the rest without being disturbed. But as <lb/>
            soon as they had received it, he ordered them to go back and <lb/>
            fetch the rest.</p>

          <p>THE Mendeans expended on the regulation of their <lb/>
            city the income arising from harbour-dues and other <lb/>
            tolls, and they did not exact the tribute arising <lb/>
            Of the Men­ <lb/>
            deans. <lb/>
            from land and houses, but entered on a register those who <lb/>
            had property, and, whenever they wanted money, those who <lb/>
            owed it paid it. They made a profit accordingly during the <lb/>
            time which had elapsed, being satisfied with their money for <lb/>
            which no interest was paid. But on making war against Olyn­ <lb/>
            thus, and finding themselves in want of money, as they had a <lb/>
            stock of slaves, they passed a decree to leave each man a male <lb/>
            and female slave, and to sell the rest to the city, so that indi­ <lb/>
            viduals might lend out their money to the city at interest.</p>

            Callistratus caused them to fetch double of that amount; for <lb/>

            it was necessary to make men worth one talent at least bail <lb/>
            for every twenty talents, he issued a proclamation, that any <lb/>

            should be given for a third part only, and at any rate that <lb/>

          <p>Of Timotheus.</p>
          <p>TIMOTHEUS, an Athenian, making war on the <lb/>
            Olynthians, and being in want of silver, coined <lb/>
            some brass money and gave it to the soldiers; and when <lb/>
            the soldiers were indignant, he said that the merchants and <lb/>
            petty dealers would all sell to them in the same way as <lb/>
            before. And he proclaimed to the merchants, that if any <lb/>
            of them should receive brass money, he should buy with it <lb/>
            the marketable produce of the land, and whatever was <lb/>
            gathered from the plains; and that whatever brass money <lb/>
            they should have left about them they should bring back to <lb/>
            him and take silver instead. And being at war about Cor­ <lb/>
            cyra and finding himself in a strait, as his soldiers began to <lb/>
            demand their pay, refusing to obey him, and threatening to go <lb/>
            off to the enemy, he convened an assembly, and said that owing <lb/>
            to the storms his money could not be sent to him, but that he <lb/>
            had such an abundant supply that he would give them the <lb/>
            city which had been betrayed, as provisions for three months, <lb/>
            free of cost. And imagining that Timotheus would never pro­ <lb/>
            mise them so large a store of money, if he did not really expect <lb/>
            that the money would come to him, they said nothing about <lb/>
            the pay, until he had arranged matters as he wished. And <lb/>
            besieging Samoa, he sold back to the Samians their fruits and <lb/>
            what was on their fields, so that he had a plentiful supply of <lb/>
            money to pay his soldiers. And when there was a scarcity <lb/>
            of provisions in the camp, owing to the influx of new comers, <lb/>
            he forbade them to sell their corn ground, or any measure of <lb/>
            it less than a medimnus, or any thing less than a metrete of <lb/>
            liquids. The taxiarchs accordingly, and the captains of com­ <lb/>
            panies, bought it wholesale and distributed it to the soldiers, <lb/>
            and they came up and carried off with them their provisions; <pb n="317"/>
            <note type="margin"> CHAP. XXV. XXVI. J </note> <lb/>
            and whenever they departed back, they sold whatever they had <lb/>
            over: so that it came to pass that the soldiers had a good <lb/>
            supply of provisions.</p>

          <p>DIDALES, a Persian, having soldiers under him, <lb/>
            was able to supply them with their daily rations <lb/>
            Of Didales. <lb/>
            from the enemy's land ; but as he had no money to give <lb/>
            them, and he was asked for it at the time when it became <lb/>
            due, he made the following contrivance. He called an <lb/>
            assembly and said that he had no lack of money, but that <lb/>
            he had it at a certain place, specifying where. And har­ <lb/>
            nessing his mules, he went towards the spot; but when he <lb/>
            came near to it, and going forward into it, he took out from <lb/>
            among the sacred things stored up, all the silver plate that <lb/>
            was there, and then went his way having so arranged his <lb/>
            mules as if they were really conveying coined silver and <lb/>
            exhibiting it. And when the soldiers saw this, they thought <lb/>
            that it was all silver which they were carrying, and took <lb/>
            courage as though they were about to gain their pay. But <lb/>
            he said that they must come to Amisus and signify their <lb/>
            approval. Now the journey to Amisus was one of many days <lb/>
            and difficult; so accordingly, during that time he satisfied the <lb/>
            army by merely giving them their provisions. But he him­ <lb/>
            self kept in hand the artificers in the camp, and those who <lb/>
            traded in any articles of merchandise ; and no one else was <lb/>

            dition and was in want of money, to take one of the priests and <lb/>
            a quantity of the victims, and to say to the priests that they must <lb/>
            be discharged on account of the expense. And when the priests <lb/>
            heard it, each of them wished the victim to be in their own <lb/>
            hands, and so they each offered money separately for them­ <lb/>
            selves. And when he had received money from them all, he <lb/>
            bade them give them an order, that they should set down to <lb/>
            the account of the temple and himself, the tenth part of the <pb n="318"/>

            rest to him until the war against the king should be brought <lb/>
            to an end. And he ordered them all to bring in a contribu­ <lb/>
            tion from every family, fixing the requisite sum, and likewise <lb/>
            a fine upon every head. And when corn was sold, he ordered <lb/>
            that the buyer and seller should deduct from the actual price, <lb/>
            and give him an obol out of every artabe, and from the <lb/>

            other employment, he bade that the tenth part should be paid. <lb/>
            And when he was about to lead his army out of the country, <lb/>
            if any one chanced to possess any uncoined gold or silver, he <lb/>
            ordered him to bring it to him ; and when most had brought <lb/>
            what they had, he bade them make use of it; but those who <lb/>
            lent it he placed together with his captains, so that he could <lb/>
            pay them out of the tribute.</p>

            him. He claimed of them, therefore, at all events to grant <lb/>
            him some men out of the body of citizens as guards for cer­ <lb/>
            tain strongholds, that he might be able to make the most out <lb/>
            of the soldiers who were then on guard there. They speedily <lb/>
            did so, as they deemed that they would themselves gain the <lb/>
            post. But Cotys having made a garrison with those who <lb/>

            of money, he ordered them to contribute, saying that they <lb/>
            should be repaid out of the tribute; but they gave in their <lb/>
            contributions, considering that the repayment would be <lb/>
            speedy; and when the time came for laying down the money, <lb/>
            he said that he had need of this also as well, but that he <lb/>
            would hereafter repay them with interest. And the soldiers <lb/>
            who were with him he deprived of their provisions and their <lb/>
            pay for six days every year, saying that on these days they <lb/>
            need not keep watch, or make any expedition, or incur any <lb/>
            expense, meaning the days superfluous in the calendar.1 And <lb/>
            during the previous time he gave to the soldiers their pro­ <lb/>
            visions on the second of the month, thus omitting three days <lb/>
            in the former month, and five in the following; and in this <lb/>

          <p>CHARIDEMUS of Orus, being in possession of cer­ <lb/>
            tain places in JEolis, asked for money to pay his <lb/>
            soldiers, as Artabazus was leading an army <lb/>
            against him. At first indeed they gave in their contribu­ <lb/>
            tions, but afterwards they said that they could do so no <lb/>
            longer. But Charidemus bade the place which he con­ <lb/>
            sidered the richest, to send off into another place whatever <lb/>
            they possessed in coin or any other valuable property, saying <lb/>
            that he would give them an escort; and further he showed <lb/>
            that he was ready to do so. And when the men were per­ <lb/>
            suaded, he led them a little way out of the city, and having <lb/>
            inquired how much they had, he took all that he had need of, <lb/>
            and sent them back again to the place. And having issued <lb/>
            a proclamation in the cities under his command, that no one <lb/>
            should possess in his house any kind of arms, but that if he <lb/>
            did so he should pay a specified fine, he disregarded the mat­ <lb/>
            ter and made no further concern of it. And the citizens be­ <lb/>
            ginning to think that the proclamation had been made as a <lb/>
            dead letter, kept what each of them chanced to have as before. <lb/>
            But on a sudden he made a search into their houses, and <lb/>
            enacted the fine from all those in whose houses he found any <lb/>
            arms.</p>

          <p>CLEOMENES of Alexandria being Satrap in Egypt, <lb/>
            forbade the exportation of corn during a season <lb/>
            Of Cleomenes. <lb/>
            of famine, in which other parts suffered severely, and Egypt <lb/>
            to a lesser extent. And as the nomarchs said that they <lb/>
            should not be able to pay their tribute, owing to the non­ <lb/>
            exportation of corn, he allowed it to be exported, but put a <lb/>
            high price upon the supply of food; so that in the end, <lb/>
            though but little was exported, he received a large sum, <lb/>
            and the nomarchs themselves were deprived of their excuse. <lb/>
            And as he was sailing through those parts where the cro­ <lb/>
            codile is regarded as a god, one of his slaves was seized by <lb/>
            the monster. Accordingly he called the priests together and <lb/>
            said, that as he had been injured first, he would punish the <lb/>
            crocodiles, and he ordered them to hunt them. But the <lb/>
            priests, fearing that their god would be despised, collected <lb/>
            together and gave him as much gold as they were able, <lb/>
            and so he desisted from his purpose. And when king Alex­ <lb/>
            ander enjoined upon him to found a city near to Pharos, and <lb/>
            there to establish the mart which was hitherto at Can opus, he <lb/>
            ailed down to Canopus to the priests and the wealthy indi­ <lb/>
            viduals, and said that he had come there for the purpose of <lb/>
            removing their settlement. But the priests and inhabitants <lb/>
            contributed to give him a sum of money that he might leave <lb/>
            their mart as it was. He took it and at that time departed, <lb/>
            but afterwards, having sailed down, when he had every thing <lb/>
            ready for building, he asked them for money to an immens <note type="footnote">IT </note> <pb n="322"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="LBOOK n."/> <lb/>
            amount: for that this was the matter which concerned him, <lb/>
            whether the mart should be there or not. And when they <lb/>
            said that they could give him nothing, he removed them else­ <lb/>
            where. And having sent a person to purchase something, <lb/>
            and perceiving that he had hit upon it very cheap, and was <lb/>
            about to reckon it to himself at a very high price, he told the <lb/>
            friends of the purchaser that he had heard that he had made <lb/>
            his purchase very dear, and so that he would not have any <lb/>
            thing to do with it: and at the same time, with assumed <lb/>
            anger, he reproved him for his doltishness. But, on hearing <lb/>
            this, they said that he ought not to believe those who said <lb/>
            any thing against him, until he should come before him and <lb/>
            render an account himself. And when the purchaser came, <lb/>
            they told him what they had heard from Cleomenes ; and <lb/>
            wishing to show them and Cleomenes what he had done, he <lb/>
            brought back the money with which he had made the pur­ <lb/>
            chase. And when corn was being sold in the country for ten <lb/>
            drachmae, he called the corn-factors to him, and asked them <lb/>
            on what terms they would negociate with him; and they said <lb/>
            that they would sell to him for less than the price at which <lb/>
            they sold to the merchants. But he ordered them to give <lb/>
            him corn at the same price as they sold to others, and then <lb/>
            sold it himself, fixing the price at thirty-two drachmae. He <lb/>
            also called the priests together, and said, that the expenditure <lb/>
            upon the temples in the country was too great: and that con­ <lb/>
            sequently the greater part of the temples and of the priests <lb/>
            must be put down. But the priests, both singly and collec­ <lb/>
            tively, gave him the sacred treasures, fancying that this was <lb/>
            what he was about to take, and each wishing that his own <lb/>
            temple should remain as it was before, and that he should <lb/>
            himself be continued in the office of a priest.</p>

            had enforced this law. Accordingly he watched the time <lb/>

            journeying from home on their own account, and when many <lb/>
            gifts were likely to be brought, and then he exacted a tenth <lb/>
            part according to the established law. And when again he <lb/>
            was seeking to provide money, he ordered every one who <lb/>
            pleased to enter the names of the slaves in the army at such a <lb/>
            price as he chose, and that they should pay him eight drachm æ <lb/>
            a year; and if the slave should run away, he promised that <lb/>
            the value enrolled upon the slave should be restored then . <lb/>
            Accordingly, a great body of slaves were enrolled, and he <lb/>
            gained a considerable sum of money. But if any slave ran <lb/>
            away, he used to order the satrap of the part in which the <lb/>
            camp stood, either to recover him, or pay the amount to the <lb/>
            owner.</p>

            follows. Not only as regards terrestrial plants, but likewise terrestrial <lb/>
            animals, a fertility and sterility both of soul and body take place; when <lb/>
             <pb n="326"/>
            the revolutions of the heavenly bodies complete the periphery of their <lb/>
            respective orbits, which are shorter to the shorter lived, and contrariwise <lb/>
            to the contrary; and with reference to the fertility and sterility of your <lb/>
            race, though those are wise whom you have trained as governors of the <lb/>
            state, yet they will never, by intellect and sense united, observe the pro­ <lb/>
            per season for procreation, but let it slip by, and sometimes generate <lb/>
            children when they ought not. To that, however, which is divinely ge­ <lb/>
            nerated, there is a period which is comprehended by the perfect number ; <lb/>
            whereas, to that generated by man, there is one, in which the augmentations <lb/>
            of the surpassing and surpassed, after having received three separations <lb/>
            and four boundaries of things similar and dissimilar, increasing and de­ <lb/>
            creasing, will render all things correspondent and rational; of which the <lb/>
            sesquiternian root conjoined with the pentad, and thrice increased, affords <lb/>
            two harmonies; one of these, the equally equal, just a hundred times as <lb/>
            much; while the other, of equal length indeed, but of oblong shape, is <lb/>
            of a hundred numbers from enable diameters of the pentad, each wanting <lb/>
            one, two of which are irrational, and of a hundred cubes of the triad. <lb/>
            And the whole of this geometric number, having such an influence, is <lb/>
            concerned with worse and better generations. Now, if our governors be <lb/>
            ignorant of this, and join our couples together unseasonably, the children <lb/>
            will neither possess talent nor be fortunate either." Mr. Burges remarks <lb/>
            in a note that this passage of Plato, descriptive of the geometric or fatal <lb/>
            number, has baffled the ingenuity of every commentator; but he gives, in <lb/>
            an appendix at the end of his volume, the views of Baroccius, Schneider, <lb/>
            and others, at the same time pronouncing them one and all to be most <lb/>
            unsatisfactory. We may observe that the passage of Aristotle which we <lb/>
            have before us, though involving a most obscure quotation from Plato, is <lb/>
            passed over without note or comment (as hopeless) by Sylburgius in his <lb/>
            edition of the Politics (Oxford, 1810) ; but Lambinus translates it thus, <lb/>
            " Horum autem esse principium ea quorum radix sesquitertia numero <lb/>
            quinario juncta, duos concentus efficit: quod futurum est, (inquit) cum <lb/>
            hujus descriptæ figuræ numerus solidus factus fuerit, proinde quasi natura <lb/>
            males homines, et nullâ disciplinâ sanabiles, aliquando gignat.'* Taylor <lb/>
            translates it nearly as I have done in the text. Mr. Barges tells us that <lb/>
            " Baroccius considers the sesquitertian progeny (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπίτριτος ἐπυθμήν</foreign>), to be <lb/>
            a root or prime number, and fixes on the number seven as its representa­ <lb/>
            tive (4 + 3 == 7). Further, by the two harmonies, he (Baroccius) sup­ <lb/>
            poses Plato to mean the connexion between the square and cube of twelve, <lb/>
            -which is itself made up of seven and five, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπίτριτος πυθμὴν πεμπάδ</foreign><unclear/> <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">συξυγεὶς</foreign>)–i. e. 144 and 1728—twelve being a number often mentioned by <lb/>
            Plato as not only perfect, but the type of perfection. If this be granted, <lb/>
            the geometric, or perfect, or fatal number may be considered to be 1728, <lb/>
            the cube of 12. This opinion, however, is opposed by Schneider, who <lb/>
            conceives it to be 216, i. e. 63, which is made up of three other cubes, <lb/>
            viz. 27, 64, and 125, i. e. 33, 43, and 53. Others again have considered <lb/>
            the root to be 9, the cube-root of 729."</p>
          <p>Taylor takes a different view of the matter; and I have thought it best to <lb/>
            give here a large portion of his note entire. " By the sesquitertian progeny, <lb/>
            Plato means the number 95; for this number is composed of the addition <lb/>
            of the squares of the numbers 4 and 3, which form the first sesquitertian <lb/>
            ratio, (viz. 25,) and the number 70, which is composed of 40 and 30, and <lb/>
             <pb n="327"/>
            therefore consists of two numbers in a sesquitertian ratio. This number <lb/>
            conjoined with 5, and thrice increased, produces ten thousand and a million. <lb/>
            For 100 X 100 = 10,000, and 10,000 X 100 = 1,000,000. But it must <lb/>
            here be observed, that these two numbers ... appear to be considered by <lb/>
            Plato as analogous to two parallelopipedons; the former, namely, ten thou­ <lb/>
            sand, being formed out of 10 X 10 X 100, and the latter, a million, from 1000 <lb/>
            X 10 X 100. These two numbers are called by Plato ' two harmonies, <lb/>
            for the following reason: Simplicius, in his Commentary on Aristotle's <lb/>
            book De Cœlo, informs us that a cube among the Pythagoreans was de. <lb/>
            nominated ' harmony,' because it consists of 12 bounding lines, 8 angles, <lb/>
            and 6 sides ; and 12, 8, and 6 are in harmonic proportion. For the dif­ <lb/>
            ference between 12 and 8 is to the difference between 8 and 6, 1. e. 4 is to <lb/>
            2, as the first term is to the third, viz. as 12 is to 6; which, as is well <lb/>
            known, is the law of harmonic proportion. As a parallelopipedon, there­ <lb/>
            fore, has the same number of sides, angles, and bounding lines as a cube, <lb/>
            the reason is obvious why the numbers 10,000 and 100,000 are called by <lb/>
            Plato harmonies. Hence, also, it is evident why he says that the other <lb/>
            of these harmonies, viz. a million, is of equal length indeed, but more <lb/>
            oblong: for if we call 100 the breadth and 10 the depth, both of 10,000 <lb/>
            and 1,000,000, it is evident, that the latter number, when considered <lb/>
            as produced by 1000 X 10 X 100, will be analogous to a more oblong <lb/>
            parallelopipedon than the former.</p>
          <p>" Again, when he says that the number 1,000,000 consists of a hundred <lb/>
            numbers from enable numbers of pentads, each being deficient by unity, <lb/>
            and from two that are ineffable, and from a hundred cubes of the triad, <lb/>
            his meaning is as follows. The number 1,000,000 consists of a hundred <lb/>
            numbers, i. e. of a hundred such numbers as 10,000, each of which is <lb/>
            composed from enable diameters of pentads, etc. But in order to under­ <lb/>
            stand the truth of this assertion, it is necessary to understand that there <lb/>
            are certain numbers which are called by arithmeticians enable dia­ <lb/>
            meters. These, also, are two-fold; for some are the diameters of even <lb/>
            squares, and others of odd squares. And the diameters of enable even <lb/>
            squares, when multiplied into themselves, produce square numbers <lb/>
            double of the squares of which they are the diameters with an excess <lb/>
            of unity. Thus for instance, the number 3 multiplied into itself pro­ <lb/>
            duces 9, which is double of the square number 4 with an excess of unity, <lb/>
            and therefore 3 will be the diameter of the even square 4. But the <lb/>
            diameters of enable odd square numbers are in power double of the <lb/>
            squares of which they are diameters by a deficiency of unity. Thus, the <lb/>
            number 7, multiplied into itself, produces 49, which is double of the <lb/>
            odd square number 25 by a deficiency of unity. This being premised, <lb/>
            it follows that the number 10,000 will consist of a certain number of <lb/>
            heptads; for 7 is the enable diameter of the square number 25; and <lb/>
            from what follows, it will be found that this number is 1386.</p>
          <p>"But the number 10,000 not only consists of 1386 heptads, but Plato <lb/>
            also adds, ' from two numbers that are ineffable;' viz. from two num­ <lb/>
            bers the roots of which cannot be exactly obtained or expressed either in <lb/>
            whole numbers or in fractions, such as the roots of the numbers 2 and 8. <lb/>
            The numbers 15 and 13 also are of this kind. and appear to be the num­ <lb/>
            bers signified by Plato. In the last place he adds, ' and from 100 cubes <lb/>
            of the triad,' viz. from the number 270; for this is equal to a hundred <lb/>
             <pb n="328"/>
            times 27, the cube of 3. The numbers then which form 10,000 are as <lb/>
            below. <lb/>
            1386 <lb/>
            1 <lb/>
            9702 <lb/>
            15 <lb/>
            13 <lb/>
            270 <lb/>
            10,000 <lb/>
            viz. 1386 heptads, two ineffable numbers, (15 and 13,) and a hundred <lb/>
            times the cube of 3, (270); and so the whole geometric number is <lb/>
            1,000,000." But in asserting that 270 is a hundred times the cube of 3, <lb/>
            Taylor is obviously at fault; for the cube of 3 is 27, and this number <lb/>
            multiplied by 100 becomes 2700, not 270. Unless, then, some error lies <lb/>
            in the text of Plato, (which is hinted in no edition of the Republic that <lb/>
            I have been able to consult,) this one mistake is fatal to Taylor's <lb/>
            theory. It is quite clear that he has chosen a million as the perfect <lb/>
            number quite arbitrarily; and that in order to make his figures come <lb/>
            right, he has done his sum backwards, taking 1386, as being the 7th part <lb/>
            of the excess of 10,000 above 298. It is curious, however, that 1386, as <lb/>
            well as 9702, is divisible by 7.</p>
          <p>While so little certain information concerning the Pythagorean num­ <lb/>
            bers has been handed down to us, or been discovered by the re­ <lb/>
            searches of antiquarians and mathematicians, it is impossible to pronounce <lb/>
            a decisive opinion upon the main difficulty in the text of Aristotle, who <lb/>
            of course is borrowing the language of Plato, inherited by him again from <lb/>
            the old Pythagorean school of philosophy. For further information <lb/>
            the reader will do well to consult Taylor's note on the fifth book of the <lb/>
            Politics, and the references given by Mr. Burges in the Appendix to vol. <lb/>
            ii. of his translation of Plato.</p>

          </head>
          <p>"His passion at this time was for Aristotlethose who knew him <lb/>
            will bear witness how deeply he was imbued with Aristotle's language and <lb/>
            ideas; how, in earnest and unreserved conversation, or in writing, his train <lb/>
            of thoughts was affected by them-how he cited the maxims of the <lb/>
            Stagirite as oracles, and how his language was racily pointed with phrases <lb/>
            from him. I never knew a man who made such familiar, even fond, use <lb/>
            of an author-and when he was selecting his son's university, with much <lb/>
            leaning for Cambridge, and many things which made him incline against <lb/>
            Oxford, Aristotle turned the scale.</p>
          <p>"'I would not consent,' said he, to send my son to a university where <lb/>
            he would lose the study of him.'</p>
          <p>"'You may believe,' he said, with regard to the London University, <lb/>
            'that I have not forgotten the dear old Stagirite in our examinations, and <lb/>
            I hope he will be construed and discussed in Somerset House as well as <lb/>
            in the schools.'"</p>
          <p>" I am getting pretty well to understand the history of the Roman <lb/>
            kings, and to commence writing. One of my most useful books is dear <lb/>
            old Tottle's (Aristotle's) Politics, which give one so full a notion of the <lb/>
            state of society and opinions in old times, that, by their aid, one can pick <lb/>
            out the wheat from the chaff in Livy with great success."</p>
          <p>11 It is just as impossible for a man to understand the questions which <lb/>
            are now so much agitated of Church authority and Church government, <lb/>
            without a knowledge of the great questions of law and government, as it <lb/>
            is to understand any matter avowedly political: and therefore the Politics <lb/>
            of Aristotle are to me of a very great and direct we every day of my</p>
