          <p>IN the present volume are contained those dialogues <lb/>
            which, although considered spurious by the generality of <lb/>
            critics, are always found in the complete editions of Plato. <lb/>
            To these are added the three several Lives attributed <lb/>
            to Diogenes Laertius, Hesychius, and Olympiodorus, <lb/>
            and the two Introductions to the Platonic System by <lb/>
            Alcinous and Albinus; also the three books of Apu­ <lb/>
            leius relating to the Philosophy and Logic of Plato and <lb/>
            Aristotle.</p>
          <p>Of all these works, the only portions which have hither­ <lb/>
            to appeared in an English dress, are the Epinomis, the <lb/>
            Life of Plato by Diogenes Laertius, and the Introduc­ <lb/>
            tion of Alcinous. But even of these not one has been <lb/>
            translated directly from the original.* In the Epinomis, <lb/>
            Taylor followed the Latin version of Ficinus as revised <lb/>
            by Grynæus; and Stanley, strange to say, adopted, in <lb/>
            preference to the Greek, Ficinus's Latin version of <lb/>
            Alcinous as revised by D. Heinsius; while Smith, in <note type="footnote"> * Since this preface was written, a complete translation of Diogenes <lb/>
            Laertius (from the Greek) has been published in Bohn's Classical Library. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="viii"/>
            his abridged translation of Diogenes Laertius, has fol­ <lb/>
            lowed the Latin version given by Stephens.</p>
          <p>To render this edition as perfect as possible, it has <lb/>
            been deemed advisable to insert Sydenham's Introduc­ <lb/>
            tion to the Doctrines of Plato ; a copious selection from <lb/>
            the Notes of Gray, as published by Matthias in the 2nd <lb/>
            volume of his edition of the Works of that poet; and a <lb/>
            General Index to the entire work.</p>

            <title type="main">INTRODUCTION TO THE EPINOMIS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>ALTHOUGH this dialogue is called the Epinomis, which might be <lb/>
            rendered into English by " A Sequel to the Laws," yet it contains <lb/>
            not a single hint for an enactment of any kind. It is in fact little <lb/>
            more than a Homily, written for the most part on the Laws, vii. § <lb/>
            20—22, p. 300—308, and it seems to be the production of some <lb/>
            Pythagorean; who, perceiving that Plato had adopted some of the <lb/>
            ideas promulgated by that school of philosophy, was desirous of <lb/>
            showing that he had only partially touched upon their tenets relat­ <lb/>
            ing to numbers. For with this question were intimately connected <lb/>
            all their ideas relating to the power and attributes of the deity. <lb/>
            And this the writer was the more willing to dilate upon, as Plato <lb/>
            had expressed his unwillingness to discuss the subject of religion at <lb/>
            a greater length. For after witnessing the fate of Socrates, who had <lb/>
            endeavoured to rationalize the creed of his country, Plato probably <lb/>
            thought it dangerous, as Aristotle certainly did afterwards, to run <lb/>
            counter to popular prejudices; and he was therefore led to remark, <lb/>
            that all the enactments relating to religion should be left to the dis­ <lb/>
            cretion of its ministers, assisted by the interpreters of the voice of <lb/>
            the gods.</p>
          <p>Respecting the author of the dialogue, nothing is known for cer­ <lb/>
            tain. Thus much however is tolerably clear, that it was not written <lb/>
            by Plato. For, as remarked by Ast on § 7, where mention is made <lb/>
            of the five elements, out of which all living things are said to be <lb/>
            formed, this doctrine is at variance with that promulgated in the <lb/>
            Timæus, where only four are enumerated. But when in § 5, where <lb/>
            the Athenian Guest alludes to some memoranda made by Clinias <lb/>
            and Megillus of the previous conversation, Ast would infer that the <lb/>
            Laws had been published already, he seems not to be aware that an <note type="footnote"> B </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="2"/>
            inference the very reverse ought to be drawn. For the memoranda <lb/>
            would rather be made shortly after the conversation had taken <lb/>
            place, just as was done by Xenophon in the case of Socrates, with <lb/>
            a view to their being published afterwards. And hence we can ac­ <lb/>
            count for the tradition, that the Laws were not given to the world, <lb/>
            till after the death of their author.</p>
          <p>The Epinomis is indeed attributed to Plato by Nicomachus; but <lb/>
            not by Proclus, as has been sometimes asserted. For Boeckh has <lb/>
            shown that the Neo-Platonist on Euclid i. p. 12, originally expressed <lb/>
            himself in a way to indicate that he did not know who was the author <lb/>
            of the dialogue. Boeckh himself feels inclined to assign the author­ <lb/>
            ship to Philip of Opuntium; who appears from Suidas to have <lb/>
            written not a little on subjects relating to Arithmetic, Geometry, <lb/>
            and Astronomy, all of which are discussed at greater or less length <lb/>
            in the Epinomis.</p>
          <p>Be however the author who he may, the dialogue itself has, like <lb/>
            the Laws, come down to us in rather an unsatisfactory state; and <lb/>
            hence I have been compelled to write longer notes than would <lb/>
            otherwise have been necessary.</p>

          <p>[1.] Clinias. ACCORDING to our agreement, we have all of us, <lb/>
            guest, come correctly, being three, I, and you, and Megillus <lb/>
            here, to consider the question of intellect, in what manner it is <lb/>
            meet to go through in a discourse that, which we say belongs <lb/>
            to the constitution of man, (and which,)1 when it has been <lb/>
            thought upon, causes 2 it to be in the best state with regard to it­ <lb/>
            self,3 as far as it is possible for man to possess it. For, as we assert, <lb/>
            we have gone through all the other matters, that existed, re­ <lb/>
            lating to the laying down of laws. But that, which is of the <lb/>
            greatest moment to discover and to speak of, namely, by learn­ <lb/>
            ing what will a mortal man become wise, this we have neither <lb/>
            spoken of nor discovered. Now then let us endeavour not to <lb/>
            leave this behind. For we should nearly do that imperfectly, <lb/>
            for the sake of which we have all rushed onwards, with the view <lb/>
            of making clear (every thing) 4 from the beginning to the end.</p>
          <p>Athenian Guest. You speak well, friend Clinias. But I <note type="footnote"> 1 I have translated, as if <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅ τε</foreign> had dropt out before <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅταν</foreign>— </note><note type="footnote"> 2, 3 I have adopted <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποιει̃</foreign>, found in the best MS. Z., in lieu of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποιει̃ν</foreign> : <lb/>
            which I cannot understand; nor could, I think, Ficinus, who has omitted it <lb/>
            in his version, adopted in part by Taylor, " quo intellecto, humanus habitus <lb/>
            optime se, quantum natura fert, ad prudentiam habet." From which <lb/>
            however it is easy to see that he found in his MS. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πϱὸς ἑαυτὴν</foreign>, of which <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πϱὸς φϱόνησιν</foreign> would be the interpretation. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 I have translated, as if <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάντα</foreign> had dropt out before <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποιήσοντες</foreign>. Fi­ <lb/>
            cinus avoids the difficulty by thus abridging two sentences into one, <lb/>
            " cujus aperiendi gratia hucusque profecti sum.us." </note> <note type="footnote"> B 2 </note> <pb n="4"/>
            <note type="margin"> [c. 1. </note> <lb/>
            think you will now hear a strange discourse, and on the other <lb/>
            hand in a certain respect not strange. For many, who meet <lb/>
            us in life,1 tell2 the same story, that the human race will be <lb/>
            neither blessed nor happy. Follow me, then, and see whether <lb/>
            3 to you I likewise appear together with them to speak cor­ <lb/>
            rectly on a point like this.3 I assert then that it is not pos­ <lb/>
            sible for men, except a few, to be blessed and happy ; 4 1 limit <lb/>
            this to as long as we live; 4 but there is a fair hope that a <lb/>
            person will after death obtain every thing, for the sake of <lb/>
            which he would desire, when alive, to live in the best manner <lb/>
            he could, 5 and dying to meet with such an end.5 And I <lb/>
            assert nothing (very) wise,6 but what all of us, both Greeks <lb/>
            and Barbarians, after a certain manner know, that to be <lb/>
            produced is at the beginning difficult for every animal. In <lb/>
            the first place, it is difficult to partake of 7 the state of con­ <lb/>
            ception, next to be born,7 and, further still, to be brought <lb/>
            up and educated; (for) all these things take place, as we all say, <lb/>
            through ten thousand troubles. The time too would be short, <lb/>
            8 not only with respect to the calculation of annoyances, but what <lb/>
            every one would imagine to be moderate; and this seems to <note type="footnote"> 1 Ficinus evidently found something different in his MS., for his ver­ <lb/>
            sion is " multi enim fluctibus hujus vitæ jactati—” </note><note type="footnote"> 2 1 have adopted <foreign xml:lang="grc">λέγουσι</foreign>, found in the best MS. Z., in lieu of <foreign xml:lang="grc">φέϱουσι</foreign>: <lb/>
            for <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγον φέρειν</foreign> is said only of a messenger bringing news. </note><note type="footnote"> 3—3 Such is the literal version of the Greek, which Ficinus has thus <lb/>
            abridged, "utrum et ipse recte hae de re dicere videar—” while Taylor <lb/>
            has given this unaccountable mistranslation, " whether it appears to you, <lb/>
            as well as to me, that by speaking as follows about this affair, we shall <lb/>
            speak well." </note><note type="footnote"> 4—4 The words between the numerals are omitted by Ficinus and <lb/>
            Taylor, and in their place is introduced “ in this life” in the sentence <lb/>

            make almost a kind of breathing-time in the middle of the life <lb/>
            of man.8 Old age however, quickly overtaking a person, would <lb/>
            make him not at all willing to live his life over again, 1 after he <lb/>
            has considered the life he has lived,1 unless he happens to be full <lb/>
            of the thoughts of a child. Now of this what is to me the proof ? <lb/>
            It is, because what is sought for in our discourse exists naturally <lb/>
            in this way. Now we are seeking by what manner we shall be­ <lb/>
            come wise, as if there were to each of us some such power as <lb/>
            this. But it flies quickly away then, when any one proceeds to <lb/>
            an 2 investigation of the so-called arts or notions,2 or any other <lb/>
            things of that kind, which we imagine to be sciences; where­ <lb/>
            .as not one of them is worthy to be called by the name of that <lb/>
            wisdom, which is conversant with the affairs of man; while <lb/>
            on the other hand, the soul is very confident, and divines, as if <lb/>
            this wisdom were existing in her by some gift of nature; but <lb/>
            what it is, and when, and how it exists, it is wholly unable to <lb/>
            discover. Does not then in this manner our difficulty about, <lb/>
            and search after, wisdom, 3seem somehow greatly to be full of <lb/>
            the hope, which exists3 to each of those amongst us, who are <lb/>
            able to examine both themselves prudently, and others harmo­ <lb/>
            niously,4 through reasonings of all kinds and spoken in every <lb/>
            manner? Shall we agree that these things are not thus, or <lb/>
            thus ?</p>
          <p>Clin. We will agree in this, 0 guest, in the hope perhaps, <lb/>
            which will arise in the course of time, of having hereafter <lb/>
            with you opinions the most true on these points.</p>
          <p>Athen. We must then first go through the other sciences, <lb/>
            as they are called, but which do not render him wise, who re­ <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin"> [c. 2. </note> [2.] Let us, then, first look into the sciences, of which the <lb/>
            race of man is first in want; since these are nearly the most <lb/>
            necessary, and truly the first. Now he, who becomes skilled <lb/>
            in these, even though he seemed at first to be wise, yet now he is <lb/>
            not considered to be wise, but obtains rather a disgrace by a <lb/>
            science of this kind. We will therefore mention what they <lb/>
            are, and (show) that nearly every one, to whom is' proposed <lb/>
            the contest of seeming to become the best man, avoids them <lb/>
            through the possession of intellect and study. Let the first <lb/>
            art then be that, 1 which, withdrawing us from eating human <lb/>
            flesh, that, as the story goes, took place formerly amongst <lb/>
            mankind after the manner of savage animals, has recalled us <lb/>
            to a more lawful food.1 2 And may those before be propitious <lb/>
            to us, and they are. For whosoever we are, who have spoken, <lb/>
            let them be bidden the first farewell.2 The manufacture of <lb/>
            wheaten flour and barley meal and moreover the food is in­ <lb/>
            deed beautiful and good; but it will never be able to work out <lb/>
            the man completely wise. 3 For this very thing, under the ap­ <lb/>
            pellation of a manufacture, would produce a difficult handling <lb/>
            of the things manufactured.3 Nor would the cultivation of <lb/>
            nearly the whole country (do so); 4 for we all appear to take <note type="footnote"> 1—1 Such is the literal version of the Latin of Ficinus—“ quæ ab hu­ <lb/>

              made it, I conceive, less so; for it is literally—“ Let that be in the first <lb/>
              place, what has withdrawn among some animals us from eating each <lb/>
              other, as is the story, and of others instituted for lawful eating." </note><note type="footnote"> 2—2 Here again is a passage, of which the literal translation proves it <lb/>
              to be perfectly unintelligible. And so have thought Stephens, Ast, and <lb/>
              Winckelmann on Euthyd. p. 69, of whom the two last have suggested <lb/>
              alterations from which nothing is gained; while the first has been con­ <lb/>
              tent to draw attention to the version of Ficinus—“ in quo sane prisci ho­ <lb/>

              nec sapientiæ nomen usurpent;" which is certainly what the train of <lb/>
              thought requires; but whether Ficinus found in his MS. the Greek <lb/>
              words answering to the Latin, is another question. </note><note type="footnote"> 3—3 Such is the literal version of the Greek, which Ficinus has thus <lb/>

              in hand the earth, not by art, but by nature, according to a <lb/>
              god.4 Nor yet would the weaving together1 of dwellings nor <lb/>
              the whole of house-building, and the manufacture of all kinds <lb/>
              of utensils, and copper-work, and the preparing of instruments <lb/>
              for carpenters and moulders, and weavers, and trades in general, <lb/>
              although possessing what is useful for the common people, be <lb/>
              suited for virtue. Nor yet does the whole of hunting, although <lb/>
              various and full of art, contribute what is greatly becoming2 to­ <lb/>
              gether with what is wise. Nor yet does the diviner's and inter­ <lb/>
              preter's art at all; for such merely knows what is said, but has <lb/>
              not learnt whether it is true. Since then we see that the pos­ <lb/>
              session of necessaries is worked out indeed by art, but that not <lb/>
              one of these arts makes any person wise, there would be left after <lb/>
              this a certain sport, 3 imitative for the most part, but by no means <lb/>
              a serious pursuit. For persons do with many instruments, <lb/>
              4 and with many imitations, effected by their own bodies,4 not <lb/>
              altogether graceful, make an imitation of things, expressed 5 in <lb/>
              prose and verse,5 and of those, of which painting is the mother, <lb/>
              while colours many and various are worked out,6 by many <lb/>
              substances moist and dry; by operating upon none of which <lb/>
              with the greatest care does the imitative art render a person <lb/>
              wise. 7 And when all has been done,7 there would be some­ <lb/>
              thing remaining in the assistance without number given to <lb/>
              persons without number ; the greatest of which and for the <lb/>
              most numerous occasions is the art of war, called by the name <lb/>
              of generalship, of the highest repute in the case of need, but <lb/>
              requiring the greatest good fortune, and that which is assigned <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin">c. 3.] </note> [3.] It is however necessary for a certain science to be­ <lb/>
            come apparent, by which he, who possesses it, would be wise in <lb/>
            reality, and not be so in opinion merely. Let us, then, con­ <lb/>
            sider. For we are endeavouring by a reasoning, difficult in <lb/>
            every way, to find some other science beyond those already <lb/>
            mentioned, which may be truly and with propriety called <lb/>
            wisdom; while he, who receives it, will be a person neither <lb/>
            vulgar nor silly, but wise and good through it; and, whether <lb/>
            he governs or is governed by the state, in justice1 become an <lb/>
            elegant2 person.</p>
          <p>Let us, therefore, consider that science first, which singly <lb/>
            proceeds from human nature, and which, amongst all that are <lb/>
            present, would, by not being present, render the race of man <lb/>
            of (all) animals3 the most senseless and thoughtless. Now this <lb/>
            it is not very difficult for any one to consider. For that, which <lb/>
            has given number to the whole race of man, would, so to say, <lb/>
            being compared 4 one against. one,4 effect this. I conceive <lb/>
            however that a certain god himself, rather than a certain ac­ <lb/>
            cident, gave it to us to preserve us ; but whom I conceive to <lb/>
            have been the god, it is necessary to state, strange although it <lb/>
            be, and, on the other hand, somehow not strange. For how <lb/>
            must we not conceive that he, who is the cause to us of every <lb/>
            good thing, should not have been the cause likewise of intel­ <lb/>
            lect, the greatest good by far ? Now what god am I speaking <lb/>

            things to us. And we assert to boot that it has given us <lb/>
            number, and will give it us still, if any one is willing to fol­ <lb/>
            low us. For if a person will proceed to a right view of it, <lb/>
            whether it be the pleasure of any one to call it the World, or <lb/>
            Olympus, or Heaven, let him so call it; but let him follow, <lb/>
            wherever it assumes a varied form, when it causes the stars in <lb/>
            it to revolve along all their courses,1 and when it imparts the <lb/>
            seasons and food for all, and the remaining gift2 of intellect, <lb/>
            as we should say, together with all number, and every other <lb/>
            good. Now this is the greatest thing, when any one, receiving <lb/>
            from it the gift of number, proceeds through every period. <lb/>
            Returning back still a little in our discourse, let us call to mind <lb/>
            that we have conceived very correctly, that if we take away <lb/>
            number from human nature, we should be intellectual not at <lb/>
            all. For the soul of the animal, from whom reason is absent, <lb/>
            would scarcely any longer be able to receive every virtue. <lb/>
            Now the animal, which does not know two and three, even and <lb/>
            odd, and is entirely ignorant of number, would never be able to <lb/>
            give a reason respecting those things, of which it alone pos­ <lb/>
            sesses sensation and memory; but nothing hinders it (from <lb/>
            possessing)3 the other virtues, fortitude and temperance. But <lb/>
            he, who is deprived of true reason, will never become wise; <lb/>
            and he, to whom wisdom is not present, which is the greatest <lb/>
            part of the whole of virtue, would never be perfectly good, nor <lb/>
            happy. In this way there is every necessity for number to be <lb/>
            laid down as a principle. But why it is necessary, there would <lb/>
            be a discourse longer than all that has been spoken. And <lb/>
            correctly will the present one have been stated likewise, that <lb/>
            of the things, mentioned as belonging to the other arts, which <lb/>
            we have gone through, 4 and permitted them all to be arts,4 not <lb/>

            cientlyl for the sake of some small matters to have no need <lb/>
            of number. And yet is it a thing of moment. And if any <lb/>

            which piety towards the gods and true number are known, <lb/>
            2 he could not mention the person, who 2 knows the whole of <lb/>
            number, and of what power it is, when present, the cause; since <lb/>
            it is evident that what relates to all music, requires numbered <lb/>
            motion and sound; and, what is the greatest, that it (number) <lb/>
            is the cause of all good things, but of nothing evil, this must be <lb/>
            known well,3 which would perhaps take place by another road; <lb/>
            for 3 the movement, which is without reason, and order, and <lb/>
            shape, and rhythm, and harmony, and all such things as partake <lb/>
            of any evil, is deficient in nearly all number. And this it is <lb/>
            meet for him to conceive in this way, who is about to end his <lb/>
            days happily; and no one,4 except him, who knows the just, <lb/>
            the good, the beautiful, and all such things, and has laid hold <lb/>
            of a true opinion respecting them, 5 will through number know <lb/>

              come skilled in numbers, by considering one thing, itself by it­ <lb/>
              self. But always to reckon up all numbers, when compared with <lb/>
              each other, I think is a greater work.1 And for the sake of this, <lb/>
              the deity having formed, as we have said, the Moon, increasing <lb/>
              and decreasing, has put together months into the year, 2 and <lb/>
              caused us to compare every number with number, with a pros­ <lb/>
              perous fortune.2 Hence, there are 3 fruits for us, and the earth <lb/>
              has become pregnant,3 so that there is food for all animals; while <lb/>
              winds and showers take place, neither out of season nor measure. <lb/>
              But if any thing occurs contrary to this on the side of evil, it is <lb/>
              meet to accuse not the divine, but human, nature, as unjustly dis­ <lb/>
              tributing its own life. Now to us, while we were investigating <lb/>
              the laws, it appeared, that the other things, which are nearly the <lb/>
              best for man, are easy for us to know ; and that every one would <lb/>
              be competent to understand what was said, and to do it, if he <lb/>
              knew what is that, which is likely to be a benefit, and what is <lb/>
              not. But it has appeared, and now appears still, that all the <lb/>
              other pursuits are not very difficult; but in what manner it is <lb/>

            and to be visible. But to the other (soul)—for let us say it again, <lb/>
            1 since it is to be said not merely once,1—(it pertains) to be in­ <lb/>
            visible, and to know and to be intelligible,2 and to have a share <lb/>
            of memory and of the reasoning power in the changes of even <lb/>
            and odd. As there are, therefore, five bodies, it is requisite to <lb/>
            say that fire 3 (is the first), and water (the second),3 and air the <lb/>
            third, and earth the fourth, and æther the fifth; and in the do­ <lb/>
            minions of each of these there is produced many an animal and <lb/>
            of every kind. Now it is meet to learn this singly, thus. Let <lb/>
            us, in the first place, lay down the whole of the things of earth <lb/>
            as one, namely, all human beings, and all such animals as are <lb/>
            with many feet, or none, and such as can move on, and such as are <lb/>
            stationary, as being held down by roots. And it is requisite to <lb/>
            consider the one thing belonging to it as this, that all these are <lb/>
            formed of all those genera, but that the greater part is of the <lb/>
            earth and the nature of solidity. It is, however, requisite to <lb/>
            lay down another kind of animal, which is generated, and, at <lb/>
            the same time, able to be seen. For it consists for the most <lb/>
            part of fire ; but contains likewise a small portion of earth and <lb/>
            air, and of all the other things. Hence, it is requisite to assert <lb/>
            that animals of every kind and visible are generated from them. <lb/>
            4 It is necessary likewise to think that all in the heavens are <lb/>
            these genera of animals,4 5 which it is necessary to say 5 is the <lb/>
            whole divine race of the stars, consisting of a most beautiful <lb/>
            body, and of a soul the most happy and the best. 6 It is requisite <lb/>

          <p>[6.] Let us then consider first, that there are, as we <lb/>
            have said, these two kinds of animals ; and2 let us say again <lb/>
            that both of them are visible, the one being, as it would seem, <lb/>
            wholly of fire, and the other of earth, and that the earthy <lb/>
            is moved in a disorderly manner, but the fiery in all order. <lb/>
            Now it is meet to consider that, what is moved without <lb/>
            order, is senseless, 3 as the animal, which is around us, acts <lb/>
            for the most part; 3 but that, what has its going in order <lb/>
            and in the heavens, it is meet to make for ourselves as a great <lb/>
            proof of its being intellectual; for it goes on ever according <lb/>
            to the same and in a similar manner; and by doing and suffer­ <lb/>
            ing 4 it would afford a sufficient proof of its living intellectu­ <lb/>

            be by far the greatest of all necessities. For it lays down <lb/>
            laws as governing, and not governed. But when soul, which <lb/>
            is a thing the best, deliberates according to the best intellect, <lb/>
            that, which is not to be changed by turning, comes out per­ <lb/>
            fect in reality according to intellect ; and even adamant <lb/>
            would not be superior to such a soul, and less to be changed <lb/>
            by turning. But in reality the three Fates hold and guard, <lb/>
            so as to be perfect, that, which has been deliberated upon by <lb/>
            each of the gods with the best counsel. It was necessary <lb/>

            others at another, and by wandering 1 up and down1 and altering <lb/>
            their orbit. Now the very reverse of this has appeared to the <lb/>
            majority of us, that, by their doing 2 the same things and in a <lb/>
            similar manner, they have not a soul. The masses, too, have <lb/>
            followed persons so senseless, as to conceive that the human <lb/>
            race is intellectual and vital, as being moved, but the divine <lb/>
            race unintellectual, as remaining in the same movements. <lb/>
            But it is allowable for the man, who places himself on the <lb/>
            side of what is more beautiful, and better, and more agree­ <lb/>
            able (to the gods),3 to conceive that he ought, on this very <lb/>
            account, to consider as intellectual that, which does always the <lb/>
            same things 4 according to the same and in a similar manner; <lb/>
            and that this is the nature of the stars, most beautiful to behold, <lb/>

            and magnificent of all choirs, completes for all animals what <lb/>
            is needful. Now (to show) that we are justly saying they pos­ <lb/>
            sess a soul, let us consider first their size. For they are <lb/>
            not in reality so small, as they appear to be; but each of them <lb/>

            to revolve for ever for the same time1 that it revolves at pre­ <lb/>
            sent. Now I assert that a god would be the cause, and that <lb/>
            it could not be possible otherwise. For it would not other­ <lb/>
            wise become animated than through a god, as we have shown. <lb/>
            But since a god is able in this respect, to him there has been <lb/>
            every facility for every animal, in the first place, to be pro­ <lb/>
            duced, and every body, and every bulk; and next, to cause <lb/>
            them to move in that way, which he conceived to be the best. <lb/>
            And now upon all these points we will make one true asser­ <lb/>
            tion. It is impossible for the earth and heavens and all the <lb/>
            stars and all the bulky bodies made from them to subsist, un­ <lb/>
            less a soul were present to each, or in each, so that2 they pro­ <lb/>
            ceed with such accuracy according to years, and months, and <lb/>
            days, and for every good, which is produced, to be produced for us <lb/>
            all. But it is requisite that, by how much the more vile is man, <lb/>
            (the less) ought he to be seen to trifle, but to assert something <lb/>
            clear concerning them. Should then any one assert that cer­ <lb/>
            tain violent motions of bodies or natures or any thing of this <lb/>
            kind are the causes, he will say nothing that is clear.</p>
          <p>[7.] It is however requisite to reconsider seriously what <lb/>
            we have said, whether our discourse has a reason for it, or al­ <lb/>
            together comes after it. In the first place then, (we said,) <lb/>
            there are two things, the one, soul, and the other, body, and that <lb/>
            many things pertain to each ; but that all are different from one <lb/>
            another, 3 and each from each ; 3 and that there is no other third <lb/>
            thing common to any one; and that soul differs from body; <lb/>
            and that the former is intellectual, but the latter unintellectual ; <lb/>
            and that the one rules, but the other is ruled; and that the <lb/>
            one is 5the cause of all (that happens), but the other is not the <lb/>
            cause of any accident;5 so that to assert that the things in <note type="footnote"> 1 In lieu of <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρόνον</foreign>, which is unnecessary after <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀεὶ</foreign>, I should prefer <lb/>

            heaven were generated by something else, and that the pro­ <lb/>
            ductions of soul and body do not exist in this way, is a great <lb/>
            folly and a want of reason. If then it is requisite for the rea­ <lb/>
            sons, relating to all such matters, to be victorious, and for all <lb/>
            things of this kind to seem confidently to be divine, we must <lb/>
            lay down one or the other of these two points ; we must either <lb/>
            hymn1 those things most correctly, as being gods themselves, <lb/>
            or (we must) consider them, like images, to be resemblances <lb/>
            of the gods, the gods -themselves having manufactured them. <lb/>
            For they 2 (are the works of artificers) 2 neither senseless nor <lb/>
            of little worth. But, as we have said, we must lay down one <lb/>
            or the other of these points. 3 And what is laid down, we <lb/>
            must honour pre-eminently before all statues.3 For never <lb/>
            will there be seen statues more beautiful and 4 more common <lb/>

            their purity, and solemnity, and the whole of life,5 than are <lb/>
            these, 6how they have been generated altogether in this way.6 <lb/>

              two kinds of living beings, 1 one (formed) of æther, and the <lb/>
              other in due order of air, neither of them is entirely visi­ <lb/>
              ble ; 1 and though present and near at hand, they do not become <lb/>
              manifest to us; but let us say that, participating in a wonder­ <lb/>
              ful intelligence, as being docile and of a good memory, they <lb/>
              know all our thoughts ; and that in a wonderful manner they <lb/>

              excessively the wicked, as being himself a sharer in pain; <lb/>
              for the deity, who possesses the completion of a divine allot­ <lb/>
              ment, is (placed) beyond these (two), pleasure and pain, but <lb/>
              has had a share in thinking upon and knowing, according to all <lb/>
              things.2 And as the heaven is full of living beings, they in­ <lb/>

            this is easy even to another person.2 Of these there are three, <lb/>
            one of the Sun, one of the Moon, and one of the not-wandering 3 <lb/>
            stars, which I mentioned a little before, and there are five others. <lb/>
            With respect to all these, and the (gods) in them, whether they <lb/>
            move of themselves, or are carried along in cars, let not one of <lb/>
            us all think even that some are gods, and others not; nor yet, <lb/>
            that some of them are genuine,4 but others such as it is not <lb/>
            lawful for any of us to mention; but let us all say that they <lb/>
            are all of them brothers, and live in fraternal allotments; and <lb/>
            let us honour them, not one for a year, and another for a <lb/>
            month, nor let us ordain for others any allotment or time, <lb/>
            in which (each) proceeds through its revolution, and com­ <lb/>
            pletes the arrangement, which reason, the most divine of all, <lb/>
            has ordained to be visible; (and) which he, who is under a good <lb/>
            dæmon,5 has first wondered at, and then felt a desire to learn, as <lb/>
            much as it is possible for a mortal nature, from thinking that <lb/>
            he shall thus pass through life in the best and most fortunate <lb/>
            manner, and after death arrive at places adapted to virtue; <lb/>
            and being thus truly initiated and in reality participating in <lb/>

            what they are. For we shall not be seen to be false. Thus <lb/>
            far at least I firmly insist upon. For I say again, that of these <lb/>
            there are eight; and that of the eight, three have been already <lb/>
            spoken of, and there are five still remaining. Now 1the fourth <lb/>
            and fifth onward movement and oblique path2 are nearly3 <lb/>
            equal in velocity with the Sun,l and are neither slower nor <lb/>
            swifter. And let us say that he, who possesses intellect, <lb/>
            is altogether competent to lead these three; and that these <lb/>
            (movements) belong to the Sun, and Lucifer. But the third it <lb/>
            is not possible to speak of by name,4 through its not being <lb/>
            known ; and the reason of this, that the person, who first saw <lb/>
            it, was a Barbarian. For an ancient places was the nurse of <lb/>
            those, who first thought of these matters, in consequence of <lb/>
            the beauty of the summer season, which Egypt and Syria 6 <lb/>
            possess sufficiently, (enabling) persons to look upon all the <lb/>
            stars, visible, so to say, perpetually; inasmuch as they dwelt <lb/>
            (in a part)7 of the world at a distance from clouds and rain.8 <lb/>
            Hence to every where else and hither too has reached what has <lb/>
            been tested by the time of thousands of years, and even infinite ; <lb/>
            and on this account it is meet with confidence to lay down <lb/>
            these matters as laws. For (to think) 9 that divine (natures) are <lb/>
            not to be held in honour, or that these are not divine, is clearly <lb/>
            the province of persons not endued with intellect. It is neces­ <lb/>

            suited to a Syrian name-giver.2 But the star, which revolves <lb/>

            (the name) almost of Mercury.3 And further, let us speak of <lb/>
            three onward movements (of those stars), that take their course <lb/>
            to the right hand, together with the Sun and Moon. But it <lb/>
            is requisite to call the eighth orb one, which a person may <lb/>

            the mental perception relating to these gods of the world. a <lb/>
            Let us then admit that, whatever the Greeks have received <lb/>
            from the Barbarians, they work it out to a more beautiful <lb/>

            spect to what has been said now, that it is difficult to discover <lb/>
            all matters of this kind without feeling a doubt. There is <lb/>
            however a hope, both much and glorious, that the Greeks will <lb/>

            reason great and good (for supposing) that, when men had <lb/>
            their first notions about the gods, how they existed, and of <lb/>
            what kind they were, and what actions they took in hand, <lb/>
            ideas were then broached, not to the mind of the moderate, <lb/>
            nor agreeable to them, nor even of those, who were next after <lb/>
            them;1 amongst whom what relates to fire and water and <lb/>
            the other bodies, was said to be the most ancient; but pos­ <lb/>
            terior to them the wonderful soul; and that the movement, <lb/>
            which the body has obtained by lot, is better and of more <lb/>
            value for carrying on both itself (and soul)2 by the aid of heat <lb/>
            and cold, and all things of that kind; but that the soul could <lb/>
            not (do so) to body and itself. But now, when we say that <lb/>
            soul (exists),3 if it exists in body, it would be not at all won­ <lb/>
            derful 4 for it to move and carry about both the body and it­ <lb/>
            self; nor would, according to any reason, soul be believed5 to <lb/>
            be unable to carry about a weight.6 Since then soul is the <lb/>
            cause of the universe, and of all good things being such, and <lb/>
            on the other hand of evil things being such, it is not at all <lb/>
            wonderful that soul should be the cause of every bearing on <lb/>
            and movement; but that the bearing on and movement to­ <lb/>
            wards the good belongs to the best soul, but the bearing on <lb/>
            and movement towards the contrary, to a contrary7 (soul); <lb/>

            say to those, to whom 3 we are stating what 4 it is meet to <lb/>
            learn, and how. Let this be mentioned first by us.</p>
          <p>[12.] The Moon goes through its orbit the quickest, and <lb/>
            first5 leads on the month and the full moon. The second it <lb/>
            is meet to consider is the Sun, that leads on the solstices <lb/>
            through the whole of its orbit, and those that describe their <lb/>
            course together with it. But that we may not frequently <lb/>
            converse in the same way about the same things, the other <lb/>
            orbits, which we mentioned before, and 6 which it is not easy <lb/>
            to comprehend, we ought to contemplate;6 and for these <lb/>
            objects it is requisite 7 to prepare natures, such as can exist,7 <lb/>
            by teaching them many things beforehand, and accustoming <lb/>
            the party, while a boy or youth, to labour thoroughly at what <lb/>
            is requisite.8 On this account there would be a need of mathe­ <lb/>
            matics ; but the greatest and first (need) is of numbers in the <lb/>
            abstract, and not of such as are connected with bodies,9 but of <lb/>
            the whole generation and power of the even and the odd, (and) <lb/>
            so much as they contribute to the nature of things that exist. <lb/>

            4, which is the square of 2 ; and to the third, 8, which is the cube of 2. <lb/>
            Double proportion was considered likewise by the ancients as perfect. <lb/>
            First, because it is the first proportion, produced between 1 and 2; and <lb/>
            secondly, because it contains all proportions within itself; for the sesqui­ <lb/>
            alter (1½), sesquitertian (1⅓), and the other proportions are, as it were, <lb/>
            parts below double proportion. The numbers, which the author here ad­ <lb/>
            duces, are 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, The ratio of 4 to 2 is double ; and that of 8 to <lb/>
            4 is also double. Now these two excesses are equal in ratio; for each is <lb/>
            double; but they are not equal in number; for 8 exceeds 4 by 4, but 4 <lb/>
            exceeds 2 only by 2. Again, if we compare 6 to 4, and afterwards to 8, in the <lb/>
            first case we have a sesquialter, and in the second a sesquitertian ratio ; <lb/>
            but these excesses are unequal in ratio, although equal in number. For the <lb/>
            ratio of 6 to 4 = 1½, and the ratio of 8 to 6 = 1⅓ ; but 6 exceeds 4 by 2, and <lb/>
            is exceeded by 8 by 2. Again, compare 12 to 6, which is a double ratio, <lb/>
            and between these compare 8 to each. Then, 12 to 8 will be a sesqui­ <lb/>

            let this be the method-for it is necessary to say so much at <lb/>
            least as this-Every diagram, system of number, and compo­ <lb/>
            sition of harmony, together with the one agreement of all the <lb/>
            stars in their revolutions, ought to be apparent to him, who <lb/>
            learns in a proper manner. And that, of which we are speak­ <lb/>
            ing, will become apparent, if a person rightly learns, looking <lb/>
            to one thing. For to those, who think upon the matter, there <lb/>
            will appear to be naturally one bond to all of these. But if a <lb/>
            person will take the matter in hand in any other way, he must, <lb/>
            as we have said, call upon fortune. For, without these, no <lb/>
            nature will become lucky in states. But this is the method, <lb/>
            (and) this the nurture, and through these subjects of instruction <lb/>
            we must proceed, whether they are difficult or easy. Nor is it <lb/>
            lawful to neglect the gods ; since the happy report, relating to <lb/>
            all of them, has, according to a manner, become apparent. And <lb/>
            I call him, who thus apprehends all these points, the man <lb/>
            the most truly wise; who, I stoutly affirm, both in jest and <note type="footnote"> stand; nor could, I think, Ficinus, whose abridged version is " quam <lb/>

            <title type="main">INTRODUCTION TO THE AXIOCHUS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>ALTHOUGH the Axiochus and five following dialogues, all equally <lb/>
            spurious, have been generally appended to the complete editions of <lb/>
            Plato, yet, strange to say, they have never been translated into <lb/>
            English. This fact, as regards the Axiochus especially, is the more <lb/>
            remarkable, as that dialogue has been so great a favourite with <lb/>
            scholars of different countries, that twelve translations have been <lb/>
            made of it into Latin, four into German, and two into French. For <lb/>
            though Cousin asserts that his own is the only French version, yet <lb/>
            he might have known from Fabricius and Fischer, that Dolet had <lb/>
            preceded him in 1544; whose tiny volume, that contains a transla­ <lb/>
            tion likewise of the Hipparchus, is so scarce, that no copy of if is to <lb/>
            be found in the National Library at Paris, as is stated distinctly in <lb/>
            a modern reprint of it; nor is it mentioned, I may add, in the dif­ <lb/>
            ferent Catalogues of the British Museum.</p>
          <p>Of these twelve translations nine have appeared in print; but the <lb/>
            remaining three are to be found only in MSS. from the pens re­ <lb/>
            spectively of Cincius Romanus, Rainutius, and Leonardus Aretinus ; <lb/>
            unless it be said that to one of these three is to be referred the copy, <lb/>
            once in the possession of Swart of Altorf, in the Catalogue of whose <lb/>
            library, says Fischer, it is described in P. 2, p. 277, n. 871, under <lb/>
            the title of " Axiochus Platonis de contemnenda morte. Venunda­ <lb/>
            tur ab Alex. Haliatte, Mediolanensi, s. a. 4." Of the version by <lb/>
            Cincius MSS. are to be found in Archbishop Parker's library at C. <lb/>
            C. Camb., as stated in the Catalogue, p. 65, and in the British <lb/>
            Museum, Burney MSS., 226, and in the National Library at Paris, <lb/>
            Cod. 6729; while a copy of the version by Rainutius is in MS. Harl. <lb/>
            4923, and in Arundel MSS. 277. To these however I have paid <lb/>
            no attention; as they are done too loosely to enable one to ascertain <lb/>
             <pb n="38"/>
            what the translators found in the MSS. before them. But such is <lb/>
            not the case with Ficinus, who has here, as elsewhere, kept very close <lb/>
            to the original, except when he perceived the text to be manifestly <lb/>
            corrupt. And a similar observation is applicable to the translation <lb/>
            of Hieronymus Wolfius, printed, together with the text and notes, <lb/>
            at Basle in 1577, 4, under the title of "Doctrina recte vivendi et <lb/>
            moriendi," a fact not known, it would seem, to Cousin, who attributes <lb/>
            that work to an anonymous scholar.</p>
          <p>With regard to the author of the dialogue, Ficinus attributes it <lb/>
            to Xenocrates, either because he found it so assigned in the MS. <lb/>
            before him, or because he knew that the follower of Plato had <lb/>
            written a treatise " On Death," as recorded by Diogenes Laert. iv. <lb/>
            12. By others the author was supposed to be Æschines, the fol­ <lb/>
            lower of Socrates. But this idea was given up, when it was ascer­ <lb/>
            tained that none of the passages quoted by Athenæus and Pollux, <lb/>
            from the Axiochus of Æschines, were to be found in the existing <lb/>
            dialogue of that name.</p>
          <p>But whatever uncertainty may exist as to the author, it is evi­ <lb/>
            dent from § 8, p. 45, n. ', as Wolf was the first to remark, that it <lb/>
            was written at the time, when the successors of Plato occupied the <lb/>
            Academy, and those of Aristotle the Lyceum, at Athens.</p>

            arges,l and had arrived at the Ilissus, the voice of some <lb/>
            one reached me, calling out, " Socrates, Socrates." And when <lb/>
            on turning towards (the sound) I looked round to see from <lb/>
            whence it might be, I beheld Clinias, the son of Axiochus, <lb/>
            running towards the fountain Callirrhoe, together with Damon <lb/>
            the musician, and Charmides, the son of Glaucon. Of these,2 <lb/>
            one was the other's music-master, and the other was, from a <lb/>
            feeling of friendship, at once the loving and beloved. I de­ <lb/>
            termined therefore to give up the direct road, and to meet <lb/>
            them, that we might come together in the easiest manner. <lb/>
            [2.] And Clinias, with tears in his eyes, said-Now, Socrates, <lb/>

            of piety, this too may be done by me.2 In no moderate mat­ <lb/>

              likewise, while thirty thousand were at the general meeting.</p>
          <p>[13.] Axio. It is so, Socrates. And from that time I have <lb/>
            had enough of the platform,3 and nothing has seemed to me <lb/>
            more disagreeable than statesmanship. And this is plain to <lb/>
            those who have been engaged in the business. And you in­ <lb/>
            deed speak thus, as taking a view from a look-out; but we, <lb/>
            who have made the experiment, know it more accurately. <lb/>
            For the mob, my dear Socrates, is a thing ungrateful, satiated <lb/>
            with the mere touch, cruel, envious, uneducated, as being <lb/>
            made up of a mass of persons brought together, violent (and) 4 <lb/>
            triflers ; while he, who acts the courtesan to it, is more miser­ <lb/>
            able by far.</p>
          <p>[14.] Soc. Since then, Axiochus, you lay down the science, <lb/>
            which is the most free, as the least to be prayed for amongst <lb/>
            the rest, what shall we think of the remaining pursuits ? Are <lb/>
            they not to be avoided ? I once indeed heard Prodicus saying <lb/>
            that death does not exist as regards either the living or those, <lb/>
            who have changed their existence.</p>
          <p>AxiM. How say you, Socrates ?</p>
          <p>Soc. That as regards the living, it does not exist; while <lb/>
            they, who are dead, do not exist; so that neither, as regards <lb/>
            you, does it exist; for you are not dead; nor, should you suffer <lb/>
            aught, will it exist, as regards you; for you will then not <lb/>

            rattle out reasons, Socrates, still more plausible than those just <lb/>

          <p>[16.] Soc. You are putting together, Axiochus, (words)4 <lb/>

            bad as opposed to the deprivation of things that are good, <lb/>

          <p>OF this dialogue, which Fischer has, on the authority of Suidas, <lb/>
            attributed to Æschines, a follower of Socrates, but Boeckh to an un­ <lb/>
            known writer, five translations have appeared in Latin, one in Ger­ <lb/>
            man, and one in French. But as they have been all made from a <lb/>
            printed text, they are in a critical point of view of very little use. <lb/>
            And a similar observation is applicable to the notes of the different <lb/>
            editors, who have been apparently unwilling to meddle with the <lb/>
            text, even when they could scarcely have failed to see it was cor­ <lb/>
            rupt. I have therefore been reluctantly compelled to supply par­ <lb/>
            tially their omissions, and to attempt to do, what would have come <lb/>
            with a better grace from Boeckh.</p>
          <p>From the allusion in § 2, to the embassy sent from Sicily to <lb/>
            Athens, as recorded by Thucydides in iii. 86, Fischer infers that the <lb/>
            dialogue is supposed to have taken place about 01. 88, 2; and as <lb/>
            regards the subject of it, that the wise alone are the really wealthy, <lb/>
            he refers to Cicero, Paradox 6, and to lamblichus, Protrept. p. 23, <lb/>

            sides over Freed-men, and there came to us Critias the son of <lb/>
            Phæax, (and)' the nephew of Erasistratus. Now Erasistratus <lb/>
            'happened at that time to be recently arrived from Sicily and <lb/>
            those places ;2 and on approaching near he said-" Hail, So­ <lb/>
            crates." And (hail)3 too thou, said I. What then, can you <lb/>
            tell us of any news 4 from Sicily ? And very (good) too, said he ; <lb/>
            but are you willing for us to sit down first ? for I am tired <lb/>
            from having walked yesterday from Megara.5 Perfectly so, <lb/>
            (said I,) if it seems good to you. What then of the events <lb/>
            there, said he, do you wish to hear the first ? Is it of the peo­ <lb/>

            battle against, until one falls upon them and destroys them <lb/>
            nest and all. So, I think, 1 are the people of Syracuse. For <lb/>
            unless, after entertaining angry feelings, one 2 shall go thither <lb/>
            with a very large fleet, it is not possible for them to come under <lb/>
            our power ; but by all these little doings they will be enraged <lb/>
            the more, so as to become the most difficult of all (to manage) ; <lb/>
            and they have just now sent ambassadors,3 intending, as it <lb/>
            seems to me, to deceive in some way the state.</p>
          <p>[2.] During our conversation the ambassadors from Syra­ <lb/>
            cuse happened to pass by; when, pointing to one of them, <lb/>
            Erasistratus observed-That person, Socrates, said he, is the <lb/>
            most wealthy of the 4 Siceliotes and Italiotes ; 4 and how should <lb/>
            he not be, who has land without stint; so that it is easy for <lb/>
            him, if one wished it, to cultivate a great deal of it; and it is of <lb/>
            such a kind, that there is none other so good,5 at least amongst <lb/>
            the Greeks; and he has still many 6 things leading to wealth, <lb/>
            chattels,6 (and) 7 slaves, and horses, and gold and silver. On <lb/>
            seeing him excited,s as if about to dilate upon the man's sub­ <lb/>
            stance, I asked him—What kind of person, Erasistratus, does <lb/>
            this man seem to be in Sicily ? This man, said he, both seems <lb/>
            to be and is the most knavish of all the Siceliotes and Italiotes, <lb/>
            by how much he is the wealthiest; so that, should you be <note type="footnote"> 1 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὓν</foreign> the sense requires <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἲμαι</foreign>, as I have translated. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 I cannot understand <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἒϱγον ποιησάμενος</foreign>.

            willing to ask any Siceliote whom he thought to be the greatest <lb/>
            rogue, not one would mention any other person than him.</p>
          <p>[3.] Conceiving then that he was holding a conversation <lb/>
            not upon trifling matters, but what seemed to be the greatest, <lb/>
            namely, virtue and wealth,1 I asked him which would he say <lb/>
            is the wealthier person, he, who happened to have 2 two <lb/>
            talents2 of silver, or he, who had a field worth two talents ? <lb/>
            I think, said he, the person who has the field. By the same <lb/>
            rule then, said I, he, who happens to have garments, or bed­ <lb/>
            furniture, or other goods of greater value than are those, <lb/>
            which the stranger possesses, would be the wealthier. To <lb/>
            this he assented. Now, should any one give you the choice, <lb/>
            which would you wish ?I would wish that, said he, which is <lb/>
            the most valuable. Would you not (say so), as conceiving <lb/>
            yourself to be more wealthy ? Just so. For the present then <lb/>
            he appears to be the wealthiest, who possesses things the most <lb/>
            valuable. Yes, said he. [4.] Would not then, said I, per­ <lb/>
            sons in health be more wealthy than those who are ill ? at <lb/>
            ileast if health is a possession more valuable than the property <lb/>
            of a person who is ill. For surely there is no one, who would <lb/>
            not set a higher value on health, although he possessed only <lb/>
            a little money, than on illness, although he possessed the pro­ <lb/>
            perty of the great king,3 through his conceiving, it is plain, <lb/>
            that health is of greater value ; for he would never prefer it, <lb/>
            unless he considered it of greater value than property. He <lb/>
            would not. If then any thing else seems to be of greater <lb/>
            value than health, the person, who possesses that thing, would <lb/>
            be the wealthiest. Yes. If then a person were to come to us <lb/>
            and ask—Can you, Socrates, and Eryxias, and Erasistratus, <note type="footnote"> 1 I have omitted <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέϱι</foreign>, which could not be thus repeated; for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀϱετής</foreign> and <lb/>

            would ask whether the owner of a field, worth two talents, was not richer <lb/>
            than the owner of one talent; although he might compare a certain <lb/>
            amount of money with the same amount of money's worth. Some rea­ <lb/>
            son should however be given to prove how the field was superior to the <lb/>
            silver. Hence I suspect that something has been lost here to this effect, <lb/>
            " For the talents might be taken away by force or fraud, or lost by acci­ <lb/>

            tell me, what possession is the most valuable to man ? Is it <lb/>

            best on this point, how he could best transact his own affairs <lb/>
            and those of his friends ? What should we say is this ? To myself <lb/>
            it appears, Socrates, that happiness is the thing of the greatest <lb/>
            value to man. And not wrongly so, said I. But shall we <lb/>
            consider those the most happy, who are the best to do ? To <lb/>
            me those appear so. [5.] Would not those then be the best to <lb/>
            do, who err the least, in the case of themselves and the rest of <lb/>
            mankind, and regulate affairs the most successfully? By all <lb/>
            means. They then, who know what is evil and what is good, <lb/>
            and what is to be done and what is not, would regulate affairs <lb/>
            the most successfully, and err the least. To this too he con­ <lb/>
            sented. Now then, the same persons appear to be the wisest, <lb/>
            and the best to do, and the happiest, and the wealthiest; if <lb/>
            indeed wisdom is a possession of the greatest value. Yes. <lb/>
            But, said Erasistratus,l taking up the discourse, of what ad­ <lb/>
            vantage would food and drink, and if there is any thing else <lb/>
            of this kind, be to a person, if he were wiser than Nestor, and <lb/>
            yet did not happen to have the necessaries of life ? How <lb/>
            would his wisdom be a benefit ? Or how could he be the <lb/>
            wealthiest, when nothing prevents him from being poor, while <lb/>
            he possesses no resources for the necessaries (of life) ? And <lb/>
            he thought indeed he had said something extremely (well).2 <lb/>
            But would the person, said I, who possesses wisdom, suffer in <lb/>
            this way, even if he were in want of these things ? 3 For if <lb/>
            a person possessed the residence 5 of Polytion, and the resi­ <lb/>
            dence5 were full of gold and silver, would he be in want of <lb/>

            observed, smiling at the same time, and blushing, 2 as if he <lb/>
            had not been present2 during what had been said before, I <lb/>
            did not imagine, Socrates, that there was any need of argu­ <lb/>

            suade not one of those, who are present,3 nor be benefited by <lb/>
            them. For who is there with any intellect, who would be <lb/>
            persuaded that the richest are the wisest ? 4 but would rather <lb/>
            be informed with greater delight, if it is necessary4 to talk <lb/>
            about being wealthy, from whence it is honourable to be <lb/>
            wealthy, and from whence disgraceful, and what it is to be <lb/>
            wealthy, whether a good or an evil. Be it so, said I. Hence- <lb/>
            forth then we will be on our guard; and you do right in ad­ <lb/>
            monishing me. But why do not you yourself, since you have <lb/>
            introduced the subject, endeavour to state whether it seems to <lb/>

            wealthy is a good. But while he was still desirous to state <lb/>
            something, Critias suddenly interrupted him (by saying)- <lb/>
            Tell me, Eryxias, do you consider it a good to be wealthy ? <lb/>
            Yes, I do, by Zeus. For I should be mad (if I did not) ; and <lb/>
            I think there is not a single person, who would not say so too. <lb/>
            And yet, said the other,2 I think too that there is not a single <lb/>
            person, whom I could not cause3 to say with myself that to <lb/>
            some men it is an evil to be wealthy. If then it were a good, <lb/>
            it would not have appeared to some to be an evil. Hereupon <lb/>
            I said to them that-If ye happened to be at variance about <lb/>
            this point, which of you two is speaking with the greater <lb/>
            truth about horsemanship, how a person would ride the best, <lb/>
            and had I myself happened to be skilled in horsemanship, I <lb/>
            would have endeavoured to cause you to cease from your <lb/>
            differences in opinion; for I should have been ashamed had I <lb/>
            not, if present, prevented, as far as I could, your being at vari­ <lb/>
            ance ; or if you had been at variance upon any other matter <lb/>
            whatever, and were about to separate not at all, unless you <lb/>
            agreed upon 4this, rather as enemies instead of being friends. <lb/>
            But now,4 since you happen to be at variance upon an affair of <lb/>
            this kind, of which there must needs be the use through the <lb/>
            whole of life, and a great difference, whether we are to attend <lb/>
            to it, as being beneficial or not; and this too as being a part <lb/>
            not of trifling questions, but of those that are thought to be <lb/>
            the greatest by the Greeks, since fathers recommend this as <lb/>

            to consider from whence they shall become wealthy; 1so that <lb/>
            should you possess anything you are worth something, but if <lb/>
            not, nothing.1 [10.] If then this object is made so violently <lb/>
            a serious pursuit, and you, who agree on other matters, differ <lb/>
            upon this one of such great moment, and still in addition you <lb/>
            are at variance on the question of wealth, not whether it is <lb/>
            of a 2 black colour or white,2 nor whether of a light weight or <lb/>
            heavy, but whether it is an evil or a good, so as even to be <lb/>
            arrayed to the extreme of enmity, should you be at variance <lb/>
            about things evil and good, and this too, although you are <lb/>
            friends as much as possible, and relations, I will not, as far as <lb/>
            rests with myself, neglect you, while at variance with each <lb/>
            other; but, if I were able myself, I would tell you how the <lb/>
            case stands, and cause you to cease from your difference (in <lb/>
            opinion). But now, since I happen to be not able, and each <lb/>
            of, you thinks himself able to cause the other to agree with <lb/>
            him, I am prepared to take a part (in the discussion), as far <lb/>
            as I can, in order that it may be agreed upon by you how the <lb/>
            matter stands. Do you then, Critias, said I, endeavour to <lb/>
            cause us to agree with you, as you have undertaken to do.</p>
          <p>[11.] I would, said he, as I have begun, gladly ask Eryxias <lb/>
            here, whether there seem to him to be men unjust and just. <lb/>
            By Zeus, said he, and very much so. Well then, to act un­ <lb/>
            justly seems it to you to be an evil or a good ? To me at <lb/>
            least an evil. Would a man, who commits adultery with his <lb/>
            neighbours'wives by means of money, seem to you to act un­ <lb/>
            justly? and this too when the state and the laws forbid it. <lb/>
            To me at least he would seem to act unjustly. Consequently, <lb/>
            said he, if the unjust man happens to be wealthy, and 3both <lb/>
            able and willing to expend money,3 lie would go astray ; but <lb/>
            if it were not his fortune to be rich, he would not have the <lb/>
            means of expending, nor would he be able to accomplish what <lb/>
            he wished, so that he would not even go astray. Hence it <lb/>
            would be a greater benefit to the party to be not wealthy, <note type="footnote"> 1—1 Fischer quotes opportunely Horace Sat. i. 1, 62, "Nil satis est, <lb/>

            wished to do what was wrong. And again, would you say <lb/>
            that to be ill is an evil or a good? I would say an evil. <lb/>
            Well then, do there seem to you to be some men, who are <lb/>
            without self-control ? Yes, to me at least. If then it were <lb/>
            better for a person of this kind for the sake of his health to <lb/>
            abstain from food and drink, and the rest of things that are <lb/>
            thought to be pleasant, while he is unable (to do so) through <lb/>
            his want of self-control, it would be better for that per­ <lb/>
            son, that there should not be from whence he could procure <lb/>
            those things for himself, rather than have a great superfluity in <lb/>
            the necessaries (of life); for thus there would not be the power <lb/>
            for him to go astray, not even if he vehemently wished it.</p>
          <p>[12.] So well and beautifully was Critias thought to have <lb/>
            spoken, that had not Eryxias felt a respect for those, who <lb/>
            were present, nothing would have prevented him from getting <lb/>
            up and striking Critias; of so great a thing did he deem him­ <lb/>
            self to have been deprived; since it was evident to him, that <lb/>
            he had previously formed not a correct opinion on the subject <lb/>
            of wealth. Perceiving then that Eryxias was in this state, <lb/>
            and careful that abuse and opposition should not proceed too <lb/>
            far, I remarked, that Prodicus, the wise man of Ceos, had, <lb/>
            when detailing this very argument, seemed to those, who were <lb/>
            present, to be such a trifler as to be unable to persuade a sin­ <lb/>
            gle person present that he was speaking what was true; and <lb/>
            thereupon a lad very young and a clever talker, who was sit­ <lb/>
            ting by, laughed at and jeered him, and put him up, desirous <lb/>
            to get at the reasons for what he was saying; and in truth he <lb/>
            became in much higher repute amongst the auditors than <lb/>
            Prodicus himself. Might you have it in your power, said <lb/>
            Erasistratus, to tell us his reasons ? Completely so, if in­ <lb/>
            deed I remember it. For it was, I think, something to this <lb/>
            effect.</p>
          <p>[13.] The lad asked him, in what way he conceived <lb/>
            wealth to be an evil, and in what a good ? when he taking <lb/>
            up the discourse, observed-Just as you do likewise, that to <lb/>
            persons beautiful in body and mind it is a good, and to such <lb/>
            as know how to use it, to these likewise it is a good; but to <lb/>
            the depraved and those who do not know, it is an evil. And <lb/>
            all the rest of things, said he, are in this state. For of what <lb/>
            kind are some of those, who make use of things, such to them <pb n="69"/>
            <note type="margin"> c. 14.] </note> <lb/>
            it is necessary for the things to be; and prettily, said he, ap­ <lb/>
            pears to have been put into verse the sentiment of Archi­ <lb/>
            lochus— <lb/>
            As the actions are men meet with, so the thoughts are, which they frame.. <lb/>
            Now then, said the lad, if any one should make me wise in <lb/>
            that very wisdom, by which the good become wise men, it is <lb/>
            necessary for him to make at the same time the rest of things <lb/>
            good for me, without his troubling himself at all about those <lb/>
            very things, because he has made me wise instead of being <lb/>
            untaught; as if a person should make me now a grammarian, <lb/>
            it is necessary for him to make the rest of things grammatical <lb/>
            for me; and if a musician, musical; just as when he makes <lb/>
            me good, (it is necessary) to have made things good at the <lb/>
            game time for me. To the latter assertion Prodicus however <lb/>
            did not assent; although he acknowledged the former. <lb/>
            [14.] Does it seem to you, said he, that as it is the work of <lb/>
            a man to make a dwelling, so it is to make things good ? or is <lb/>
            it necessary for things to continue to the end to be such, as <lb/>
            they may have been at the commencement, whether evil or <lb/>
            good ? And Prodicus seemed to me to suspect to what point <lb/>
            the argument was about to proceed in so2 very clever a man­ <lb/>
            ner ; (and),3 in order that he might not appear before all pre­ <lb/>
            sent to be confuted by the lad—for he thought it would be a <lb/>
            thing of indifference for him to suffer this when alone-he said <lb/>
            it was the work of a man. Does 4 virtue, said (the lad), seem <lb/>
            to you a thing to be taught,4 or is it innate ? To be taught, he <lb/>
            replied, at least by5 me. Would not then, said he, a person <lb/>
            appear to be silly, if he thought that, by praying to the gods, <lb/>
            he should become a grammarian or a musician, or obtain any <lb/>
            other science, which it is necessary for a person to obtain <lb/>
            by either learning from another or discovering himself? To <note type="footnote"> 1 I have with Stephens followed Comarius, who suggested <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐστὶν</foreign> for <lb/>

            this too he assented. Do not you then, Prodicus, said the lad, <lb/>
            when you pray to the gods to do well, and for good things to <lb/>
            happen, pray at that time for nothing else but to become <lb/>
            beautiful in body and mind; since to men beautiful in body <lb/>
            and mind things likewise happen to be good, but bad to the <lb/>
            depraved. If then virtue happens to be able to be taught, <lb/>
            you would appear to be praying for nothing else than to be <lb/>
            taught, what you do not know.</p>
          <p>[15.] I said then to Prodicus, that he seemed to me to have <lb/>
            suffered a thing of not a trifling kind, if he had happened to <lb/>
            fail in this; at least if he conceived that, what we pray for <lb/>
            from the gods, would take place 1even at the same time. For <lb/>
            should you go in haste on each occasion to a city,2 and in your <lb/>
            prayers ask of the gods to give good things, you nevertheless <lb/>
            would not know whether they are able to give you what you <lb/>
            happen to ask for, as you would do, if you were to go to the <lb/>
            doors of a grammar-master, and beg of him to impart the <lb/>
            knowledge of grammar, and to trouble himself about nothing <lb/>
            else but the science, which you can receive on the instant, and <lb/>
            (by which) you will be able to do the works of the grammar- <lb/>
            master. On my saying this, Prodicus directed his course to <lb/>
            the lad, as about to defend himself, and to make a display, as <lb/>
            you have done just now, and taking it to heart should he <lb/>
            appear to have prayed to the gods in vain. And thereupon the <lb/>
            ruler of the Gymnasium advancing, bade him take himself away <lb/>
            from the Gymnasium, as he was conversing upon subjects not <lb/>
            suited to young persons; and if not suited, evidently wrong.</p>
          <p>[16.] This account have I detailed for the sake of this, <lb/>
            that you may see how situated are the persons engaged in phi­ <lb/>
            losophy. For if Prodicus had been present, and spoken thus, <lb/>
            he would have appeared to those present to be so mad, 3 as to <lb/>
            be ejected even from the Gymnasium.3 But you seem to <lb/>
            have now talked so extremely well, as not only to have per­ <lb/>

            opposite side to agree with you; (and)1 it is evident that, as <lb/>
            in courts of law, if two persons happened to give the same <lb/>
            evidence, one seeming to be correct in body and mind, but <lb/>
            the other depraved (in both), the judges would, on account of <lb/>
            the testimony of the depraved character, be not at all con­ <lb/>
            vinced ; but, as it might happen, do even the reverse; but if <lb/>
            the person, who seemed to be correct in body and mind, had <lb/>
            so stated (alone),2 the statement would have seemed to be <lb/>
            vehemently true. Perhaps then the parties are situated in <lb/>
            some such manner with respect to yourself and Prodicus ; and <lb/>
            one they consider a sophist and a vain talker, but yourself a <lb/>
            statesman and a man of much worth; and then they imagine <lb/>
            that they ought not to look to the speech itself, but to the <lb/>
            speakers, of what kind they may be. But nevertheless, said <lb/>
            Erasistratus, although you are speaking in ridicule, Socrates, <lb/>
            it seems to myself at least, that Critias appears to say some­ <lb/>
            thing (well). Nay, said I, by Zeus, nothing whatever. But <lb/>
            why, since you have conversed upon these matters well and <lb/>
            beautifully, do you not finish what remains of your discourse ? <lb/>
            For there seems to me something still remaining of the in­ <lb/>
            quiry, especially since this appears to be acknowledged, that <lb/>
            (wealth) is to some a good, but to others an evil. There re­ <lb/>
            mains then to inquire what is wealth in the abstract. For if <lb/>
            we do not know this first, we shall not be able to agree as to <lb/>
            what portion is an evil, and what a good; and I am prepared, <lb/>
            as far as I can, to make the inquiry with you. Let then the <lb/>
            person, who asserts that to be wealthy is a good, say on this <lb/>
            point how the case happens to be.</p>
          <p>[17.] Nay, said he, I do not, Socrates, define wealth in any <lb/>
            way more cleverly than the rest of mankind. For this is to <lb/>
            be wealthy, to possess much money. And I conceive that Cri­ <lb/>
            tias here does not think that to be wealthy is any thing else. <lb/>
            Even thus, said I, there will be something still left to consider, <lb/>
            of what kind is the money, in order that you may not shortly <lb/>
            afterwards appear to be at variance on this point again. For <lb/>
            instance, you know 3 that the Carthaginians make use of money <lb/>
            of this kind. In a small skin there is bound up as much as is <note type="footnote"> I I have inserted <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ</foreign>, which seems to have dropt out after <foreign xml:lang="grc">σοὶ</foreign>— </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The antithesis evidently requires ravra <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὸς</foreign>— where <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὸς</foreign> might <lb/>

            the weight of a stater at most. But what is so bound up <lb/>
            within, no one knows, except those who make it up. They then <lb/>
            deem it a legal tender,2 when a seal has been put upon it; and <lb/>
            he, who possesses the greatest number of these skins, is thought <lb/>
            to possess the most money, and to be the wealthiest. But if <lb/>
            any one amongst us were in possession of such things to the <lb/>
            greatest amount, he would be not a whit more wealthy, than <lb/>
            if he possessed many pebbles from the mountain ;3 but at La­ <lb/>
            cedæmon they deem a weight of iron a legal tender, and this <lb/>
            when it is the useless part of iron; and he, who possesses <lb/>
            a great weight of such kind of iron, is thought to be wealthy; <lb/>
            but elsewhere its possession is worth nothing ; while in Æthi­ <lb/>
            opia they make use of engraved stones, of which a man of <lb/>
            Laconia would not have the power to make any use. But <lb/>
            amongst the nomade Scythians, if a person possessed the re­ <lb/>
            sidence of Polytion, he would be thought to be not at all more <lb/>
            wealthy, than if a person amongst us were the owner of the <lb/>
            mountain Lycabettus. [18.] It is plain then that each of <lb/>
            these things cannot be property; since some of those, who <lb/>
            have possessed them, appear to have been not at all more <lb/>
            wealthy on this account. But each of these, said I, exist in <lb/>
            reality5 as property to some persons, and they who possess <lb/>
            them are wealthy; but to others they are not property, nor <lb/>
            are persons on this account more wealthy; just as the same <lb/>
            things6 are neither honourable nor disgraceful to all, but dif­ <lb/>
            ferent to different persons. If then we are willing to inquire <lb/>
            why amongst the Scythians houses are not property, but are <lb/>
            so with us; or why amongst the Carthaginians skins are so, <lb/>
            but not with us; or why amongst the Lacedæmonians iron is <lb/>

            Athens possess a thousand talents-weight of the stones in the <lb/>
            Market-place, of which we make no use, is it that he would <lb/>
            be deemed to be wealthier on that account ? It appears not, <lb/>
            at least to me. But if he possessed a thousand talents-weight <lb/>
            of the stone called lychnite,1 we should say that he was very <lb/>
            wealthy. Very indeed. [19.] Is it, said I, on this account, <lb/>
            because the latter is useful to us, but the former useless ? <lb/>
            Yes. Especially since amongst the Scythians houses are on <lb/>
            this account not property to them, because they have no use <lb/>
            for a house ; nor would a Scythian put any value upon the most <lb/>
            beautiful house for himself rather than a sheep-skin cloak; <lb/>
            because the latter is useful to him, but the former useless. <lb/>
            2 Again, on the other hand,2 we do not consider the money of <lb/>
            Carthage as property. For there is not an article of those we <lb/>
            are in want of, which we can carry off by it,3 as we can by <lb/>
            silver; so that it would be useless to us. It is likely. What­ <lb/>
            ever things then happen to be useful to us, these are property; <lb/>
            but whatever are useless, are not property. How is this, So­ <lb/>
            crates ? said Eryxias, taking up the discourse. Is there not what <lb/>
            we make use of for conversing with each other, and 4 for doing a <lb/>
            hurt,4 and many other things ? And would these be a pro­ <lb/>
            perty ? And yet they appear to be useful. 5 Not even thus <lb/>
            then5 has it appeared to us what is a property. For that it <lb/>
            is necessary that a property, if it is about to exist at all, <lb/>
            should be useful, is acknowledged nearly by all. But what is <lb/>
            the kind of property, since it is not of every kind. [20.] <lb/>

            property, and for what has the possession of property been <lb/>
            discovered, as drugs have 2for causing diseases to go away?2 <lb/>
            for perhaps it would thus become more clear. Since then it <lb/>
            seems a thing of necessity, that, whatever happens to be pro­ <lb/>
            perty, must be useful likewise, and that of things useful <lb/>
            there is one kind, which we call property, it will still be <lb/>
            left to inquire, 3 for what need are the things, which are meet <lb/>
            to be called property, useful ? 3 For all things are equally <lb/>
            useful, of which we make use for any 4 operation, just as all <lb/>
            that have life are living things; of which living things one <lb/>
            kind we call man. If then a person were to ask us—By <lb/>
            what thing being removed out of the way shall we have no <lb/>
            need of the physician's art, nor of its instruments ? we should <lb/>
            be able to say-If diseases were removed from our bodies, <lb/>
            and did not exist at all, or if existing, were removed on the in­ <lb/>
            stant. Of sciences then the medical is, as it seems, that, which <lb/>
            is useful for this purpose, to cause the removal of diseases. <lb/>
            [21.] And if a person should again ask us—By the removal <lb/>
            of what thing are we in no need of property, should we <lb/>
            be able to tell? But if not, let us consider the matter thus. <lb/>
            Come (say), if a man could live without food and drink, and <lb/>
            were neither hungry nor thirsty, is there a reason why he <lb/>
            should want those very things, or silver, or any thing else, <lb/>
            in order that he might obtain them? To myself at least it <lb/>
            does not seem (he would). In the same manner then are the <lb/>
            rest of things. For if we did not want the things, of which <lb/>

            of which the body1 [being deficient]1 is in want, that, which is <lb/>
            called property, would be not used by us; at least if no one <lb/>
            wanted at all any one of these things, for the sake of which <lb/>
            we should wish to possess property, in order that 2 we may <lb/>
            possess what is sufficient2 for our desires, and the wants of <lb/>
            the body, of which we may on each occasion stand in need. <lb/>
            If then the possession of property is useful for this purpose, <lb/>
            namely, the attention to the wants of the body, should this <lb/>
            be taken away from the midst of us, we should not be in want <lb/>
            of property, and property would perhaps not exist at all. It <lb/>
            appears so. [22.] -It appears then, as is likely, that what are <lb/>
            useful for this doing of things, are property. That such was <lb/>
            property he acknowledged indeed ; the reasoning nevertheless <lb/>
            troubled him exceedingly. But what are these kind of things ? <lb/>
            (said he). Shall we say that the same thing can be useful for <lb/>
            the same operation at one time, but useless at another ? I <lb/>
            would not say so; but if we have any want of the same thing 3 <lb/>
            for the same operation, it seems to me it would be useful; but <lb/>
            if not, not. Hence, if we could work up a brazen image <lb/>
            without fire, we should not be in want of fire for such an <lb/>
            operation; and if we did not want it, it would not be useful <lb/>
            to us. And the same reasoning applies to the rest of things. <lb/>
            It appears so. Of such things then as it is possible for a <lb/>
            thing to exist without them, not one of them would appear to <lb/>
            be useful, at least for that thing. It would not. If then we <lb/>
            should appear at any time able, without silver and gold, and <lb/>
            the rest of such kind of things, which we do not use for the <lb/>

            useful. But those things would be (property), by which we <lb/>
            are able to obtain what are useful.</p>
          <p>[23.] I could never, Socrates, be able to be persuaded of <lb/>
            this, that gold and silver and the rest of things of that kind <lb/>
            are not property. For of this I am strongly persuaded, that, <lb/>
            as things without use are not property, so of things the most <lb/>
            useful 1property is useful for it.1 Nevertheless (I am not <lb/>
            persuaded) of this, that these things happen to be not useful <lb/>
            to us; since by them we obtain the necessaries (of life). Come <lb/>
            then (say), how shall we speak of these things ? Are there <lb/>
            not certain persons, who teach music or letters, or any other <lb/>
            science, who in return for such instruction obtain for them­ <lb/>
            selves the necessaries (of life) by bargaining for a remunera­ <lb/>
            tion for such things ? There are. Would not then these persons <lb/>
            by such science obtain for themselves the necessaries (of life), by <lb/>
            making an exchange for it, as we now do for gold and silver ? <lb/>
            I confess it. If then they obtain by this act, what they make <lb/>
            use of for living, this act would be useful for their living; for <lb/>
            we have said that silver is useful on this account, that we are <lb/>
            enabled by it to procure what is necessary for the body. It is <lb/>
            so, said he.</p>
          <p>[24.] If then the sciences of things useful for it are these, <lb/>
            sciences would appear 2 to be property for the very same rea­ <lb/>
            son that gold and silver are. 3It is evident. It is evident too3 <lb/>
            that those, who possess these sciences, are rather wealthy. But <lb/>
            we admitted a little before with so much difficulty the reason­ <lb/>
            ing, whether they were the wealthiest. But from what has <lb/>
            been just now admitted, this would of necessity happen, that <lb/>
            the rather intelligent are rather wealthy. For should a per­ <lb/>

            not then all the rest of things in a similar condition ? It is <lb/>
            likely. Gold then and silver and the rest of things, which are <lb/>
            thought to be property, would be useful to him alone, who <lb/>
            happens to know how to use them. Just so. Did it not seem <lb/>
            before to be the part of persons superior both in body and <lb/>
            mind to know where and how to make use of each of these <lb/>
            things ? I admit it. [25.] To those men alone then, who <lb/>
            are superior in body and mind, these things would be useful; <lb/>
            since they (alone) 1 know how to use them. If then they are <lb/>
            useful to these alone, to these alone they would appear to be <lb/>
            property. 2Is it so? It is likely.2 Him too, who is un­ <lb/>
            skilled in horsemanship, yet possesses horses that happen to <lb/>
            be useless to him, should a person render skilful, would he <lb/>
            not at the same time make him more wealthy, since he makes <lb/>
            things to be useful to him which previously happened to be <lb/>
            useless ? For by imparting skill to the person he at the same <lb/>
            time makes him wealthy likewise. It seems so. And yet I <lb/>
            think I could swear on behalf of Critias, that he is persuaded <lb/>
            by none of these arguments. (And truly so), by Zeus. For <lb/>
            I should be mad if I were persuaded. But why have you not <lb/>
            completed that part of the argument, how that gold and silver <lb/>
            and the rest of things of that kind are not, although they seem <lb/>
            to be, property ? since I am very much delighted to hear those <lb/>
            arguments, which you happen to be just now going through. <lb/>
            Thereupon I observed that you appear to me, Critias, to be <lb/>

            to house-builders for making a dwelling ? So it seems at least <lb/>
            to me. Whether then shall we say that those things would be <lb/>
            useful, which they1 make use of for house-building, namely, <lb/>
            stones and bricks, and wood, and if there be any thing else of <lb/>
            this kind ? or that there are tools, with which they make the <lb/>
            dwelling, and by which they obtain these things, namely, the <lb/>
            wood and the stone, and again, the tools for them ? To myself <lb/>
            at least it seems, said he, that all these (the tools) are useful <lb/>
            for those (the materials). Hence, said I, in the case of the <lb/>
            rest of operations, not only are those things2 (useful), which we <lb/>
            make use of for each of the works, but those also, by which <lb/>
            we obtain them, and without which they would not exist. It <lb/>
            is entirely so. Hence, both for those, who possess these (the <lb/>
            tools), and 3 if there be any thing further up,3 and for those <lb/>
            who possess these (the materials) 4and what is further up,4 <lb/>
            so that at last they come to some infinite multitude, it is ne­ <lb/>
            cessary for all these to appear useful for their operations: <lb/>
            There is nothing, said he, to prevent such from being the case. <lb/>
            [27.] Well then, if food and drink, and clothing, and the other <lb/>
            things which a person is about to make use of for the body, <lb/>
            were in his power, would he want in addition gold and silver, <lb/>
            or any thing else, by which he could obtain what was in his <lb/>
            power? It appears to me he would not. Would it not then <lb/>
            appear to us, that sometimes a person does not want any of <lb/>
            those things, which relate to the needs of the body ? (Yes.) <lb/>
            For he does not want them. Hence if they appeared to be <lb/>
            useless for this operation, they could not, on the other hand, be <lb/>
            deemed to appear useful. For it has been laid down, that it <lb/>
            is not possible for things to be at one time useful, and at an­ <lb/>
            other useless, as regards the same operation. In this way at <lb/>
            least, said he, the same reasoning would hold good to both you <lb/>
            and me. For if these were at any time useful for this pur­ <lb/>
            pose, it never would happen for them to be on the other hand <lb/>
            useless. 5 But now to some operations of depraved doings, <note type="footnote"> 1 In lieu of <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἰ̃ς αὐτω̃ν</foreign>, where the genitive has no meaning, I should <lb/>

            but to others of good.5 I should say so. 1 Is it not possible <lb/>
            then for a depraved act to be useful for the working out of some <lb/>
            good?1 It does not seem so to myself at least. But good <lb/>
            acts we should say are those, which a man does through virtue. <lb/>
            I admit it. Is it not possible for a person to learn some of <lb/>
            the things, which are taught by conversation, although he were <lb/>
            deprived of hearing, 2or any thing else?2 By Zeus, it does <lb/>
            not seem so to me at least. Hence, of the things useful for <lb/>
            virtue hearing would appear 3 to be one,3 if at least virtue is to <lb/>
            be taught by hearing, and we make use of it for instruction. <lb/>
            It appears so. [28.] Hence, if medical art is able to cure <lb/>
            a person diseased, even medical art would sometimes appear <lb/>
            to be one5 of the things useful for virtue, if 6 through it be <lb/>
            furnished the power of hearing what relates to the thing to be <lb/>
            taught.6 There is nothing to prevent it. If then again we <lb/>
            obtain medical science in return for property, even property <lb/>
            would appear to be useful for virtue. Yes, said he ; for such <lb/>
            it is. Hence, again, in like manner, that (would be useful), by <lb/>
            which we could obtain property. Yes, all such by all means. <lb/>
            Now does it not seem to you that a person could from acts <lb/>
            depraved and disgraceful obtain for himself silver, in return <lb/>
            for which he might obtain medical science, or be able to hear, <lb/>
            after being unable ? and to use that very (hearing) for virtue, <lb/>
            or any other things of that kind ? To me at least it does seem <lb/>
            very much so. Would not then the depraved be useful for <lb/>
            virtue ? It would. It is not necessary then for those things, <lb/>
            by which we can obtain what is useful for each, to be them­ <lb/>
            selves useful for the same. For things depraved would some­ <lb/>

            unless these had existed previously, come (say), how shall we <lb/>
            speak of things of this kind ? Is it possible for ignorance to <lb/>
            be useful for science, or disease for health, or vice for virtue ? <lb/>
            I should say, not. [29.] And yet we should agree in this, <lb/>
            that it is impossible for science to be produced in him, in <lb/>
            whom ignorance had not existed previously; or health, in him <lb/>
            in whom disease had not (existed); or virtue, in him in <lb/>
            whom vice had not. The fact, said he, is so, as it seems <lb/>
            to me. Hence it would not be necessary for those things <lb/>
            to be useful, without which a thing is not able to exist. <lb/>
            For (otherwise) 1 ignorance would appear to be useful for <lb/>
            science; and disease, for health ; and vice, for virtue. Of <lb/>
            these arguments too he was very hard of belief, 2 unless <lb/>
            all these things shall be property.2 And I, knowing him <lb/>
            thoroughly, that it would be an equally hard task to con­ <lb/>
            vince him, as, according to the saying, to boil a stone, said- <lb/>
            Let us bid a long 3 farewell to these arguments; since we are <lb/>
            unable to agree, whether the same things are useful, and a pro­ <lb/>
            perty, or not. But how shall we say on this question? <lb/>
            Whether shall we consider a person happier and better, who <lb/>
            is in want of the greatest number of things necessary for his <lb/>
            body and living, or him, who (is in want) of the fewest and <lb/>
            most trifling ? Now this question would perhaps be viewed in <lb/>
            the best manner,4 thus. Should one compare a person himself <lb/>
            with himself, and consider which of his states is the better, <lb/>
            whether, when he happens to be ill, or in health. But this at <lb/>
            least, said he, does not require any great consideration. For <lb/>
            perhaps, said I, it is easy for every simpleton to know 5 that <lb/>
            the state of the person in health is better than that of the per­ <lb/>
            son ill. Well then, at what time do we happen to be in want <lb/>
            of things more in number and variety? when we are ill, or in <note type="footnote"> 1 This " otherwise " is due to " alioquin," in the Latin version. </note><note type="footnote"> 2_2 The words between the numerals I cannot understand, nor could, <lb/>

            in. the desire, and the want of the greatest number of things <lb/>
            that relate to the pleasures of the body. It is so. [30.] <lb/>
            According to the same rule then, 2 as a person is in the best <lb/>
            condition for himself, when he is in want of the fewest of <lb/>
            these things, so on the other hand, if there were two persons, <lb/>
            one of whom happened to be greatly in the desire and want of <lb/>
            many things, and the other of few things and moderately so, <lb/>
            as for example things of this kind, such men as are dice­ <lb/>
            players, others wine-tipplers, and others of a voracious appe­ <lb/>
            tite, for all these happen to be nothing else than desires. <lb/>
            Very much so.2 Now all desires are nothing else than the <lb/>
            want of some things. (Nothing).3 The persons then, who <lb/>
            have suffered the most of these, are in a more depraved state <lb/>
            than those, who have suffered things of this kind either not <lb/>
            at all, or to the least extent. I consider then persons of this <lb/>
            kind to be very depraved; and the more they are of this kind, <lb/>
            the more depraved. It seems then to us that it is not possible <lb/>
            for these things to be useful for this purpose, unless we happen <lb/>
            to be in the want of these things for this purpose. I admit it. It <lb/>
            is necessary then, if these are about to be useful to us for the <lb/>
            care of the wants of the body, that we too should want them <lb/>
            for this purpose. So it seems at least to me. He then, to <lb/>
            whom the greatest number of things useful for this purpose <lb/>
            belongs, would appear to be in want of the greatest number <lb/>
            for this purpose, since it is necessary for him to feel a want of <lb/>
            all useful things. To me at least it seems to appear in this <lb/>
            way. It is necessary therefore, according to this reasoning, <lb/>
            for those, to whom there happens to be much property, to be <lb/>
            in much want of the things necessary for the care of the body. <lb/>
            For the things useful for this purpose have appeared to be <lb/>
            property ; so that of necessity they, who should appear to us <lb/>
            to be the wealthiest, are in the most depraved state, since they <lb/>
            are in want of the greatest number of things of this kind. <note type="footnote"> 1 In lieu of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ</foreign> the syntax and sense require <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̃ν</foreign>—as I have translated. </note><note type="footnote"> 2_2 As the apodosis is wanting in this long-winded sentence, I doubt not <lb/>

            <title type="main">INTRODUCTION TO THE DIALOGUE ON VIRTUE.</title>
          </head>
          <p>OF this dialogue, which contains little more than two portions of <lb/>
            the Mono, the authorship is attributed to Æschines by Suidas, whom <lb/>
            Fischer has followed; but by Boeckh to Simon, the shoemaker, in <lb/>
            consequence of his remarking that the follower of Socrates had written <lb/>
            two treatises respectively on Justice and Virtue, both of which are <lb/>
            found amongst the titles of the spurious dialogues. It is however <lb/>
            difficult to believe that any person, who was contemporary with <lb/>
            Plato, would condescend to pilfer from a fellow-writer; unless it be <lb/>
            said that Simon has given the dialogue as it really took place, with <lb/>
            the view of showing that nearly all of what Plato put into the <lb/>
            mouth of Socrates was the produce of the writer's own fertile <lb/>
            imagination.</p>
          <p>Be however the author who he may, it is a curious fact, that the <lb/>
            dialogue contains allusions to circumstances not mentioned by Plato, <lb/>
            but which could hardly have been known except to a contem­ <lb/>
            porary, as I have remarked in § 7, n. 6_6.</p>
          <p>No less curious is another fact, that amongst the confessedly <lb/>
            spurious dialogues of Plato, mentioned by Diogenes Laertius in in. <lb/>
            62, there is one under the title of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μίδων ἣ ῾Ιπποστρόφος</foreign>. But as the <lb/>
            Vienna MS. reads there <foreign xml:lang="grc">῾Ιπποτρόφος</foreign>, and the Vatican MS. of Plato, <lb/>
            marked <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ω</foreign> by Bekker, gives the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">῾Ιπποτρφος</foreign>, as the name of <lb/>
            the person conversing with Socrates, and as "Hippotrophus" is <lb/>
            found as one of the Interlocutors in the Latin version of this dia­ <lb/>
            logue made by Cincius Romanus, preserved amongst the additional <lb/>
            MSS. No. 11,760, in the British Museum, it is fair to infer that the <note type="footnote"> G 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="84"/>
            real title was <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μίδων ἢ ῾Ιπποτρόφος</foreign>. For thus Midon the horse- <lb/>
            breeder would be the origin of Menon of Thessaly, a country <lb/>
            famous for its breed of horses. And it was from this coincidence in <lb/>
            the name furnished by three different sources, that I have been led <lb/>
            to examine more attentively than I should otherwise have done, the <lb/>
            version of Cincius; where I have discovered, what I little expected, <lb/>
            that the translator had, like Ficinus in other parts of Plato, met <lb/>
            with a MS. more full than any subsequently collated, as may be <lb/>
            seen in my notes.</p>
          <p>With regard to the next dialogue " On Justice," I have only to <lb/>
            remark, that it was in existence in the time of Thrasyllus, from <lb/>
            whom Diogenes Laertius drew the greater part of his information <lb/>
            relating to the Platonic and Pseudo-Platonic writings.</p>

          <p>[1.] Is Virtue a thing to be taught, or to be not taught? <lb/>
            but1 do men become good by nature, or by any other means ? <lb/>
            I cannot, Socrates, state at present. But let us consider the <lb/>
            matter in this way. Come then, (say,) if a person wished to <lb/>
            become good in the virtue,2 in which clever cooks are good, <lb/>
            from whence would he become so? It is evident, if he <lb/>
            learnt from good cooks. Well then, if a person wished to <lb/>
            become a good physician, by going to whom would he become <lb/>
            a good physician ? It is evident, by going to some one of <lb/>
            the good physicians. But if he wished to become good in <lb/>
            the art, in which clever carpenters (are good) ? To (some <lb/>
            one) of the (good) carpenters.</p>
          <p>[2.] If then he wished to be good in the virtue, in which <lb/>
            men are good and clever, whither must he go and learn ? I <lb/>
            conceive to (some one) of the (good) men (to learn) this, if it <lb/>
            is to be learnt; for from whence else? Come then, (say,) <lb/>
            who are the men that have become good ? in order that we <lb/>
            may see whether these are the persons, who make men good, <lb/>
            Thucydides,3 and Themistocles, and Aristides, and Pericles. <note type="footnote"> 1 This <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλὰ</foreign> is strangely introduced here. But as it is found in the <lb/>
            Meno, § 1, although in a manner perfectly proper there, it would be un­ <lb/>
            critical perhaps to remove it. Cincius however has what is preferable, <lb/>
            " Estne virtus o Hyppotrophe, res quae doctrina percipi possit? an contra ? <lb/>
            Num viri boni natura efficiuntur, sive alio quodam modo ?" </note><note type="footnote"> 2 By " virtue," was meant not merely a moral quality, as with us, but <lb/>
            " excellence," generally. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 This word should evidently follow <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ Περικλη̃ς</foreign>, to preserve the <lb/>
            order in which they are taken subsequently, not only in this dialogue, but </note> <pb n="86"/>
            <note type="margin"> [c. 3, 4. </note> <lb/>
            Have we it in our power to say who was the teacher of each <lb/>
            of these? We have not; for it is not told. Well then, (can <lb/>
            we mention) any pupil, either-amongst strangers or citizens or <lb/>
            any one else, either a free man or a slave, who assigns as the <lb/>
            cause of his having become wise and good his inter­ <lb/>
            course with them ? This too is not told. But they did not <lb/>
            surely grudge to share their virtue with other persons. Per­ <lb/>
            haps so. Was it that there might not be rival artists, just as <lb/>
            cooks, and physicians, and carpenters feel a jealousy; 1 since it <lb/>
            is not to their advantage for many rival artists to exist, nor <lb/>
            for them to dwell amongst many similar persons. Is it then <lb/>
            in like manner not an advantage for good men to dwell amongst <lb/>
            many similar persons ? Perhaps so. [3.] Are not the good <lb/>
            and the just the same ? Yes, they are. Is there the individual, <lb/>
            to whom it is an advantage to live not amongst good persons, <lb/>
            but amongst bad ? I cannot tell. Can you not tell this too, <lb/>
            whether it is the work of good men to do a hurt, and of bad <lb/>
            men to do a benefit, or the reverse ? The reverse. The good <lb/>
            then do a benefit, the bad do a hurt. Yes. Is there a per­ <lb/>
            son who wishes to be hurt rather than to be benefited ? By <lb/>
            no means. No one therefore wishes to live amongst bad per­ <lb/>
            sons, rather than amongst good. It is so. Not one then of <lb/>
            the good is so jealous of another, as (not) 2 to make him a good <lb/>
            person and similar to himself. From this 3 reasoning it seems so. <lb/>
            [4.] You have heard that Cleophantus was the son of Themis­ <lb/>
            tocles. I have heard it. It is evident then that Themistocles <lb/>
            was not jealous of his son becoming the best possible; who (was <lb/>
            jealous of)4 no one else, if indeed he was a good man; and <lb/>
            (good)5 they say he was. Yes. You know then that Themis­ <lb/>
            tocles caused his son to be taught to be a clever and a good <lb/>
            horseman. For instance he used to remain 6 standing upright <note type="footnote"> in the Meno, § 33, 4, where Sydenham was the first to remark that this <lb/>
            Thucydides was not the historian, but a political opponent of Pericles. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Fischer refers to Hesiod Epy. 25, Kat <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὺκεραμες κεραμε</foreign>ĩ <foreign xml:lang="grc">κοτέει, καὶ <lb/>

            upon horses, and upright too hurled a javelin from (the backs <lb/>
            of) the horses, and did many other wonderful feats, 1 and taught <lb/>
            him, and made him wise in many other things, 1 such as are <lb/>
            closely connected with a good education. Or have you not heard <lb/>
            so from elderly persons ? I have heard it. No one then could <lb/>
            find fault with the son's nature as being bad.2 Not justly so <lb/>
            at least from what you have said. [5.] But what is this ? <lb/>
            that Cleophantus, the son of Themistocles, became a good and <lb/>
            wise man in the matters where his father was wise, have <lb/>
            you ever heard from any younger or older person ? I have <lb/>
            not heard it. Do we then conceive that he wished to instruct <lb/>
            his own son in these matters ; but in the wisdom, in which <lb/>
            he was wise himself, not to make him better than any of his <lb/>
            neighbours, if virtue were a thing to be taught ? It is not <lb/>
            likely at least. [6.] Of such a kind then is this your teacher <lb/>
            of virtue, to whom you have alluded ?3 Let us then look to <lb/>
            another, by name Aristides, who brought up Lysimachus, and <lb/>
            instructed him the best of the Athenians on such subjects <lb/>
            as are connected with (good)4 teachers; and yet he made him <lb/>
            a man no better than any body ; for both you and I have seen <lb/>
            and associated with him. It is true. [7.] You know too <lb/>
            that Pericles brought up well 5 his sons Paralus and Xan­ <lb/>
            thippus, 6 of the latter of whom you seem to me to have been <lb/>
            the lover.6 These, as you know yourself, he taught to be <lb/>
            horsemen inferior to none of the Athenians ; and he instructed <note type="footnote">reading from Meno, § 32, in lieu of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπέβαινε</foreign>, although in both places the <lb/>

            all the other things that are learnt by art. But did he not <lb/>
            wish to make them good men ? But perhaps, Socrates, they <lb/>
            would have become so, had they not died young. I You <lb/>
            reasonably come to the aid of your beloved.' But Pericles <lb/>
            would have much rather made them clever in his own wisdom, <lb/>
            than in music and contests, had virtue been a thing to be <lb/>
            taught, and had he been able to make them good men. [8.] <lb/>
            But (I fear) that it is a thing not to be taught; since Thu­ <lb/>
            cydides brought up well2 his two sons, Melesias and Stepha­ <lb/>
            nus, 3 in behalf of whom you will not have it in your power to <lb/>
            say, what you have done in behalf of the sons of Pericles; for <lb/>
            one of these you surely know lived to old age, and the other <lb/>
            much beyond.3 And yet their father taught them well other <lb/>
            pursuits, and they wrestled the best of the Athenians. For <lb/>
            he put one under Xanthias, and the other under Eudorus; <lb/>
            and these were surely thought to wrestle the best of those of <lb/>
            that period. Yes, they were. [9.] Is it not evident then, <lb/>
            that he would not have taught his sons these things, where4 it <lb/>
            was requisite to instruct them at an expense to himself, but those <lb/>
            where5 without expending any thing it was requisite to make <lb/>
            them good men. Now would he not have taught them this, <lb/>
            if it were to be taught ? It is likely at least. But perhaps <lb/>
            Thucydides was a man of small means, and had not very <lb/>
            many friends amongst the Athenians or their allies ; and6 he <lb/>
            was of a great family, and of great power in the state, and <lb/>

              thing to be taught, he would have discovered a person amongst <lb/>
              those of the country, or foreigners, who would have made his <lb/>
              son a good man, if he himself had, through his attention to <lb/>
              state affairs, no leisure. But (I fear) that virtue is a thing <lb/>
              not to be taught. Perhaps not. [10.] But if it is not to be <lb/>
              taught, are the good naturally so from, their birth ? But this <lb/>
              perhaps we shall discover by considering the matter in this <lb/>
              way. Come then, (say,) do there exist the natures of good <lb/>
              horses ? They do exist. Are there not men, who possess an <lb/>
              art, by which they know the natures of good horses, both as <lb/>
              regards their body, with reference to running, and their feel­ <lb/>
              ings, which of them are full of spirit or devoid of it. Yes. <lb/>
              What is this art, and what its name ? Equestrian. Is there <lb/>
              not in like manner an art relating to dogs, by which persons dis­ <lb/>
              criminate between the good and bad natures of dogs ? There is. <lb/>
              What is it ? The hunter's art. There are too assayers amongst us <lb/>
              of gold and silver, who, by looking, decide upon both the better <lb/>
              and the worse (metal). There are. And what do you call them ? <lb/>
              Silver assayers. [11.] The boy-drillers1 moreover know, by <lb/>
              examining the natures of the bodies of men, which of them are <lb/>
              useful and which not, for each of their labours, and which of <lb/>
              the bodies of persons older and young, are about to be worthy of <lb/>
              note, and in which there is much hope of their executing works <lb/>
              connected with the body. It is so. [12.] Whether then are <lb/>
              good horses and dogs, and other things of such a kind, of more <lb/>
              importance in states, or good men ? Good men. Well then, <lb/>
              do you conceive that, if the natures of men were good for vir­ <lb/>
              tue, that mankind would not have planned in every way to <lb/>
              discover those natures ? It is likely at least. Can you then <lb/>
              mention any art, which has been exhibited and applied to <lb/>
              the natures of good men, so as to enable persons to decide <lb/>
              upon them ? I cannot. And yet the art would be worth <lb/>
              much, and so too the parties possessing it. For they would <lb/>
              have pointed out the young men, who, when they were still <lb/>
              boys, were about to be good; and whom we should have taken <lb/>
              and kept in the Acropolis for the public use, as if it were silver, <lb/>
              and something more beautiful,2 in order that they might not suf­ <lb/>
              fer any mischief, either in a fight or in any other danger, but be <note type="footnote"> I On the <foreign xml:lang="grc">παιδοτρίβαι</foreign>, see my remarks on Crito, § 7, n. 5. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 As in Meno. § 25, the expression in a similar passage is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐφυλάττομεν <lb/>

              laid up as the saviours and benefactors of the state, since1 they <lb/>
              should have arrived at a proper age. But it seems almost that <lb/>
              virtue does not exist to mankind either by nature or instruction. <lb/>
              [13.] How then, Socrates, would persons seem to become <lb/>
              (good),2 if they do not become so by nature or instruction ? <lb/>
              By what other means could the good exist ? This, I think, <lb/>
              could not be shown easily ; but I conjecture that the property <lb/>
              (of goodness) is something especially divine, and that good <lb/>
              men exist, as prophets do and oracle chaunters. For these <lb/>
              exist neither by nature nor by art, but become such by the <lb/>
              inspiration of the gods. And so too good men point out to states <lb/>
              what is about on each occasion to happen, and what is about <lb/>
              to be, from the inspiration 3 of a god, much more, and more <lb/>
              clearly, than oracle chaunters do : and even women 4 somehow <lb/>
              say that such a person is a divine man; and the Lacedæmo­ <lb/>
              nians too, when they praise in a very handsome manner, say <lb/>
              that a man is divine,5 and often does Homer make use of the <lb/>
              same expression, and the rest of poets likewise. When there­ <lb/>
              fore a god wishes a state to do well, he causes some men in it <lb/>
              to be good; but when a state is about to do ill, the god takes <lb/>
              away the good men from it. Thus then it is likely that vir­ <lb/>
              tue is a thing not to be taught nor (derived) from nature, but <lb/>
              exists by a divine allotment to those who possess it. <note type="footnote"> if the Greek were <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάλλιον</foreign>, not <foreign xml:lang="grc">μα̃λλον</foreign>— The two words are constantly <lb/>

          <p>[1.] CAN you tell us what is justice? or does it seem to <lb/>
            you not worth entering into a discourse about it ? To me at <lb/>
            least (it seems) very much so. What is it then ? What else <lb/>
            than the things considered just. Do not (speak)1 to me in this <lb/>
            way; but, as if you had asked me—What is the eye ? I <lb/>
            should have said to you—It is that, by which we see; and if <lb/>
            you should bid me to prove it, I would prove it. And if you <lb/>
            should ask—To what is given the name of soul ? I would say <lb/>
            -To that, by which we know (something).2 And if again- <lb/>
            What is the voice ? I would answer-That, by which we con­ <lb/>
            verse. In this way then do you tell me that justice is that, <lb/>
            which we use for something, as are the things, of which I was <lb/>
            just now asking. I have it not in my power to reply in this <lb/>
            way at all. But, since such is the case, perhaps we shall dis­ <lb/>
            cover it more easily in this way. Come then, (say,) by what <lb/>
            do we, on consideration, distinguish the greater and the less ? <lb/>
            Is it not by a measure ? Yes. And together with a measure <lb/>
            by what art ? Is it not by that of measurement ? Yes. And <lb/>
            how things light and heavy? Is it not by weight? Yes. <lb/>
            And together with a weight by what art ? Is it not that of <lb/>
            weighing? Certainly.3 Well then, by what instrument do <note type="footnote"> 1 On the ellipse of <foreign xml:lang="grc">λέγε</foreign> after <foreign xml:lang="grc">μή μοι</foreign>, see my note on Æsch. Suppl. 284. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 I have translated, as if rt had dropt out before <foreign xml:lang="grc">γιγνώσκομεν</foreign>, which <lb/>

            we, on consideration, distinguish what is just and unjust ? and <lb/>
            together with the instrument, by what art previously ? Is it <lb/>
            not somehow manifest to you thus ? No. [2.] But1 (let us <lb/>
            consider it)1 again in this way. When we are disputing <lb/>
            about things greater and less, who decides between us ? Is <lb/>
            it not the measurers ? Yes. And when about things many <lb/>
            and few, who are the persons to decide? Is it not the num­ <lb/>
            berers ? But what, when we are disputing with each other <lb/>
            about things just and unjust, to whom do we come ? and who <lb/>
            are the persons to decide on each occasion between us ? Say. <lb/>
            Do you not, Socrates, mean the judges ? You have correctly <lb/>
            made the discovery. Come then and try to tell this likewise. <lb/>
            By doing what do the measurers decide respecting things <lb/>
            large and small ? Is it not by measuring ? Yes. And re­ <lb/>
            specting things heavy and light ? Is it not by weighing ? Yes. <lb/>
            And respecting things many and few ? Is it not by num­ <lb/>
            bering? Yes. But how, respecting things just and unjust ? <lb/>
            Answer me. I cannot say. Say, by speaking. Yes. By speak­ <lb/>
            ing then do judges decide between us, when they are forming a <lb/>
            judgment respecting things just and unjust. Yes. And by <lb/>
            measuring, those skilled in measuring things small and great ? <lb/>
            for a measure is that, by which these things are judged. It <lb/>
            is so. And by weighing, those skilled in weighing things <lb/>
            heavy and light ? for a weight is that, by which these things <lb/>
            are judged. Yes, it is. And again by numbering, those <lb/>
            skilled in numbering things many and few ? for number is <lb/>
            that by which these things are judged. It is so. But by speak­ <lb/>
            ing, as we just now agreed, the judges decide respecting things <lb/>
            just and unjust. You speak correctly, Socrates. [3.] It is <lb/>
            true then; and speech is that, it seems, by which things just <lb/>
            and unjust are judged. What then are things just and un­ <lb/>
            just ? As if a person had asked us—Since a measure, and the <lb/>
            measuring art, and the person skilled in measuring, decide <lb/>
            which is the greater and the less, what is the greater and the <lb/>
            less ? Shall we say to him that the greater exceeds, and the<lb/>

              in the scales is heavy, but the thing (going) upwards is <lb/>
              light ? In like manner if he should ask us—Since speech and <lb/>
              the art of judging and the judge is the party who decides <lb/>
              what is just and unjust, what is the just and unjust ? What <lb/>
              answer shall we have to give him ? 1Or have we not a sin­ <lb/>
              gle word to say ?x We have not. Whether willingly or un­ <lb/>
              willingly do men, think you, have this injustice ? I mean in <lb/>
              this way. Think you that they do injustice 2 [and are unjust] 2 <lb/>
              willingly or unwillingly ? Willingly, I imagine, Socrates; <lb/>
              for they are wicked. [4.] You conceive then that men are <lb/>
              willingly wicked and unjust. I do; and do not you ? No; <lb/>
              at least if we are to be persuaded by the poet.3 What kind <lb/>
              of poet ? He who said- <lb/>
              Not one is wicked willingly, nor blest <lb/>
              Unwillingly. <lb/>
              But still on the other hand,4 Socrates, well is the old proverb,, <lb/>
              that <lb/>
              Poets do many falsehoods sing. <lb/>
              But I should marvel, if this poet has told a falsehood. Come <lb/>
              then,6 if you are at leisure, let us consider, whether he is say­ <lb/>
              ing what is false or true. Nay, I am at leisure. Come then, <lb/>
              (say,) do you deem it just to tell a falsehood, or to tell the truth? <lb/>
              To tell the truth. To tell a falsehood then is unjust? Yes. <lb/>
              But whether to deceive or to not deceive ? To not deceive, as­ <lb/>
              suredly. To deceive then is unjust ? Yes. But what, is it <lb/>
              just to hurt, or to benefit? To benefit. To hurt then is un­ <lb/>
              just ? Yes. [5.] It is just then to tell the truth, and to <lb/>
              not deceive, and to benefit; but to tell a falsehood, and to hurt, <note type="footnote"> 1__1 The Greek is at present, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἢ οὐδέ πω ἔχομεν εἰπει̃ν</foreign>— But one <lb/>

              and to deceive, unjust. Yes, by Zeus, and greatly so. What, <lb/>
              to do so to enemies ? By no means. But it is just to do a <lb/>
              hurt to enemies, but to do a benefit, unjust. Yes. It is then <lb/>
              just by deceiving enemies to do them a hurt? How not? <lb/>
              Well then, to tell a falsehood in order that we may deceive <lb/>
              and do a hurt to enemies, is it not just ? It is. But what, <lb/>
              do you not say that it is just to do a benefit to friends ? I do. <lb/>
              Whether by not deceiving or by deceiving for their benefit ? <lb/>
              By deceiving even, by Zeus. But is it just to do a benefit by <lb/>
              deceiving, and yet not by telling a falsehood ? or by telling a <lb/>
              falsehood? It is just by telling even a falsehood. To tell a <lb/>
              falsehood and to tell the truth is, as it seems, both just and <lb/>
              unjust. Yes. And to not deceive and to deceive is both just <lb/>
              and unjust. So it seems. And to do a hurt and to do a be­ <lb/>
              nefit is just and unjust. Yes. All things of this kind are it <lb/>
              seems the same, both just and unjust. To me at least they <lb/>
              appear so. [6.] Hear then. I have, like other men, a right <lb/>
              eye and a left. Yes. And a right nostril and a left. Cer­ <lb/>
              tainly. And a right hand and a left. Yes. Hence, since <lb/>
              after giving the same name, you say that some of my (mem­ <lb/>
              bers) are on the right side, and others on the left, would you <lb/>
              not be able to say, if I asked you, on which side they were, <lb/>
              that some on one side are the right, and others on the other <lb/>
              side the left ? Yes. Come then, likewise, to that point,1 since <lb/>
              after giving the same name, you say that some acts are just, <lb/>
              and some unjust, can you tell which are the just, and which <lb/>
              the unjust? To me then it now appears that each of these <lb/>
              acts, taking place at a proper time,2 are just; but at not a pro­ <lb/>
              per one, unjust. And correctly does it appear to you. He <lb/>
              then, who does each of these acts at a proper time, does what <lb/>
              is just; but he, who does not at a proper time,3 (does) what <lb/>
              is unjust. Yes. He then, who does what is just, is just; <lb/>
              but he who does what is unjust, is unjust. It is so. [7.] <lb/>
              Who then at a proper time is able to cut and burn and to <lb/>

              he who knows, is able to do what is proper at a proper time ;1 <lb/>
              but he who does not know, is not. Thus it is. And he who <lb/>
              knows how to tell falsehoods, and to deceive, and to do a be­ <lb/>
              nefit, is able to do each of these things at a proper time ;2 <lb/>
              but he who does not know, is not. You say what is true. <lb/>
              And he who does these acts at a fitting time is just. Yes. He <lb/>
              does them then through knowledge.. How not ? The just man <lb/>
              then is just through knowledge. Yes. The unjust man then <lb/>
              is unjust through what is opposite to what is just. It appears <lb/>
              so. Now the just man is just through wisdom. Yes. And <lb/>
              the unjust man is unjust through the want of instruction. It <lb/>
              seems so. [8.] That, which our ancestors left us, as wisdom, <lb/>
              seems near to being justice; but that, which (they left) as <lb/>
              want of instruction, to be injustice. It is likely. Are men <lb/>
              uninstructed willingly, or unwillingly ? Unwillingly. Un­ <lb/>
              willingly then they are unjust. It appears so. But the un­ <lb/>
              just are wicked. Yes. Unwillingly then persons are wicked <lb/>
              and unjust. By all means. But they act unjustly through <lb/>
              there being the unjust. Yes. Through an act of unwillingness. <lb/>
              Certainly. But that, which is willing, does not take place <lb/>
              through what is unwilling. It does not. But the doing of <lb/>
              injustice takes place through the existence of injustice. Yes. <lb/>
              Now injustice is an involuntary act. Involuntary. Unwillingly <lb/>
              then persons do an injustice, and are unjust and wicked. Un­ <lb/>
              willingly, as it appears. The poet then did not in this case <lb/>
              tell a falsehood. It seems not. <note type="footnote"> 1, 2 I have twice omitted <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ τῳ̃ καιρῳ̃</foreign> after <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν τῳ̃ δέοντι</foreign>. See just <lb/>

          <p>Or these dialogues, the former is said by Diogenes Laert., iii. 62, <lb/>
            ' to be decidedly not written by Plato, and was one of those entitled <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽Ακέφαλοι</foreign>, and attributed to Æschines, son of Charinus, the sausage­ <lb/>
            maker ; of whom Socrates remarked, as we learn from Diog. L. ii. 60, <lb/>
            that he was the only person who knew how to honour him pro­ <lb/>
            perly. Now though no reason is there assigned for the remark, it <lb/>
            is not difficult to conceive, by comparing what we know of the con­ <lb/>
            duct of some other pupils of Socrates, such as Critias and Alcibi­ <lb/>
            ades, and even Plato, that Æschines not only put in practice the <lb/>
            precepts of his master, but gave a true representation of his senti­ <lb/>
            ments, without altering them to suit, as Plato did, his own peculiar <lb/>
            notions.</p>
          <p>With regard to the subject matter of the dialogue, it may be ex­ <lb/>
            pressed in the words of Xenophon in Cyrop. i. 6, 46, that " the <lb/>
            wisdom of man no more knows how to choose what is best, than if a <lb/>
            person were to do whatever might arise from the throw of a die;" a <lb/>
            passage quoted opportunely by Davies on Cicero de Nat. Deor. i. <lb/>
            35, " Hoc est non considerare, sed quasi sortiri, quid loquare." And <lb/>
            it was doubtless from the similarity of subject that Boeckh was led <lb/>
            to attribute the Demodocus to the author of the Sisyphus ; of which <lb/>
            the only separate edition is to be found in my " Plato's Four Dia­ <lb/>
            logues, the Crito, Hippias, Alcibiades, and Sisyphus," published by <lb/>
            Valpy in 1831; while the Demodocus is one of the small portions of <lb/>
            the Platonic and Pseudo-Platonic writings, that have never appeared <lb/>

            versation merely, consider the matter in this way, if the case <lb/>
            seems to be such as has been just now stated. Do you not <lb/>

            the diameter is not unknown, whether it be a diameter or not, <lb/>

          <p>Sis. Certainly.</p>

          <p>Sis. Entirely.</p>
          <p>Soc. Must we not consider then at present, what impediment <lb/>
            is in the way of those, who are seeking, to the discovery of the <lb/>
            things, about which they are making the search ?</p>
          <p>Sis. So it seems at least to me.</p>
          <p>Soc. Could we say that any thing else was an impediment <lb/>
            to them except a want of knowledge ?</p>
          <p>(Sis. Nothing else).2</p>
          <p>Soc. Let us, by Zeus, consider the matter very much, let­ <lb/>

            thing according to the musician's art ?</p>
          <p>Sis. Not I indeed.</p>
          <p>Soc. What then, as regards generalship, or piloting ? Do <lb/>

            who however did not perceive some errors in the Greek, which I corrected <lb/>
            in Revue de Philologie, vol. ii. p. 225, and I will therefore present the <lb/>
            reader with an English version of it. <lb/>
            " To the gods Apollo, his long arrows holding, <lb/>
            Spoke thus-Who knows the arrow to let By, <lb/>
            Than the far-darting farther ? On the strife <lb/>

            In Ares' helmet Hermes shook the lots, <lb/>
            Which Phœbus first obtaining, with his hands <lb/>
            The bent bow pushing from him, and the string <lb/>
            Letting go sharply, first his arrow fix'd <lb/>
            Within the distant gardens of the West. <lb/>
            When with his stride did Zeus the distance clear, <lb/>
            And cried-Where shall I shoot ? no space have I. <lb/>
            And no bow drawing, bow-man's glory gained." <lb/>
            To the same fable an allusion is made by Lucretius in i. 968, "si quis <lb/>
            procurrat ad oras Ultimus extremas jaciatque volatile telum," quoted by <lb/>
            Davies on Cicero de N. D. i. 20, " animus—ita late longeque peregrinatur, <lb/>

          </head>
          <p>[1.] You are, Demodocus, requesting1 me to advise you <lb/>
            on the matters, about which you are come together to de­ <lb/>
            liberate. But it has come into my mind to consider, what <lb/>
            avails this meeting of yours, and the eagerness of those, who <lb/>
            think to advise with you, and the vote, which each of you thinks <lb/>
            of giving. For, in the first place, unless it be possible to advise <lb/>
            correctly and skilfully on the points, respecting which ye are <lb/>
            come to deliberate, how is it not ridiculous for you to come <lb/>
            together to deliberate on points, respecting which it is not pos­ <lb/>
            sible to advise correctly ? And in the second place, if it be <lb/>
            possible to advise correctly and skilfully upon matters of this <lb/>
            kind, still the knowledge, by which it is possible to advise <lb/>
            correctly on them, is none. How then is it not out of place ? <lb/>
            But if there be any knowledge, by which it is possible to ad­ <lb/>
            vise correctly on such matters, is it not necessary that there <lb/>
            should be certain persons skilled to advise correctly on mat­ <lb/>
            ters of this kind ? And if there are certain persons, skilled <lb/>
            to advise on those points, about which you are come together <lb/>
            to deliberate, is it not necessary for you likewise to know how <lb/>
            to advise on these matters, or not to know ? Or that some <lb/>
            persons should know, and some not ? If then all of you know, <lb/>
            what need is there for you to come together to deliberate ? for <lb/>
            each of you is competent to advise. But if, on the other hand, <lb/>
            all of you do not know, how will you be able to deliberate ? <lb/>
            Or what advantage would there be to you in this meeting to­ <lb/>
            gether, if you are not able to deliberate ? But if some of you <lb/>
            know, and others do not know, but these are in want of coun­ <lb/>
            sel, whether it is possible for an intellectual person to advise <note type="footnote"> 1 On this meaning of <foreign xml:lang="grc">κελεύειν</foreign> see Alcibiad. II. § n. 70. </note> <pb n="110"/>
            <note type="margin"> [c. 2, 3. </note> <lb/>
            the unskilled, even a single person is sufficient to advise with <lb/>
            those of you, who do know. Or do not all, who know, advise <lb/>
            the same thing ? so that it is fitting, after you have heard that <lb/>
            person, to separate. But now you do not this ; but you wish <lb/>
            to hear many giving their advice; for you do not take upon <lb/>
            yourselves to know those, who are attempting to advise with <lb/>
            you on points, on which they are advising. For if you had <lb/>
            taken upon yourselves to know those, who were advising with <lb/>
            you, it would have been sufficient for you to have heard one <lb/>
            person alone. To come together then with the view of hear­ <lb/>
            ing those, who do not know, as if you were doing something <lb/>
            of importance, how is it not a thing out of place ? Respect­ <lb/>
            ing then this meeting of yours, I am in this way at a loss.</p>
          <p>[2.] And that too is a thing of difficulty relating to the <lb/>
            eagerness of those, who think they can advise with you. For <lb/>
            if, while advising, they do not give the same advice upon the <lb/>
            same points, how can they all advise correctly, when they do <lb/>
            not advise what he, who advises correctly, would advise?1 <lb/>
            Or how can the eagerness of those, who are eager to advise <lb/>
            on points, in which they are unskilled, not be out of place ? <lb/>
            for being skilled, they would not choose to advise incorrectly. <lb/>
            But if, on the other hand, they advise the same, what need is <lb/>
            there for them all to advise ? for a single one of them would, <lb/>
            if advising the same, be sufficient. To be eager then on such <lb/>
            matters, as would be of no importance, how is it not ridi­ <lb/>
            culous ? Neither then would the eagerness of the unskilled <lb/>
            be not out of place, when it is of such a kind; nor would men <lb/>
            of sense feel an eagerness on such matters, knowing that even <lb/>
            one of them would do the same thing by advising what was fit­ <lb/>
            ting ; so that I am unable to discover how the eagerness of <lb/>
            those, who fancy they are advising, is not ridiculous.</p>
          <p>[3.] But as regards the vote which you are thinking to <lb/>
            give, I am the most at a loss, what it can avail. For whether <lb/>
            are you giving a judgment upon those, who know how to ad­ <lb/>
            vise? 2But more persons will not advise at all any better <note type="footnote"> 1 I have translated, as if the Greek were ä av <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξυμβουλεύοι</foreign>— not <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἃ <lb/>

              than one, nor some one way and others another correctly upon <lb/>
              the same matter ;2 so that respecting them there will be no need <lb/>
              for you to give a vote. But are you giving a judgment 1upon <lb/>
              some, who are unskilled and who ought not to advise any <lb/>
              persons ?1 Surely it is not fitting to intrust to such persons, <lb/>
              as if they were madmen, to advise. But if you are to give a <lb/>
              judgment upon neither the skilled nor the unskilled, upon <lb/>
              whom are you to give it ? But what need is there for other <lb/>
              persons to advise with you at all, if you are competent to <lb/>
              give a judgment upon such matters? But if on the other <lb/>
              hand you are not competent, of what avail are your votes ? <lb/>
              Or how is it not ridiculous for you to come together, as if <lb/>
              about to consult, when you yourselves are in want of ad­ <lb/>
              vice, and are incompetent, and yet fancy that you ought <lb/>
              to come together and give a vote, as if competent to form <lb/>
              a judgment? For neither by being taken singly are you <lb/>
              ignorant, and become sensible by being taken together; nor, <lb/>
              on the other hand, are you at a loss individually, but by <lb/>
              coming together are no longer at a loss. But do you be­ <lb/>
              come competent to see together what things are to be done <lb/>
              by you ? and this too, when you have neither learnt them from <lb/>
              any one, nor discovered them yourselves ; which is the most <lb/>
              shocking thing of all. For being unable to see together, what <lb/>
              is to be done, you will not be competent to give a j udgment upon <lb/>
              the party, who is advising you correctly upon these matters ; <lb/>
              2 nor, if a person, standing alone, as an adviser, should say <lb/>
              this, that he himself will teach you what is to be done, is it <lb/>
              in your power to form a correct judgment2 upon those, who <lb/>
              are advising you correctly or not. Now this would be a state <lb/>
              not less shocking than that. If then neither the meeting nor <lb/>
              the (single) 3 adviser is able to make you competent to give a <note type="footnote"/><note type="footnote">1—1 In lieu of <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ ὡς μὴ</foreign> a,-! <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξυμβουλεύοντας κρίνετε</foreign>, the sense seems <lb/>

              j udgment, what need is there to you for voting ? Or how is this <lb/>
              meeting of yours not opposed to your votes, and the vote to <lb/>
              the eagerness of those advising you ? For this meeting of <lb/>
              yours is that of persons not competent, but in need of advisers ; <lb/>
              while the votes are given as of persons not wanting advisers, <lb/>
              but able to form a judgment, and to advise ; and the eager­ <lb/>
              ness of those advising you, is as of persons who know; but <lb/>
              the votes are given by you, as if the persons advising did not <lb/>
              know. Now if any one were to ask you, who have voted, and <lb/>
              the person advising you, respecting the matters on which you <lb/>
              have voted-do you know what will that be, for the sake of <lb/>
              which you think of doing what you have voted ? you would <lb/>
              not, I think, be able to say. And even if that should take <lb/>
              place, for the sake of which you have it in your thoughts to <lb/>
              do every thing,1 do you know how it will benefit you ? I think <lb/>
              that neither you nor the party advising you would be able to <lb/>
              tell this. But you conceive that some of those with intellect2 <lb/>
              3 know .somehow this. But if a person should ask you who is <lb/>
              the party,3 I do not think you would agree on this point. <lb/>
              When therefore both the things, about which you are consult­ <lb/>
              ing,4 are such as not to be manifest, and the persons likewise, <lb/>
              who vote and advise, are unskilled, reasonably will you say that <lb/>
              it often falls out that persons have no faith in, and repent of, <lb/>
              those things, for which they have taken counsel and voted. <lb/>
              Now such events it is not becoming to fall out to the sensible. <lb/>
              For they know the things, about which they give advice, both <lb/>
              of what kind they are. and that they exist firmly to the parties <lb/>
              persuaded, for the sake of whom they give the advice, and <lb/>
              that neither to themselves nor to the parties persuaded will <lb/>

          <p>[4.] I was once present with a person while he was <lb/>
            admonishing his friend, because the latter had trusted to <lb/>
            an accuser, not having heard the other party making an <lb/>
            apology for himself, but hearing only the accuser. He said <lb/>
            that (the friend) had done a terrible thing, in deciding against <lb/>
            the party without having been present himself, or having <lb/>
            heard from the friends of the party, to whose statements it <lb/>
            was reasonable for him to trust. For,1 after having heard <lb/>
            both, he would not have so hastily trusted to the accuser ; but <lb/>
            that it was just, before conferring praise or blame, to hear <lb/>
            the party make his defence, as well as the accuser. For how <lb/>
            could any one decide correctly a suit, or judge in a proper <lb/>
            manner between persons, without hearing the opposite parties ? <lb/>
            for that it is better that assertions, like a purple colour and <lb/>
            gold-money, should be judged of by being placed side by side. <lb/>
            Or for what purpose has time been allowed to both the op­ <lb/>
            posite parties in a suit ? or the judges sworn to hear both sides <lb/>
            equally ? unless the lawgiver conceived that suits would be <lb/>
            decided more justly and better by the judges. But you seem <lb/>
            to me to have not even heard of what is said by the multitude. <lb/>
            What is it ? said (the other). <lb/>
            2 Decide no suit, till both accounts you've heard.2 <lb/>
            And yet this would not have been thus circulated, if it had not <lb/>
            been well said, and as is fitting. I advise you therefore, said he, <lb/>
            for the future not to blame or praise persons so hastily. The <lb/>
            other then said that it appeared to him an absurd thing, if it <lb/>
            were impossible to know, when one person was speaking, whe­ <lb/>
            ther he was telling the truth or a falsehood, and yet possible <lb/>
            to know, when two persons were speaking ; and impossible to <note type="footnote"> 1 I have translated as if the Greek were <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ γὰϱ ὰν</foreign>— not <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὖ</foreign>— </note><note type="footnote"> 2—2 On this proverbial verse see my note on Æsch.

            taught by that very person and another, when telling a false­ <lb/>
            hood; and if one by speaking straightforwardly and truly <lb/>
            should be unable to show what he is saying clearly, but that <lb/>
            two, one of whom should tell a falsehood, and not speak <lb/>
            straightforwardly, should be able to show clearly that, which <lb/>
            the party speaking straightforwardly was not able to show <lb/>
            clearly. And I am at a loss, said he, on this point likewise, <lb/>
            how they are to show it clearly; whether by being silent, or <lb/>
            speaking. For if they are to show it clearly by being silent, <lb/>
            there would be a need of hearing neither, much less both. <lb/>
            But if by speaking both are to show it clearly, and both <lb/>
            parties speak according to no regular manner and time1—for <lb/>
            both think they have a right to speak in turn-how is it pos­ <lb/>
            sible for both to show the matter clearly ? For if both are <lb/>
            showing the matter clearly at the same time, both will be <lb/>
            speaking together at the same time. 2 But this they are not <lb/>
            wont to do, nor do the laws permit it;2 so that if they are to <lb/>
            show the matter clearly by speaking, each of them will do so <lb/>
            by speaking; and when either party speaks, then either party <lb/>
            will show the matter clearly; so that they will speak one be­ <lb/>
            fore and the other after; and they will show the matter clearly, <lb/>
            one before and the other after. Now if each party in turn <lb/>
            shows the same matter clearly, what need is there to hear the <lb/>
            latter ? for the matter will have become clear by the party <lb/>
            first speaking. But if both parties show clearly 3 that mat­ <lb/>
            ter, said he,3 how will not either of them have done so ? for <lb/>
            how would both be able to show clearly that, which one of <note type="footnote"> 1 In lieu of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τϱόπον</foreign> one MS. affords as a var. lect. <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρόνον</foreign>— and hence <lb/>

            it clearly, it is evident that the former will have spoken of <lb/>
            it, and the former will have shown it clearly; so that how is <lb/>
            it not possible for the person hearing him alone to know all <lb/>
            correctly ? 1 On hearing them I was at a loss, and unable to <lb/>

            reasoning was true. If then you can advise me on this <lb/>
            matter, whether it is possible, 3when one person is saying <lb/>
            any thing, to know correctly what he is saying, say so;3 or <lb/>
            whether there is need of a speaker on the opposite side, if a <lb/>
            person would know which is speaking straightforwardly. Or <lb/>
            whether it is not necessary to hear both parties ? Or how do <lb/>
            you think ?</p>
          <p>[5.] The day before yesterday a person was finding fault <lb/>
            with another, because he was unwilling to lend money or to <lb/>
            trust him; and the party, with whom he was finding fault, <lb/>
            was defending himself; whereupon another person amongst <lb/>
            those, who were present, inquired of the party finding fault- <lb/>
            whether he, who had not trusted nor lent the money, had <lb/>
            erred ? and have not you too, said he, who did not persuade <lb/>
            him to lend, erred ? In what, said the other party, have I <lb/>
            erred ? Which of the two, said (the inquirer), seems to you <lb/>
            to err ? the person, who fails in what he wishes, or he, who <lb/>
            does not (fail) ? The person who fails, said he. Have you <lb/>
            then not failed in wishing to borrow; while he, who did not <lb/>
            wish to give up (his money), has not failed in that point. <lb/>
            Truly so, said he; but in what have I erred, even if he has <lb/>
            not given it me ? Because, said (the inquirer), if you have <lb/>
            begged the things which you ought not, how do you think <lb/>
            that you have not erred ? while he has acted correctly in not <lb/>
            giving them up; but if, on the other hand, you have begged <note type="footnote">1 I have translated as if <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάντ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὖ</foreign> had dropt out between <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκούσαντα</foreign> <lb/>

            what you ought, and failed in this point, how have you not of <lb/>
            necessity erred ? Perhaps so, said he; but how has he not <lb/>
            erred, who did not trust me ? If you had treated with him, <lb/>
            said (the inquirer), as was fitting, you would not have erred at <lb/>
            all. Not at all. But now you have not treated with him, as <lb/>
            was fitting. I appear so, said he. If then he was not per­ <lb/>
            suaded, when you were treating with him, as was not fitting, <lb/>
            how can you justly find fault with him ? I am unable to say. <lb/>
            Nor can you say that one must not pay attention to those, who <lb/>
            conduct themselves ill ? This (I can say) very much, said <lb/>
            he. Do not then those persons seem to you to conduct them­ <lb/>
            selves ill, who treat with a party in a manner that is not fit­ <lb/>
            ting ? To me at least (they seem so), said he. In what then <lb/>
            did he err, if he paid no attention to you, when conducting <lb/>
            yourself ill ? It appears, said he, in nothing. Why then, said <lb/>
            (the inquirer), do persons find fault on such matters with each <lb/>
            other, and blame those, who are not persuaded by them, be­ <lb/>
            cause they are not persuaded, but do not find fault with them­ <lb/>
            selves at all, because they have not persuaded them ? Here­ <lb/>
            upon another party who was present, observed — When a <lb/>
            person has conducted himself well towards any one, and has <lb/>
            assisted him, and subsequently requests that party to conduct <lb/>
            himself in a similar manner towards him, but does not meet <lb/>
            with such conduct, how does he not reasonably find fault ? Is <lb/>
            not, said (the inquirer), the person whom the party requests <lb/>
            to conduct himself in a similar manner, either able to conduct <lb/>
            himself well, or unable ? (Yes.)1 And if he is unable, how <lb/>
            can he properly make the request, who requests him (to per­ <lb/>
            form) 2 what he cannot ? but if he is able, how did he not <lb/>
            persuade him (to do so) ? or how do persons, who speak in <lb/>
            this way, speak correctly ? But, said (the other), it is requisite, <lb/>
            by Zeus, to find fault with such a person,3 in order that both <lb/>
            he may for the remainder of his life conduct himself better, <lb/>
            and the other mean fellows,4 who hear the party finding fault. <lb/>
            Think you, said (the inquirer), that any persons will conduct <note type="footnote"> I I have introduced the answer "Yes," which could hardly be dis­ <lb/>

            themselves better when they hear a party speaking correctly,1 <lb/>
            or when in error ? When speaking correctly, said he. 2Now <lb/>
            the party, who was speaking not correctly, did not seem to you <lb/>
            to make a request correctly?2 Truly so, said he. How then <lb/>
            will those, who hear a person finding fault in this way, conduct <lb/>
            themselves better. Not at all, said he. For what purpose, <lb/>
            then, 3 would a person find fault 3 in this way? He confessed <lb/>
            he could not discover</p>
          <p>[6.] Some one was accusing a person of stupidity, because <lb/>
            he had given credence quickly even to parties he happened to <lb/>
            meet with,4 while they were speaking. To fellow-citizens and <lb/>
            familiar friends, when speaking, it is reasonable to trust. But <lb/>
            to persons of that kind, whom he had never seen nor heard <lb/>
            of before, to give credence, and this too when he was not <lb/>
            ignorant that the majority of men are braggarts and knaves, <lb/>
            was no little proof of silliness. When one of those present <lb/>
            observed-For my part I thought that you considered a per­ <lb/>
            son of greater value, who could quickly understand even any <lb/>
            one he met with, rather than him, who did so slowly. And so <lb/>
            I do consider, said the other. Why then, said (the former), do <lb/>
            you find fault, if a person gives credence quickly, even to <lb/>
            those he meets with, when they speak the truth ? But, said <lb/>
            (the other), I do not find fault with this, but because he gives <lb/>
            credence to those, who tell falsehoods. But, if after a longer <lb/>
            period even to those not accidentally met with he had given <lb/>
            credence, and suffered annoyance,5 would you not have found <lb/>
            fault with him still more ? Yes; I should have done so, said he. <lb/>

            with a person on this account, but because he gives credence <lb/>
            to those, who state what is not credible. I do so, said he. <lb/>
            Whether then, said (the other), do you think it is not right to <lb/>
            find fault with him for giving credence slowly even to those <lb/>
            not accidentally met with, but right (to do so) for giving cre­ <lb/>
            dence quickly even to those accidentally met with ? Not I in­ <lb/>
            deed, said he. Why then do you find fault with him ? said <lb/>
            (the other). Because he errs in giving credence to persons <lb/>
            accidentally met with, previous to making an inquiry. But <lb/>
            if he had slowly given credence, previous to making an in­ <lb/>
            quiry, he would not have erred. Not so, by Zeus, said he; <lb/>
            but he would have erred even thus not the less; but I think one <lb/>
            ought not to give credence to persons accidentally met with. <lb/>
            But if, said (the other), you think one ought not to give credence <lb/>
            to persons accidentally met with, how is it fitting to give cre­ <lb/>
            dence quickly to persons unknown ? and do you think that it <lb/>
            is requisite to make an inquiry, whether they are speaking the <lb/>
            truth ? I think so,1 said he. Say then, said (the other), is it <lb/>
            not requisite to make inquiry about familiar friends and ac­ <lb/>
            quaintances, whether they are speaking the truth ? I should <lb/>
            say so, said he. For perhaps, said (the other), some of these <lb/>
            state what is not credible. And very much so, said he. Why <lb/>
            then, said (the other), is it more reasonable to give cre­ <lb/>
            dence to familiar friends and acquaintances than to persons <lb/>
            accidentally met with? I cannot tell, said he. What then, <lb/>

            how will it not be necessary to consider the same persons <lb/>

            <title type="main">INTRODUCTION TO THE DEFINITIONS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>OF these Definitions, which are appended to all the complete <lb/>
            editions of Plato, and found likewise in eleven MSS. collated <lb/>
            by Bekker, the authorship is attributed in the Vienna MS. to <lb/>
            Speusippus. (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Φ</foreign>.) But since the writing relied upon, as the authority <lb/>
            for this statement, is more modern than the rest of the Manuscript, <lb/>
            the remark is probably due to Sambucus, once the possessor of it; <lb/>
            who, says Menage, on Diogen. L. iv. 5, asserted that the ‟<foreign xml:lang="grc">Οϱοι</foreign>, men­ <lb/>
            tioned in the Life of Speusippus, had been falsely attributed to <lb/>
            Plato; and he might have added, that although the Definitions are <lb/>
            attributed to Plato by Casaubon, they are distinctly assigned to <lb/>
            Speusippus by Ficinus; whose version of them is to be found towards <lb/>
            the end of a volume in folio, containing his translation of " lambli­ <lb/>
            chus de Mysteriis," and other Greek treatises of a similar character, <lb/>
            printed by Aldus in 1497. Stobæus, however, found the Definitions <lb/>
            at the end of his MS. of Plato; to whom he says they were at­ <lb/>
            tributed, in iii. p. 49, 35. But instead of Speusippus being the <lb/>
            author of these Definitions, internal evidence would rather lead to <lb/>
            the supposition of their being the production of some more recent <lb/>
            philosopher of Alexandria. For we find <foreign xml:lang="grc">δόμα</foreign> twice used in the <lb/>
            sense of a “gift," a word first met with in Holy Writ, and sub­ <lb/>
            sequently in Plutarch, as remarked by H. Stephens ; and while its <lb/>
            compound <foreign xml:lang="grc">πϱόδομα</foreign> is found in Hesych. ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αῤῥαβὼν</foreign>, as duly noticed by <lb/>
            Lobeck on Phrynichus, p. 249, the simple <foreign xml:lang="grc">δόμα</foreign> is reckoned amongst <lb/>
            irregular formations by Herodian, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πεϱὶ Μονηϱου̃ς Λέξεως</foreign>, p. 30, 5, <lb/>
            where Lehr refers to Lobeck's <foreign xml:lang="grc">Παϱαλειπόμενα</foreign>, p. 424.</p>
          <p>But granting even that from this fact no inference could be fairly <lb/>
            drawn against the supposed authorship and antiquity of the Defini­ <lb/>
            tions, yet the matter of them is such as to disprove their being <lb/>
             <pb n="122"/>
            written by a disciple of Plato, and suggests rather that they are the <lb/>
            production of some philosopher, who concocted them from a faith­ <lb/>
            less representation of the doctrines promulgated in the Socratic, <lb/>
            Stoic, Academic, and Peripatetic schools; and this too with so little <lb/>
            judgment, as frequently to give an unintelligible definition, when <lb/>
            he might have found an intelligible one elsewhere, as I have shown <lb/>
            on various occasions in the notes. Socrates, it is true, as remarked <lb/>
            by Menage on Diogenes L. vii. 60, is said by Aristotle in Metaphys. <lb/>
            i. 6, and xiii. 4, and Theopompus the rhetorician, quoted by Arrian <lb/>
            on Epictetus ii. 17, to have paid considerable attention to Defini­ <lb/>
            tions ; and this may be inferred from some instances furnished by <lb/>
            Xenophon in Memorab. iv. 6. But it is to Zeno and his followers <lb/>
            that we must refer the practice of laying down Definitions, as the <lb/>
            basis of subsequent discussions. For they were accustomed to ap­ <lb/>
            ply to moral philosophy the principle they had learnt from the <lb/>
            Pythagoreans, as the groundwork of physical philosophy, developed <lb/>
            by mathematics, as may be inferred from the Life of Pythagoras by <lb/>
            Diogenes; who appeals to Phavorinus to prove that " Pythagoras <lb/>
            made use of definitions through his ‘Mathematical Wood;’ and still <lb/>
            more so did Socrates and his followers; and so did Aristotle and the <lb/>
            Stoics." Menage too, on Diogen. L. vii. 60, remarks that a mass of <lb/>
            such definitions are to be found in the Life of Zeno alone.</p>
          <p>To the preceding proofs that the author of the Definitions was <lb/>
            some philosopher of Alexandria, may be added those which Cousin <lb/>
            has adduced. He remarks that ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αξίωσις</foreign>, in the sense of " dignity " <lb/>
            or " majesty," does not belong to the period of Plato, nor even to <lb/>
            any age of good Greek ; and neither does <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λογισμὸς σεμνότατος</foreign>. So <lb/>
            too ’A <foreign xml:lang="grc">γάπησις</foreign> is not a word of Plato or his time; while on the un­ <lb/>
            intelligible definition of the word ”<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ονομα</foreign>, " a noun," he observes <lb/>
            that “the language used there is altogether of the Alexandrine <lb/>
            school, and is better suited to a treatise by Dionysius the Areopagite <lb/>
            than to one attributed to Plato."</p>

            <title type="main">INTRODUCTION TO THE TREATISE OF TIMÆUS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>OF this short treatise, relating to a Cosmogony according to <lb/>
            the Pythagorean theory, the authorship used to be attributed to <lb/>
            Timæus the Locrian, until Meiners adduced arguments to show <lb/>
            that the work was the production of a more modern writer. The <lb/>
            genuine writings of the Locrian philosopher had so completely dis­ <lb/>
            appeared before the time of Aristotle, that he seems to have known <lb/>
            nothing about them, as may be inferred from what he says in <lb/>
            Metaphysic. i. 6, p. 649, B.</p>
          <p>In confirmation of this decision, which has been adopted by <lb/>
            nearly all subsequent writers on the subject, De Gelder has been <lb/>
            led to express his belief that the work was written by some phi­ <lb/>
            losopher, who lived in the second century of the Christian era, and <lb/>
            amused himself with drawing up an abridgment of the Timæus of <lb/>
            Plato, adopting what he conceived to be the Doric dialect, with the <lb/>
            view of enabling him to palm it off as a genuine production of the <lb/>
            Locrian philosopher. But though we know that similar deceptions <lb/>
            have been practised at different times, yet even De Gelder himself <lb/>
            confesses his inability to discover the motives that could lead the <lb/>
            unknown author to commit the forgery. Hence we may fairly <lb/>
            imagine that it was done at an earlier period, when the Ptolemies <lb/>
            were collecting the works of older writers to adorn their library at <lb/>
            Alexandria. And this deception the writer was enabled to carry <lb/>
            on with the greater success, as he has been careful to introduce, <lb/>
            doubtless from the work of a Pythagorean, some marked discrepan­ <lb/>
            cies, duly noticed by De Gelder in Præf. p. xi., from the Timæus <lb/>
            of Plato, of whose treatise his own is in other respects little more <lb/>
            than an abridgment.</p>
          <p>At the present day the treatise is held in so little honour, that <note type="footnote"> VOL. VI. </note> <note type="footnote"> L </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="146"/>
            De Gelder offered an apology for publishing it at Leyden in 1836. <lb/>
            But the time has been, when it was highly esteemed as the genuine <lb/>
            production of that very philosopher, whose ideas Plato was thought <lb/>
            to have developed in his Timæus; and it was accordingly trans­ <lb/>
            lated into Latin by Georgius Valla, Simon Passiensis, called like­ <lb/>
            wise Bevilaqua, and Nogarola, whose versions were printed re­ <lb/>
            spectively at Venice in 1488, 1498, and 1555, and subsequently by <lb/>
            Cornarius, fol. Bas. 1561. Of versions of it in modern languages, <lb/>
            a French one appeared at Berlin, 1763, by the Marquis d' Argens, <lb/>
            and another at Paris in 1768, by the Abbé Batteux, the former <lb/>
            accompanied with an elaborate Preface and Commentary, and the <lb/>
            latter with some sensible notes and a few various readings from <lb/>
            three Paris MSS. There is likewise a German translation by <lb/>
            Schulthes, first published at Zurich in 1779, and again in 1842. <lb/>
            It is said by Fabricius to have been translated into English by <lb/>
            T. Stanley, in his " History of Philosophy;" but such is not the <lb/>
            fact; and equally incorrect is the Bipont editor of Plato, by whom <lb/>
            De Gelder has been misled, in attributing a Latin translation of <lb/>
            the treatise to Ficinus.</p>

          <p>[1.] TIMÆUS the Locrian asserted this-that of all the <lb/>
            things in the Universe there are two causes, (one) I Mind, (the <lb/>
            cause) of things existing according to reason; (the other) <lb/>
            Necessity,1 (the cause) of things (existing) by (some) force, <lb/>
            according to the powers of bodies; and that the former of <lb/>
            these is of the nature of the good, and is called god, and the <lb/>
            principle of things that are the best; but what come after <lb/>
            this and are co-causes, are referred to Necessity; but that, as <lb/>
            regards the things in the Universe, there are Form, Matter, <lb/>
            and the Perceptible, which is, as it were, a production from <lb/>
            the two (others); and that the former (namely, Form)2 is un­ <lb/>
            produced, and unmoved, and stationary,3 and of the nature <lb/>
            of the same, and perceptible by the mind, and a pattern of <lb/>
            such things produced, as exist by a state of change; for that <lb/>
            some such thing as this is Form spoken of and conceived to <note type="footnote"> 1—1 What the author here, and Plato in Tim. p. 48, A., and 68, E., <lb/>

            recognisable by three marks; Form by mind, according to <lb/>
            knowledge; Matter by a spurious kind of reasoning, through <lb/>
            its not being perceived mentally by a direct course, but by <lb/>
            analogy; and their productions by sensation and opinion.</p>
          <p>[2.] Before, then, heaven existed, there were, through rea­ <lb/>
            son, Form and Matter, and the god, who is the worker-out4 <lb/>
            of the better. But since what is older5 is superior to what <lb/>
            is younger, and what is put in order before what is without <lb/>
            order, the deity, being good, did, on seeing that Matter receives <lb/>
            Form, and is altered in every way, but without order, 6feel the <lb/>
            necessity 6 of bringing it into order, and to establish a change <lb/>
            from the undefined to the defined, in order that the differences <lb/>
            between bodies might have a similar relation, and not receive <lb/>
            various turns at hap-hazard. He made, therefore, this world <lb/>
            out of the whole of Matter, laying it down as a limit to the <lb/>
            nature of being, through its containing all the rest of things <lb/>

            not to have an equality of force. (The world too) is in a <lb/>

            same kind as itself ;4 as regards the latter, in exhibiting for <lb/>
            ever the change dependent on a circle. Now the sphere alone <lb/>
            is able in a state of quietness and of motion to preserve a fit­ <lb/>

            another place, through its being on every side equally distant <lb/>

            perhaps be guessed at, from knowing, what is stated by Plutarch, De Anim. <lb/>
            Procreat. p. 1020, C., that Plato's first term was 192, the half of 384, <lb/>
            which last was adopted by Eudorus, a disciple of Crantor; and hence <lb/>
            too we can obtain perhaps a clue, if not to the author of this treatise, at <lb/>
            least to the time, when it was probably compiled. With regard to Plato's <lb/>
            first term of 192, Plutarch must have learnt the fact from some other <lb/>
            source than the Timæus itself, where there is not the most distant allusion <lb/>
            to it; unless it be said that in his copy of that treatise there was found <lb/>
            the identical number 192, in Greek letters p <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ϛ β</foreign>, written after <foreign xml:lang="grc">μίαν ἀφει̃λε <lb/>
            τὸ πρω̃τον ἀπὸ παντὸς μοι̃ραν</foreign> in p. 35, B. Be this, however, as it may <lb/>
            -for Macrobius, in Somn. Scipion. ii. 2, has translated the passage as it <lb/>

            Stalbaum, after Boeckh, makes the first term of the series 384, with­ <lb/>
            out alluding even to Plutarch—we may perhaps arrive at the reason for <lb/>
            the selection of this term, by bearing in mind that 192 is the product of </note> <pb n="152"/>
            <note type="margin"> [c. 3. </note> <lb/>
            first being assumed, it is easy to reckon the double and triple; <lb/>
            and all the terms, together with their complements and eighths, <note type="footnote"> 16 into 12; where 12 would represent the twelve signs of the Zodiac, or <lb/>
            the twelve months of the year, made up of 4 quarters, each consisting of <lb/>
            3 months ; while 16 would represent the square of 4; which last number <lb/>
            was, as I learn from the erudite treatise of Meursius, " De Denario <lb/>
            Pythagorico," who, collecting, as usual, all that can be found in ancient <lb/>
            authors on this subject, refers to Hierocles on " The Golden Verses," <lb/>
            connected with the four elements of matter, and the four seasons of the <lb/>
            year; and probably, I may add, with the four first digits, whose sum <lb/>
            made up the Pythagorean Tetractys, or Tetras, according to Procopius <lb/>
            Gazæus in Genesin—“ Unitas, binarius, ternarius, et quatcrnarius, inter <lb/>
            se additi, denarium constituunt." Nicomachus, however, in Harmonic., <lb/>
            says that four represented harmony; and so too does J oannes Protospath. <lb/>
            on Hesiod, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ τετρὰς λέγεται</foreign> ‘<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αρμονία· ἐ̃χει γὰρ τὸν ἐπίτριτον</foreign> : where, <lb/>
            from the mention of the musical term <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸν ἐπίτριτον</foreign>, there is an evi­ <lb/>
            dent allusion to the story about the hammers, which will be discussed <lb/>
            more at length in the Supplementary Note, or because it is the common <lb/>
            difference between the odd numbers, 3, 7, 11, 15, taken in an arithmetical <lb/>
            progression, whose sum makes 36, one of the 360 degrees into which <lb/>
            the supposed orbit of the sun was divided, when the months were 10, <lb/>
            not, as subsequently, 12. But why the square of 4 was taken instead of <lb/>
            4 itself, may perhaps be explained by supposing that, as the square would <lb/>
            be the emblem of the surface of matter at rest, and the circle that of the <lb/>
            surface of matter in motion, without which musical sounds cannot exist, <lb/>
            the square may be considered as surrounding the circle of musical sounds, <lb/>
            and the difference between the semidiagonal of the circumscribing square <lb/>
            and the semidiameter of the circumscribed circle, may be taken as the <lb/>
            first term of an harmonical scale. For other explanations of the reason, <lb/>
            which led to the selection of 384, as the first term of the harmonical <lb/>
            series, the reader is referred to Boeckh's " Philolaus," and to Schneider's <lb/>
            " Dissertatio de Numero Platonico," quoted by Lindau on Tim. p. 45, <lb/>
            who conceives with Plutarch that 384 was selected, as being the lowest <lb/>
            number on which it was possible to operate for the eighths continually <lb/>
            without the introduction of fractions; while, to understand the whole <lb/>
            passage thoroughly, De Gelder says we must adopt, as already remarked <lb/>
            by Batteux, <foreign xml:lang="grc">λήμμασι</foreign>, found in a Par. MS., in lieu of <foreign xml:lang="grc">συμπληρώμασ</foreign> ; and <lb/>
            that we must add likewise <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ ται̃ςἀποτομαι̃ς</foreign> after <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ</foreign> rote <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπογδόοις</foreign> : for <lb/>
            otherwise there would be two terms, namely, 2187 and 6561, wanting to <lb/>
            complete the series of 36 terms. The proper word, however, was <foreign xml:lang="grc">λει̃μμα</foreign>, <lb/>
            by which was meant the lesser of two unequal sections, into which a <lb/>
            number was divided ; as in the case of 7 ; which, divided into two un­ <lb/>
            equal sections, gives 3 and 4, of which 3 would be called <foreign xml:lang="grc">λει̃μμα</foreign>. So too, <lb/>
            if between any two notes, taken as extremes, two semitones are intro­ <lb/>
            duced, not having the same ratio to their contiguous notes, but repre­ <lb/>
            sented, for example, respectively by ⅓and ⅕ the semitone represented by <lb/>
            the greater number (⅓) was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποτομὴ</foreign>, that by the less (⅕)<foreign xml:lang="grc">δίεσις</foreign>. <lb/>

            the reason of (each) shape ; and the result from these (two) are <lb/>
            Earth and Water, and Air and Fire; the creation of which <lb/>
            is of this kind. 2 (Now) every body is composed of surfaces ;2 <lb/>
            and this is (composed) of triangles; of which one is rectan­ <lb/>
            gular, the half of a square, with two equal sides; the other, <lb/>
            whose sides are all unequal, 3having the greater angle thrice <lb/>
            the size of the lesser; while the least angle in it is the third <lb/>
            of a right angle, and the middle one is the double of the <lb/>
            least; for it is two parts out of three; but the greatest is a <lb/>
            right angle, being one and a half greater than the middle one <lb/>
            and the triple of the least.3 Now this triangle (with all its <lb/>
            sides unequal) is the half of an equilateral triangle, cut into <lb/>
            two equal parts by a line let down from the apex to the base. <lb/>
            Now in each of these triangles there is a right angle; but in <lb/>
            one the two sides about the right angle are equal; in the <lb/>
            other all the sides are unequal. Now let this be called a <lb/>
            scalene (triangle); but the other, the half of a square, (be <lb/>
            considered) the principle of the constitution of the Earth. <lb/>
            For the square (produced) from this (scalene triangle) is com­ <lb/>
            posed of four half-squares; and from such a square is pro­ <lb/>
            duced the cube, a body the most stationary and steady in <lb/>
            every way, having six sides and eight angles; and on this <lb/>

            from it an equilateral (solid) triangle; of which is formed the <lb/>
            pyramid, having four faces, and their angles1 equal, the form <lb/>
            of Fire, which is the most easy to be moved, and made up of <lb/>
            the finest particles. After this is the octohedron, with eight <lb/>
            faces and six angles, the element of Air; and the third is the <lb/>
            eikosihedron, with twenty faces and twelve angles, the element <lb/>
            of Water, made up of particles the most numerous and heavi­ <lb/>
            est. These then, as being composed of the same element, are <lb/>
            changed into each other. But (the deity) has made the do­ <lb/>
            decahedron, the image of the Universe, as being the nearest <lb/>
            to the Sphere. Fire then, by the fineness of its particles, <lb/>
            passes through all things ; and Air through the rest of things, <lb/>
            with the exception of Fire; and Water through Earth. All <lb/>
            things are therefore full, and leave no vacuum.2 But they <lb/>
            are brought together by the revolving movement of the Uni­ <lb/>
            verse, and are pressed against, and rubbed by, each other in <lb/>
            turn, and produce the never-failing change from production <lb/>
            to destruction.</p>
          <p>[6.] By making use of these the deity put together this <lb/>
            world, sensible to touch through (the particles of) Earth, <lb/>
            and to sight through (those of) Fire; which two are the ex­ <lb/>
            tremes ; but through (the particles of) Air and'Water he has <lb/>
            bound (the world) together by the strongest chain, namely, <lb/>
            proportion; which is able to hold together both itself, and <lb/>
            the things kept in subjection through it. Now if the thing <lb/>
            bound together is a plane surface, one middle (term) is suf­ <lb/>
            ficient ; but if a solid, there will be need of two. With two <lb/>
            middle terms then he combined two extremes, so that as Fire <lb/>
            is to Air, Air might be to Water, and Water to Earth ; and <lb/>
            by alternation, as Fire is to Water, Air (might be) to Earth ; <lb/>
            and by inversion, as Earth is to Water, Water (might be) to <lb/>
            Air, and Air to Fire; and by alternation, as Earth is to Air, <lb/>
            so Water (might be) to Fire. Now since all are equal in <lb/>
            power, their ratios are in a state of equality. This world <lb/>
            then is one, through the bond of the deity, made according to <lb/>

          <p>[8.] But amongst the senses the deity has lit up in us the <lb/>
            sight for viewing objects in the heavens, and for 2 the recep­ <lb/>
            tion of knowledge;2 while as the recipient of speech and <lb/>
            melody, he has implanted in us hearing, 3of which he who is <lb/>
            deprived from his birth will become dumb, nor be3 able to <lb/>
            give vent to any portion4 of speech; and hence persons say <lb/>
            that this sense is related the nearest to speech. But as many <lb/>
            of the affections of the body, as have a name, are so called with <lb/>
            reference to the touch; and some too from their tendency to its <lb/>
            seat. For the touch judges of the properties connected with <lb/>
            life,5 (such as) warmth, coldness, dryness, moisture, smoothness, <lb/>
            roughness, (and) of things, yielding, opposing, soft, hard. The <lb/>
            touch too decides upon what is heavy and light. 6But reason <lb/>
            defines them by their inclination to the middle (of the world) <lb/>
            and from the middle.6 Now men mean the same thing by <lb/>
            below and middle. For the centre of a sphere is the below ; <lb/>
            but that, which is above it to the circumference, is the up. <lb/>
            Now what is warm appears to consist of fine particles, and <lb/>
            such as cause bodies to separate; but what is cold (consists) <lb/>
            of gross particles, and such as cause bodies to condense. The <lb/>
            circumstances relating to taste are similar to those (relating) <lb/>
            to touch. For by concretion and secretion, and further, by <lb/>
            entering the pores and by (assuming) shapes, substances are <lb/>

            on Ocellus Lucanus, p. 20, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πϱός τε</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαμπϱὸν καὶ ξανθὸν</foreign> teat <foreign xml:lang="grc">λευκὸν</foreign>, <lb/>
            explains <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαμπϱὸν</foreign> by <foreign xml:lang="grc">λευκὸν</foreign> ; and would reject therefore <foreign xml:lang="grc">λευκὸν</foreign> as a gl. <lb/>
            One would prefer however <foreign xml:lang="grc">γλαυκὸν</foreign>, if <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαμπϱὸν</foreign> means there "white;" <lb/>
            but if light-blue, as here, <foreign xml:lang="grc">λευκὸν</foreign> must be retained. With regard to the <lb/>
            whole tenor of the passage, it is worth while quoting the words of Apu­ <lb/>
            leius de Mundo, " Pictura ex discordibus pigmentorum coloribus, atris, </note> <pb n="163"/>
             <note type="margin">c. 9.] </note> <lb/>
            ture of these. Now what is white causes the vision to ex­ <lb/>
            pand, but what is black to contract; just as what is warm is <lb/>
            able to expand the touching, but what is cold to contract 'it; <lb/>
            and what is rough naturally contracts the tasting, but what is <lb/>
            sharp dilates it.</p>
          <p>[9.] And (it is natural) for the covering of animals, that <lb/>
            live in the air, to be nourished and kept together by the food <lb/>
            being distributed by the veins through the whole mass, in the <lb/>
            manner of a stream, conveyed as it were by channels, and <lb/>
            moistened by the breathe which diffuses it, and carries it <lb/>
            to the extremities. And respiration is produced through <lb/>
            there being no vacuum in nature, while the air, as it <lb/>
            flows in, is inhaled in the place of that which is exhaled, <lb/>
            through unseen mouths, through which the drops (of sweat) <lb/>
            are visible on the surface; but a portion is got rid of by the <lb/>
            natural warmth (of the body). It is necessary then for a por­ <lb/>
            tion, equal to what has been got rid of, to be introduced in its <lb/>
            place; for, if not, there would be a vacuum ; which is impos­ <lb/>
            sible: for the animal would no longer be flowing together2 <lb/>
            and one, when the covering had been separated by the vacuum. <lb/>
            Now the same organization takes place in the case of lifeless <lb/>
            substances, according to the analogy of respiration. For the <lb/>
            gourd and amber are the likenesses of respiration. Now the <lb/>
            breath flows through the body to an orifice outwards,3 and is <lb/>
            introduced in turn through respiration by the mouth and nos­ <lb/>
            trils, and again, after the manner of the Euripus, is carried <note type="footnote"> albis, luteis, et puniceis, confusione modica temperatis, imagines iis, quos <lb/>

            out. I The gourd (too), when the air within it is got rid of <lb/>
            by fire, attracts to itself moisture: and amber, when the air <lb/>
            is separated from it, receives an equal substance.1 Now all <lb/>
            nourishment is from the heart, as the root, and from the <lb/>
            stomach, as a fountain, and is conveyed to the body, to which, <lb/>
            if it be moistened by more than what flows out, there is said to <lb/>
            be an increase; but if by less, a decay; but the point of per­ <lb/>
            fection is the boundary between those (two), and is considered <lb/>
            (to exist) in an equality of efflux and influx; but when the <lb/>
            joints of the system are broken, should there be no longer any <lb/>
            passage for the breath, or the nourishment be not distributed, <lb/>
            the animal dies.</p>
          <p>[10.] Now there are many things hurtful to life and the <lb/>
            causes of death. One kind is called disease. And of diseases <lb/>
            the commencement is the want of harmony between the princi­ <lb/>
            pal powers, when the simple powers, such as heat, or cold, or <lb/>
            moisture, or dryness, are too much or deficient; and after these <lb/>
            the turns and alterations of the blood from corruption, and the <lb/>
            deterioration of the flesh, when wasting away, should the turns <lb/>
            take place according to the changes to what is acid, or brackish, <lb/>
            or bitter, in the blood, or wastings away of the flesh. For from <lb/>
            hence arises the generation of bile and of phlegm, (and) diseased <lb/>
            juices, and the rottenness of liquids, weak indeed, unless deeply <lb/>
            seated,3 but difficult (to cure), when their commencement is <lb/>
            generated from the bones, and painful, if in a state of inflam­ <lb/>
            mation from the marrow. The last of disorders is (those of) <lb/>
            the breath, bile, and phlegm, when they increase and flow into <lb/>
            situations foreign to them, or into places inappropriate ;4 for <lb/>

            into those very things.1 These then are the sufferings of the <lb/>
            body; and from these are many diseases of the soul, some <lb/>
            from one faculty, others from others ; of the perceptive (soul <lb/>
            the disease is) a difficulty of perception ; of the recollecting, <lb/>

            cited madness; of the rational, an indisposition to learn and <lb/>

            and pains, desires and fears, inflamed by the body and mixed <lb/>
            up with the mind, and are called by various names. For <lb/>
            there are loves, and regrets, and desires let loose, and passions <lb/>
            on the stretch, and heavy resentments, and appetites of vari­ <lb/>
            ous kinds, and pleasures without measure. 3 In all simplicity, <lb/>
            to be unreasonably disposed towards affections and to be un­ <lb/>

            in them or to be superior to them places us in a good or bad <lb/>
            position. Against such impulses the temperament of our <lb/>
            bodies is able to co-operate greatly, whether quick or hot, or <lb/>
            varied in various ways, by leading us to melancholy and vio­ <lb/>

            produce itchings and forms of bodies more like a state of in­ <lb/>

            the living out of doors, and simple fare, and gymnastic exer­ <lb/>
            cises, and the morals of companions, produce the greatest effect <lb/>
            in the way of virtue and of vice. And these causes are de­ <lb/>
            rived from parents and the elements rather than from our­ <lb/>
            selves, provided there be no remissness on our part in keeping <lb/>
            aloof from acts of duty. And for the animal to be in a good <lb/>
            condition, it is requisite for the body to possess the better <lb/>
            properties under its control, (namely,) health and correct per­ <lb/>
            ception, and strength and beauty. Now the principles of <lb/>
            beauty are, a symmetry as regards its parts, and as regards <lb/>
            the soul. For nature has arranged, like an instrument, the <lb/>
            body to be subservient to, and in harmony with, the subjects <lb/>
            of life. And it is requisite for the soul likewise to be brought <lb/>
            into harmony with its analogous good qualities, (namely,) in <lb/>
            the case of temperance, as the body is in the case of health; <lb/>
            and in that of prudence, as in the case of correct perception; <lb/>
            and in that of fortitude, as in the case of vigour and strength ;2 <lb/>
            and in that of justice, as in the case of beauty.3 Of these <lb/>
            the beginning is from nature; but their middle portions and <lb/>
            end are from carefulness ; those relating to the body, through <lb/>
            the gymnastic and medical arts; those to the soul, through <lb/>
            instruction and philosophy. For these are the powers that <lb/>
            nourish, and give a tone to, the body and soul by means of <lb/>
            labour and gymnastic exercise, and a pureness4 of diet; some <lb/>
            through druggings (applied to the body),5 and others through <lb/>
            discipline applied to the soul by means of punishments and <lb/>
            reproaches ; for by encouragement they give strength and <lb/>

            And they would be called of necessity strange2 punishments ; <lb/>
            since the souls of cowards enter by a change into the bodies <lb/>
            of women, 3who are given to insulting conduct;3 and those <lb/>

          </head>
          <p>As the Notes of Batteux, to which reference is made in p. 153, n. 1_1, <lb/>
            would scarcely furnish all the information requisite for the complete elu­ <lb/>
            cidation of this passage, I have introduced some preliminary matter, which, <lb/>
            it is hoped, will afford clear notions on a rather difficult subject.</p>
          <p>When Pythagoras was endeavouring to discover in respect to sounds a <lb/>
            test for the ear, similar to that for the eye in respect to colours, as furn­ <lb/>
            ished by a lens, and to that for the hand, in respect to different substances, <lb/>
            solid and liquid, by means of measures and weights, he happened to pass <lb/>
            by the workshop of a coppersmith, where he heard a variety of sounds, <lb/>
            produced by different hammers, as they came in contact with the metal; <lb/>
            and after making various experiments, he discovered that the difference <lb/>
            in the sounds was according to the weight of the hammers, and not ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the force with which the metal was struck. For the sounds <lb/>
            were really the same, though differing in intensity, whether the hammers <lb/>
            were wielded by hands more or less powerful; just as a key on the <lb/>
            pianoforte gives the same note, but differing only in loudness, whether it <lb/>
            be struck by a grown person or a child.</p>
          <p>Perceiving thus that certain vibrations were produced in a bar of metal, <lb/>
            when struck by different hammers, and suspecting probably that the sound <lb/>
            was connected in some measure with such vibrations, he is reported to <lb/>
            have noted down the weights of the different hammers, and on his re­ <lb/>
            turn home to have suspended from a beam, stretched diagonally from <lb/>
            two corners of a room, four strings of the same substance, length, and <lb/>
            twist; to each of which he attached four weights of 12, 9, 8, and 6 <lb/>
            pounds, respectively, which were fastened to the ground. He then <lb/>
            struck the strings first singly, and found that the sounds were more or <lb/>
            less acute, according as the strings were attached to the less or greater <lb/>
            weight; he then struck the two extreme strings, and found that the sound <lb/>
            proceeding from the string connected with the greatest weight, was, as <lb/>
            compared with the sound proceeding from that connected with the <lb/>
            least weight, in the proportion of 2 to 1: and by ringing the changes on <lb/>
            the other strings, he found the sounds to be always in proportion to the <lb/>
            weights attached to the strings.</p>
          <p>His next step, it is said, was to transfer the strings, now called cat-gut, <lb/>
            a corruption of cut-gut, to the bridge of a musical instrument, where the <lb/>
            bridge answered the purpose of the beam previously used ; while, in the <lb/>
            place of the weights originally attached to the strings, he invented pegs, <lb/>
            around which the strings were wound, and by which they were extended <lb/>
            or contracted to the proper pitch, as they are at present in all stringed <lb/>
            instruments; and the names assigned to the four strings were, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ύπάτη</foreign>, the <lb/>
            highest, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέση</foreign>, the middle, <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραμέση</foreign>, near to, but lower than, the middle, <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">νεάτη</foreign>, the lowest; with which may be compared the four strings <lb/>
            that produce the four notes, E, A, D, and G, on the modern violin.</p>
          <p>According, however, to Boethius, De Musica, i. 20, this four-stringed <lb/>
            lyre was invented even before the time of Orpheus. His words are­ <lb/>
            " Simplicem principio fuisse musicam refert Nicomachus, adeo ut quatuor <lb/>
            nervis tota constaret; idque usque ad Orpheum duravit, ut primus qui­ <lb/>
             <pb n="170"/>
            dem et quartus diapason harmoniam (nervi) resonarent—ad imitationem <lb/>
            musicæ mundanæ, quæ ex quatuor constat elementis." While Manuel <lb/>
            Bryenus in Harmonic. § i. p. 362, carries the invention still higher. For <lb/>
            he says that " before the time of Mercury there was a four-stringed lyre, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατὰ μίμησιν τῆς τῶν στοιχείων τετρακτύος</foreign>—where, be it remarked, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τετρακτύος</foreign> is used for <foreign xml:lang="grc">τετράδος</foreign>—but that Mercury, having joined two <lb/>
            systems, formed a seven-stringed lyre;" where, as he says nothing of <lb/>
            the other system, one may hazard a conjecture that he had heard of the <lb/>
            tradition, mentioned by Diodorus Sic. i. 16, that the first lyre was with <lb/>
            only three strings, to answer to the three seasons, called in Greece <foreign xml:lang="grc">τΩραι</foreign>—</p>
          <p>Be, however, the inventors of the four and seven-stringed lyres who <lb/>
            they may, it is evident that the latter could not have been applied to any <lb/>
            scientific purpose, until the three intermediate notes had been discovered <lb/>
            requisite to make up the scale of seven notes; which were called respect­ <lb/>
            ively <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρυπάτη</foreign>, near to, but under, the highest; <foreign xml:lang="grc">ύπερμέση</foreign>, near to, but <lb/>
            above, the middle ; and <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρανεάτη</foreign>, near to, but above, the lowest; thus <lb/>
            making two semitones between the middle and highest. But instead of <lb/>
            these semitones having the same ratio to their contiguous primary tones, <lb/>
            Pythagoras discovered that they might be represented by a string divided <lb/>
            into two unequal parts, bearing the ratio to each other of 243 to 256, (or <lb/>
            of 34 to 44.) And these seven names, invented originally for the seven <lb/>
            strings of the lyre, were subsequently applied to the seven planets, when <lb/>
            they were considered as giving what was called the music of the spheres.</p>
          <p>By what means Pythagoras was enabled to arrive at the proportions, <lb/>
            which two unequal semi tones bear to each other, has not, as far as I <lb/>
            know, been handed down. But he probably got at the fact by carrying <lb/>
            out the experiments which led him to discover that, when a string is <lb/>
            stretched so as to produce a certain sound, a string of the same thickness <lb/>
            and twist, but of half that length, will give an octave higher; the third <lb/>
            of that length, a fifth higher; and the eighth, the next note higher. So <lb/>
            too if a string of a certain length gives a sound represented by a, the <lb/>
            next note lower (6) will be represented by and (c) the next lower <lb/>
            by b+⅛, and so on, except when the series a+⅛, is interrupted by one or more <lb/>
            semitones, when instead of ⅛ another quantity must be substituted, de­ <lb/>
            pendent on the ratio which 213 bears to 256.</p>
          <p>With these preliminary observations we may turn to the Remarks of <lb/>
            Batteux, who has drawn out the series of 36 terms and adjusted them to <lb/>
            a musical scale-where the letters in Italics refer to the vocal gamut, and <lb/>
            the Roman capitals to the instrumental—after prefacing the series with <lb/>
            some observations, from which I will make such extracts as bear directly <lb/>
            upon the matter in hand, and this with the greater willingness, as Bat­ <lb/>
            teux's little volume is not easily to be met with.</p>
          <p>" By an harmonic proportion Timæus understands that of the numbers, <lb/>
            which represent the concords in a musical scale. These were amongst <lb/>
            the ancients only three. The octave, called diapason,1 where the lowest <lb/>
            note was to the highest as 4 to 2; the fifth, called diapente,2 in the ratio <lb/>
            of 3 to 2 ; and the fourth, called diatessaron,3 in the ratio of 4 to 3. To <lb/>
            these were added, to complete the intervals of the concords, the single <note type="footnote"> 1, 2,3 The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">χορδῶν</foreign> is to be supplied after <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ πασῶν</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ <lb/>
            πέντε</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ τεσσάρων</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="171"/>
            notes, which are in the ratio of 9 to 8, and the semitones in that of <lb/>
            243 to 256.</p>
          <p>" N ow as the ancients identified the Soul of the world with its move­ <lb/>
            ment, the quantity of the movement became in their eyes the measure of <lb/>
            the quantity of the Soul; and as the movement appeared to them to be <lb/>
            the greatest at the circumference of the Universe, but nothing at the <lb/>
            centre, the quantity of the Soul was considered to be the minimum at <lb/>
            the centre, but the maximum at the circumference. Hence if the Soul <lb/>
            were fixed, like a radius at one end, at the centre, it would, when turned <lb/>
            along its whole length through all parts of the Universe, move with <lb/>
            greater or less velocity, according as those were nearer to the circumfer­ <lb/>
            ence or centre.</p>
          <p>" To understand then how the degrees of velocity were calculated, let <lb/>
            us conceive this radius to be divided according to a musical scale; when <lb/>
            such a division will represent the degrees, considered harmonically, of <lb/>
            the Soul of the world.</p>
          <p>" Let then 1 be assumed as the first term of the radius, fixed at the cen­ <lb/>
            tre, or, to avoid fractions, that would otherwise occur in the calculations <lb/>
            connected with the series following, let it be 384.' The second, which <lb/>
            will be the distance of the next note, will be 384+⅛ = 432. The third, <lb/>
            432+⅛= 486. The fourth, being a semi tone, will be 512 ; for as 243 is <lb/>
            to 256, so is 486 to 512. The eighth will be 768, the double of 384, or <lb/>
            the first octave; and the 36th will be 114695, as shown by the table fol­ <lb/>
            lowing : <figure type="illustration">

              selves, represent an arithmetical progression, whose common difference is <lb/>

              properties of numbers, taken as the symbols of the phenomena of matter, <lb/>
              'which only a second Pythagoras would be able to unfold; and a similar <lb/>

              35 to 44; especially if we bear in mind what is stated by Plutarch, De <lb/>
              Anim. Procreat. ii. p. 1028, B., respecting Lucifer being represented by <lb/>
              243, and the Sun by 729. </note></p><pb n="172"/>

          <p>" That these 36 numbers are those which Timæus had in view, there <lb/>
            can be but little doubt; since they fulfil all the conditions he has laid <lb/>
            down. For we find there a progression of tones and semitones; of tones, <lb/>
            which increase by adding to the number that precedes its eighth to make <lb/>
            up the number that is to follow; and of semitones, by finding a number <lb/>
            that is to follow, which shall bear to the preceding one the same ratio that <lb/>
            243 does to 256.</p>
          <p>" It is requisite however to pay attention to the four numbers, 1944, <lb/>
            2048, 2187, and 2304, where the difference between the first and second <lb/>
            is that of a semi tone minor (104); and between the second and third of <lb/>
            a semitone major (139); while these two semitones united make up <lb/>
            243, the difference between 2187 and 1944, or the equivalent of one tone. <lb/>
            But between 2187 (Sib) and 2304 (La) there is not more than a semi­ <lb/>
            tone minor, or the ratio of 243 to 256. And a similar arrangement in <lb/>
            the four numbers, 5832, 6144, 6561, and 6912.</p>
          <p>" But why were these terms fixed at 36 ? The reason is to be found in <lb/>
            the mysteries of the school of Pythagoras, where it was thought proper <note type="footnote"> 1—1 On these two terms Batteux observes—“The difference between <lb/>
            1944 and 2187, is 243. Take away then 139, which the Greeks called <lb/>
            an apotomé, from 243, there will remain 104, which they called a lemme. <lb/>
            Now 1944+104=2048;and 2048+139=2187:" and why 243 is thus <lb/>
            divided into 139 and 104, he has explained shortly afterwards. </note><note type="footnote"> 2—2 Here again there is something arbitrary in this introduction of a <lb/>
            semitone, marked by the same letters of the gamut as the tone itself. </note><note type="footnote"> 3—3 Batteux's note is, " 5832+ (the lemme) 312 = 6144, and 6144+ <lb/>
            (the apotomé) 417 = 6912." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="173"/>
            to multiply 384, the first assumed term, by 27. But why by 27 ? Be­ <lb/>
            cause that number is the sum of the first numbers, which represent lines, <lb/>
            surfaces, solids, squares, and cubes, added to unity. Thus, 1 is unity; 2 <lb/>
            and 3, the first numbers representing lines; 4 and 9, the first surfaces, <lb/>
            and both squares, the former of an even number (2), and the latter of <lb/>
            an odd number (3); and lastly, 8 and 27, both representing solids and <lb/>
            cubes, the former of an even number (2), and the latter of an odd num­ <lb/>
            ber (3). Taking then the number 27 as the symbol of the world, and <lb/>
            the numbers which it contains as the symbols of the elements and <lb/>
            their combinations, it was only reasonable for the Soul of the world, which <lb/>
            is the very basis of order and of the combinations, which constitute the <lb/>
            world, to be composed of the same elements (of order) as the number 27 <lb/>
            is itself."</p>

          </head>
          <p>[1.] PLATO, an Athenian, was the son of Ariston and <lb/>
            Periction6, or Potoné,1 who carried up her family to Solon. <lb/>
            For Solon's brother was Dropides; whose son was Critias, <lb/>
            the father of Calæschrus, whose children were Critias, one of <lb/>
            the thirty,2 and Glaucon, from whom were sprung Charmides <lb/>
            and Perictioné, of whom and of Ariston Plato was the son, the <lb/>
            sixth in descent from Solon, who carried up his genealogy to <lb/>
            Neleus and Poseidon. They say that his father likewise <lb/>
            carried his family up to Codrus, the son of Melanthus, who, <lb/>
            according to Thrasyllus, were historically descended from <lb/>
            Poseidon. [2.] But Speusippus, in his work entitled " Plato's <lb/>
            Funeral Supper," 3 and Clearchus, in his Praise of Plato," <lb/>
            and Anaxilides, in the second book " About Philosophers," <note type="footnote"> 1 Since the mother of Plato is not called elsewhere Potoné, it would <lb/>
            seem, that the name of the daughter (in § 4) has been by some mistake <lb/>
            attributed to the parent, contrary to the usual custom of Greece, where <lb/>
            girls were never, I believe, called after their mothers, although they were, <lb/>
            perhaps, after their grandmothers, just as boys were after their grand- <lb/>
            fathers. Hence for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἢ Ποτώνης</foreign> one might read <foreign xml:lang="grc">έκ</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">άπὸ Ποτώνης</foreign>— </note><note type="footnote"> 2 By " the thirty" are meant " the thirty tyrants," as they were called, <lb/>
            who were appointed by Lysander to be the Board of Directors at Athens, <lb/>
            after the city had fallen into the power of the Lacedæmonians. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 In lieu of <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ δείπνου</foreign>, I have adopted <foreign xml:lang="grc">περιδείπνῳ</foreign>, as recommended <lb/>
            by Menage. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">περίδείπνον</foreign>, as we learn from Suidas, was a supper in <lb/>
            honour of the dead, and one at which it was customary to speak an eulogy <lb/>
            on the deceased. Now as Plato died at a marriage feast, according to the <lb/>
            account given just afterwards, and alluded to in § 45, it is not difficult to <lb/>
            see what was probably the subject of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">περίδειπνον</foreign> written by Speu­ <lb/>
            sippus, the nephew of Plato. </note> <pb n="176"/>

            state that there was a story at Athens, how that Ariston at­ <lb/>
            tempted to violate Perictioné, then in her prime, and not <lb/>
            succeeding, beheld, on ceasing from his violence, a vision of <lb/>
            Apollo, 1 from which time he kept her undefiled by the rights <lb/>
            of marriage until her delivery ; 1 when Plato, says Apollo­ <lb/>
            dorus, in his " Chronicles," was born in 01. 88, on the seventh <lb/>
            of Thargelion, (i. e. April,) the day on which the Delians say <lb/>
            Apollo was born; and he died, as Hermippus states, while <lb/>
            supping at a marriage feast,2 in the first year of 01. 108, <lb/>
            having lived 81 years.3 [3.] But Neanthes says he died in <lb/>
            his 84th year. He was therefore younger than Isocrates by <lb/>
            6 years;4 who was born in the archonship of Lysimachus; <lb/>
            but Plato in that of Ameinias,5 during which Pericles died. <lb/>
            He was of the ward of Colyttus, as Antileon states in the se­ <lb/>
            cond book " On Chronology;” but according to some he was <lb/>
            born at Ægina, in the house of Phidiades, the son of Thales, <lb/>
            as Phavorinus says in his " Various History," through his <lb/>
            father having been sent (thither), together with some others, <lb/>
            as an allotment-holder,6 but who returned to Athens, when <lb/>
            those parties were driven out by the Lacedæmonians, who <lb/>
            assisted the people of Ægina. He acted moreover as a Cho­ <lb/>
            regus, the means being furnished by Dion,7 as Athenodorus <note type="footnote"> 1_1 The story, told here rather indistinctly by Diogenes, is given more <lb/>
            clearly by Plutarch in Sympos. viii. 1, and the other authors quoted by <lb/>
            Casaubon and Menage; from whom it appears, that Plato was said to <lb/>
            have been the son of Apollo, and not of Aristo, who married Perictioné, <lb/>
            not knowing that she was already pregnant by the god. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 But Cicero, de Senect. § 5, says that Plato died while in the act of <lb/>
            writing. Here, instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">γάμοις</foreign>, Clinton in Fast. Hellenic, p. 139, = <lb/>
            149, ed. Krueger, would read <foreign xml:lang="grc">γενεθλίοις</foreign>, "his birthday.” </note><note type="footnote"> 3 But Athenæus, in v. c. 18, says that Plato died in his 82nd year. <lb/>
            The discrepancy in the account of Neanthes is owing, perhaps, to the <lb/>
            error of A (4) for A (1) found in the MS. of that author, which Diogenes <lb/>
            made use of. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Meursius, Do Archont. Athen. iii. 2, would read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ζ</foreign> (7) for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ς</foreign> (6), on <lb/>
            the authority of Pseudo-Plutarch's Life of Isocrates. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 Instead of " Ameinias," Salmasius proposed to read " Ameinon." <lb/>
            The word in Diodorus is Epameinondas. But no Athenian, eligible for <lb/>
            the Archonship, would have been called by a name with the Doric ter­ <lb/>
            mination in " das," instead of the Attic in " des." Athenæus has Epa­ <lb/>
            meinon. In such a variety of readings, who, asks Menage, can detect <lb/>

            states in the eighth book of his " Peripatetics." [4.] He <lb/>
            had two brothers, Adeimantus and Glaucon, and a sister, <lb/>
            Potoné, of whom Speusippus was the son. 1 He received his <lb/>
            boyhood's education1 under Dionysius, of whom he makes <lb/>
            mention in " The Rivals;" but became a gymnast under the <lb/>
            wrestler Ariston of Argos; by whom he was called Plato on <lb/>
            account of his fine habit of body, having borne previously the <lb/>
            name of Aristocles after his grandfather,2 as Alexander states <lb/>
            in his " Successions;"3 but some (say) he was called so from <lb/>
            4 the breadth of his interpretation,4 5 or because he was of a <lb/>
            broad face, as Neanthes asserts.5 There are also those who <lb/>
            state that he wrestled at the Isthmus,6 as Dicæarchus does in <lb/>
            his first book " On Lives ;"7 [5.] and that he paid some at­ <lb/>
            tention to painting; and wrote poetry, at first dithyrambs,8 <lb/>
            and subsequently songs and tragedies ; and they say9 he had <lb/>
            a thin voice,10 as Timotheus of Athens states in his work " On <lb/>
            Lives." It is said moreover that Socrates saw in a dream <note type="footnote">1_1 Such is the proper translation of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπαιδεύθη γϱάμματα</foreign>. For by <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">γϱάμμτα</foreign>, literally " letters," was meant every thing that a boy was <lb/>
            taught in his earliest years. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 As the name of Aristocles does not appear in the genealogy on the <lb/>
            mother's side, the person alluded to was of course the father of Ariston. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 By the word " Successions " are to be understood those that oc­ <lb/>

            Menage renders " orationis ubertatem." But such neither is, nor could <lb/>
            be, the meaning of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑϱμηνείας</foreign>. Diogenes probably wrote <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑἰϱωνείας</foreign>. For <lb/>
            " irony " is the figure of speech constantly adopted by Socrates. Com­ <lb/>

            may be compared with <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλατὺς γέλως</foreign>, which Herodian, at the end of <lb/>

            the instant full-fledged and flew up, singing sweetly; 1 and <lb/>
            that the (next) day Plato 2was placed with him (as a pupil) ;2 <lb/>
            when he said, "This is the bird." 3 He began his philoso­ <lb/>

            Colonus, as Alexander says in his " Successions," on the au­ <lb/>
            thority of Heracleitus. Subsequently, however, when about <lb/>
            to engage in the contest with a tragedy, he did, after hearing <lb/>
            Socrates, commit before the temple of Dionysus,4 his poems <lb/>
            to the flames, saying, <lb/>
            Come hither, Vulcan, Plato has need of thee.5 <lb/>
            [6.] And from that period they say, being now twenty years <lb/>
            old, he became a hearer of Socrates; and when the latter <lb/>
            departed (from life),6 Plato attached himself to Cratylus, the <lb/>
            follower of Heracleitus, and to Hermogenes, who adopted the <lb/>
            philosophy of Parmenides. Afterwards, when he was 28 <lb/>
            years old, as Hermodorus says, he retired to Megara with <lb/>
            some other disciples of Socrates to Euclid. Subsequently he <lb/>

            the Egyptians are physicians. Plato had determined more­ <lb/>
            over to mingle with the Magi; but on account of the wars <lb/>
            then raging in Asia, he swerved from his purpose, and, re­ <lb/>
            turning to Athens, passed his time in Academia. Now this <lb/>
            was a grove-like gymnasium in the suburbs, so called from <lb/>
            a certain hero Academus, as Eupolis says in his “ Non­ <lb/>
            campaigners," <lb/>
            In the well-shaded courses' of the god, <lb/>
            (Call'd) Academus. <lb/>
            But Timon likewise, speaking against Plato, says- <lb/>

            poets, which occurred in the country, when Isocrates was a <lb/>
            guest of Plato, Praxiphanes has put into writing. 4Aris­ <lb/>

            time at Delium, where he obtained a prize for good conduct.4 <lb/>
            In his discourses he has made a mixture of the doctrines of <lb/>
            Heracleitus; Pythagoras, and Socrates. For as regards what <lb/>
            are perceptible by a sense, he philosophized according to <lb/>
            Heracleitus; in what are perceptible by the mind, according <lb/>
            to Pythagoras; but in what relates to politics, according to <lb/>
            Socrates. [9.] And some, amongst whom is Satyrus, assert <note type="footnote"> 1 In lieu of <foreign xml:lang="grc">δϱόμοισι</foreign>, Meursius in Exercitat. Critic, ii. 12, would read <lb/>

            as Alcimus states in his treatises, which are four, addressed to <lb/>
            Amyntas ; where he says thus in the first—“ Plato appears to <lb/>
            have spoken3 much from the writings of Epicharmus. For <lb/>
            let us look into the matter. Plato asserts 4that what is per­ <lb/>
            ceptible by a sense, is never permanent either as regards quality <lb/>
            or quantity, but is ever in a state of flux and change.4 [10.] <lb/>
            5 So that from which things should a person take away, these <lb/>
            being neither equal, nor of a certain kind, nor possessing <lb/>
            quantity nor quality :5 and these are they, of which there is a <lb/>
            generation always, but never a substance; but that is per­ <lb/>
            ceptible by mind, from which nothing is taken away or added. <lb/>
            Now this of things eternal the nature, which happens to be <lb/>
            similar and the same for ever." And in fact Epicharmus has <lb/>
            spoken very clearly about things perceptible by a sense and <lb/>
            mind.</p>
          <p>A. Gods have ever present been, nor ever have they fail'd (to be) ; <lb/>
            Similar too things present round us,6 and for ever through the same.</p>
          <p>B. Still before the gods 'tis said7 that Chaos did exist the first. <note type="footnote"> 1 To this purchase Timon alludes in a tristich, preserved by A. Gellins, <lb/>

              [12.] Alcimus states likewise this too — The wise assert <lb/>
              that the soul perceives some things through the body, when, <lb/>
              as it were,1 it hears (or) sees;1 but on other things it reflects <lb/>
              through itself, and makes no use of the body. Hence of <lb/>
              things existing, some are perceptible by sense, and some by <lb/>
              mind. On which account Plato likewise has said that it is <lb/>
              requisite for those, who are desirous of understanding the <lb/>
              principles of the Universe, in the first place to preserve ideas <lb/>
              separate by themselves, such as similitude, and unity, and mul­ <lb/>
              titude, and magnitude, and rest, and motion; and, secondly, <lb/>
              beauty, and goodness, and justice, each taken abstractedly, and <lb/>
              to lay down points like these, as the basis (of philosophy). <lb/>
              [13.] Thirdly, to take a combined view of ideas, how they ex­ <lb/>
              ist in relation to each other, such as 2 science, or magnitude, <lb/>
              or power,2 while bearing in mind that 3what exist with us <lb/>
              have, through sharing with them, the same name with them ;3 <lb/>
              I mean, for instance, that things are just, inasmuch as they <lb/>
              (share) in abstract justice; and things beautiful, inasmuch <lb/>
              as they (share) in abstract beauty.4 Now one of every <lb/>
              species is eternal, perceptible by the mind,5 and moreover in­ <lb/>
              sensible to suffering; and hence he asserts that ideas exist, <lb/>

            the first time to see the island and the craters (of Ætna),2 <lb/>
            when the tyrant Dionysius, the son of Hermocrates, compelled <lb/>
            him to form an acquaintance with himself. But he, after <lb/>
            conversing on the subject of tyranny, and asserting that, <lb/>
            what was advantageous to him (Dionysius) alone,3 was not the <lb/>
            better thing, unless he excelled in virtue likewise, gave of­ <lb/>
            fence to Dionysius; who becoming enraged said (to Plato)- <lb/>
            Thy language is that of an old (dotard); and Thine, replied <lb/>
            the other, is that of a tyrant. [19.] From whence the tyrant, <lb/>
            being much annoyed, was at first eager to destroy him; but, <lb/>
            on being subsequently dissuaded by Dion and Aristomenes, <lb/>
            he did no such thing; but handed him over to Pollis the <lb/>

            Plato to Ægina, was going to sell him; when Charmandrus, <lb/>
            the son of Charmandrides, indicted Plato on a capital charge, <lb/>

            the first Athenian, who should come upon the island, should <lb/>
            perish without the form of a trial. Now it was Charmandrus <lb/>

            Plato did not accept, (for that purpose,) but to purchase a <lb/>
            small garden for himself in Academia. And there is a story <lb/>
            that Pollis was defeated by Chabrias, and subsequently 1swal­ <lb/>

            being angry for his conduct towards the philosopher, as Pha­ <lb/>
            vorinus states in the first book of his " Memoirs." [21.] <lb/>
            Dionysius did not however remain quiet; but, on learning <lb/>
            (his escape), sent to Plato an order not to speak ill of him; <lb/>
            who sent word in return, that his leisure was not such as to <lb/>
            enable him to recollect even Dionysius. His second trip was <lb/>
            to the younger Dionysius, to ask him for some land and per­ <lb/>
            sons, who were to live according to his notion of a polity. <lb/>
            But Dionysius, although he made a promise to that effect, did <lb/>
            not act up to it; and some say that Plato was imperilled, as <lb/>
            having persuaded Dion and Theotas2 to effect the freedom of <lb/>
            the island; on which occasion the Pythagorean Archytas <lb/>
            begged him off, by writing a letter to Dionysius, and sent <lb/>
            him in safety to Athens. And this was the letter.</p>

            Dionysius; but not being successful, he returned to his <lb/>
            country, having accomplished nothing. There he meddled <lb/>
            not with state affairs, although he was, from what he wrote, <lb/>
            a politician ; and the reason was, that the people were already <lb/>
            habituated to other forms of polity. And Pamphila states in <lb/>
            the 25th book of her " Memoirs," that 1 the Arcadians and <lb/>
            Thebans, when they were building Megalopolis, called upon <lb/>
            him to be their law-giver; but on his learning that they were <lb/>
            unwilling to have an equality, he did not go. [24.] (There is <lb/>
            a report too) that he accompanied1 Chabrias the general, when <lb/>
            he was put on his trial on a capital charge, and not one of the <lb/>
            citizens were willing to do so; and that when Crobylus, the <lb/>
            informer, met him, as he was going up to the Acropolis in <lb/>
            company with Chabrias, and said, "Are you come to act the <lb/>
            pleader for another person, when you are not ignorant that <lb/>
            the poison-cup of Socrates is waiting for you?"—he replied <lb/>
            —" When I served in the army for my country's sake, I en­ <lb/>

            who opposed the reasoning of Lysias, the son of Cephalus, by <lb/>
            exposing it in detail1 in his Phædrus; and he first examined <lb/>
            theoretically the power of the science of grammar. But, as he <lb/>
            first spoke against nearly all before his time, it has been made <lb/>
            a subject of inquiry, why he has never mentioned Democritus. <lb/>
            On his going up to the Olympic games, Neanthes of Cyzicus <lb/>
            says that all the Greeks turned their eyes towards him, when <lb/>
            he had a meeting with Dion, then about to lead an army <lb/>
            against Dionysius. And it is reported, in the first book of <lb/>
            " The Memoirs " of Phavorinus, that Mithridates the Persian <lb/>
            put up a statue of Plato in the Academy, with this inscrip­ <lb/>
            tion—</p>
          <p>Mithridates, the son of Rhodobates, a Persian, has dedicated to the <lb/>
            Muses an image of Plato, which Silanion executed.</p>
          <p>[26.] Heracleides says, that when Plato was a young man <lb/>
            he was so modest and orderly behaved, that he was never <lb/>
            seen to laugh excessively ; and though he was such a kind of <lb/>
            person, he was scoffed at by the Comic writers. For instance, <lb/>
            Theopompus in his " Autochares"2 says thus- <lb/>
            3 For one is none, <lb/>
            And two, as Plato holds, is scarcely one;3 <lb/>
            and Anaxandrides too in his "Theseus "— <lb/>
            When olives he devoured, 4 that Plato loves ;4 <lb/>

            the education of Cyrus ; while Plato in the " Laws " asserts <lb/>
            that the education of Cyrus was a fiction; for he was not such <lb/>
            a kind of person ; and though both make mention of Socrates, <lb/>
            neither of them do so of each other, except Xenophon of <lb/>
            Plato in the 3rd book of his "Memoirs." [35.] It is re­ <lb/>
            ported likewise that Antisthenes, being about to read some­ <lb/>
            thing he had written, invited Plato to be present; and on <lb/>
            Plato asking what he was about to read, he said—1 On the <lb/>
            being to not contradict ;1 when on Plato saying-How then are <lb/>
            you writing on this very subject ?-and on his showing that <lb/>
            Antisthenes was turning round on himself,2 the latter wrote <lb/>
            a dialogue against Plato with the title of "Sathon;" from <lb/>
            whence they continued through life estranged from each <lb/>
            other. They say, too, that Socrates, on hearing Plato read <lb/>
            his Lysis, remarked-How many falsehoods, by Hercules, has <lb/>
            this young man told against me ! For the man had written <lb/>
            not a little that Socrates had never said. [36.] Against <lb/>
            Aristippus likewise Plato had a feeling of hatred. At least <lb/>
            in his dialogue " On the Soul," he slanders Aristippus, by <lb/>
            saying that he was not present at the death of Socrates, but <lb/>
            absent in Ægina, although it was close at hand. He had <lb/>
            likewise a feeling of rivalry towards Æschines; and they <lb/>
            say that, 4 although he was himself in good repute with Dio­ <lb/>
            nysius, yet, that Æschines, who had come (to Syracuse) on <lb/>
            account of his poverty, was looked down upon by Plato,4 but <lb/>
            was taken under his protection by Aristippus; and Idome­ <lb/>
            neus asserts that the reasons which Plato assigns to Crito, <lb/>
            while consulting (with Socrates) in person about his flight, <lb/>
            were those given by Æschines; but that Plato assigned them <lb/>
            to Crito through his ill-feeling towards the other party.</p>

            Moreover, Euphorion and Panætius have stated that the com­ <lb/>

            quently turned about,2 nearly the whole of which, says <lb/>
            Aristoxenus, had been written in " The Opposite Reason­ <lb/>
            ings"3 of Protagoras ; [38.] and that the first dialogue he <lb/>
            wrote was the Phædrus; for the question mooted there has <lb/>
            something of a juvenile character; while Dicæarchus blames <lb/>
            the whole manner of writing as being rather gross.4</p>
          <p>Plato, when he saw a person playing at dice, is reported to <lb/>
            have found fault with him; and on the party saying " It was <lb/>
            for a trifle," he replied, " But the habit is not a trifle."</p>
          <p>On being asked whether any thing of his would be, like <lb/>
            those of former men, kept in recollection ? he replied, " There <lb/>
            is need of a name first; and then there will be many."</p>
          <p>On Xenocrates once coming into his house, Plato told him <lb/>
            to whip his slave ; for he himself was not able, through being <lb/>
            in a passion: and to one of his slaves he said, " You would <lb/>

              All men beyond, Aristocles here lies. <lb/>
              If Wisdom ever praise from all has won, <lb/>
              He has won most; and from him Envy flies. <lb/>
              [44.] And another- <lb/>
              Earth in her bosom Plato's body hides ; <lb/>
              His soul to the ranks of blest immortals strays : <lb/>
              To Ariston's son the good man, who abides <lb/>
              Far off, for a godlike life1 due honour pays. <lb/>
              And another of a more recent date- <lb/>
              Why, eagle, hast thou come over a tomb ? and of whom is it, say ? <lb/>
              And (why) art thou looking to the starry dwelling of the gods ? <lb/>
              Of the soul of Plato, that has flown to Olympus, <lb/>
              I am the image; but his earth-born body the land of Attica holds.3 <lb/>
              [45.] And there is my own to this effect— <lb/>
              4 Had not Apollo, to the Grecians kind, <lb/>
              To Plato's wit his godlike art resign'd, <lb/>

            seekest at the hands of any one soever very zealously the <lb/>
            settled opinions of the philosopher, I deem it necessary to <lb/>
            delineate both the nature of his reasonings and the order of <lb/>
            his dialogues, and the road of his instruction, 1 in a manner, <lb/>
            as far as is possible, elementary and reduced to heads, in order <lb/>
            that the account of his life may not be without a share of that <lb/>
            relating to his settled opinions; for it would be, as they say, <lb/>
            2bringing an owl to Athens,2 should it be required to narrate <lb/>
            them to thee according to each species.</p>
          <p>[48.] They say then that Zeno of Elea first wrote dialogues. <lb/>
            But Aristotle, in the first book " About Poets," says it was <lb/>
            Alexamenus a Styrian, or Teian, as Phavorinus asserts in <lb/>
            his ‟ Memoirs." But it appears to me that Plato would, by <lb/>
            having bestowed great care on that kind of writing, justly <lb/>
            carry off the first prize, as well for beauty as invention like­ <lb/>
            wise.</p>
          <p>Now a dialogue is a conversation, composed of question <lb/>
            and answer, upon some of the subjects relating to philosophy <lb/>
            or polity, with a becoming representation of the manners of <lb/>
            the persons introduced, and 3the dressing of their diction.3 <lb/>
            But the dialogue-art is that of a conversation, by which 4we <lb/>
            arrange or re-arrange4 a subject, according to the questions and <lb/>
            answers of the parties conversing. [49..] Now of the Platonic <lb/>
            dialogue5 there are two kinds marked of old ;6 the expositive <lb/>
            and the inquisitive: and these are divided, the expositive <lb/>
            into two other marked kinds, the theoretical and practical; <lb/>
            of which the theoretical belongs to the physical and logical; <note type="footnote"> that the female here alluded to was the Arria mentioned by Pseudo-Galen <lb/>

            but the practical to the ethical and political. And of the in­ <lb/>
            quisitive there are likewise two principal marked kinds; one <lb/>
            is l after the manner of a fight (with gloves), and the other <lb/>
            after that ( with fists) ; 1 and to the former belongs that which <lb/>
            is maieutic2 and tentative; but to the latter that which is <lb/>
            detective3 and eversive.</p>
          <p>[50.] It does not however lie hid from us, that some assert <lb/>
            that dialogues differ in another manner. For they say that <lb/>
            some are dramatic, and some of a narrative, and others of a <lb/>
            mixed kind. But such persons have designated the difference <lb/>
            in dialogues by a name rather after the manner of tragic <lb/>
            writers, than of philosophers.</p>
          <p>Now of the physical kind there is the Timæus; of the <lb/>
            logical, the Statesman, and Cratylus, and Parmenides, and the <lb/>
            Sophist. But of the moral, the Apology, and Crito, and <lb/>
            Phædo, and Phædrus, and the Banquet, and Menexenus, and <lb/>
            Clitophon, and the Letters,4 and Philebus, Hipparchus, (and) <lb/>
            the Rivals. But of the political, the Republic and Laws, and <lb/>
            Minos and the Epinomis, and the Atlantic.5 [51.] Of the <lb/>
            maieutic, the two Alcibiades, Theages, Lysis, (and) Laches; <lb/>
            of the tentative, Euthyphron, Meno, Ion, Charmides, (and) <lb/>
            Theætetus; of the detective one,6 the Protagoras ; and of the <lb/>
            eversive, the Euthydemus, the two Hippias, (and) Gorgias. <lb/>
            Thus much then suffice it to say on the subject of the dia­ <lb/>
            logue, as to what it is, and what are its different kinds.</p>
          <p>But since there is much of factious contention, some assert­ <lb/>
            ing that Plato dogmatizes, and others not, come, let us take a <lb/>
            part in these matters likewise. Now to dogmatize is to lay <note type="footnote"> 1—1 By this version an English reader will have the best idea of what <lb/>

            Now of these, the thing about which there is an opinion, is a <lb/>
            proposition, but the opinion itself is a supposition. Plato <lb/>
            then, on subjects which he comprehends, exhibits his opinions ; <lb/>
            but what is false, he refutes; while on such as are not clear, <lb/>
            he holds back. Now on points, that seem to him (to be true), <lb/>
            he shows himself through four characters, Socrates, Timæus, <lb/>
            the stranger from Athens,1 and the Eleatic stranger.2 These <lb/>
            strangers are not, however, as some imagine, Plato and Par­ <lb/>
            menides, but fictitious characters without a name ; since, while <lb/>
            Plato is detailing what is said by Socrates and Timæus, be is <lb/>
            putting forth his own opinions. But he introduces by name,3 <lb/>
            when convicted of false notions, Thrasymachus, and Callicles, <lb/>
            and Polus and Gorgias, and Protagoras, and Hippias too, and <lb/>
            Euthydemus, and those who are like them. [53.] And while <lb/>
            he is putting together his proofs, he makes use of induction <lb/>
            for the most part; not however in one form, but two-fold. <lb/>
            Now induction is a reasoning that from certain truths (really <lb/>
            existing) 4 infers a truth peculiarly5 similar to itself. Of <lb/>
            this induction there are two kinds; one, according to a con­ <lb/>
            trariety, and the other from consequence. That according <lb/>
            to contrariety is, when about6 the whole answer the con­ <lb/>
            trary to what has been asked shall follow; for example—My <lb/>
            father is either different from, or the same as, your father. If <lb/>
            then your father is different from my father, he would not, as <lb/>
            being different from a'father, be a father. But if he is the <lb/>
            same as my father, he would, as being the same as my father, <lb/>
            be my father. [54.] And again-If man is not an animal, <lb/>
            he would be stone or wood. Now he is not stone or wood. <lb/>
            For he is a thing with life, and is moved by himself. He is <note type="footnote"> This person is introduced in the Laws.

            then an animal. But if he is an animal, so also is a do-,, and <lb/>
            a bull an animal. 1A man then, as being an animal, would <lb/>
            be a do- or bull.1 Now this is the kind of induction accord­ <lb/>
            ing to a contrariety 2and a contest,2 of which Plato makes use, <lb/>
            not to dogmatize, but to confute. But the kind according to <lb/>
            a consequence is likewise two-fold; one demonstrating what <lb/>
            is sought for in part by means of that which exists in part; <lb/>
            the other, rendered credible as a whole by means of that <lb/>
            which is taken as a part. The former is suited for oratory ; <lb/>
            the latter, for logic. For example, in the former it is inquired, <lb/>
            whether this man 3has murdered somebody, a proof being,3 <lb/>
            that he was found at that very time, with blood upon him. <lb/>
            [55.] Now this is the oratorical kind of induction, since the <lb/>
            orator's art is occupied about particulars, not universals. For <lb/>
            it does not make an inquiry about abstract justice, but about <lb/>
            things that are just in a particular point of view; but the <lb/>
            other is dialectical, through the universal being proved4 by <lb/>
            the particulars. For example, it sought whether the soul <lb/>
            is immortal, and whether the living proceed from the dead; <lb/>
            which is shown in the dialogue " On the Soul," through <lb/>
            something universal, (namely,) that opposites proceed from <lb/>
            opposites ; and that the Universal is itself composed of <lb/>
            particulars; for example, that sleeping proceeds from being <lb/>
            awake, and conversely; and that the greater proceeds from <lb/>
            the less, and conversely. Now of this kind has Plato made <lb/>
            use for building up his own notions.</p>
          <p>[56.] And as of old in a tragedy at first the Chorus alone <lb/>
            went through the drama, but afterwards Thespis invented <lb/>
            one actor to enable the Chorus to be at rest, and Æschylus <lb/>
            a second actor, and Sophocles a third, and they thus filled up <lb/>
            the tragedy; so in the case of a philosophical discourse, it <lb/>
            was formerly of one kind, relating to physics; but Socrates <note type="footnote"> 1—1 The Greek is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ε</foreign>і<foreign xml:lang="grc">̎η α̎ν κα</foreign>і<foreign xml:lang="grc">̀ όα̋νθϱζῶον κα</foreign>і<foreign xml:lang="grc">̀ κύων κα</foreign>і<foreign xml:lang="grc">̀ ό βοῦς</foreign>: <lb/>

            added ethics, and Plato dialectics, and he thus worked out <lb/>
            philosophy to an end. But Thrasyllus says that Plato put <lb/>
            forth his dialogues after the manner of the tragic tetralogy; <lb/>
            just as they1 (the tragedians) contended with four dramas, 2at <lb/>
            the Dionysia, the Lenæa, the Panathenæa, and the Chytri;2 <lb/>
            of which the fourth was a satyric drama; and the four were <lb/>
            called a tetralogy. [57.] Now there are, says he, in all fifty-six <lb/>
            genuine dialogues of Plato—the Republic, 3nearly the whole <lb/>
            of which, says Phavorinus in the 2nd book of his " Various <lb/>
            History," is found in the " Opposite Reasonings" of Pro­ <lb/>
            tagoras,3 being divided into ten, and the Laws into twelve, <lb/>
            forming nine tetralogies, the Republic occupying the place of <lb/>
            one book,4 and of one book 5 likewise the Laws. And he lays <lb/>
            down as the first tetralogy, that which embraces a common <lb/>
            argument. For he is desirous of showing of what kind would <lb/>
            be the life of a philosopher. And he adopts for each book a <lb/>
            double title; one derived from a name, and another from the <lb/>
            matter. [58.] In the tetralogy, which is the first, the Euthy­ <lb/>
            phron, or On Holiness, takes the lead; and the dialogue is <lb/>
            tentative; the second is The Apology of Socrates, moral; <lb/>
            the third, Crito, or About what is to be done, moral; the <lb/>
            fourth, Phædon, or About the Soul, moral. The second <lb/>
            tetralogy, in which the Cratylus, or On the Rectitude of <lb/>
            Names, takes the lead, is logical; the Theætetus, or On <lb/>
            Knowledge, tentative; the Sophist, or On the Being, logical; <lb/>
            the Statesman, or On Kingly Power, logical. In the third <lb/>

              express the same thing. For he calls what is perceptible by <lb/>
              the mind, both 5 Entity and Non-entity; Entity, on account <lb/>
              of its being generated; Non-entity, on account of its constant <lb/>
              change; and likewise Idea, as being neither moved nor at <lb/>
              rest; and the Same, and One, and Many.5 And he is ac­ <lb/>
              customed to do the same in the case of more words.</p>
          <p>[65.] The exposition of his reasoning is three-fold. First, <lb/>
            it is requisite to show clearly what is each of the points spoken <lb/>
            of; next, on what account they are spoken of, whether ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the leading notion, or in the portion of a similitude, <lb/>
            and for the building up of the fixed opinion; and thirdly, <lb/>
            whether they are spoken of correctly.</p>
          <p>But, since some marks are placed in his books, come let us <lb/>
            say something about them.</p>
          <p>The X is adopted for (peculiar) words and figures of speech, <lb/>

              was brought to one spot by the deity, who considered order <lb/>
              to be better than disorder.1 [70.] And (he said) that this <lb/>
              existence (of matter) is to be resolved into four elements, <lb/>
              fire, water, air, earth; from which both the world and what <lb/>
              is in it are generated; but that the earth alone is unchange­ <lb/>
              able, assigning as a reason, the difference in the forms, of which <lb/>
              it is composed; for of all the others he says the forms are <lb/>
              homogenous; for they are all composed from one 2 triangle, <lb/>
              whose sides are longer one than the other;2 but the form of <lb/>
              the earth is peculiar to itself. For the element of fire is <lb/>
              pyramidal; that of air, octohedral ;3 and that of water, eikosi­ <lb/>
              hedral;4 but that of earth, cubical; from whence the earth <lb/>
              neither changes into them, nor they into the earth. [71.] <lb/>
              5 And that each is not separated into its own place; because <lb/>
              the circular movement, by compressing and bringing things <lb/>
              to the centre, causes the small particles to coalesce; but sepa­ <lb/>
              rates the large; from whence the species, as they change them­ <lb/>
              selves, change likewise their places.5 And that the world is <lb/>
              one, (and) generated; since it has been made by the deity, <lb/>
              perceptible by mind; and that it is animated,6 in consequence <lb/>
              of that, which is animated, being superior to that, which is <lb/>
              not animated; and that this is laid down as the workmanship <lb/>
              of the best cause; and that it was made one and not bound­ <lb/>
              less ; because one likewise was the model, by which he fabri­ <lb/>
              cated it. [72.] 7And that it is spherical; because he, who <lb/>
              produced it, has that form; for that (the world) contains the <lb/>
              rest of living beings;7 but this (the deity) the forms of all <lb/>
              things; and that it (the world) is smooth, 8 in a circle, and <lb/>
              possesses no organs,8 on account of there being no use for <lb/>
              them; moreover that the world will continue undestroyed, <note type="footnote"> I See Timæus, p. 30, A. </note><note type="footnote"> 2—2 On this <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόμηκες τρίγωνον</foreign> see Timaeus, p. 54, A. Such a triangle <lb/>

              over that the deity is the cause of the whole of generation; <lb/>
              because the good is naturally the doer of good; and that the <lb/>
              best is the cause of the generation of heaven; for that the <lb/>
              best of things perceived by the mind is the cause of the most <lb/>
              beautiful of things generated; so that, since such is the deity, <lb/>
              heaven is like the best, as being the most beautiful; and it <lb/>
              would be like not one of things generated, but the deity <lb/>
              (alone).2 [73.] And that the world is composed of fire, <lb/>
              water, air, (and) earth; of fire, that it might be visible; and <lb/>
              of earth, that it might be solid; of water and air, that it <lb/>
              might be according to a proportion—3 for the powers of solid <lb/>
              substances have a proportion by two middle terms-so that the <lb/>
              whole might become one3—and that from all together it might <lb/>
              be perfect and undestroyed. And that time is the image of <lb/>
              eternity;4 and that this remains forever; but that time is <lb/>
              the movement of the heaven; for that night, and day, and <lb/>
              month, and all such things, are parts of time ; and hence <lb/>
              5time would not be without the natural movement of the <lb/>
              world;5 for that as soon as 6a movement took place in it,, <lb/>
              time was; and that for the generation of time, the sun and <lb/>
              moon and planets were generated. [74.]7 And that the <lb/>
              number of the seasons might be very plain, and living things <lb/>
              have a share in number, (he says) that the deity lit up the <lb/>
              light of the sun; 8 and that the moon is above the circle of <lb/>

              sides are longer, one than the other, and that, whose two sides <lb/>
              are equal.1 [76.] (He says) then that the principles and <lb/>
              causes are the two mentioned, of which the pattern is god <lb/>
              and matter; which (last) is of necessity without- form, as is <lb/>
              the case with the rest of recipients ; and that the cause of this <lb/>
              proceeds from necessity; for2 (the mind) by receiving some­ <lb/>
              how ideas produces existences; and through an inequality <lb/>
              of power it is moved; and being moved it moves in return <lb/>
              the things moved by that power; and (he says) that these <lb/>
              were moved formerly without reason and order; but, when <lb/>
              they began to constitute the world out of what they received <lb/>
              from the deity, they were moved3 symmetrically and orderly. <lb/>
              [77.] For (he says) there were two causes even before the <lb/>
              creation of heaven, and a third, generation; but not clear, <lb/>
              and only vestiges,4 and without order; but, when the world <lb/>
              had been created, they too received order; and that heaven <lb/>
              was created out of all existing bodies. And it seems to him <lb/>
              that the deity, like the soul, is incorporeal; 5 for thus he is <lb/>
              especially non-receptive of corruption and suffering. And he <lb/>
              lays down, as before stated, ideas, as the causes and principles <lb/>
              of things being constituted by nature such as they are.</p>
          <p>[78.] On the subject of good and evil he said thus-that <lb/>
            the aim should be6 to become like the deity; that virtue is <lb/>
            self-sufficient for happiness ; but that it wants, as instruments, <lb/>

              the wise would be, nevertheless, happy, even if those things <lb/>

              down; and should legislate from events, as they arise, for his <lb/>

            from whence he was considered by some to be rather in­ <lb/>
            clined to fables, by his mixing up accounts of this kind <lb/>
            with his writings, in -order that, through the uncertainty of <lb/>
            the manner, in which matters stand after death, persons may <lb/>
            thus be restrained from acts of injustice. These then were <lb/>
            his favourite notions.</p>
          <p>[80. ] 1 And he divided, says Aristotle,2 things in this man­ <lb/>
            ner. Of the good some relate to the soul, some to the body, <lb/>
            and some are externals. For example, justice, prudence, <lb/>
            fortitude, and temperance, and things of this kind relate to <lb/>
            the soul; but beauty, and a good habit, and health, to the <lb/>
            body; but friends, and the happiness of one's country, and <lb/>
            wealth, are amongst externals. [81.] 3Of good things then <lb/>
            there are three kinds; some relating to the soul, some to <lb/>
            the body, and some (are) external.3 Of friendship there are <lb/>
            three kinds; one natural, another social, and another hos­ <lb/>
            pitable. Now by natural we mean that, which parents feel <lb/>
            towards their offspring, and relations towards each other ; <lb/>
            and in this other animals likewise have a share; by social <lb/>
            that, which is produced from habitual intercourse, and not at <lb/>
            all connected by family-ties, such as that between Pylades and <lb/>
            Orestes; but the friendship from hospitality is that from a <lb/>
            meeting together, and carried on by means of writings4 to <lb/>
            strangers. Of friendship then there is the natural, the social, <lb/>
            and hospitable. But some add a fourth, the amorous.</p>
          <p>[82.] Of a political state there are five kinds; 5 one is de­ <lb/>
            mocratical; another, aristocratical; a third, oligarchical; a <lb/>
            fourth, regal; (and) a fifth, tyrannical. The democratical <lb/>
            exists in states, when the people rule, and choose through <note type="footnote"> 1 This section begins in Menage's ed. with ö<foreign xml:lang="grc">θεν</foreign>v <foreign xml:lang="grc">κ</foreign>ai—a little above. </note><note type="footnote"> 8 This analysis of the doctrines of Plato is not, says Aldobrandinus, to <lb/>

            itself magistracies and laws. The aristocratical is, when <lb/>
            neither the rich, nor the poor, nor persons in repute, rule, but <lb/>
            when the best possess power in the stated Oligarchy is, <lb/>
            when magistracies are elected from persons of property; for <lb/>
            the rich are fewer than the poor. Of regal power there is <lb/>
            one kind according to law, and another according to family; <lb/>
            as at Carthage it is according to law; for that is a citizen- <lb/>
            state ; but at Lacedæmon and Macedonia2 it is according to <lb/>
            family; for they make a kingly power from a certain family. <lb/>
            But a tyranny is, when persons, 3 after being cheated or <lb/>
            forced,3 are ruled over by some one. Of a political state <lb/>
            then there is the form of a democracy, an aristocracy, an <lb/>
            oligarchy, a kingly rule, and a tyranny.</p>
          <p>[83.] 4 Of justice there are three kinds; 5 one relating to the <lb/>
            gods, another to men, and another to the departed. For they, <lb/>
            who sacrifice according to the laws, and have a regard for <lb/>
            holy things, it is plain, act piously towards the gods; and <lb/>
            they, who pay debts and restore deposits, act justly towards <lb/>
            men; while they, who have a regard for monuments,5 it is <lb/>
            plain, (act justly)6 towards the departed. Of justice then <lb/>
            there is a kind relating to the gods, another to men, and <lb/>
            another to the departed.</p>
          <p>[84.] Of sciences there are three kinds; 7one relating to <lb/>
            the power to do something, another to make something, and <lb/>
            another to speculate on something.7 For house-building and <lb/>
            ship-building are sciences that make something ; for one can <lb/>
            see the work done; but the sciences of statesmanship, and of <lb/>
            playing on the pipe or harp, and such like, are those that do <lb/>

            seen.8 For one is playing the pipe, another the harp, and <lb/>
            another the part of a statesman. But the sciences of geome­ <lb/>
            try, harmony, and astrology1 are speculative; for they neither <lb/>
            do any thing, nor make any thing; but one speculates, as a <lb/>
            geometrician, how lines are with respect to each other; an­ <lb/>
            other, as a harmonist, (speculates) on sounds; and the other, <lb/>
            as an astrologer, on the stars and the world. 2 Of sciences then <lb/>
            some are speculative, others relating to doing, and others to <lb/>
            making.2</p>
          <p>[85.] Of medical science there are five kinds ;3 the phar­ <lb/>
            maceutic, the chirurgic,4 the dietetic, the nosognomic, and the <lb/>
            boethetic. The pharmaceutic cures illness by drugs; the <lb/>
            chirurgic restores health by cutting and burning; the dietetic <lb/>
            -produces a change in disorders by a change of diet; the <lb/>
            nosognomic by knowing the characters of the disease; and <lb/>
            the boethetic, by assisting on the instant, gives a relief from <lb/>
            pain. Of the medical science then there is the pharmaceutic, <lb/>
            the chirurgic, the dietetic, 5the boethetic, and the noso­ <lb/>
            gnomic.5</p>
          <p>[86.] Of law there are two divisions; one written, the <lb/>
            other unwritten. That, by which we act the statesman in <lb/>
            cities, is the written; but that, which exists according to <lb/>
            custom, is called the unwritten. For instance, there is no <lb/>
            law to prevent our going naked to the public place of meeting, <lb/>
            or putting on female attire; and yet we do not do such acts, <lb/>
            through being prevented by an unwritten law. Of law then <lb/>
            there is the written and the unwritten.</p>

            litical; and there is another division of speeches, such as <lb/>
            orators write and bring forward as a display, for the purpose <lb/>
            of praise, or blame, or accusation. Now this kind is the <lb/>
            oratorical. And there is a third division, when private per­ <lb/>
            sons converse with each other. Now this is called the private <lb/>
            kind. And there is another division, when persons, by put­ <lb/>
            ting questions and giving answers to the questioners, con­ <lb/>
            verse in a brief manner. Now this is called the dialectical. <lb/>
            The fifth division is, when artists converse with each other <lb/>
            about their own art. Now this is called artistical. Of speeches <lb/>
            then there is the political, the oratorical, the private, the <lb/>
            dialectical, and the artistical.</p>
          <p>[88.] Musical science is divided into three kinds: one is <lb/>
            by the mouth alone, such as singing; the second by means of- <lb/>
            the mouth and hands, such as playing on, and singing to, the <lb/>
            harp ; the third is by means of the hands alone, such as harp­ <lb/>
            playing. Of musical science then there is one kind by the <lb/>

            by the hands.</p>
          <p>[89.]1 Nobility2 of birth is divided into four kinds: one <lb/>
            is, when the ancestors were 3persons of a beautiful (body) <lb/>
            and of a fine (mind),3 4and just4 persons say that their de­ <lb/>
            scendants are nobly born; another is, when the ancestors pos­ <lb/>

            wise persons call nobly born; and another, when the ancestors <lb/>
            obtained a name, for instance, from generalship, (or)5 contests, <lb/>
            6 crowned with garlands,6 the descendants of these likewise <lb/>
            we call nobly born; and there is another kind, when a man is <lb/>
            himself of a noble soul [and of a great soul]. 7 And this <lb/>

            kind derived from ancestors of probity; another from those <lb/>
            in power ; another from those in great repute; and another <lb/>
            from a person's own greatness of soul.2</p>
          <p>[89.]3 Beauty is divided into three4 kinds; one is that, <lb/>
            which is a subject of praise, as the beauty of form, (per­ <lb/>
            ceived) by the sight; another, as an object of utility, as any <lb/>
            instrument or dwelling, and such like things, beautiful in <lb/>
            respect to their use; and things, which, as regards laws and <lb/>
            pursuits, and such like, are beautiful on the ground of a bene­ <lb/>
            fit. Of beauty then there is one kind on the score of praise ; <lb/>
            another, on that of utility; and another, on that of benefit.</p>
          <p>[90.] The soul is divided into three parts; for one part <lb/>
            is rational; another, concupiscible; and another, irascible. <lb/>
            Of these the rational is the cause of consulting, and calculat­ <lb/>
            ing, and reflecting, and of all such like acts; the concupiscible <lb/>
            part of the soul is the cause of desiring to eat, and of having <lb/>
            sexual intercourse, and of such like acts; and the irascible part <lb/>
            is the cause of feeling boldness, and joy, and sorrow, and <lb/>
            anger. Of the soul then there is one part, rational; another, <lb/>
            concupiscible ; and another, irascible.</p>
          <p>[91.]6 Of perfect virtue there are four7 kinds ; one, pru­ <lb/>
            dence; another, justice; the third, fortitude; the fourth, <lb/>
            temperance. Of these, prudence is the cause of doing things <lb/>
            correctly; justice, of acting justly in our intercourse and <lb/>
            dealings with (each other); fortitude, of not being out of our <lb/>
            wits 8 in dangers and things of dread, but remaining (in them); <lb/>
            and temperance, of mastering our desires, and of not being <note type="footnote"> 1 Menage aptly compares Juvenal's " Nobilitas sola est atque unica <lb/>

          <p>[92.]1 Ruling power is divided inio five kinds; one, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to law ; one, according to nature; and one, according <lb/>
            to custom; a fourth, according to family; and a fifth, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to violence. The rulers then in states, when they have <lb/>
            been chosen by the citizens, rule according to law. They, <lb/>
            who rule according to nature, not only amongst men, but <lb/>
            animals likewise, are the males; for the males for the most <lb/>
            part rule every where the females. The rule according to <lb/>
            custom is of such a kind, as boy-leaders have over children, <lb/>
            and teachers over their disciples.2 The rule according to <lb/>
            family is of such a kind, as the kings at Lacedæmon3 possess ; <lb/>
            4for the kingly power comes from a certain family;4 and <lb/>
            after the same manner persons bear sway in Macedonia; for <lb/>
            there the kingly power is appointed from a family. But if <lb/>
            persons rule over unwilling 5 citizens by violence, or over will­ <lb/>
            ing by fraud,5 a rule of this kind is said to be according to <lb/>
            violence. Of rule then there is one kind according to law; <lb/>
            another, according to nature; another, according to family; <lb/>
            and another, according to violence.</p>
          <p>[93.] Of oratory there are six kinds. For when (speakers) <lb/>
            bid (a state)6 to make war against, or alliance with, any one, <lb/>
            such a kind is called a drawing-on ; but when they require it <lb/>
            not to make war or an alliance, but to keep quiet, such a kind <lb/>
            is a drawing-off. The third kind of oratory is, when a per­ <lb/>
            son says he has been injured by some one, and shows such a <lb/>
            one to have been the cause of many evils. Now this kind is <lb/>
            called an accusation. The fourth kind of oratory is called a <lb/>
            defence, when a person shows he has injured no one,7 nor <note type="footnote"> 1 This section begins in Menage's ed. a little below, with ot <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέ</foreign>v ovv— </note><note type="footnote"> 2 In Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τω̃ν φ</foreign>l<foreign xml:lang="grc">τώντων</foreign>, literally, " those who go them."

            a defence. The fifth kind of oratory is, when one shows a <lb/>
            person to be of a beautiful (body) and of fine (mind). Now <lb/>
            this kind is called a praising. The sixth kind, is when one <lb/>
            shows a person to be ill-favoured On body and mind). Now <lb/>
            this is called a blaming. There are then of oratory one kind, <lb/>
            1 a praising; another, a blaming; another, a drawing-on; <lb/>
            another, a drawing-off; another, an accusation; and another, <lb/>
            a defence.1</p>
          <p>[94.] 2 To speak correctly is divided into four kinds; one <lb/>
            is, to speak what is requisite; and one, to speak how much is <lb/>
            requisite; the third, to speak to whom it is requisite; and the <lb/>
            fourth, to speak when it is requisite. 3 As to what is requi­ <lb/>
            site, it is meet to speak, what is about to benefit the speaker <lb/>
            and hearer. As to how much is requisite, to speak neither <lb/>
            more nor less than what is sufficient. As to whom it is re­ <lb/>
            quisite to speak, if (a person) addresses his elders in error,4 it <lb/>
            is meet to address fitting language (to them) as (being) older; <lb/>
            but if younger persons, it is meet to address fitting (language <lb/>
            to them) as being younger. 5 As to when it is requisite, it is <lb/>
            meet5 to speak neither before nor after 6 (it is fitting); 6 or <lb/>
            else 7 that he will be in error and speak ill.7</p>
          <p>[95.]8 Kindness is divided into four (forms). For (it is <lb/>

            nature, (such as) a day, and a year, and the seasons. Things <lb/>
            have an end according to art, as house-building; for a person <lb/>
            puts the finish to a dwelling; and as ship-building, for 2(a <lb/>
            person puts the finish to)2 vessels. There is an end to things <lb/>
            according to accident; when they turn out in a different <lb/>

            and wealth; and another, in doing and suffering.</p>
          <p>[98.] Of philanthropy there are three kinds; one exists <lb/>
            by being of an easy address,2 as when some persons accost all <lb/>
            they happen to meet, 3and, throwing out the right hand, give <lb/>
            them a greeting ;3 another kind is, when a person affords as­ <lb/>
            sistance to every one in misfortune; another kind 4 [of phi­ <lb/>
            lanthropy]4 is, when persons are liberal in feastings. Of <lb/>
            philanthropy then there is one kind, in addressing; another, <lb/>
            in acting kindly; and another, in feasting and being fond of <lb/>
            society.</p>
          <p>[99.]5 Felicity is divided into five parts. One is in well <lb/>
            planning; another, in a sound state of the senses, and in <lb/>
            bodily health; the third is in good fortune in one's doings; <lb/>
            the fourth in a good repute amongst men ; and the fifth in an <lb/>
            abundance of means, and of things useful for life. (Of these) <lb/>
            well-planning comes from instruction and from being skilled <lb/>
            in many matters; a sound state of the senses from the mem­ <lb/>
            bers of the body, as when a person sees with his eyes, and <lb/>
            hears with his ears, and perceives with his nose and mouth, <lb/>
            what he should perceive. Now a thing of this kind is a <lb/>
            sound state of the senses. And good fortune is, 6 when a <lb/>
            person proceeds in the right road to what he is aiming at, and <lb/>
            accomplishes,6 what it is meet for a man, who is in earnest, <lb/>
            to do. And good repute is, when a person hears himself well <lb/>
            spoken of. And abundance of means is, when a person is so <lb/>
            situated with respect to the use of things in life, that he can <lb/>
            benefit friends and indulge in expense on a large scale and in <lb/>
            an easy manner. Now he, in whom all these circumstances <lb/>
            meet, is completely happy. Of felicity then, well-planning is <note type="footnote"> 1 Such is the literal meaning of <foreign xml:lang="grc">στρατόπεονδ</foreign>. But it is sometimes <lb/>

          <p>[100.] Arts are divided into three (kinds), first, second, <lb/>
            and third. The first is, that of mining for minerals, and of <lb/>
            felling wood; for they are preparative: (the second)1 is that <lb/>
            of the smith and carpenter; for they are shape-giving; since <lb/>
            from iron the smith forms arms, and from wood the carpenter <lb/>
            pipes and lyres: and (the third)2 is that of -the party using <lb/>
            materials, as the horseman makes use of reins; the warrior <lb/>
            of arms ; and the musician of pipes and a lyre. Of art then <lb/>
            there are three kinds; that, which is the first; that, which is <lb/>
            the second ; and that, which is the third.</p>
          <p>[101.] The good is divided into four kinds. One of which <lb/>
            we say is in a person possessing virtue, peculiarly a good; <lb/>
            another we speak of, as being a good in itself, namely, virtue <lb/>
            and justice; (we speak) of the third, as, for example, food, <lb/>
            and suitable exercise, and drugs; the fourth good we say is <lb/>
            such a thing, as the art of the piper, and of the actor, and <lb/>
            such like. Of the good then there are four kinds; one, to <lb/>
            possess virtue; another is, virtue itself; a third is, food, and <lb/>
            useful exercise; and a fourth good we say is, the art of the <lb/>
            piper, and actor, and poet.3</p>
          <p>[102.] Of existing things some are bad, some good, and <lb/>
            some neither one or the other. Of these we say those are <lb/>
            bad, which are able to do ever a mischief, such as intemper­ <lb/>
            ance, and thoughtlessness, and injustice, and such like things. <lb/>
            But the opposites to these are good. 4But some things are <lb/>
            able at one time to benefit, and at another to do a mischief, as <lb/>
            to walk, and to sit down, and to eat; or wholly unable to either <lb/>
            benefit or hurt; and these are neither good nor bad.4 Of ex­ <lb/>
            isting things then, some are good, some bad, and some neither <lb/>
            the one or the other.</p>
          <p>[103.] A good state of law is divided into three kinds; one, <lb/>
            when the laws are 5 carefully made,5 we say is a good state of <note type="footnote"> 1 I have supplied here and in 2 the words that seem necessary for the <lb/>

            law; another, when the citizens abide by the laws laid down ; <lb/>
            and this we say is a good state of law ; the third, when, al­ <lb/>
            though there are not laws, yet persons conduct themselves <lb/>
            correctly as citizens, according to custom and (proper) pur­ <lb/>
            suits ; and this we call a good state of law. Of a good state <lb/>
            of law then, one kind is, that laws be carefully made; another, <lb/>
            that persons abide by existing laws ; and a third, when they <lb/>
            conduct themselves as citizens according to custom and proper <lb/>
            pursuits.</p>
          <p>A bad state of law is divided into three kinds ; one of which <lb/>
            is, when the laws are bad, as regards 1 strangers and citizens ;1 <lb/>
            another, when persons do not obey the existing (laws); and <lb/>
            another, when there is no law at all. Of a bad state of law <lb/>
            then, one kind is in there being bad laws; another, in per­ <lb/>
            sons not obeying those that exist; and a third, in there being <lb/>
            no law.</p>
          <p>[104.]2 Opposites are divided into three kinds-as we say <lb/>
            that good things are opposite to bad; and3 justice to injustice, <lb/>
            and prudence to imprudence, and such like; and that bad <lb/>
            things likewise are opposite to bad, (such as) prodigality to <lb/>
            illiberality,4 and the being unjustly put on the rack to being <lb/>
            treated so justly; and such like 5 [bad things are the opposite <lb/>
            to bad];5 6 and some, as being neither the one nor the other, <lb/>
            are opposite to those, that are neither the one nor the other, <lb/>
            as for instance, the being poor to the being rich; for each by <lb/>
            itself is neither good nor bad; and similarly opposite is light <lb/>
            to heavy, and quick to slow.6 Of opposites then, some things, <note type="footnote"> 1—1 The strangers are here strangely mentioned before the citizens. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This section begins in Menage's ed. with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕτερον δὲ, ἐὰν</foreign>— a little <lb/>

            and health; those to be shared are, as many as it is not pos­ <lb/>
            sible to have, but of which it is possible to have a share; for <lb/>
            instance, it is not possible to have the good itself, but it is pos­ <lb/>
            sible to have a share of it; and those (meet) to be in existence <lb/>
            are as many as it is not possible either to have a share of them <lb/>
            or to have, but as many as are meet to be in existence; for <lb/>
            example, to be earnest in a matter and just: now these things <lb/>

            and one without life ; that with life is of living beings, that <lb/>
            without life is sounds and noises. Of voice with life one kind <lb/>
            is expressed by letters, and one not expressed by letters. That <lb/>
            expressed by letters is of men ; that not expressed by letters is <lb/>
            of animals. 3 Of voice then there is one with life, and one <lb/>
            without life.3</p>
          <p>[108.]4 Of existing things, some are divisible and some <lb/>
            indivisible. And of the divisible, some are with similar <lb/>
            parts, some with dissimilar parts. Now the indivisible are <lb/>
            as many as have no division, or are not composed of some­ <lb/>
            thing ; as for instance, unity, a point, and a sound; but the <lb/>
            divisible are as many as are composed of something; as for <lb/>
            instance, syllables, and concords, and animals, and watery <lb/>
            and gold. Now those with similar parts are as many as are <lb/>
            composed of similar things, and where the whole differs in <lb/>
            nothing from the part, except in multitude; as for instance, <lb/>

            <title type="main">THB LIFE OF PLATO, BY HESYCHIUS OF MILETUS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>PLATO the philosopher is said to have never undergone even <lb/>
            once the marriage-state or sexual intercourse. And they say <lb/>
            that his mother became pregnant from a divine vision when <lb/>
            Apollo appeared to her; but when she had brought forth <lb/>
            Plato, that then her husband cohabited with her. and that <lb/>
            being with 1 broad shoulders or face he was called Plato ;1 but <lb/>
            some assert that he was so called from being 2broad in his <lb/>
            discourses.2 Hence Timon, while ridiculing him, says in his <lb/>
            Farcical verses-</p>
          <p>The broadest man led all, but with sweet voice <lb/>
            He talk'd, the picture of the Tettix kind, <lb/>
            That settling on the trees of Hecademus, <lb/>
            Their pleasant note pour forth-</p>
          <p>For the spot, which (is now) Academia, was formerly called <lb/>
            Hecademia. He made for himself a mingling of the doctrines <lb/>
            of Heracleitus, Pythagoras, and Socrates. For on things, <lb/>
            perceptible by the senses, he philosophized according to <lb/>
            Heracleitus; on those, perceptible by mind, according to <lb/>
            Pythagoras; but on those, relating to politics, according to <lb/>
            Socrates. He was likewise much indebted to Epicharmus. <lb/>
            For Epicharmus3 says—“ The wise assert that the soul per­ <lb/>
            ceives some things through the body; as, for example, by <note type="footnote"> 1—1 To understand this remark the reader should bear in mind that <lb/>
            the Greek for " broad " is <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλατ-υς</foreign>, a word very similar to <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλατ-ων</foreign>, </note><note type="footnote"> 2—2 If my emendation of <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰρωνείας</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑρμηνείας</foreign>, in Diogen.

            hearing and seeing; but on other things it reflects itself by <lb/>
            itself, without making any use of the body: and hence, of the <lb/>
            things that exist, some are perceptible by the senses, and <lb/>
            some by the mind." On which account Plato has said that it <lb/>
            is requisite for those, who desire to look into the principles of <lb/>
            the Universe, to separate, in the first place, ideas, themselves <lb/>
            by themselves, such as similitude, and unity, and number, <lb/>
            and magnitude, and rest, and motion: secondly, to lay down <lb/>
            itself by itself, beauty, and goodness, and justice, and such <lb/>
            kind of things : and, thirdly, to look into such of the ideas as <lb/>
            have a relation to each other, to wit, science, or magnitude, or <lb/>
            arbitrary power, and to consider that what are with us have <lb/>
            the same name as those, through their participating in them- <lb/>
            I mean, that things are just, such as (participate in) the ab­ <lb/>
            stractedly just; and are beautiful, such as (participate in) the <lb/>
            abstractedly beautiful; and that each of the species is eternal, <lb/>
            and a notion,1 and, moreover, not subject to circumstances. <lb/>
            Hence he says likewise that ideas exist2 in nature, as if they <lb/>
            were patterns; and that the rest of things are like to them, <lb/>
            as being their resemblances. Epicharmus too thus expresses <lb/>
            himself touching the abstractedly good, and ideas- <lb/>
            Seems not the case then to be thus about <lb/>
            The good ? that of itself it is a thing; <lb/>
            And he, who learning knows it, good becomes; <lb/>
            Just as a piper, who has learnt to pipe, <lb/>
            Or to dance has'a dancer learnt, or some <lb/>
            Weaver to weave, or what you will of trades <lb/>
            Like these, himself's the artist, not the art. <lb/>
            Plato accompanied Chabrias, the general, on trial for a capital <lb/>
            charge, when not one of the citizens was willing to do so; <lb/>
            and when Crobylus the informer met him as he was going up, <lb/>
            together with Chabrias, to the Acropolis, and said—“ Art <lb/>
            thou come to plead on the side of another, not knowing that <lb/>
            the hemlock of Socrates awaits thee ? he replied—“ When too <lb/>
            I served in the army for the sake of fatherland, I endured <lb/>
            dangers ; and now for the sake of duty on account of a friend <lb/>
            I will endure them." But though he was such a kind of <note type="footnote"> 1 Although <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόημα</foreign> is found both here and in Diogen. L. § 13, yet one <lb/>

            person, he was nevertheless scoffed at by the writers of <lb/>
            comedy. At least Theopompus says- <lb/>
            For one is none, <lb/>
            And two, as Plato holds, is scarcely one; <lb/>
            and Anaxandrides too in his “ Theseus ”— <lb/>
            When olives he devoured, that Plato loves ; <lb/>
            and Timon likewise, while thus playing on the letters (of his <lb/>
            name)— <lb/>
            As Plato plaits, in plaited wonders skill'd. <lb/>
            Alexis in " Meropis "— <lb/>
            Thou'rt come in time ; since I, in doubtings tost, <lb/>
            Am walking up and down, and, Plato-like, <lb/>
            Find nought that's wise, but merely tire my feet; <lb/>
            and in " Ancylion "—</p>
          <p>A. Thou speak'st of what thou knowest not one jot.</p>
          <p>B. Mind has with Plato been a-running.</p>
          <p>A. Know'st thou, <lb/>
            What is a pound, and onions what ?</p>

          <p>On questions which he comprehended, Plato exhibits his <lb/>
            opinions; and falsehoods he confutes; but on points that are <lb/>
            uncertain he holds back. And what he has made up his mind <lb/>
            upon, he exhibits by means of four characters, Socrates, <lb/>
            Timæus 1 the Athenian Guest, and the one from Elea;1 but <lb/>
            amongst those confuted for falsehoods he introduces Thra­ <lb/>
            symachus, Callicles, Polus, (and) Gorgias. He asserted that <lb/>
            the principle of the soul was arithmetical, but of the body, <lb/>
            geometrical; and he defined it to be an idea of a breath stand­ <lb/>

          <p>COME then, let us speak of the family of the philosopher, <lb/>
            not for the sake of prolixity,1 but of benefit rather and in­ <lb/>
            struction to those, who betake themselves to him. For he <lb/>
            was not “ a Nobody,"2 but rather- <lb/>
            3 To many of mankind he was a care.3 <lb/>
            For Plato is said to have been a son of his father Ariston, the <lb/>
            son of Aristocles, from whom he carried up his family to So­ <lb/>
            lon, the law-giver; and hence he wrote, in imitation of his <lb/>
            ancestor, the Laws in twelve books, and a Political Constitu­ <lb/>
            tion in eleven.4 He came into the world by his mother Pe­ <lb/>
            rictioné, who was descended from Neleus, the son of Codrus.5 <lb/>
            For they say that Apollo in a vision had an intercourse with <lb/>
            his mother Perictioné, and, appearing in the night to Ariston, <lb/>
            ordered him to have no connexion with Perictione until the <lb/>
            time of her bringing forth.6 And so he acted. And his pa- <note type="footnote"> 1 I have adopted <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολυηκοἴας</foreign>, suggested by Windet, instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολυηκοἴας</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Here is an allusion to the name <foreign xml:lang="grc">Οὖτις</foreign>, assumed by Ulysses to enable <lb/>

            rents taking him after his birth, and when he was still an <lb/>
            infant, placed him on Mount Hymettus, intending to make a <lb/>
            sacrifice to the deities there, namely, Pan, and the Nymphs, <lb/>
            and Apollo, who presides over shepherds. But while he was <lb/>
            lying there, bees came and filled his mouth with honey from <lb/>
            the comb, in order that it might be said1 truly of him— <lb/>
            2 From his mouth flow'd a voice than honey far <lb/>
            More sweet.2 <lb/>
            And he calls himself 3on every side and a fellow-slave with <lb/>
            the swans, as if he had proceeded4 from Apollo; for the bird <lb/>
            belongs to Apollo. In early life he first went as a pupil to <lb/>
            Dionysius the grammar-master, to learn the common course of <lb/>
            instruction, of whom he has made mention in the Rivals, in <lb/>
            order that Dionysius might not be without a share of remem­ <lb/>
            brance on the part of Plato. After him he made use of <lb/>
            Ariston the Argive, as his master in gymnastics, by whom, <lb/>
            as they say, his name was changed into Plato, having been <lb/>
            previously called Aristocles, after his grandfather; and he <lb/>
            was called Plato, from his having two parts of his body very <lb/>
            wide, namely, his breast and forehead, as his likeness proves, <lb/>
            put up every where with such a representation. But others <lb/>
            assert that it was not for this reason his name was changed, <lb/>
            but on account of the breadth, and diffuseness, and openness <lb/>
            of the style adopted5 by him; just as they say that Theo­ <lb/>
            phrastus, who was previously called Tyrtamus, had his name <lb/>
            changed to 6 Theophrastus on account of the divine nature of <note type="footnote"> 1 In lieu of <foreign xml:lang="grc">γένηται</foreign>, the sense evidently requires <foreign xml:lang="grc">λέγηται</foreign>— what I <lb/>

              for themselves; but grammar, to embellish the language, <lb/>

              Now that Plato exercised himself in Dithyrambics is evident <lb/>
              from the Phædrus, a dialogue that breathes very much5 of a <lb/>
              dithyrambic style; inasmuch as Plato wrote, as reported, that <lb/>
              dialogue the first. He took likewise great delight in Aris­ <lb/>
              tophanes, the comic writer, and in Sophron; from whom he <lb/>
              benefited in his imitation of the characters in his dialogues. <lb/>
              And he is reported to have been so delighted, that, when he <lb/>
              was dead, (copies of) Aristophanes and Sophron were found <lb/>
              on his couch; and he made himself this epigram upon Aris­ <lb/>

              the Banquet, as having derived some benefit in the style of <lb/>
              comedy. For after making him hymn the god of Love, he <lb/>

              And a certain Anatolius, a grammarian, on speaking (again)2 <lb/>
              the verse, was in some repute with Hephæstus, who had been <lb/>
              appointed governor of the city;3 for he said to him4— <lb/>
              Come here, Hephæstus, Pharus needs thy aid. <lb/>
              They say, moreover, that when Socrates was about to receive <lb/>
              him (as a disciple), he saw, as a vision in a dream, that a swan <lb/>
              without wings had settled on his knees ; and, becoming fledged <lb/>

              sweet, that he enchanted all who heard it; and this indicated <lb/>
              the future fame of the man. But after the death of Socrates, <lb/>
              he again5 made use of Cratylus, one of the sect of Heraclei­ <lb/>

              that name, inscribing it " Cratylus, or On the Correctness of <lb/>

            when he was at Syracuse with Dionysius the Great, he en­ <lb/>
            deavoured to change the tyranny there into an aristocracy; <lb/>
            for which purpose he had gone to him (Dionysius); and on <lb/>
            the latter inquiring of him—Whom do you think amongst <lb/>
            men is happy ? fancying forsooth that the philosopher would, <lb/>
            out of flattery, say that he was, Plato answered that (he <lb/>
            thought) Socrates was. (And when) Dionysius asked him <lb/>
            again-What do you consider as the business of a statesman ? <lb/>
            Plato replied-To make the citizens better. (And when) he <lb/>
            asked a third time-What then ? Does it seem to you a little <lb/>
            thing to act the judge correctly ?-for Dionysius had a reputa­ <lb/>
            tion for acting the judge correctly—Plato replied,1 not lowering <lb/>
            his sail1 a jot—It is indeed a little thing, and of a statesman 2 <lb/>
            the farthest portion ; for they, who act the judge correctly, are <lb/>
            like the menders of cloth, who weave up again torn garments. <lb/>
            (And when) he asked a fourth time-What is it, think you,3 <lb/>
            to be a tyrant ? Is it not a brave thing ? Plato replied-Of <lb/>
            all the most cowardly; since 4he fears even the razor4 of the <lb/>
            barber, lest he should lose his life by it. Whereupon Dio­ <lb/>
            nysius, being greatly annoyed, ordered him, while the sun was <lb/>
            still above the earth, 5 to take himself off from Syracuse; and <lb/>
            thus was Plato with dishonour5 driven out of Syracuse.</p>
          <p>Of his second journey to Sicily the reason was this. <lb/>
            After the death of Dionysius the Great, Dionysius, the son of <lb/>
            Dionysius, succeeded to the kingdom, having Dion for his <lb/>
            uncle, who had been a familiar acquaintance of Plato during <lb/>
            his first journey. Dion therefore writes to him (saying) that <lb/>
            -" If you were now present, there would be6 a hope of <lb/>
            changing the tyranny into an aristocracy." For this purpose <lb/>
            then, when he had made a second journey, he was falsely ac­ <lb/>
            cused by the spear-bearing attendants upon Dionysius, how <lb/>
            that he was plotting to make over the government to Dion, <note type="footnote">1__1 Such is the exact meaning of <foreign xml:lang="grc">μηδὲν</foreign> , similar to <lb/>

            and to depose Dionysius; when being overpowered, he was <lb/>
            by Dionysius delivered over to Pollis of Ægina, who was <lb/>
            then trading with Sicily, to be sold. And he carrying Plato <lb/>
            to Ægina, found there Anniceris, the Libyan, who was about <lb/>
            to sail to Elis for the purpose of entering the contest with a <lb/>
            four-horsed car; and meeting with Pollis, he purchased Plato <lb/>
            from him, having bought1 this glory, superior to all the vic­ <lb/>
            tory of a four-horsed car; respecting whom Aristides2 says <lb/>
            that no one would have known 3 Anniceris, if he had not <lb/>
            purchased Plato.</p>
          <p>Of his third journey to Sicily this was the motive. Dion, <lb/>
            after being proscribed by Dionysius and deprived of his pro­ <lb/>
            perty, was thrown into prison. He writes therefore to Plato, <lb/>
            that Dionysius had promised to release him, if Plato would <lb/>
            come to him again; when he readily undertook this third <lb/>
            journey to assist his friend. And thus much on the travels of <lb/>
            the philosopher to Sicily.</p>
          <p>It should be known likewise that he went to Egypt to the <lb/>
            men of the priesthood there, and learnt from them the science <lb/>
            of a priest. Hence he says in the Gorgias—4“No, by the <lb/>
            dog,”—which was a god in Egypt.4 For that, which statues <lb/>
            mean amongst the Greek, animals do amongst the Egyptians, <lb/>
            through being the symbols of each of the gods to whom they <lb/>
            are dedicated. Being desirous, moreover, to meet with the <lb/>
            Magi, but unable to reach them in consequence of a war <lb/>
            raging at that time in Persia, he departed for Phœnicia; and <lb/>
            meeting there with the Magi, he obtained the science of the <lb/>
            Magi; and hence he appears in the Timæus to be skilled in <lb/>
            the art of sacrificing, while speaking of the signs of the liver <lb/>
            and entrails, and such like matters. But this ought to have <lb/>
            been told 6 previous to the statement of the causes of his <lb/>

          <p>On his return to Athens he established a school in the <lb/>
            Academia, by separating a portion of the Gymnasium for a <lb/>
            grove sacred to the Muses; and there Timon, the man-hater, <lb/>
            associated with Plato alone. Very many persons did he <lb/>
            attract to learning, both men and women in male attire, by <lb/>
            preparing them to hear him, and showing them that his <lb/>
            philosophy was superior to all love of business. For he <lb/>
            freed himself from the ironyl of Socrates, and from passing <lb/>
            his time 2 in the place of public meeting, and at work-shops,2 <lb/>
            and from composing discourses to catch young persons.3 He <lb/>
            freed himself likewise from the Pythagorean oath,4 about <lb/>
            keeping their doors closed, and the—“He said it,"5 and ex­ <lb/>
            hibited himself more like a citizen to all. 6 After making <lb/>
            many his admirers, and benefiting the most of them,6 when <lb/>
            he was about to die, he had a dream, how that having become <lb/>
            a swan,7 he went from tree to tree, and caused the greatest <lb/>
            trouble to bird-limers. This Simmias, the Socratic philoso­ <lb/>
            pher, expounded (by saying) that he would be not caught by <lb/>
            those, who after him wished to interpret him; for the in­ <lb/>
            terpreters who wanted to catch8 the meaning of the an­ <lb/>
            cients were like bird-limers; and not caught he is; since <lb/>
            one may take his words, like those of Homer, in a sense <lb/>
            physical, moral, ethical, theological, and, (to speak) simply, in <lb/>
            a variety of senses. For these two souls are said to be alto- <note type="footnote"> 1 This seems rather a strange assertion; for the Socratic irony is to be <lb/>

          <p>Philosophy is a longing after wisdom, or a release or with­ <lb/>

            upon pleasures2 with little admiration. It is requisite too for <lb/>
            him, who is about to be a philosopher, to be mentally free. <lb/>

            naturally disposed, as it is4 towards truth and freedom (in <lb/>
            thought)5 and temperance; and there ought to be in addition <lb/>
            an aptitude to learn, and a (good) memory. For these things <lb/>
            form the species of a philosopher. Since these naturally good <lb/>
            qualities, when they meet with a proper education and fitting <lb/>

          <p>Since life is twofold, Contemplative and Active, of the <lb/>

            mind, while it is thinking upon 8 what is perceptible by mind ;8 <lb/>
            but Action is an operation of the rational soul, perfected by <lb/>

            itself of reasoning.</p>
          <p>The perception of things that exist is Contemplative; but <lb/>
            Practical (science) is concerned about things to be done; and <lb/>
            Dialectical about reasoning. Now this last is subdivided into <lb/>
            the Distributive, and the Definitive, and the Inductive, and <lb/>
            the Syllogistic; and this last into the Demonstrative, which <lb/>

            which is concerned about the enthymeme,3 which is called an <lb/>
            imperfect syllogism ; and still further into Sophisms ; 4 which <lb/>
            would not be that, which takes the lead in the eye of the <lb/>
            philosopher, but what is necessary.4</p>
          <p>Of Practical science one part is seen to be concerned <lb/>
            about the care of morals, and another about the regulation of <lb/>
            a household, and another relating to the state, and its safety. <lb/>
            Of these, the first is called Moral; the second, (Economical; <lb/>
            the third, Political. Of the Contemplative one portion, re­ <lb/>
            lating to what is unmoved and the first cause, and such things <lb/>

            and their return to the spot from whence they started, and to <lb/>
            the constitution of this world, is Physical; but another por­ <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin"> c. 4.] </note> Such then being the subdivision and portioning out of the <lb/>
            kinds of philosophy, we must first speak of the Dialectical, as <lb/>
            it is agreeable to the doctrines of Plato; and first of all about <lb/>
            the Judicatory.</p>
          <p>[4.] Respecting the faculty of Judging, and the Judicatory <lb/>
            powers of the soul.</p>
          <p>Since there is that, which judges, and likewise that, which <lb/>
            is judged, there will be also that, which is effected by them, <lb/>
            what a person would call judging. Properly one would call <lb/>
            the act of judging the judging faculty, but more commonly <lb/>
            that which judges. Now this is twofold; one, by which a <lb/>
            thing is judged; the other, through which it is. Of which <lb/>
            the former would be the intellect that is in us; 1 the latter, <lb/>
            the organ,1 that is naturally judicatory, 2acting like a leader <lb/>
            to what is true; but like a follower after what is false. <lb/>
            Now this organ is nothing else than natural reason. And, <lb/>
            as regards things that exist, the philosopher would be called <lb/>
            more clearly a judge, by whom things are judged. But rea­ <lb/>
            son likewise is a judge, through which the truth is judged, <lb/>
            and which we have said is an organ. Now reason is twofold. <lb/>
            One is altogether 3to be not made captive and is accurate; <lb/>
            the other is not to be deceived by falsehoods as regards the <lb/>
            knowledge of things. The former of these can be attained <lb/>
            by god, but not by man; but the latter can be attained by <lb/>
            man likewise. Now this is also twofold ; one is conversant <lb/>
            about things perceptible by mind; the other about things <lb/>
            perceptible by a sense; 4of which the one, conversant about <lb/>
            things perceptible by mind, is Science and Scientific Reason; <lb/>
            but the other, conversant about things perceptible by a sense, <lb/>
            is Opinionative and Opinion.4 From whence the Scientific <lb/>

            by a sense, the principles are Intelligence and Perception. <lb/>
            Now Perception is an affection of the soul, that gives, <lb/>
            like a leader, by means of the body a previous intimation <lb/>
            of a power that has been affected. But when there has <lb/>
            been produced in the soul by means of the organs of sense an <lb/>
            impression according to its sensation, 2[which is a sensation,]2 <lb/>
            then, in order that (the impression) may not be evanescent, <lb/>
            but permanent, 3[and preserved]3 the preservation of it is <lb/>
            called Memory.4 But Opinion is the complication of memory <lb/>
            and sensation. For when we meet for the first time with a <lb/>
            thing perceptible by a sense, and a sensation is produced in <lb/>
            us by it, and from this sensation Memory, and we subse­ <lb/>
            quently meet again with the same thing perceived by a sense, <lb/>
            we combine the memory previously brought into action with <lb/>
            the sensation produced a second time ; and we say within our­ <lb/>
            selves,5 6 as, for instance, say,6 Socrates, (or) a horse, (or) fire, or <lb/>
            whatever thing there may be of such a kind. Now this is <lb/>
            called Opinion through our combining the recollection brought <lb/>
            previously into action with the sensation recently produced. <lb/>
            And when these, placed7 along each other, agree, a true opi­ <lb/>
            nion is produced; but when they 8swerve from each other,8 a <lb/>
            false one. For if a person, having a recollection of Socrates, <lb/>

              which memory and sensation are produced (conjointly),1 Plato2 <lb/>
              likens to an impression on wax ; but when the soul, after re­ <lb/>
              moulding by an exercise of thought the things, which have <lb/>
              been imagined out of sensation and memory, looks upon them, <lb/>
              as upon those, out of which they have been produced, Plato <lb/>
              calls this a painting to the life ;3 and sometimes too a phan­ <lb/>
              tasy. But he calls the exercise of thought a talking4 of the <lb/>
              soul to itself;5 and talking (he says) is a flowing6 from it, <lb/>
              proceeding with a vocal sound through the mouth. Now <lb/>
              Cogitation is an operation of the mind, while contemplating <lb/>
              the first things perceptible by mind. And this seems to be <lb/>
              twofold; one, while it was contemplating things perceptible <lb/>
              by mind, previous to the soul 7 existing in the body ;7 another, <lb/>
              after 8it had been compelled to come into this body. Of <lb/>
              these, one 9 [that contemplated previous to the soul existing <lb/>
              in the body]9 was called Cogitation ;10 but "after it existed <lb/>
              in the body,11 that, which was then called Cogitation, was now <lb/>
              called Physical Thinking, as being a cogitation in a subjec­ <lb/>

              when the soul existed apart from the body, called Cogitation, <lb/>
              but is now Physical Thinking. Now Physical Thinking is <lb/>
              called by him (Plato) both a simple science, and a fledging1 <lb/>
              of the soul; and sometimes, recollection. From these sciences <lb/>
              that are simple, Physical and Scientific Reason, which exists <lb/>
              in Nature, is composed. Since then there is Reason existing, <lb/>
              both Scientific and Opinionative, and there is a Cogitation <lb/>
              existing and Sensation, there are also things, that are subjec­ <lb/>
              tive to them; as for instance, those, that are perceptible by <lb/>
              mind, and those likewise, by a sense.</p>
          <p>Now, since of things perceptible by mind some are primary, <lb/>
            as ideas, and some secondary, as species, which, being (im­ <lb/>
            pressed) on Matter, are inseparable from it, Cogitation is <lb/>
            twofold, one of the primary, and another of the secondary. <lb/>
            And again, since of things perceptible by a sense, some are <lb/>
            primary, as qualities-for instance, colour, whiteness,-but <lb/>
            some according to accident-as white mixed with another <lb/>
            colour,-and, moreover, 2 a congregated mass,2 as fire, honey,­ <lb/>
            so there is sensation, one part of which is of primaries, and <lb/>
            called itself primary; and another of secondaries, (and called) <lb/>
            secondary. Of the primaries, perceptible by mind, Cogitation <lb/>
            judges, not without Scientific Reason, 3by means of a certain <lb/>
            apprehension, and not by a discourse in detail ;3 but of the <lb/>
            secondary, a sense judges not without Opinionative Reason; <lb/>
            but of the congregated mass, Opinionative Reason (judges) not <lb/>
            without a sense. Now since the world, perceptible by mind, <lb/>
            is a primary perceptible, but that, perceptible by a sense, is a <lb/>
            congregated mass, of the world, perceptible by mind, Cogita­ <lb/>
            tion judges, 4together with Reason that is not without rea­ <lb/>
            son ;4 but of that perceptible by a sense Opinionative Reason <lb/>
            (judges) not without a sense.</p>
          <p>Since then there is Contemplation and Action, right reason <lb/>
            does not judge in a similar manner of things, which fall under <lb/>
            Contemplation, and of what are to be done ; but in the case of <lb/>
            Contemplation it looks to the truth, and to what is not in that <note type="footnote"> 1 Here is an allusion to Phædr. p. 249, C. D. </note><note type="footnote"> 2—2 This in modern metaphysics would be called " a concrete sub­ <lb/>

            For by having a natural notion of what is beautiful and good <lb/>
            we make use of reason ; and referring to these natural notions, <lb/>
            as to some determinate standards, we decide, 2 whether any of <lb/>
            these things are in this state or in a different one.2</p>
          <p>[5.] About the Dialectic element and its aim. <lb/>
            The most elementary part of Dialectic Science he deems to <lb/>
            be, first, the looking upon the essence of every thing whatso­ <lb/>
            ever, and then, upon what relates to its accidents. It looks <lb/>
            upon each thing, as it is in itself, either from above, in the <lb/>
            way of Division or Definition, or from below,3 in that of Analy­ <lb/>
            sis ; but on the accidents of, and that which exist in, essences, <lb/>
            (it looks) either from the things contained, through Induction, <lb/>
            or from the things containing, through a Syllogism ; so that, <lb/>
            according to this account, in Dialectical Science there is a <lb/>
            dividing, and a defining, and an analyzing, and, moreover, that <lb/>
            which is inductive and syllogistic. Now the dividing is the <lb/>
            separating a genus into its species, or a whole into its parts; <lb/>
            as when we separate the soul into the rational, and 4 that <lb/>
            affected by circumstances ;4 and again the (so) affected into <lb/>
            the irascible and the concupiscible. The division too of the <lb/>
            voice (is) into the things signified ; as5 when one and the same <lb/>
            word is referred to many things; and the division of accidents <lb/>
            into things subjective; as when we say of good things, that some <lb/>
            are so, as regards the soul, some, as regards the body, and some <lb/>
            are external; and that of things subjective into accidents; as <lb/>
            when we say of men, that some are good, some bad, and some <lb/>
            between (both).6 It is necessary then to make use of the <lb/>
            separation of the genus into its species for the purpose of <lb/>
            knowing thoroughly each thing by itself, and what it is ac­ <lb/>
            cording to its essence. But this cannot take place without <note type="footnote"> 1—1 Ficinus has, what the sense requires, " quid agendum, quid non," <lb/>
            which plainly leads to <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί πρακτέον καὶ μή</foreign>, in lieu of ri <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ πραττόμενον</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 2—2 Ficinus has more briefly, " bonane an mala sint singula, dijudi­ <lb/>

            a Definition. Now a Definition is produced from a division <lb/>
            after this manner. Of the thing, that is about to fall under a <lb/>
            Definition, it is requisite to take (in the first place)1 the genus ; <lb/>
            2 as in the case of man (the genus) is an animal ;2 and then to <lb/>
            separate it, according to its proximate differences, descend­ <lb/>
            ing to the species ; as, for instance, to rational and irrational, <lb/>
            mortal and immortal; so that if the proximate differences are <lb/>
            combined3 with the genus, 4that proceeds from them,4 there <lb/>
            exists a definition of man.</p>
          <p>But of Analysis there are three kinds; one is an ascent from <lb/>
            things perceptible by a sense to the primary perceptible by <lb/>
            mind; another is an ascent through things (fully) shown5 and <lb/>
            obscurely shown to propositions not to be demonstrated and <lb/>
            without a middle;6 and another is that, which ascends from <lb/>
            an hypothesis to principles not hypothetical. Now the first is <lb/>
            something of this kind; as if we should proceed from the beauty <lb/>
            relating to the body to the beauty relating to the soul; and <lb/>
            from this to that in pursuits; and from this to that in laws; <lb/>
            and then to the wide sea7 of beauty; and then, after having <lb/>
            proceeded thus,8 we should discover 9what remains, namely, <lb/>
            beauty itself.9 The second kind of Analysis is something like <lb/>
            this. It is requisite to suppose what is to be sought, and to <lb/>
            see what things are before it, and to show these from what <note type="footnote"> I I have followed Ficinus, whose version, " in primis capere," shows <lb/>

            </note>come after, by ascending up to those before, until we arrive <lb/>
            at the first and what is acknowledged ; and beginning (again),1 <lb/>
            from this we shall descend to what is sought by the Syntheti­ <lb/>
            cal manner. For instance,2 I am seeking, whether the soul <lb/>
            is immortal; and after supposing this very thing, I inquire <lb/>
            whether it is always moved; and after showing this, whether <lb/>
            what is always-moved is self-moved ; and again, after showing <lb/>
            this, I consider whether what is self-moved is a beginning <lb/>
            of motion ; and then, whether a beginning is unbegotten ; <lb/>
            3 which is laid down as being acknowledged,3 inasmuch as the <lb/>
            unbegotten is likewise the indestructible; from which, as <lb/>
            from a thing quite clear, making a beginning I will put to­ <lb/>
            gether a demonstration of this kind-If a beginning be a <lb/>
            thing unbegotten and indestructible, that, which is self-moved, <lb/>
            is a beginning of motion. Now the soul is a thing self- <lb/>
            moved ; it is therefore indestructible, and unbegotten, and im­ <lb/>
            mortal. But the Analysis from an hypothesis is of this kind- <lb/>
            A person, inquiring into a matter, lays down that very thing <lb/>
            hypothetically; and he then considers what will follow upon the <lb/>
            assertion so laid down; and after this, whether it is requisite <lb/>
            to give a reason for the hypothesis; and, laying down another <lb/>
            hypothesis, he inquires whether what had been previously <lb/>
            laid down, follows again4 the other hypothesis; and so he <lb/>
            continues to do, until he arrives at some principle not hypo­ <lb/>
            thetical.</p>
          <p>Induction is wholly a method by reasoning, which pro­ <lb/>
            ceeds from the like to the like, or from particulars to generals. <lb/>

            Syllogism.</p>
          <p>Of that portion of reasoning, which we call a Proposition, <lb/>
            there are two kinds; one is Affirmation, the other Negation. <lb/>
            Affirmation is a thing of this kind—Socrates is walking about; <note type="footnote"> 1 Since Ficinus has " rursus incipientes," he, doubtless, found in his <lb/>
            MS. <foreign xml:lang="grc">δ</foreign>' au <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρξάμενοι</foreign>, not <foreign xml:lang="grc">δἐ ἀρξάμενοι</foreign>— </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This example contains the leading arguments put forth in the Phædo, <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [c. 6. </note> <lb/>
            but Negation is a thing of this kind—Socrates is not walking <lb/>
            about. Of Affirmation and Negation, there is one kind re­ <lb/>
            lating to what is Universal, another to what is Particular. An <lb/>
            Affirmation relating to what is Particular is of this kind­ <lb/>
            "A certain1 pleasure is a good:" a Negation is of this kind <lb/>
            -" A certain 2 pleasure is not a good." But an Affirmation <lb/>
            relating to what is Universal is of this kind—“ Every dis­ <lb/>
            graceful thing is an evil:" a Negation is of this kind-" Not <lb/>
            one of disgraceful things is a good."</p>
          <p>Of Propositions some are Categorical, some Hypothetical. <lb/>
            The Categorical are simple; as "Every just thing is beauti­ <lb/>
            ful ;" but the Hypothetical point out a Consequence or Re­ <lb/>
            pugnance.</p>
          <p>Plato makes use likewise of the operation of Syllogisms, <lb/>
            when he is disproving or proving ; when disproving false­ <lb/>
            hoods by a searching inquiry ; and when proving truths by a <lb/>
            certain kind of teaching. Now a Syllogism is a reasoning, <lb/>
            in which, on some things being laid down, something neces­ <lb/>
            sarily turns out different from what has been laid down. Of <lb/>
            Syllogisms there are some Categorical; others Hypothetical; <lb/>
            and others Mixed. Of these the Categorical are those, of <lb/>
            which the assumptions and conclusions are simple proposi­ <lb/>
            tions ; the Hypothetical are those, that proceed from hypothe­ <lb/>
            tical propositions; and the Mixed are those, that combine the <lb/>
            (other) two.</p>
          <p>The man3 makes use likewise of Demonstrative (reason­ <lb/>
            ing),4 in the dialogues 5that covertly lead (to truth),5 and of <lb/>

            suredly, should what is accidental be imposed upon an acci­ <lb/>

            instance, we should give to a man the name of a horse; since <lb/>
            to speak is some one of actions; so that a person would not <lb/>
            speak correctly by speaking in any manner soever, but if he <lb/>
            should speak in such a way, as things exist naturally. Now <lb/>
            since to give a name to a thing is a part of speaking, so is a <lb/>
            name a part of speech; (and) to name a thing correctly or <lb/>
            not would take place, not according to any imposition whatso­ <lb/>
            ever, but according to a natural affinity with the thing. Hence <lb/>
            he would be the best name-imposer, who should mark out by <lb/>
            the name the nature of the thing. For the name is an in­ <lb/>
            strument of a thing, not such as occurs accidentally, but 3has <lb/>
            a mutual relation by nature ;3 and through it we teach each <lb/>
            other the things, and we judge of them;4 so that 5the name <lb/>
            is something with a teaching, and the instrument, that judges <lb/>
            of the existence of each thing,5 as the shuttle is of weaving.</p>
          <p>With regard to the Dialectic art, this too will take place, (to <lb/>
            wit,) to make use of names correctly. For as a man skilled in <lb/>
            weaving would make use of a shuttle, through knowing its <lb/>
            work, after a workman had manufactured it, so the Dialectician <lb/>
            would, after the name-imposer had imposed the name, make <lb/>
            use of it in a proper and advantageous manner. For it is the <lb/>
            part of an artificer to make a rudder, but of the steersman to <lb/>
            make use of it properly. So too the name-imposer himself <lb/>

              good; at least when a person pursues Geometry, not for any <lb/>
              practical purpose, but makes use xof it, as something ad­ <lb/>
              ditional, so as1 to ascend to the ever-existing being, and not <lb/>
              to waste his time about what is generated and destroyed. <lb/>
              Geometry2 is, moreover, very useful; for after its second in­ <lb/>
              crease there follows the contemplation according to it, which <lb/>
              has a third increase. Useful likewise as a fourth subject for <lb/>
              learning is Astronomy; according to which we shall contem­ <lb/>
              plate3 the onward movement of the stars in heaven, 4and of <lb/>
              heaven,4 and the artificer of night and day, and of months <lb/>
              and years; from whence 5by some familiar road5 we shall <lb/>
              search out6 the artificer of the universe while proceeding from <lb/>
              these subjects of learning, as from some basis and elements <lb/>
              7 (by degrees to higher matters).7 And of Music too we shall <lb/>
              have a care by bringing the hearing of it to our ears. For as <lb/>
              the eyes are constituted with respect to Astronomy, so is the <lb/>
              hearing with respect to Harmony. And as, by turning our <lb/>
              thoughts to Astronomy, we are led on the road from things <lb/>
              seen to an existence unseen and perceptible by mind, so by <lb/>
              listening to the voice of Harmony, we pass, in like manner, <lb/>

              happen, nevertheless, to be very useful, according to what <lb/>
              has been stated. From whence Plato said that such subjects <lb/>
              of learning were not sciences at all. The Dialectic art is <lb/>
              then a progression, that naturally ascends from Geometrical <lb/>
              Hypotheses to the first principles of things and non-hypo­ <lb/>

          <p>[9.] Respecting Ideas and the Efficient Cause.</p>
          <p>While matter retains the character of a Principle, (Plato) <lb/>
            admits still other principles likewise, both the pattern-like, <lb/>
            that is, relating to Ideas, and that of god, the father and the <lb/>
            cause of all things. Now Idea is, as regards god, a mental <lb/>
            operation by him; as regards us, the first thing perceptible <lb/>
            by mind; as regards Matter, a standard; but as regards the <lb/>
            world, perceptible by a sense, a pattern ; but as considered4 <lb/>
            with reference to itself, an existence. For universally all that <lb/>
            is generated according to a design ought to be generated for <lb/>
            something. For5 if any thing be produced from any thing, as <lb/>
            my own resemblance is from myself, there must be a pattern <lb/>
            previously laid down ; 6 and whether the pattern be within or <lb/>
            without, each of the artificers, having the pattern in himself, <lb/>
            on every side and in every manner, invests its form with <lb/>
            Matter.6</p>
          <p>Now persons define Idea as the eternal pattern of things <lb/>
            existing according to Nature. For it does not please the ma­ <lb/>
            jority of Platonists (to admit) that there are Ideas of works <lb/>
            of art, such as of a shield, or lyre ; nor yet of things, that are <lb/>
            contrary to Nature, such as of fever, and cholera ; nor of what <lb/>
            exists according to a part,7 as of Socrates and Plato; nor of <note type="footnote"> 1 I have translated, as if the Greek were <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς</foreign> via <foreign xml:lang="grc">δέχηται σχήματα, <lb/>

            and superior; for Ideas are the notions of god eternal and <lb/>
            perfect in themselves.</p>
          <p>Now that there are Ideas, in this way too they exhort (us).1 <lb/>
            For whether the deity be mind or something mental, it has <lb/>
            thoughts, and these too both eternal and not to be turned aside. <lb/>
            And if this be so, there are Ideas. For if Matter is on its <lb/>
            own account without (a standard of) measure,2 it must meet <lb/>
            with a standard from something else, that is superior and <lb/>
            without matter; hence 3if the antecedent (is true), so is the <lb/>
            consequent;3 and if this be so, Ideas are certain (standards <lb/>
            of) measures without Matter. Moreover, if the world is not <lb/>
            such, as it is, from chance, not only has it been produced out <lb/>
            of something, but by something; and not only so, but for <lb/>
            something likewise. Now what could that, for which it has <lb/>
            been produced, have been else than Idea ? so that thus there <lb/>
            would have been Ideas. Moreover, if mind differs from true4 <lb/>
            opinion, what is perceived by mind differs also from what is <lb/>
            held as an opinion; and if this be so, 5[things perceived by <lb/>
            the mind are different from those held as opinions; so that]5 <lb/>
            there will have been the primaries perceived by mind, and <lb/>
            the primaries perceived by a sense; and if this be so, there <lb/>
            are Ideas. Now mind does differ from a true opinion ; so that <lb/>
            there will have been Ideas.</p>

            when they determine to think upon something perceptible by <lb/>
            mind, they keep in their fancy that, which is perceptible by a <lb/>
            sense, so as to think at the same time of magnitude, and form, <lb/>
            and colour-do frequently think not clearly upon things per­ <lb/>

            1 analogy which the sun has to the seeing faculty and to things <lb/>
            seen, without being himself vision, but enabling it to see and <lb/>
            them to be seen, this analogy1 has the primary mind to the <lb/>
            thinking faculty, and to the things thought of. For not being <lb/>
            what the thinking faculty is, it enables it to think, and for things <lb/>
            perceptible by mind2 to be thought of, by throwing around <lb/>
            them the light of truth. But the third notion would be some­ <lb/>
            thing of this kind. A person, after contemplating the beauty in <lb/>
            bodies, will then proceed to the beauty of the soul; and after­ <lb/>
            wards to that, which is in pursuits and laws; and then to the <lb/>
            wide sea3 of the beautiful; after which he will think of the <lb/>
            good itself, and the lovely, and desirable, 4as it were a light <lb/>
            that has appeared, and is shining out upon the thus ascending <lb/>
            soul.4 5 In this way he thinks too upon god, on account of <lb/>
            his excellence in a state of honour,5 and that he is without <lb/>
            parts, through there being nothing prior to him; for a part, <lb/>
            and that, from which 6(any thing is composed),6 is prior to <lb/>
            that, of which it is a part; for the plane is prior to the bulk <lb/>
            in a body, and the line is prior to a plane. By not having <lb/>
            parts then he would be unmoved, as regards space and change. <lb/>
            For if he were changed, it would be either by himself or by <lb/>
            another. Now if it were by another, that other would be. <lb/>
            more powerful than he; but if by himself, he would be <lb/>
            changed either for the worse or the better. Now both of <lb/>
            these (suppositions) are absurd. From all which it appears <lb/>
            that he7 is without body; which may be shown from these <note type="footnote"> 1—1 I have translated, as if the Greek were <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνάλογον</foreign>, not <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγον</foreign>— </note><note type="footnote"> 2 I have translated, as if the Greek were <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὲ</foreign>, not <foreign xml:lang="grc">γὰρ</foreign>— </note><note type="footnote"/><note type="footnote"> 3 Here, as in p. 250, n. 7, Ficinus substitutes " fontem " for " mare," <lb/>

            primis sine magnitndine quantitatis agnoscit—” where the last clause is <lb/>
            required to fill up the chain of reasoning. Not less at variance with the <lb/>
            Greek is the version of Stanley, " By this he comprehendeth god himself <lb/>
            through reason of that excellence, which consisteth in adoration of him." </note><note type="footnote"> 6—6 The Supplement between the numerals has been adopted from <lb/>

             <note type="margin">c. 11.] <lb/>
            </note>proofs likewise. For if god were body, he would be Material <lb/>
            and with a Form, through every body being a dual substance, <lb/>
            composed of Matter and of Form united to it; which are as­ <lb/>
            similated to Ideas and partake of them in some kind of manner <lb/>
            hard to be explained. Now it is absurd for god to be com­ <lb/>
            posed of Matter and Form. For he will not be simple, nor <lb/>
            capable of being a beginning; so that the deity would be a <lb/>
            thing without body; and from another point,' if he is body, <lb/>
            he would be Material, and would be either fire or water, or <lb/>
            earth or air, or something (produced) from them. Now each <lb/>
            of these at least is not capable of being a beginning; and he <lb/>
            would be really2 produced posterior to Matter, if he were <lb/>
            Material; which suppositions being absurd, we must under­ <lb/>
            stand him to be without body. For if he were body, he <lb/>
            would be 3 destroyed, and produced, and changed.3 But each <lb/>
            of these events is absurd in his case.</p>
          <p>[11.] That Qualities are incorporeal.</p>
          <p>Qualities moreover can be shown in this manner to be incor­ <lb/>
            poreal. Every body is in a subjective state. But a Quality <lb/>
            is not in a subjective state, but accidental. Body is therefore <lb/>
            not a Quality. Every Quality is in a subjective state; but no <lb/>
            body is in a subjective state. Quality therefore is not body. <lb/>
            Further, one quality is the opposite to another quality. But <lb/>
            one body is not so to another body; and body differs, as far <lb/>
            as it is body, in nothing from body; but it does differ in <lb/>
            Quality, 4 and not, by Zeus, in bodies.4 Qualities are therefore <lb/>
            not bodies. And it is most reasonable, that, as Matter is de­ <lb/>
            void of Quality, so Quality should be devoid of Matter; and <lb/>
            if Quality be immaterial, Quality will be incorporeal. 5 For <lb/>
            if Qualities were bodies,5 two and three bodies would be in <lb/>
            the same place-a thing the most absurd. But if Qualities <lb/>

            reference to air and water-things that exhibited previously <lb/>
            merely3 foot-marks,4 and (were) the receptacle of the powers <lb/>
            of the Elements, and were without reason and without mea­ <lb/>
            sure shaking Matter and were shaken by it. 5 For from each <lb/>
            of the four elements, as a whole, he generated the World;5 <lb/>
            and from all fire and earth and water and air leaving out <lb/>
            neither any part or power, through having reflected,6 in <lb/>
            the first place, that it was requisite to be a body and a pro­ <lb/>
            duction, and altogether tangible and visible; since without <lb/>
            fire and without earth it was not possible for any thing to be <lb/>
            either visible or tangible. According then to a fair reason <lb/>
            he formed it of earth and fire. But since it was requisite for <lb/>
            some chain to be in the midst of both of these; and since the <lb/>
            divine chain is that of proportion, which has by nature the <lb/>
            power to make itself and what are united with it one; and <lb/>
            since the World was not a plane-for one middle power would <lb/>
            have been sufficient—but spherical-and required two mid­ <lb/>
            dle powers for the fitting together-on this account, in the <lb/>
            nidst of fire and of earth, both air and water were arranged <lb/>
            according to the manner of a proportion ; 7 so that, as fire is <lb/>
            o air, so air should be to water, and this last to earth, and <lb/>
            onversely;7 and 8 by nothing being left from without, he <note type="footnote">1 Since Ficinus has " pulchrum ordinem—” perhaps his MS. read <lb/>

            and stable; but he made use of the form of the Dodecahedron <lb/>
            for the Universe. But more than all these was the Plane of <lb/>
            the nature of a Principle. For Planes are prior to Solids. <lb/>
            And of the nature of a Plane there are, as it were, some two <lb/>
            progenitors, 1the most beautiful, 1 in the form of right-angled <lb/>
            triangles; one, the Skalene; the other, the Isoskeles; the <lb/>
            Skalene having one angle a right angle, and another two­ <lb/>
            thirds (of a right angle), and the remainder the third (of a <lb/>
            right angle). Now the former,2 [1 mean the Skalene triangle,]2 <lb/>
            is the element of the Pyramid, and Octahedron, and Eikosi­ <lb/>
            hedron ; the Pyramid consisting of four equilateral triangles, <lb/>
            each of which is divided into six Skalene triangles, as de­ <lb/>
            scribed already; but the Octohedron in like manner of eight, <lb/>
            each of which is divided into six Skalene; and the Eikosihe­ <lb/>
            dron (in like manner)3 of twenty. But the other, 4 [I mean the <lb/>
            Isoskeles,]4 becomes the constituent form of the Cube; for <lb/>
            when four Isoskeles triangles come together, they make a <lb/>
            Square; from six squares of which kind is formed a Cube. <lb/>
            But for the Universe the deity made use of the Dodecahedron. <lb/>
            Wherefore there are seen 5 [in heaven]5 the forms of twelve <lb/>
            animals in the circle of the Zodiac, and each of them is di­ <lb/>
            vided into thirty parts. And nearly so in the case of the <lb/>
            Dodecahedron; which consists of twelve pentagons, (each)6 <lb/>
            divided into five triangles, so that, as each consists of six tri­ <lb/>
            angles, there are found in the whole Dodecahedron three hun­ <lb/>
            dred and sixty triangles, being as many as there are parts in <lb/>
            the Zodiac. Matter then, being fashioned into these forms by <lb/>
            the deity, was moved at first with (indistinct)7 footsteps, and <lb/>
            without order, but was subsequently reduced into order by the <lb/>

            means there is left no vacuum, destitute of some body; and as <lb/>
            this inequality continues, it gives rise to a shaking; for by <lb/>

          <p>[14.] Respecting the Soul of the World, and the Spheres, <lb/>
            and the Stars.</p>
          <p>1 Bodies then has (Plato) introduced for the instruction of the <lb/>
            Soul, touching the powers that are exhibited in it.1 For since <lb/>
            we judge of each of things existing by the Soul, he has fairly <lb/>
            placed in it the Principles of all existing things, in order that, <lb/>
            while contemplating each of the things that fall under it, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to their affinity and proximity, we should represent to <lb/>
            ourselves its being in harmony with its acts. By saying then <lb/>
            that there is a certain existence perceptible by the mind, which <lb/>
            is indivisible, he has represented to himself another existence <lb/>
            likewise, relating to bodies, which is divisible, by showing that <lb/>
            he is able to lay hold by intellect of each of these existences; and <lb/>
            by seeing that, as regards things perceptible by mind, there is <lb/>
            an identity and a difference, and ( so too) as regards things <lb/>
            perceptible by a sense, from all these be has made the Soul a <lb/>
            contribution.2 For either the like is known by the like, which <lb/>
            is the favourite doctrine of the Pythagorean, or the unlike by <lb/>
            the unlike, which is that of Heracleitus, the Physical philoso­ <lb/>
            pher. But when (Plato) says that the World has been generated, <lb/>
            we must not understand him, as if there were once a time, <lb/>
            when the World was not; but because 3it is ever in genera­ <lb/>
            tion,3and shows forth something as a cause more ancient than <lb/>
            its own constitution. And even the deity does not make the <lb/>
            Soul ever existing of the World, but puts it in order. And <note type="footnote"> 1—1 Ficinus has, more briefly, " Ex corporibus itaque animæ vires <lb/>

            ceptible by his mind, it may, while eagerly seeking his no­ <lb/>
            tions, assume species and forms. It is plain then that the <lb/>
            World is a thing of life and intellectual. For the deity being <lb/>
            desirous of making it the best (work),3 made it consequently <lb/>
            both with life and intellect. For that, which is with life, is, <lb/>
            4taken as a whole, a completed work superior to that, which, <lb/>
            taken as a whole,4 is without life; and the intellectual than the <lb/>
            non-intellectual; although perhaps by the mind not being able <lb/>
            to subsist without a thing of life, but by the life being extended <lb/>
            from the centre to the extremities, 5it has happened, that it <lb/>
            surrounds the body of the World in a circle and entirely con­ <lb/>

            maining kinds of living beings, the winged, the aquatic, and <lb/>
            the foot-walking. These the deity enjoined upon his offsprings <lb/>

            primary matter certain portions for definite periods, as if they <lb/>
            were to be paid back again, fabricated mortal things of life. <lb/>
            But when there was respecting the race of Man, as being the <lb/>
            nearest related to gods, again a care both to the father of all, <lb/>
            and to the gods, his offspring, the artificer of the Universe <lb/>
            sent down upon earth the souls of this race, equal in number to <lb/>
            the stars; and after he had placed 2each soul in a star, as in <lb/>
            a vehicle connected with it,2 he did, in order that he might be <lb/>
            without blame, lay down laws, fixed by Fate, after the manner <lb/>
            of a Law-giver ; that from the body should arise mortal af­ <lb/>
            fections, first, sensations, then pleasure and pain, and fear <lb/>
            and anger, and that the souls, which obtained a mastery over <lb/>
            these (feelings), and were not controlled by them, should live <lb/>
            justly, and arrive at the star, connected with them ; while they, <lb/>
            who were overcome by (their own) injustice, should come in <lb/>

            the head, after placing as a substratum the brain in the manner <lb/>
            of a ploughed field; and they put around the face the organs <lb/>
            of the senses, to fulfil their fitting office. And they formed <lb/>
            the marrow 3out of the smooth and straight triangles,3 of <lb/>
            which the elements were composed, for it to be the generation <lb/>

            created.</p>
          <p>Hearing has been created for distinguishing sound. It <lb/>
            commences from a movement about the head and ends at the <lb/>
            seat of the liver. And sound is that, which passes through <lb/>
            the'ears and brain and blood1 in succession, until the soul is <lb/>
            struck. An acute sound is that, which is moved quickly; <lb/>
            a grave, slowly; a great one (is what is moved) with much <lb/>
            (force); a small one (that which is moved) with little (force).</p>
          <p>Following upon these there has been put together the <lb/>
            power of the nostrils for the perception of smells. Now Smell <lb/>
            is an affection, descending from the veins in the nostrils to <lb/>
            the places2 about the navel. But it does not happen that the <lb/>
            kinds of it have received a name, except two, 3the most be­ <lb/>
            longing to a genus,3 (namely) the sweet-smelling, and the <lb/>
            bad-smelling, which have the appellation 4of painful and <lb/>
            pleasant;4 but (it does happen) that all smell is denser than <lb/>
            air, and thinner than water; 5and properly the things, in <lb/>
            which the genus of Smell is reasonably said,5 that have not <lb/>
            obtained a perfect change, but have a participation in air and <lb/>

            differences in them; and we call things, that receive a touch, <lb/>
            yielding; but those, that do not yield, resisting. Now this <lb/>

            those, that have a larger base, are 2 stable, and fixed to their <lb/>

            immortal portion of it might not be infected by the trifles6 of <lb/>
            mortals, 6they placed over the body, as if they were appoint­ <lb/>

            residence, the head, which possesses a form, imitating that of <lb/>
            the Universe; and they placed under it the rest of the body <lb/>
            to minister to it; and attached that portion to it, as it were <lb/>
            a vehicle, while they assigned to its mortal parts a dwelling- <lb/>
            place, one to one part and another to another. For they <lb/>
            placed that, which feels anger, in the heart; but that, which <lb/>
            is affected by desire, in the intermediate place between the <lb/>
            boundary on the side of the navel and that of the diaphragm, <lb/>

            we may learn from hence. In the first place, the things, se­ <lb/>

              since the part, that has the property of suffering, and that, <lb/>
              which has the property of reasoning, are different by nature, <lb/>
              it is meet for them to be in separate places. For they are <lb/>
              found to be at war with each other. Now nothing is able to <lb/>
              be at war with itself; nor can the things opposed to each <lb/>
              other stand together 1 at the same time about the same object.' <lb/>
              At least in the case of Medea, anger is seen to be at war with <lb/>
              reason ; for she says—2 <lb/>
              I know how great the ills I'm about to do ; <lb/>
              But rage has a pow'r greater than 3 my counsels.3 <lb/>
              And in the case of Laius, when carrying off Chrysippus, de­ <lb/>
              sire is at war with reason ; for he says- <lb/>
              4 Alas ! this thing from god4 to man's an ill, <lb/>
              When, what is good, one knows, but uses not. <lb/>
              Still further 5is it presented to the mind,5 that the property <lb/>
              of suffering is different from that of reasoning, from the care <lb/>
              of the property of reasoning being one thing, but that of suf­ <lb/>

          <p>[25.] That the Soul is immortal.</p>
          <p>That the soul is immortal (Plato) proves by proceeding in <lb/>
            this manner. The soul brings life to whatsoever she is at­ <lb/>
            tached, as being a thing born with herself. Now that, which <lb/>
            brings life to any thing, is itself non-recipient of death; and a <lb/>
            thing of this kind is immortal. If then the soul is immortal, <lb/>
            it would be indestructible likewise. For it is an incorporeal <note type="footnote"> " quinetiam ratio hominibus duntaxat, pars autem perturbationibus ob­ <lb/>

            2If then the soul will be after death, and was, before it fell in <lb/>

            by any thing else at all. And being in this state, it would <lb/>
            be a thing incorruptible. Moreover that, which is self-moved, <lb/>
            is ever-moved in the manner of a principle. Now a thing of <lb/>
            this kind is immortal. The soul too is self-moved. Now the <lb/>
            self-moved is the principle of all motion and generation. But <lb/>
            a principle is not generated, and is not to be destroyed; so <lb/>
            that the soul of the Universe would be such, and that of man <lb/>
            likewise;2 since both have a share in the same mixture. Now <lb/>
            he says that the soul is self-moved, because it possesses a <lb/>
            life born with it, (and) ever in action by itself.</p>
          <p>That rational souls then are immortal, a person might, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to this man, firmly assert; but whether the irrational <lb/>
            are so likewise, is a doubtful point. For it is probable that <lb/>
            irrational souls, driven about by a mere phantasy, and making <lb/>
            no use of either reasoning or judgment, or contemplation 3 and <lb/>
            their combination, or intellectual apprehension,4 but, being <lb/>
            altogether without thought, belong neither to a nature per­ <lb/>
            ceptible by mind, nor to an existence. the same as the rational, <lb/>
            and are mortal and corruptible.</p>
          <p>And it follows upon the reasoning that souls are immortal, <lb/>
            that they are introduced into bodies by their being innate in <lb/>
            the natures, that form the foetus; and, by passing into many <lb/>
            bodies, both human and not human, 5they ever remain the <lb/>
            same in number,5 either by the will of the gods or through <lb/>
            incontinence6 or a love for the body ; for body and soul pos­ <lb/>

          <p>Now the nature of a possibility falls somehow in the middle <lb/>
            between the true and the false; but ' that, which rests on <lb/>
            ourselves, is borne, as it were, on a vehicle, upon that (pos­ <lb/>

          <p>We must next speak in order and summarily of what has <lb/>
            been said by the man on points of Morality. The good to be <lb/>

            and those 4previously tried,4 did he give a share of his lec­ <lb/>
            tures on the good. If any one however takes up his writings <lb/>
            carefully, 5(he will say that)5 he has laid down our good in <lb/>
            the knowledge and contemplation of the primary good, which <lb/>
            a person would call god and the primary mind. For all the <lb/>
            things, that in any way are held by man to be good, he con­ <lb/>
            ceived to have obtained that appellation from their participat­ <lb/>

            who has this, Plato says in the Euthydemus,8 there is a <lb/>

            far as is possible; and that it is a similarity likewise to be­ <lb/>
            come just and holy with prudence. At another time he says, <lb/>
            as in the last book of the Republic, that to be just alone (is <lb/>
            so); 10 for never is that person at least neglected by the gods, <lb/>

            he says that the end (of life) 3 is assimilated with god ; and <lb/>
            another, (it is) to follow (god),4 as when he states, 5"Now <lb/>

            follow (each other) in turn.1 For as Fortitude is pre­ <lb/>
            servative of. a lawful dogma, so it is of right reason. 2 [For <lb/>
            a lawful dogma is a kind of right reason.] 2 But right rea­ <lb/>
            son comes from Prudence. Moreover, Prudence stands as <lb/>
            an ally3 with Fortitude. For it is the knowledge of good <lb/>
            things. Now no one is able to see what is good, while it is <lb/>
            rendered obscure by cowardice, and the feelings that follow <lb/>
            upon cowardice. And nearly in the same manner a person <lb/>
            is unable to act with prudence in union with intemperance, <lb/>
            4or generally through being subdued by any feeling. And if <lb/>
            he does any thing contrary to right reason,4 Plato says that <lb/>
            he suffers thus through ignorance and folly;5 6 so that he <lb/>
            would not be able to possess Prudence, while he is intemper­ <lb/>

          <p>5 Since there is, if any thing else, what is in our power and <lb/>

            For what is honourable would not be an object of praise, if it <lb/>
            were from nature or a divine lot. 6 Virtue therefore will be <lb/>
            likewise a voluntary thing, existing, according to some im­ <lb/>
            pulse, fiery, and noble, and permanent. From Virtue then <lb/>
            being voluntary, it follows that Vice is involuntary.6 For <lb/>

            different are the mischiefs done; and the involuntariness lies <lb/>

            is permissible to turn aside by reasoning, and 3urbanity in <lb/>
            conduct,3 and care. 4 So great an ill (then) is injustice, that <lb/>
            5to act unjustly is a thing more to be avoided than to suffer <lb/>
            unjustly.5 For the former is the work of a bad man ; but the <lb/>
            latter is the suffering of a weak one. And both is a base <lb/>
            thing. But to act unjustly is so much the greater ill, as it is <lb/>
            the baser thing. And it is an advantage to him, who acts <lb/>
            unjustly, to undergo punishment,6 as it is to a person diseased <lb/>
            to give up7 his body to a physician to cure. For all punish­ <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin"> [c. 31. </note> But since most Virtues are conversant with Affections, let <lb/>
            us define what kind of a thing is an Affection.</p>
          <p>Now an Affection is an irrational movement of the soul, as <lb/>
            regards either an ill or a good. And a movement has been <lb/>
            called irrational, because Affections are neither decisions nor <lb/>
            opinions, but movements of the irrational portions of the soul. <lb/>
            For in the part of the soul, subject to Affections, there exist <lb/>
            1 things, which, although they are our works, are nevertheless <lb/>
            not in our power.1 They are however frequently produced <lb/>
            in us, when not willing and resisting. Sometimes too, while <lb/>
            knowing that, what have fallen on us, are 2 neither painful, nor <lb/>
            pleasant, nor fearful,2 we are not the less led by them; 3what <lb/>
            we should not have suffered, had these Affections been the <lb/>
            same as decisions.3 For the latter we reject, 4when we con­ <lb/>
            demn them, whether fittingly or not fittingly.4 5 For a good <lb/>
            or for an ill:5 since on the appearance of an indifferent thing <lb/>
            an Affection is not put into motion. For all Affections exist, <lb/>
            according to the appearance of a good or an ill. For if we <lb/>
            imagine that a good is present, we are pleased; and if it is <lb/>
            about to be, we desire it; but if we imagine that an ill is pre­ <lb/>
            sent, we are pained; and what is about to be, we fear. For, <lb/>
            there are two Affections, simple and elementary, (namely,) <lb/>
            Pleasure and Pain, and from these the rest are formed. For <note type="footnote"> 1—1 I have, with Stanley, followed the Latin of Ficinus, “quæ etsi <lb/>

            we must not number with these Fear and Desire, as being of <lb/>
            the nature of principles and simple. For he, who fears, is not <lb/>
            entirely deprived of pleasure: 1 since if a person has existed <lb/>
            through a time, that may have happened, while despairing of a <lb/>
            release from, or an alleviation of, the ill; he abounds however in <lb/>
            being pained and troubled; and on this account he is united to <lb/>
            pain ;1 and he, who desires, while remaining in the expectation <lb/>
            of obtaining (his wish), is pleased; but as he is not completely <lb/>
            confident, nor has a firm hope, he is weighed down. Since then <lb/>
            Desire and Fear are not of the nature of principles, it will be <lb/>
            conceded without a doubt that not one of the other Affections is <lb/>
            simple,2 such, I mean, as Anger, and Regret, and Jealousy, and <lb/>
            such like. For in these Pleasure and Pain are seen, 3mixed <lb/>
            up, as it were, in a manner with them.3 But of Affections some <lb/>
            are of a wild kind, others of a tame. Now the tame are such as <lb/>
            exist in man according to nature; (being)4 both necessary and <lb/>
            proper; and they are in this state, while they preserve some <lb/>
            measure; but when there is found in them5 a want of measure, <lb/>
            they then become deviations from right. Of such a kind are <lb/>
            Pleasure, Pain, Anger, Pity, Shame. For it is proper to be <lb/>
            pleased at things that happen according to nature, but to be <lb/>
            pained at their contraries. And Anger is necessary 6 for self­ <lb/>
            defence and to avenge oneself upon foes ;6 and Pity is proper <note type="footnote"/><note type="footnote">1—1 Such is the literal version of the Greek; which I cannot under­ <lb/>

            1 for a love of mankind;1 and Shame is requisite for a retreat <lb/>
            from things that are base.2 But other Affections, which are <lb/>
            contrary to Nature, are of a wild kind, and arise from a per­ <lb/>
            version (of mind),3 and improper habits. Of such a kind4 is <lb/>
            (excessive)5 laughter, and a rejoicing over calamities, and a <lb/>
            hatred of mankind ; which, by being stretched out and relaxed, <lb/>
            and existing in any state whatsoever, are deviations from <lb/>
            right,6 through not receiving any moderation.</p>
          <p>And on the subject of Pleasure and Pain Plato says, that <lb/>
            these Affections, existing somehow naturally in us from the <lb/>
            beginning, are put into motion and carried onward ; since Pain <lb/>
            7and Sorrow7 are generated for those, who are excited contrary <lb/>
            to nature; but Pleasure for those, who return to their former <lb/>
            state according to nature. Now he conceives that the state <lb/>
            according to nature is a mean between Pain and Pleasure- <lb/>
            8 while it is the same with neither of them8—in which (mean) <lb/>
            we exist for the greater portion of time. He teaches more­ <lb/>
            over that there are many kinds of Pleasures, some (felt) through <lb/>
            the body, and others through the soul; and that of Pleasures <lb/>
            some are mixed with their opposites ;9 but others remain pure <lb/>
            and undefiled; and that some are the result of memory, 10 and <lb/>
            others united to hope;10 and that some are disgraceful, such <lb/>
            as are unrestrained, and combined with injustice, but others <lb/>

            being for a vicious (soul); and there is an intermediate (kind) <lb/>

            who strives to possess it, shall possess it, not by rendering <lb/>
            delicate or praising the object of his love, but by repressing it <lb/>
            rather, and showing that by a person, being in the state he is <lb/>
            now, life is not to be lived.2 3 And when he gets the party <lb/>
            loved into his power, he will make use of him, after having en­ <lb/>

            in them, become perfect; and the end to them (will be), that, <lb/>
            instead of a lover and a beloved, they will become friends.3</p>
          <p>[33.] On the Forms of Polity.</p>
          <p>Of Polities (Plato) says that some 4 (exist in reality, but <lb/>
            some)4 are supposed to exist, such as5 he has detailed in the <lb/>
            Republic. For in that (treatise), he has depicted 6the former as <lb/>
            unwarlike; but the latter as being in a feverish state and war­ <lb/>
            like,6 while seeking which of these would be the best, and how <lb/>
            they should be constituted. And it is there that, nearly alike <lb/>
            to the division of the soul, is a Polity divided into three parts, <lb/>
            relating to the guardians and aiders and operatives; to the <lb/>
            first of which he assigns the counselling and ruling power; <lb/>
            to the second, that of fighting for (the state), if need be; <lb/>
            7who are to be put into order according to the principle of <lb/>
            anger,7 as if they were the allies of the rational principle; <note type="footnote">1—1 Ficinus. " ad bonum fervore quodam animi perferantur—” who <lb/>

            atque docebit nequaquam illi, donec talis sit, esse vivendum." </note><note type="footnote"> 3—3 Here again Ficinus has strangely represented the original, " Pro­ <lb/>

            but to the last (he assigns) arts, and the rest of handicrafts. <lb/>
            And he conceives it right for the rulers to be philosophers, <lb/>
            and contemplative of the primary good; for they alone1 will <lb/>
            administer all things properly ; 2 for never will human af­ <lb/>
            fairs cease from ills, unless philosophers become kings, or <lb/>
            those, who are called kings, become, from some divine allot­ <lb/>
            ment, truly philosophers.2 For states will act3 the best <lb/>
            and with justice at that time, when each portion of it 4is <lb/>
            under its own law;4 so that the rulers may consult for the <lb/>
            people, and the co-fighters be their servants and fight in <lb/>
            their behalf, while the rest follow them obediently. And <lb/>
            he says there are five kinds of Polities; (the first),5 an <lb/>
            aristocracy, when the best are in power; the second, a timo­ <lb/>
            cracy, where 6those fond of honours6 are the rulers; the <lb/>
            third, a democracy; and after this an oligarchy; and the last, <lb/>
            a tyranny, which is the worst. He depicts likewise other <lb/>
            Polities, hypothetically; of which there is that in the Laws, <lb/>
            and that too, 7after correction, in the Epistles;7 of which he <lb/>
            makes use for the states, that are labouring, as mentioned in <lb/>
            the Laws, under a disease, and 8 possessing a region bounded <lb/>
            off,8 and persons selected from every age, so that, according <lb/>
            to the differences in their nature, and places, there may be a <lb/>
            need of peculiar instruction9 and of bringing up and of using <lb/>
            arms. For they, who are near the sea, would apply them­ <lb/>
            selves to navigation and to naval battles: while those, dwell­ <lb/>

            4and law-judgments. For Political science considers ten <lb/>

            we must engage in war or not.4</p>
          <p>[34.] On the Sophist.</p>
          <p>It has been stated before what kind of person is the phi­ <lb/>
            losopher. From him the Sophist differs, first in manner, in <lb/>
            that he is 5 the seeker of pay from young persons,5 and is will­ <lb/>
            ing to be considered 6 a person with bodily and mental ac­ <lb/>
            complishments,6 rather than to be so; and (secondly) in <lb/>
            matter, in that the philosopher is conversant with things <lb/>
            existing for ever and in the same state; while the Sophist <lb/>
            busies himself about that which is not, and 7 retires to a spot, <lb/>
            difficult to be seen on account of its darkness.7 For to that, <note type="footnote"> 1—1 Such is the literal version of <foreign xml:lang="grc">γεωλ</foreign>ó<foreign xml:lang="grc">φοις</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">πεδίοις</foreign>. But as such a <lb/>
            combination of words is unintelligible, opportunely has Ficinus " littora," <lb/>
            which has led me to believe that the author wrote lv <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰγιαλοι̃ς ἢ ἀφελέ­ <lb/>
            σιν</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">πεδίοις</foreign>— where <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφελέσιν</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">πεδίοις</foreign> may be compared with <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφελω̃ν <lb/>

            <title type="main">THE INTRODUCTION OF ALBINUS TO THE DIALOGUES OF PLATO.</title>
          </head>
          <p>[1.] THAT 1 for a person about to enter upon 2 the Dialogues <lb/>
            of Plato, it is fitting that he should know previously what a <lb/>
            Dialogue is. For neither without some art and power3 have <lb/>
            dialogues been written, nor is it easy for a person, unskilled <lb/>
            in contemplation, to know them artistically. It is agreeable <lb/>
            then for a philosopher, who is making for himself an insight <lb/>
            into every matter of whatever kind, to examine, (first,)4 the <lb/>
            essence of the thing, and afterwards, what power it has, and <lb/>
            not with reference to what is naturally useful and what is not. <lb/>
            Now (Plato) says thus—5 " On every matter, 0 boy, there is <lb/>
            one commencement to those about to consult properly. It is <lb/>
            needful to know, about what is the consultation ; or else there <lb/>
            must needs be an erring in this matter. Now it lies hid from <lb/>
            the majority, that they do not know the essence of each thing ; <lb/>
            (but), as if they did know, they do not, at the commencement <note type="footnote"> 1 From the word "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Οτι</foreign>, here and elsewhere, it is evident that the whole <lb/>
            of this Introduction is merely an extract from a longer treatise. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 I have translated, here and elsewhere, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐντυχχάνειν</foreign>, " to enter upon," <lb/>

            neither with themselves nor with others." In order then that <lb/>
            we may not suffer this,3 while entering upon the Dialogues <lb/>
            of Plato, let us consider this very thing, which I have spoken <lb/>
            of, what is a dialogue. 4 [For neither without some art and <lb/>
            power have dialogues been written.] 4 5It is then nothing <lb/>
            else than a discourse composed of question and answer upon <lb/>
            some political or philosophical matter, combined with a be­ <lb/>
            coming delineation of the manners of the characters intro­ <lb/>
            duced, and the arrangement as regards their diction.5</p>
          <p>[2.] Now a dialogue is called a discourse, as a man (is <lb/>
            called) an animal. But since of a discourse there is one kind <lb/>
            arranged (in the mind)6 and another pronounced (by the <lb/>
            mouth),7 let us hear about the one pronounced (by the mouth). <lb/>
            And since of the latter there is one kind spoken, as a con­ <lb/>
            tinued narration, and another by question and answer, ques­ <lb/>
            tions and answers are the peculiar mark of a dialogue ; 8 from <lb/>
            whence it is said to be a discourse8 by interrogation; and <lb/>
            moreover9 it is applied to some political and philosophical <lb/>
            matter; because it is meet for the subject matter to be re­ <lb/>
            lated to the dialogue.10 Now the matter is that relating to <lb/>
            politics and philosophy.11 For as the matter of fables is laid <lb/>
            down as adapted to tragedy and poetry in general, so is to <lb/>
            dialogue philosophy, that is (to say), what relates to philosophy. <lb/>
            But as regards that, which is combined with a becoming deline- <note type="footnote"> I So Heindorf explains <foreign xml:lang="grc">διομολογου̃νται</foreign>, which Fischer has restored <lb/>

            ation of the manners of the characters introduced, (and) their <lb/>
            being different in their discourses through life, some as phi­ <lb/>
            losophers, and others as sophists, it is requisite to assign to <lb/>
            each their peculiar manners; to the philosopher that, which <lb/>
            is noble, and simple, and truth-loving; but to the sophist <lb/>
            that, which is of many hues, and tricky, and reputation- <lb/>
            loving ; but to an individual what is peculiar to him. Added <lb/>
            to this, 1(the definition) speaks likewise of the arrangement,1 <lb/>
            as regards their diction; and reasonably so. For as 2the <lb/>
            measure ought to be 2 adapted to tragedy and comedy, and the <lb/>
            fiction (of the subject) to the bruited story, so ought the dic­ <lb/>
            tion and composition, adapted to the dialogue, possess what <lb/>
            belongs 3to the grace of an Attic style,3 and is neither super­ <lb/>
            fluous nor deficient.</p>
          <p>[3.] But if a so-called discourse, not being made in the <lb/>
            form, as I have laid down, but deficient on these points, is <lb/>
            said to be a dialogue, it will not be said so correctly. 4Thus <lb/>
            that, which is said in the case of Thucydides to belong to the <lb/>
            power to represent the peculiarity of dialogues, but rather <lb/>

            how many of them 6exist subdivided into the uncut.6 <lb/>

            the exploratory does so to persons.</p>
          <p>[5.] Of the dialogues of Plato there are drawn out in the <lb/>
            class of Physics, the Timæus; in that of Morals, the Apology; <lb/>

            (and) Protagoras; in that of statesmanship, the Crito, Phæ­ <lb/>

            the Alcibiades; and in the overthrowing, the Hippias, Eu­ <lb/>
            thydemus, (and) Gorgias.</p>
          <p>[6.] Since then we have seen their differences, how they <lb/>
            exist naturally, and their characteristics, let us state, in addi­ <lb/>
            tion, from what dialogues persons must begin their entrance <lb/>
            upon a discourse of Plato. For opinions are different. For <lb/>
            some begin with the Epistles; and some with the Theages. <lb/>
            And there are those, who divide the dialogues into tetralogies ;3 <lb/>
            and rank as the first tetralogy that, which contains the Euthy­ <lb/>
            phron, Apology, Criton, and Phædon ; the Euthyphron, as <lb/>
            in it the charge against Socrates is brought forward; the <lb/>
            Apology, since it was necessary for him to defend himself; <lb/>
            the Crito, on account of his staying in prison ; and afterwards <lb/>
            the Phædon, since in it Socrates meets with the end of life. <lb/>
            And of this4 opinion are Derkyllides and Thrasyllus. But <lb/>
            they seem to me to have wished to assign an order to the <lb/>
            persons (of the dialogues) and the circumstances of their <lb/>
            lives-a matter which is perhaps useful for something else, <lb/>
            but not however for that, which we are wishing now; for we <lb/>
            wish to discover the commencement and arrangement of in­ <lb/>
            struction that is according to wisdom. We say then that <lb/>

            </note>fined; for that, being perfect, it is similar to the perfect <lb/>
            figure of a circle. For as the commencement of a circle is <lb/>
            not one and defined, so neither is it of a discoursed</p>
          <p>[7.] We will not however on this account enter upon it in <lb/>
            any manner soever, nor accidentally. For if it is requisite <lb/>
            to describe a circle, a person does not describe it, beginning <lb/>
            from any point, but2 * * * * in whatever state each of us <lb/>
            may be with regard to the discourse, beginning from that he <lb/>
            will enter upon the dialogues of Plato. For there is a state <lb/>
            according to nature, for instance, good or bad; and that ac­ <lb/>
            cording to age, where a person, for instance, is in the season <lb/>
            for philosophizing or has passed it; and that, according to a <lb/>
            predilection, as, for instance, in favour of philosophy or3 his­ <lb/>
            tory ; and 4 that, according to a habit,4 as in being, for ex­ <lb/>
            ample, previously initiated (in instruction),5 or without in­ <lb/>
            struction, and that, according to the matter, as being engaged, <lb/>
            for example, in philosophy, or dragged around by (political)6 <lb/>
            circumstances.</p>
          <p>[8.] He then, who is, according to nature, well born, and <lb/>
            according to age is in the season for philosophizing, and ac­ <lb/>
            cording to a predilection, for the sake of exercising himself, <lb/>

            tions his discourse is carried on. 1(Such a person)1 must enter <lb/>
            upon the Phædo next in order; for in it (Plato) states who <lb/>
            is the philosopher, and what is his pursuit; and upon the <lb/>
            supposition of the soul being immortal he goes through the <lb/>
            discourse relating to it. After this it would be requisite to <lb/>
            enter upon the Republic. For, commencing with the earliest <lb/>
            instruction, he delineates the whole of education, by making <lb/>
            use of which a person would arrive at the possession of virtue. <lb/>
            But since it is requisite for us to be versed in the knowledge <lb/>
            of things divine, so as to be able, by possessing2 virtue, to be <lb/>
            assimilated to them, we shall enter upon the Timæus; for by <lb/>

            theology, and morality, and statesmanship. And2 that the <lb/>
            doctrines may remain in the soul and not be3 chased away, it <lb/>
            will be necessary for it to be delivered to the reasoning re­ <lb/>
            lating to causation,4 in order that a person may lay hold firmly <lb/>
            of the proposed aim. In addition to these it is meet that, what <lb/>
            is not contrary to reason, should be furnished, in order that <lb/>
            we may not be carried aside by some sophist, and turn our <lb/>
            thoughts into a worse direction. That we may therefore cast <lb/>
            out false opinions, it will be necessary to enter upon the <lb/>
            dialogues of the tentative character, and which possess the <lb/>
            confuting and the so-called cleansing power. And that a <lb/>
            person may call forth into light the notions relating to physics, <lb/>
            it will be necessary to enter upon the dialogues of the ob­ <lb/>
            stetrical character, for this is peculiar to them ; since in those <lb/>
            there are doctrines relating to physics, and to morals, and to <lb/>
            statesmanship, and to the regulation of a household ; of which <lb/>
            some have a reference to contemplation and a contemplative <lb/>
            life; but others to action and an active life; but both of them <lb/>
            5 relate to the being assimilated to god.5 And that these, <lb/>
            after being imparted, may be not escaping from us, it will be <lb/>
            necessary to enter upon the dialogues of a logical character, <note type="footnote"> I have translated, as if the Greek were not <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὠς</foreign>, but <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὒτως</foreign>-</note><note type="footnote"> 2 I have adopted <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὲ</foreign>, inserted by Fabricius, after <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἳνα</foreign>— </note><note type="footnote"/><note type="footnote"> 3 The syntax requires either the insertion of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠ</foreign> after <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναπόδραϭτα</foreign>, or <lb/>

          <p>[1.]2 3THE conformation of his body gave to Plato his <lb/>
            name ;3 for he was previously called Aristocles. His father was <lb/>
            said to have been Ariston; while his mother was Perictioné, <lb/>
            the daughter of Glaucus ;4 and on both sides the nobility of <lb/>
            his birth was sufficiently remarkable. For his father Ariston <lb/>
            derived through Codrus his origin from Neptune; while the <lb/>
            blood on his mother's side flowed from Solon, the very wise, <lb/>
            who was the founder of the laws of Athens. There are how­ <lb/>
            ever those, who assert that Plato sprang from a more exalted <lb/>
            origin, at the time when a certain vision in the form of Apollo <lb/>
            had a connexion with Perictioné. He was born in the month <lb/>
            called Thargelion 5 at Athens, on the day6 in which Latona is <lb/>
            reported to have brought forth Apollo and Diana at Delos, (and) <lb/>
            on the day before that, in which we have heard that Socrates <lb/>
            was born. Mention is likewise made of the pretty dream that <note type="footnote"> 1 The more correct title would perhaps be that found in some MSS. <lb/>

            Socrates had ; for he thought he saw a cygnet flying from an <lb/>
            altar, which was in the Academia, sacred to Cupid, and settling <lb/>
            on his lap ; and that afterwards, a full-fledged swan, it directed <lb/>
            its flight to heaven, entrancing the ears of men and gods with <lb/>
            the music of its song. And after Socrates had mentioned the <lb/>
            dream to some persons when they had come together, Ariston <lb/>
            very opportunely 1 attended upon Socrates, with the view of <lb/>
            offering Plato to him as (the youth's) instructor; on whom <lb/>
            when Socrates had cast his eyes and 2 saw from his external <lb/>
            appearance his internal disposition,2 he said, " This, friends, <lb/>
            is the swan (from the altar) of Cupid in the Academy."</p>
          <p>[2.] Such and (sprung) from such did Plato not only excel <lb/>
            heroes in virtue, but he equalled likewise the gods in power. <lb/>
            For Speusippus, 3who was furnished with family documents,3 <lb/>
            praises the acuteness of the boy's talent in perception, and <lb/>
            his disposition as regards his wonderful modesty; and he <lb/>
            makes mention of the first-fruits of his youth as being im­ <lb/>
            bued with the proofs of labour and his love of study; and <lb/>
            testifies that in the man there met together the growth of <lb/>
            these and of other virtues.</p>
          <p>From the same parents were his brothers Glaucon and <lb/>
            Adeimantus. For his instructors he had in 4 the rudiments <lb/>
            of education,4 Dionysius; and in the palæstra, Ariston, a na­ <lb/>
            tive of Argos; and such a progress did practice bring with <lb/>
            it, that he contended for the wrestler's prize at the Pythian <lb/>
            and Isthmian games. Nor did he disdain the painter's art. <lb/>
            For Tragic and Dithyrambic compositions likewise he fitted <lb/>
            himself; and, carried away by a confidence in his poetical <lb/>
            powers, he was already desirous of professing himself a com­ <lb/>
            petitor, had not Socrates driven from his mind the lowness <lb/>
            of the desire, and taken care to implant in his soul the glory <lb/>
            that arises from true praise. And even previously5 he had <note type="footnote"> 1 Such seems to be the meaning of " commodum ;" for which two <lb/>
            MSS. read " commodo—" </note><note type="footnote"> 2—2 Compare Shakspeare's—" To read the mind's construction in the <lb/>

            But when he had given himself up to Socrates, he was supe­ <lb/>
            rior to the rest of the disciples of Socrates not only in genius <lb/>
            and learning; but by labour likewise and elegance he shed a <lb/>
            lustre on the wisdom imparted to him by Socrates; by the <lb/>
            labour, through which he endeavoured to make that wisdom <lb/>
            his own; and by the elegance, through which he contributed <lb/>
            to it a considerable dignity from the beauty and majesty of <lb/>
            his language.</p>
          <p>[3.] But after Socrates had left the world, 1 he sought <lb/>
            out from whence he might make a further progress ; and he <lb/>
            betook himself to the discipline of Pythagoras; and though <lb/>
            he saw it possessed a method of diligence and splendour com­ <lb/>
            bined, he was still more desirous of imitating its continence <lb/>
            and chastity. And, as he perceived that the talents of the <lb/>
            Pythagoreans were aided by other kinds of learning, he went <lb/>
            to Cyrené to learn Geometry under Theodorus, and travelled <lb/>
            even to Egypt to obtain a knowledge of astrology, and that he <lb/>
            might learn from thence the rites of the prophets there. And <lb/>
            2a second time he went2 to Italy, and became a follower of the <lb/>
            Pythagoreans, Eurytus of Tarentum, and Archytas, who was <lb/>
            rather advanced in years ; and he would have directed his <lb/>
            thoughts to the Indians and Magi, had not the wars in Asia3 <lb/>
            at that time prevented him 4(from proceeding thither).4 5On <lb/>
            which account,5 by following out with more than usual study the <lb/>
            discoveries of Parmenides and Zeno, he so filled his treatises <lb/>
            with things, 6taken unitedly, which singly6 had been an ob- <note type="footnote"> Heracleitus after the death of Socrates. But Aristotle, in Metaphys. i. <lb/>

            sary in its turn, were not only not at variance with each <lb/>
            other, but that they afforded a mutual aid. For although the <lb/>
            members of philosophy had been obtained from different fac­ <lb/>
            tories, (such as) natural philosophy from the Heracleiteans, <lb/>
            mental from the Pythagoreans, and moral from the very foun­ <lb/>
            tain of Socrates, yet from them all he formed one body, and, <lb/>
            as it were, of his own begetting. But as the chiefs of these <lb/>
            families (of Philosophy) had delivered to their auditors their <lb/>
            sentiments in unpolished (language) and a rudimental (form), <lb/>
            Plato rendered them perfect and even to be admired by polish­ <lb/>

            honourable dress of lofty diction. [4.] Many of his hearers, <lb/>
            belonging to either sex, flourished as philosophers. He left <lb/>
            behind him his patrimony, consisting of a small garden, ad­ <lb/>
            joining the Academy, and 1two slaves, and a goblet,' with <lb/>
            which he made supplications to the gods ; and of gold so <lb/>
            much, as he had worn, when a boy, in his ear,2 to mark his <lb/>
            (noble birth). Some evil-disposed persons carp indeed at his <lb/>
            three journeys to Sicily, and discuss them with opinions at <lb/>
            variance with each other. But he went thither 3 the first time <lb/>
            for the sake of information, that he might understand the na­ <lb/>

          <p>[5.] Plato considers the principles of (all) things to be three- <lb/>
            God, Matter, and the Forms of Things, which he calls 'Ideae, <lb/>
            (Ideas,) that are incomplete, shapeless, (and) distinguished by <lb/>
            no mark of species and quality. But of God his sentiments <lb/>
            are that he is incorporeal.1 He alone, says (Plato), is 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπερί­ <lb/>
            μετρος</foreign>, (without a circumference,)2 the father and adorner3 of <lb/>
            all things, blessed (himself) and the cause of blessings (to <lb/>
            others), the very best, in want of nothing himself, (and) con­ <lb/>
            ferring all things (upon all); whom he calls the heavenly, <lb/>
            the ineffable, the riot-to-be-named, or, as he says himself, <lb/>
            4<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂρρητον ἀκατωνόμαϭτον</foreign>;4 whose nature it is difficult to dis­ <lb/>
            cover ; and, if discovered, it cannot be proclaimed to the <lb/>
            many. 5 [The words of Plato are these, <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεὸν εὑρει̃ν τε ἔργον, <lb/>
            εὑρόντα δὲ εἰς πολλοὺς ἐκΦέρειν ἀδύνατον</foreign>. ] 5 But of Matter he <lb/>
            makes mention as unable to create, and to be destroyed, and <lb/>
            that it is neither Fire, nor Water, nor any other of the princi­ <lb/>
            ples and positive elements; but that of all things it is the <lb/>
            first recipient of forms, and subjective to the act of making; <lb/>
            (and) being as yet shapeless and devoid of the quality of <lb/>

            to Water; but that the triangle with equal feet4 forms out of <lb/>
            itself a square, and the square 5a cube, which is peculiar to <lb/>
            the Earth.5 On which account he gave to Fire the movable <lb/>

            that not only no portion of these is left without the World, <lb/>

          <p>Of gods he enumerates three kinds; of which the first is <lb/>
            that one and alone the highest, who is beyond the World, and <lb/>
            incorporeal; whom we have shown above to be the father and <lb/>
            architect of this divine World; another is such as the stars <lb/>
            possess, and the rest of the deities, whom we call the heaven­ <lb/>
            inhabiting ; the third embraces1 those, whom the old Ro­ <lb/>
            mans2 called " Medioxumi," because they are, with relation to <lb/>
            themselves and place and power, inferior to the highest gods, <lb/>
            but naturally superior to man.</p>
          <p>[12.] But all things which are carried on naturally, and <lb/>
            on that account correctly, are governed by the guardianship <lb/>
            of Providence: 3nor can the cause of any evil be ascribed <lb/>
            to God;3 on which account 4(Plato) conceives that not all <lb/>
            things are to be referred to the lot of Fate.4 For he gives <lb/>
            this definition, that Providence is a divine determination, <lb/>
            the conservator of the prosperity of that, for the sake of <lb/>
            which it has undertaken such an office ; (and) that Fate <lb/>
            is a divine law, by which the inevitable designs of, and the <lb/>
            acts commenced by, the deity are fulfilled. And hence, if <lb/>
            any thing is done by Providence, it is done likewise by Fate; <lb/>
            and that, which is finished by Fate, should seem to have been <lb/>
            commenced5 by Providence. Now the first Providence is <lb/>
            that of the highest (power) and the most above all the gods; <lb/>
            who has ordained not only the deities, that dwell in heaven, <lb/>
            whom he has dispersed to be 6a guard and glory6 through all <note type="footnote"> that Apuleius obtained his knowledge of the doctrines of Plato from <lb/>

            in wisdom to the rest of beings that live upon earth; and, <lb/>
            after laying down laws, he delivered over to the other deities <lb/>
            the disposition and guardianship of the other matters, which <lb/>
            were necessary to be done daily. From whence so strenuously <lb/>
            did the deities of the second providence keep their hold of <lb/>
            the providence undertaken by them, that all things, 3 which <lb/>
            are shown to mortals from heaven,3 preserve the state of the <lb/>
            father's arrangement unchanged. But the Daemons, whom <lb/>
            we might call Genii and Lares, (Plato) decides are the <lb/>
            servants of the gods, and the protectors of man, and their <lb/>
            interpreters,4 should they wish for any thing from the gods. <lb/>
            Nor does he think that all things are to be referred to the <lb/>
            force of Fate ; but that there is something in ourselves, <lb/>
            and something too in Fortune. He confesses, however, that <lb/>
            the unforeseen5 accidents of Fortune are not known to us; for <lb/>
            that something unsteady and running against us is wont to <lb/>
            come between the affairs, which may have been undertaken <lb/>
            with design and meditation, so that it does not permit, what <lb/>
            has been thought upon, to come to an end. And when that <lb/>
            impediment arrives advantageously, the circumstance is called <lb/>
            Good Fortune; but Misfortune, when those hinderances are <lb/>

          <p>[13.] Of all earthly things, nothing more excellent has <lb/>

          <p>In the first place, the twin pupils of the eyes are very clear, <lb/>
            and, shining with a certain light of vision, they possess the <lb/>
            office of knowing light; while hearing, by partaking of the <lb/>
            nature of air, has a perception of sounds, through messengers <lb/>
            in the air; whereas the taste, being a sense more relaxed, is <lb/>
            on that account suited to things rather moist and watery; but <lb/>
            the touch, as being of the earth and corporeal, perceives <lb/>
            things, that are rather solid, and which can be handled and <lb/>
            struck against. Of those things likewise, which are changed, <lb/>
            when corrupted 1 there is a separate perception. 1 For in the <lb/>
            middle of the region of the face Nature has placed the nostrils, <lb/>
            by 2the double door-way2 of which there passes an odour to­ <lb/>
            gether with the breath; and that conversions and changes <lb/>
            furnish the causes of smelling; and that they3 are perceived <lb/>
            from substances, when corrupted or burnt, or in a mucous4 <lb/>
            or moistened state; 5when those substances are sought out, <lb/>
            they are exhaled in vapour and smoke, the judgment and <lb/>

            of the constellations, and he understands their distances, to­ <lb/>

            agree with, and respond to, each other, so that the firmness of <lb/>
            mind be not inferior to the very strong powers of the body. <lb/>
            The body however is increased then by natural increments <lb/>
            when the portion of good health, being attended to 3with skil­ <lb/>
            ful art,3 knows not to exceed the measure of necessary living ; <lb/>
            and when health is not worn down by the greatness of exter­ <lb/>
            nal labours, nor by the weight of food introduced too immoder­ <lb/>
            ately, or not digested and distributed through the body as it <lb/>
            should be. For then the joints and limbs retain the measure and <lb/>
            force of due vigour, when that, which is introduced for the pre­ <lb/>
            servation of the whole body, is distributed to all the parts, as it <lb/>
            were in equal proportions for each ; but when that takes place <lb/>
            in the least degree, then ensues the destruction of the body. <note type="footnote"> 1_1 Compare Tim. p. 86, B. </note><note type="footnote">2_2 Compare Tim. p. 88, B. </note><note type="footnote"> 3_3 I have translated, as if Apuleius had written "solerti arte—” not <lb/>

            <title type="sub">ON MORAL PHILOSOPHY.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>[1.] THE head1 of Moral Philosophy is, son2 Faustinus, <lb/>
            that you may know, by what means it is possible to arrive at <lb/>
            a happy life. But previous to the other matters, which 3are <lb/>
            known to appertain3 to happiness, which is the end4 of good <lb/>
            things, I will show what Plato thinks upon this point.</p>
          <p>Of good things then he thought that some were pre-emi­ <lb/>
            nently so, and in themselves the first; but the rest he conceived <lb/>
            were good through a participation.5 The first good things are <lb/>
            God, the highest, and that mind, which he calls <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νου̃ς</foreign> ; secondly, <lb/>
            the things, which flow from the fountain of the first,6 are the <lb/>
            virtues of the mind, (namely,) Prudence, Justice, Modesty,7 <lb/>
            (and) Fortitude, but that amongst all these Prudence is the <lb/>
            superior; but as the second in number and power he laid <lb/>
            down Continence; to these succeeds Justice; (while) Fortitude <lb/>
            is the fourth. <note type="footnote"> 1 I have written " head " in the sense in which Shakspeare uses that <lb/>
            word in Othello, " The very head and front of my offending." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 It has been thought that Faustinus was not a son, but a disciple of <lb/>
            Apuleius. • </note><note type="footnote"> 3_3 I have translated, as if, instead of " contingerent," found in one <lb/>
            MS., the reading were originally " contingere nota—” similar to "notum <lb/>
            properare ” in Horace, according to the correction of Bentley; while (4) <lb/>
            in lieu of “ fine," I have adopted " finem," the emendation of Bosscha, <lb/>
            who understood by that word what Cicero does in his treatise " De <lb/>
            Finibus Bonorum et Malorum." Hildebrand, unable to find a better <lb/>
            reading, retains the one in MS. Flor., "bonorum finem contingere—” </note><note type="footnote"> 5 In lieu of "per perceptionem," in one MS., and per receptionem " in <lb/>
            another, I have translated, as if the text were " per participationem," <lb/>
            which it is strange that Floridus did not suggest, who aptly refers to the <lb/>
            expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατὰ</foreign> in Alcinous, § 27. </note><note type="footnote"> 6 Instead of " priorum," one would have expected " primorum," as un­ <lb/>

            tinentiam," is in Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">σωφροσύνη</foreign>, commonly rendered “Temperance;” <lb/>
            and the four are called the Cardinal Virtues. With regard to the order <lb/>
            of the words, Oudendorp observes that " Pudicitiam " should precede <lb/>
            " Justitiam," as shown by the following enumeration. But Plato, in Legg. <lb/>
            i. p. 630, B. § 5, has <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικαιοσύνη καὶ σωφροσύνη καὶ φρόνησις</foreign>. </note></p><pb n="347"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> c. 2, 3.] </note> In good things likewise lie made this distinction; 1 that <lb/>
            some are of God 2and in themselves the first,2 and are called <lb/>
            simple goods ; others are of man ; nor are the same good things <lb/>
            thought to be so by all; on which account the virtues of the <lb/>
            mind are of God and simple; but those of man, which are <lb/>
            goods in the opinion of some, are such as agree with the con­ <lb/>
            veniences of the body, and are what we call external; which <lb/>
            to the wise3 and those, who live rationally and moderately, are <lb/>
            really good, but must needs be evils to the unwise and to those <lb/>
            who are ignorant of their use.</p>
          <p>[2.] The first good is the true, and divine, and best, and <lb/>
            worthy to be loved and desired; and for the beauty of which <lb/>
            the minds, that are under the influence of reason, have a <lb/>
            longing, under the guidance of Nature, and are by the same <lb/>
            power lit up to an ardent love for it. But as not all are able to <lb/>
            obtain it, nor can possess the faculty of acquiring the first good, <lb/>
            they are carried on to that, which is of man. The second good <lb/>
            is not common to many, nor is it in a similar manner a good <lb/>
            to all. For the longing after, and the desire to do any thing is <lb/>
            excited either by a true good, or by what seems to be a good ; <lb/>
            from whence under the guidance of Nature there is a certain <lb/>
            affinity between good things and that portion of the soul, which <lb/>
            agrees with reason. But he considers that to be a good by <lb/>
            accident, which is united to the body and to things that come <lb/>
            from without, and that he, who is imbued by Nature to follow <lb/>
            what is good, thinks be has been 4 born not only for himself,4 <lb/>
            but for all men likewise; and that each one has been conceived5 <lb/>
            not 6 in an equal or similar manner,6 but for the state; and <lb/>
            next for those nearest to him; and then for the rest, who are <lb/>
            united to him by familiarity or acquaintance.</p>

            from his stock, nor bad, but that his disposition inclines to <lb/>
            both ; that he has indeed some seeds of both, which are united <lb/>
            to the origin of his birth, but which, by the discipline of <lb/>
            education, ought to burst out into another 1 part; and that the <lb/>
            instructors of boys ought to have no greater care than to <lb/>
            thoroughly imbue them with morals and instructions, so that <lb/>
            they may wish to become lovers of virtues, and learn to <lb/>
            rule and be ruled by Justice as their mistress. On which <lb/>
            account the boys ought to be brought to this point,2 beside all <lb/>
            the rest, that they may know that the things which are to <lb/>
            be followed and avoided, are honourable and dishonourable; <lb/>
            that to the former belong 3 pleasure and praise ; to the latter <lb/>
            disgrace and baseness;3 (and) that we ought with confidence <lb/>
            to wish for the honourable things which are good.</p>
          <p>Of dispositions three kinds are classed by him; of which <lb/>
            he calls one the superior and pre-eminent; another, the most <lb/>
            foul and the worst; the third, which is tempered moderately <lb/>
            from both, he calls a mean. In this mean he desires to be <lb/>
            partakers the docile boy and the man, who is making a pro­ <lb/>
            gress to moderation, and who is 4mild in his manner4 and <lb/>
            elegant; since he asserted that a mean of the same kind, <lb/>
            (called) a third something, occurs in the case of virtues and <lb/>
            vices; through which some acts are to be praised and others <lb/>
            blamed. 5(Thus) between knowledge, (of one kind) firm, of an­ <lb/>
            other false, there is an obstinacy (of mind) united to a vanity;5 <note type="footnote"> I Here again I am at a loss about the meaning of " alteram—” The <lb/>
            train of thought requires rather " melioratam," or " præstantiorem-” </note><note type="footnote"> 2 I have translated, as if the text were “præter cætera—ad hoc," not <lb/>
            "hos," which I cannot understand. Hildebrand too has " ad hoc—” </note><note type="footnote"> 3_3 Such is the literal version of the text of Oudendorp. But the <lb/>
            balance of the sentences evidently requires not " illa voluptatis ac laudis, <lb/>
            hæc vero dedecoris ac turpitudinis," but something like " illa veræ vo­ <lb/>
            luptatis ac laudis; hæc dedecoris ac ægritudinis,” for thus “veræ volup­ <lb/>
            tatis” would be balanced by " ægritudinis—” and the pleasure" <lb/>
            arising from honourable acts be properly called " true,” as being mentally <lb/>
            opposed to the not-true pleasure of acts not honourable. Hildebrand <lb/>
            conceives the whole passage to be so corrupt, as to defy correction, ex­ <lb/>

            ness2 as the means between fortitude and fear. Since of those <lb/>
            persons, whom he wished to appear moderate, neither the vir­ <lb/>
            tues were sincere, nor the vices sheer and untempered, but <lb/>
            mixed up on this side and on that.</p>
          <p>[4.] But the wickedness of. a person stained with all vices <lb/>
            he said was the worst; which, he asserted, took place, when <lb/>
            that portion, which is the best and rationable, and ought to <lb/>
            rule the rest, was the slave of others; (and) when those <lb/>
            leaders into vices, namely, anger and lust, are the lords, <lb/>
            while reason is sent under the yoke. From things likewise <lb/>
            quite different, (such as) abundance and want,3 is wicked­ <lb/>
            ness made up. Nor by the fault of an inequality alone does <lb/>
            he consider that wickedness goes halting, but that 4 it falls <lb/>
            upon a dissimilitude; 4 for it could not agree with goodness, <lb/>
            since it differs in so many ways from itself; and carries be­ <lb/>
            fore it not an inequality, but an incongruity. On which ac­ <lb/>
            count he says that the three portions of the soul are pressed <lb/>
            by three vices. (Thus) against prudence fights indocility, <lb/>
            which not only introduces the destruction of science, but is <lb/>
            adverse to the discipline of learning. Of this indocility we <note type="footnote"> vanity. I have therefore translated, as if Apuleius had written " Ita <lb/>

            been easily lost before another; and "junctam mentis inter" corrupted <lb/>
            into "jactatam inter—” Hildebrand, objecting to "validam," would <lb/>
            read " ruditum " in the sense of " ruditatem;" and conceives that <lb/>
            " alteram " is a corruption of some word, that had the meaning of " col­ <lb/>

            "chastity" and " lustfulness," I cannot understand. Opportunely then <lb/>
            do some MSS. read " abstinentiam et temperantiam;" for from both <lb/>

            but fixes them down by a stupor not to be moved. To the <lb/>
            feelings of desire he applies luxuriousness, that is, a longing <lb/>
            after pleasures, and insatiable draughts of things desired,6 <lb/>
            7for enjoyment and possession.7 From this luxuriousness <lb/>
            there flows avarice and wantonness ; of which the former <lb/>
            puts a restraint upon liberality; the latter, 8by living too im­ <lb/>

            in deeds likewise, agreeing with himself and the rest (of man­ <lb/>

            ever in subjection and under the rein ; and they 1 so obey it, <lb/>
            as to do their ministering tranquilly. (He says), however, <lb/>
            that virtue is of one form, because that, which is good by its <lb/>
            own nature, has no need of assistance; but, that it may be <lb/>
            perfect, it ought to be content with solitude. 2 Nor is quality <lb/>
            alone united to the natural disposition of virtue, but simili­ <lb/>
            tude likewise;2 for so does it agree with itself on every side, <lb/>
            that it is fitted from itself and answers to itself. Hence he <lb/>
            speaks of virtues as means, and the same too as extremes, not <lb/>
            only because (the former)3 are from redundance and want, <lb/>
            but because they are placed in the middle-ground of virtues. <lb/>
            For example, Fortitude is surrounded on this side by Bold­ <lb/>
            ness, on that by Timidity. Now Boldness comes from the <lb/>
            abundance of confidence, but Fear from the fault of a defi­ <lb/>
            cient Boldness. * * *</p>
          <p>[6.] Of Virtues, some are perfect, others imperfect. Now <lb/>
            those are imperfect, which by the kindness of Nature alone come <lb/>
            forth in all, or are furnished by discipline alone, or are taught <lb/>
            by Reason, as a mistress. Those therefore, that are made up <lb/>
            of all,4 we say are perfect. He denies, (however,) 5that im­ <lb/>
            perfect virtues accompany themselves ;5 but those, which are <lb/>
            perfect, he conceives on that account especially to be insepar­ <lb/>
            able and united to each other, because for the person, who <lb/>
            has an uncommon natural disposition, if there be added in­ <lb/>
            dustry, practice, and the discipline which Reason, the ruler of <lb/>

            of which he wishes for Wisdom to appear as the instruction <lb/>

            of understanding good and evil things, and those which are <lb/>
            between the two. In that part then, which is considered as <lb/>
            given rather to anger, is the seat of Fortitude and the strength <lb/>
            of the soul, and the nerves, required for fulfilling those things, <lb/>

            </note>[9.] Now this same (Statesman's) art has a care for the usefulness of the soul by two methods. One 1 relates to law­ <lb/>
            giving,2 the other1 to law-courts.2 The former is similar <lb/>
            to the exercise, by which is acquired the beauty and strength <lb/>
            of the soul, j ust as by exercise the health and beauty of the <lb/>
            body is preserved : but that relating to law-courts is on a par <lb/>
            with medicine; for it cures the diseases of the soul, as medicine <lb/>
            does those of the body. These he calls disciplines, and pro­ <lb/>
            fesses that an attention to them brings a very great advantage ; <lb/>
            while their imitators are the arts of cookery and perfumery; <lb/>
            but that the sophist's art, and the bland profession of the law, <lb/>
            and the allurements of flattery, are disgraceful to those, who <lb/>
            profess them, useless to all; of which arts he unites that of <lb/>
            the sophist to that of the cook. For as the art of the cook <lb/>
            sometimes catches the (good) opinion of the imprudent by its <lb/>
            professing medical science, as if the things, which it is doing, <lb/>
            are suited to the cure of disorders; so the art of the sophist, <lb/>
            by imitating the manner of law-courts, furnishes to fools a <lb/>
            (good) opinion, as if that art were attending to j ustice, which <lb/>
            it is clear is favouring iniquity; whereas the professors3 of law <lb/>
            imitate the art of the perfumer; for while this wishes to be <lb/>
            the remedy, through which beauty and health are preserved in <lb/>
            bodies, it not only diminishes the usefulness of the body, but <lb/>
            breaks down its strength and powers, and changes the true <lb/>
            colour of the blood to slothfulness ;4 so that, by imitating the <note type="footnote">1, 1 How the feminine " altera " can be thus introduced with reference <lb/>

          <p>He thinks (moreover) that those virtues can be taught and <lb/>
            studied, which appertain to a rationable soul, that is to say, <lb/>
            Wisdom and Prudence; and that those, which in the place of <lb/>
            a remedy offer a resistance to the portions (of the soul),1 that <lb/>
            are corrupt, namely, Fortitude and Continence, are rationable. <lb/>
            Now the Virtues before mentioned are held to be in the place of <lb/>
            discipline; the rest, if they are perfect, he calls virtues; (but) <lb/>
            if only half-perfect,2 he conceives they ought not indeed to <lb/>
            be called disciplines, nor yet does he consider them to be <lb/>
            entirely strangers to discipline. But Justice, in that 3it is <lb/>
            scattered amongst three parts of the soul,3 he imagines to be <lb/>
            the art of living and a discipline; and that is at one time <lb/>
            teachable, and at another proceeds from use and experience.</p>
          <p>[10.] Of good things some he 4 asserts are to be sought for the <lb/>
            sake of themselves, as for example, happiness, and a pleasure <lb/>
            that is good; others, for not their own sake, as medicine; <lb/>
            others, for the sake both of themselves and something else, as <lb/>
            forethought, and the rest of virtues, which we seek after, <lb/>
            both for their own sake, as being in themselves excellent and <lb/>
            honourable; and for the sake of something else, that is to say, <lb/>
            of happiness, which is the fruit of virtue the most to be <lb/>
            wished for.4 On this ground some bad things are to be <lb/>
            avoided for the sake of themselves; others, for the sake of <lb/>
            other things ; (but) the majority, (for the sake) of themselves <lb/>
            and of other things, as for example, folly, and vices of that <lb/>

            to all to be evils, when they are a hurt or an obstacle, as for <lb/>

            sake; in like manner how can he, who shall have perceived <lb/>
            that vices not only bring disgrace upon reputation, but do a <lb/>
            hurt in another manner, and are guilty of a fraud, be able to <lb/>
            unite himself of his own accord to their fellowship ? But if <lb/>
            he proceeds to evil things of that kind, and believes that the use <lb/>
            of them is advantageous to himself, through his being deceived <lb/>

            a dissimilarity in manners and a difference in life, and sects, <lb/>
            and opposite dispositions. There are likewise, he says, other <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin">c. 14, 15.]</note> [14.] Of Loves of this kind Plato numbers three; because <lb/>
            there is one, divine, agreeing with a mind uncorrupted and the <lb/>
            method of virtue, (and) not to be repented of; another, per­ <lb/>
            taining to a degenerate mind, and to pleasure the most cor­ <lb/>
            rupt ; the third, mixed up with both, belonging to a mediocre <lb/>
            disposition and of moderate desires; but souls of a darker <lb/>
            hue (he says) are impelled by a longing for the body, and <lb/>
            that their only aim is to enjoy the use of it and to soften <lb/>
            down their heart, by a pleasure and gratification of that kind. <lb/>
            I But these are the acts of an elegant and well-educated mind, 1 <lb/>
            to love passionately the souls of the good, and to make them a <lb/>
            study, and to wish it done, that they should indulge as much <lb/>
            as possible in good pursuits and be rendered better and su­ <lb/>
            perior. The mean between the two (he says) is formed of <lb/>
            both ; so that they are not entirely void of bodily gratifica­ <lb/>
            tions, and yet are able to be caught by an elegant disposition of <lb/>
            soul. As then that Love is inferred to be the most filthy and the <lb/>
            least human and base, not from the nature of things, but from <lb/>
            a bodily sickness and disease, so it may be believed that the <lb/>
            divine (Love) comes into the minds of men, when it is granted <lb/>
            by the gift and kindness of the gods, and by the breath of a ce­ <lb/>
            lestial Cupid. There is too a third kind of Love, which we <lb/>
            have mentioned as a mean. It is brought together by the <lb/>
            proximity of what is divine and earthly ; and since it is united <lb/>
            2by the connexion of a joint state amongst like persons,2 it is, <lb/>
            as3 being near to reason, the divine one; but4 the earthly, as <lb/>
            being united 5to baseness and the longing after pleasure.5</p>

            and not even to himself; but that he, whom no excess of <lb/>
            wickedness can go beyond, appears to be the worst of all.2 <lb/>
            (He says too) that such a person can never find a way for <lb/>
            himself in the conduct of affairs, not merely on account of his <lb/>
            ignorance, but because he knows not himself, and because <lb/>
            thorough wickedness produces an unsettling in the mind, by <lb/>
            impeding that person's designs, when commenced and re­ <lb/>

            them by no violence. Such a person it behoves not only to <lb/>
            inflict no injury, but even not to return it. For he does not <lb/>
            consider that to be an act of contumely, which a wicked man <lb/>

            ought to appear the most wealthy indeed, since he alone is <lb/>
            able to rule over (wealth)1 for necessary uses. For the rest <lb/>

            use, or apply them to the worst purposes. For it is not the <lb/>
            absence of money, that gives birth to want, but the presence of <lb/>
            immoderate desires. It behoves (then)2 the philosopher, if <lb/>
            he will be in want of nothing, and the despiser of, and supe­ <lb/>
            rior to, all those things, which men consider bitter to be <lb/>
            borne, to do nothing otherwise,3 than to endeavour constantly <lb/>
            to separate the soul from its fellowship with the body. And <lb/>
            hence Philosophy is to be deemed a desire for death and a <lb/>
            habit of dying.</p>
          <p>[22.] It is meet for all good men to be friends amongst <lb/>
            themselves, even if they are little known (to each other); <lb/>
            and they are to be considered friends by that power, through <lb/>
            which their manners and tenets agree; since like is not ab­ <lb/>
            horrent from like. From hence it is clear that the fidelity <lb/>
            of friendship can exist amongst the good alone. (Now) wis­ <lb/>
            dom makes that young man a sedulous4 lover of good, who <lb/>
            by the goodness of his disposition is rather ready (to learn) <lb/>
            good arts. Nor will a deformity of body be able to drive <lb/>
            away such a desire. For when the soul itself is pleasing, the <lb/>

            But neither for the sake of the dead ought lamentations to be <lb/>
            indulged in, since we know that the party has suffered no evil; <lb/>
            and, if he had been with good feelings, that he is added to the <lb/>

            any thing can he be in want of virtue, of which he claims for <lb/>
            himself the perpetual possession. The wise man, therefore, <lb/>
            will not be sad.</p>
          <p>[23.] The aim (then) of wisdom is that the wise man may <lb/>
            by his merits1 be carried up to god ;2 3and this is about to be <lb/>
            all his study, says (Plato),3 that he may by the emulation of <lb/>
            his life approach to the doings of the gods. Now this will be <lb/>
            able to happen to him, if he shows himself a man perfectly <lb/>
            just, pious, (and) prudent. From whence, not only in the <lb/>
            knowledge of looking forward, but in the labour of acting, <lb/>
            it is fitting for him to follow those things, which are approved <lb/>
            of by gods and men; since the highest of the gods not only <lb/>
            thinks upon all this Universe through the reasoning of his <lb/>
            reflections, but undertakes the first, the middle, and the last, <lb/>
            and regulates what has been discovered thoroughly, by the <lb/>
            universality and constancy of a provident arrangement.</p>
          <p>Moreover, (he says) that the person4 appears to be happy <lb/>
            to all, to whom good is supplied, and who knows in what <lb/>
            manner he ought to be free from vices. Now one kind of <lb/>
            happiness is, when we protect by the presence of our talents, <lb/>
            what we are doing; another, when nothing is wanting to the <lb/>
            perfection of life, and we are content with the mere contem­ <lb/>
            plation of it. Now of each kind of happiness the source flows <lb/>
            from virtue. But for the adornment 5of the genial place,5 or <note type="footnote"> 1, 2 I have adopted " meritis," found in ed. pr., and changed " dei " <lb/>

            virtue, we need none of these aids from without, which we <lb/>
            deem to be good. But for the uses of ordinary life there is a <lb/>
            need of the care of the body, and of the protection of these <lb/>
            things, which come from without; yet however in suchwise, <lb/>
            that they may become better by virtue, and by its assistance <lb/>
            be united to the advantages of happiness, without which they <lb/>
            are least of all to be held in the place of good things. Nor <lb/>
            is it in vain, that virtue alone can make persons most happy; <lb/>
            since without it happiness cannot be found from other pros­ <lb/>
            perous affairs. Since we say that the wise man is a foot­ <lb/>
            follower and imitator of god, and we fancy that he does follow <lb/>
            the deity. For this does the saying1 mean, "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Επου θεῳ̃</foreign>, " Fol­ <lb/>
            low god." Now not only does it behove him, while he in­ <lb/>
            habits (this) life, to speak words worthy of the gods,2 and not <lb/>
            to do those acts, which are displeasing to their majesty; but <lb/>
            at that time likewise, when he is leaving the body, which he <lb/>
            will not do, against the will of god.3 For though the power <lb/>
            over death is in his hand, (and) though he knows that, by <lb/>
            leaving the things of earth, he shall obtain what are better, <lb/>
            still he ought not to bring death upon himself, unless the <lb/>
            divine law shall decree that he must of necessity suffer it; <lb/>
            and,' if the adornments of his previously-passed life do him <lb/>
            honour, still it behoves him to be more honourable, 4 and the <lb/>
            lover of a favourable report, when, careless of the life of his <lb/>
            posterity, he permits his soul to pass to immortality, and an­ <lb/>
            ticipates, because he has lived piously, that it will inhabit the <lb/>
            places of the blest, and mingle with the choirs of the gods <lb/>
            and demi-gods.</p>
          <p>[24.] Respecting the constitution of states, and the preserv­ <lb/>

            ors, bringing, when united, 2aid and assistance2 to each other <lb/>
            in turn, and regulating their duties by the same and correct <lb/>
            laws; and a state would be one, 3like a villa,3 under the <lb/>
            same walls, if4 the minds of the inhabitants are accustomed <lb/>
            5to like and dislike the same things.5 On which account we <lb/>
            must persuade the founders of commonwealths, that they in­ <lb/>

            that6 all may be known to the same ruler, and not unknown <lb/>

            be valued, 9with a bad heart and impotence, but when men, <lb/>

            so take care of food and living for themselves, as to waste on <lb/>
            common feasts the money they may receive from those whom <lb/>
            they protect. Marriages too (he says) 2 are not to be entered <lb/>

            they may see of that age, to be their own, and all become, as <lb/>
            it were, the parents of all the children in common. Of these <lb/>
            marriages there is sought at a proper time the union ; of which <lb/>
            he believes 6 the fidelity will be firm, if the number of the days <lb/>
            accords with the harmony of music; while they, who are born <lb/>
            of such marriages, will be imbued with fitting studies, and <lb/>

            the principles of the origin of a state and its foundations, he <lb/>
            discusses, not in his own name,5 its situation 6 and advantages, <lb/>

            viduals too may have houses and private property, as they may <lb/>

            to most persons to contain three kinds or parts, relating to <lb/>
            Nature, (and) Morals, and Reasoning, of which (last) I now <lb/>
            propose to speak, and in which is comprehended the art of <lb/>

            " tyrannis illa et singularis (for so one MS.) dominationis caput—” <lb/>
            Perhaps Apuleius wrote " tyranni vis, belluæ similis, et singulare domi­ <lb/>
            nationis caput—” i. e. " the force of a tyrant, like to a wild beast-and <lb/>
            the individual head of lordly rule." </note><note type="footnote"> 2—2 I have translated, as if the text were " simili illegum conjura­ <lb/>

            This is called enunciable, when it comprehends an absolute <lb/>

            or falsehood;6 which Sergius calls "Effatum" (an expres­ <lb/>
            sion) ; 7Varro, " proloquium " (a fore-speaking) ; Cicero, <lb/>
            “enuntiatum” (an enunciation); 7 the Greeks, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πϱότασιν</foreign> (a fore­ <lb/>

              For you substitute a condition, through which a person, un­ <lb/>
              less he is wise, is not happy. (But) we will now speak of <lb/>
              the Predicative, which naturally precedes, and is, as it were, <lb/>
              the element (i. e. the principle) of the Substitutive.</p>
          <p>There are likewise other differences, (namely) of Quantity <lb/>
            and Quality. Of Quantity, in that some are General; as <lb/>
            " Every breathing thing is alive; others Particular, as " Some <lb/>
            animals do not breathe;" others Undefined, as "Animal <lb/>
            breathes;" for the assertion does not define, whether it is <lb/>
            every one, or some one. 1Nevertheless it always avails in the <lb/>
            place of a Particular; because it is more safe to admit from <lb/>
            what is uncertain that, which is less.1 But of Quality, in <lb/>
            that some are Affirmative; 2 because they affirm something <lb/>
            about something, as " Virtue is a good;" for it affirms that <lb/>
            there is goodness in Virtue; others Negative,3 as " Virtue is <lb/>
            not a good;" for it denies that there is goodness in Virtue. <lb/>
            The Stoics consider this too an Affirmative, when they say <lb/>
            " It happens to a certain pleasure to be not a good." It <lb/>
            affirms therefore, what happens to it, that is, what it is. For <lb/>
            that reason, they say, it is Affirmative, because it affirms <lb/>
            there is in that thing, in which it has denied there is that, <lb/>
            which does not seem to be in it; but they call that alone <lb/>
            Negative, to which a negative particle is prefixed. Now <lb/>
            these will be beaten4 as well in other points as in this, should <lb/>
            a person make this inquiry, 5 " That, which has not substance, <lb/>
            does not exist." For they will be compelled, according to <note type="footnote"> 1—1 Such is the literal version of words, which, I confess, I do not <lb/>
            understand. Martianus Capella, who evidently drew from the same source <lb/>

            in iv. § 396, more intelligibly—“ Quod igitur indefinite dicimus, necessario <lb/>

          <p>[3.] A proposition, says Plato in the Theætetus,1 consists of <lb/>
            two parts of speech, a noun and verb, in the fewest words, as <lb/>
            “ Apuleius discusses;" which is either true or false; and is <lb/>
            therefore a proposition. From whence some2 have laid it <lb/>
            down, that there are only those two parts of speech; because <lb/>
            from those alone can be formed a perfect speech, that is, one <lb/>
            which includes a sentence entirely ; and that adverbs and <lb/>
            pronouns and participles and conjunctions, and the rest of <lb/>
            things of that kind, which Grammarians enumerate, are no <lb/>
            more the parts of speech than are the (parts) of ships their <lb/>
            ornaments, or of men their hairs; but3 that in the whole <lb/>
            framework of a speech they are certainly to be reckoned in <lb/>
            the place of bolts and pitch and glue. Moreover, of the two <lb/>
            parts before-mentioned one is called the Subjective,4 as if it <lb/>
            were placed under, as "Apuleius;" the other the Declara­ <lb/>
            tive,5 as " discusses," or “ discusses not;" for it declares what <lb/>
            Apuleius is doing. It is permissible, however, while the <lb/>
            meaning remains the same, to extend each part to more <lb/>
            words; as if, instead of " Apuleius," you should say, " the <lb/>
            Platonic philosopher of Madaura;" and in like manner, in­ <lb/>
            stead of " discussing," you should say that " he is making use <lb/>
            of a speech." For the most part the Subject is the minor <note type="footnote"> 1 The passage alluded to is not, I think, in the Theætetus, but in the <lb/>
            Sophist, p. 262, C. § 103, where the Stranger, while conversing with <lb/>
            Theætetus, says that words cannot express an act, or the existence of <lb/>
            any thing, unless a person mixes up verbs with nouns; and then, if they <lb/>
            have been fitted properly, their combination becomes a speech, nearly of <lb/>

              (in a proposition), and the Predicate the major, inasmuch as <lb/>
              it embraces not only this Subject, but others likewise. For <lb/>
              not only does Apuleius discuss, but many others who can be <lb/>
              comprehended under the same Predicate ; unless perchance a <lb/>
              peculiarity belonging to something is predicated of it; as if <lb/>
              you should say, " That, which is a horse, is able to neigh;” <lb/>
              now "to neigh " is peculiar to a horse. Hence in these pe­ <lb/>
              culiarities equal is the Predicate, and equal too the Subject; <lb/>
              but not, as in other cases, (the former,)' is the major; since, <lb/>
              when2 the same proposition might conversely become the Sub­ <lb/>
              ject, and have as the Predicate of itself that, which it had <lb/>
              previously as the Subject; as if, by changing the order,3 you <lb/>
              should say, " That, which is able to neigh, is a horse." But <lb/>
              you would not be able to convert in like manner the terms, <lb/>
              when they are unequal. For, not because it is true that <lb/>
              " Every man is an animal," will it on that account be true, if <lb/>
              you convert the terms, that " Every animal is a man." For <lb/>
              it is not as peculiar to a man to be an animal, as it is to a <lb/>
              horse to neigh; since there are other animals without num­ <lb/>
              ber. Hence the Predicate is known in many ways ; although <lb/>
              the question be proposed in a converse order. First, because <lb/>
              the Predicate can embrace more things than the Subject; <lb/>
              next, because it is never ended by a Noun, but always by a <lb/>
              Verb; by which especially it is distinguished even in the <lb/>
              peculiarities alluded to from an equal Subject. This likewise <lb/>
              is to be considered in the way of a comparison, that as pro­ <lb/>
              positions 4 (taken as a whole) 4 are both definite and indefinite, <lb/>
              so it is agreed that portions of them, Subjective as well as <lb/>
              Declarative, are partly defined, as "man" (and) "animal," <lb/>
              and partly undefined, as “ not a man " (and) " not an animal." <lb/>
              For they do not define what a thing is, when (they say) it <lb/>
              is not, but merely show that there is something else be­ <lb/>

              who confirms either of (the so-called One or the other)3 never <lb/>
              refutes the other; while4 he, who refutes the other confirms <lb/>
              either of the (so-called) 5 One or the other.5 But when either <lb/>
              of the Universals is proved, it confirms its own Particular; <lb/>
              but when it is refuted, it does not weaken it; and conversely, <lb/>
              when either of the Particulars is refuted, it weakens its own <lb/>
              Universal; but, when it is proved, it does not confirm it. <lb/>
              Now that all this is so, as we assert, that, which is delineated <lb/>
              below,6 easily shows from the propositions themselves. For <lb/>
              it is ascertained what a person concedes, who shall have made <lb/>
              any proposition.</p>
          <p>[5.] Now either of the Universals is destroyed in three <lb/>
            ways; when its Particular is shown to be false, or either one of <lb/>
            the two others, whether the Disagreeing or the Sub-neutral.7 <lb/>
            But it is supported in one way, if the Sub-neutral8 belonging <note type="footnote"> 1, 2 Such is the literal version of "posuit" and “ tollit;” which the <lb/>

            once suspected, that Apuleius wrote " subneutra, velut alterutra—” just <lb/>

            ported in three ways; if its Universal is true, or either of <lb/>
            the two others is false, whether its Sub-equal or Sub-neuter.</p>
          <p>The same facts we shall observe in the case of Equivalent <lb/>
            propositions. Now those are said to be " Equivalent," <lb/>
            which under another enunciation have an equal power, and <lb/>
            are at the same time true, or at the same time false, one on <lb/>
            account of the other, as the Undefined5 and the Particular. <lb/>
            Moreover every proposition, if it assumes at its commence­ <lb/>
            ment a Negative particle, becomes (as)6 its Sub-alternate <lb/>
            Equivalent; as when there is an Universal Affirmative, " All <lb/>
            pleasure is a good," if a negation be prefixed to it, it will be <lb/>
            " Not all pleasure is a good," having the same meaning as its <lb/>
            Sub-alternate had, " Some pleasure is not a good." And in the <lb/>
            three other propositions the same thing is to be understood.</p>
          <p>[6.] Then with respect to Conversion, an Universal Nega­ <lb/>
            tive and its Sub-alternate, a Particular Affirmative, are said to <lb/>
            be Convertible propositions, on that account, because their <lb/>
            portions, Subjective and Declarative, are able to preserve <lb/>
            always their mutual changes, the condition of truth or false­ <lb/>
            hood still remaining. For as this proposition is true—“ No <lb/>
            prudent man is impious—” so, if you make a change in its <lb/>
            parts, it will be true (to say), " No impious man is prudent." <lb/>
            In like manner, as it is false (to say), " No man is an animal," <lb/>
            so, if you make a change, it will be false (to say), " No animal <lb/>
            is man." By parity of reasoning a Particular Affirmative <lb/>
            becomes Convertible, " A certain grammarian is man," and <note type="footnote"> dita." By referring, however, to the diagram, it would seem that both <lb/>
            " alterutra " and “ subneutra," would be best understood by " the diag­ <lb/>
            onal " or " cross proposition. But I have preferred the word “ Sub- <lb/>
            alternate," adopted in modern Logic, as the translation of "alterutra." </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Since " subneutra" has been used just above in the sense of alter­ <lb/>

            "A certain man is a grammarian." This result the two <lb/>
            other propositions cannot always effect; although they some­ <lb/>
            times undergo a Conversion; nor yet are they on that account <lb/>
            said to be Convertible; for that which sometimes 1 deceives, <lb/>
            is rejected as uncertain.1 Each proposition must therefore <lb/>
            be laid open2 through all its significations, as to whether it <lb/>
            agrees, when it is taken Conversely. 3 Nor are those univer­ <lb/>
            sally true;3 but only five. For either the peculiarity of <lb/>
            something is declared, or its genus, or difference, or 4 defined <lb/>
            limit,4 or accident; nor beyond these (predicates) can any <lb/>
            thing be found in any proposition. For instance, should you <lb/>
            lay down "man" as the subject, you would say something of <lb/>
            him, or mark out a peculiarity of his, as “ being able to <lb/>
            laugh;”5 or his genus, as "an animal;" or his difference, as <lb/>
            " being rational;" or defined limit, as "a mortal animal en­ <lb/>
            dued with reason ;” or accident, as " being an orator." Since <lb/>
            every thing, which is Declarative of any thing, either can, or <lb/>
            cannot, be in turn its Subjective. And if it can, it either <lb/>
            marks out what it is, and is (thus) a defined limit; or it does <lb/>
            not mark out, and is (thus) a peculiarity. But if it cannot, <lb/>
            there is either that, which ought to be placed in the definition, <lb/>
            and (thus) there is a genus or difference ; or what ought not <lb/>
            (to be placed), and is (thus) an accident. Through these <lb/>
            means then it will be known that the Particular Negative is <lb/>
            not convertible. Now the Universal Affirmative is not by <lb/>
            itself convertible; but it can be nevertheless made convertible, <note type="footnote">1—1 So Oudendorp from conjecture. The MSS. vary between " fallitur <lb/>

            as a Particular. For example, when the proposition is, "Every <lb/>
            man is an animal," it cannot be converted, so as to be, "Every <lb/>
            animal is a man but it may be, as a Particular, " A certain <lb/>
            animal is man." But this (is) in a simple 1conversion, which <lb/>
            is called in the inferences of conclusions a Reflex.1 There is <lb/>
            likewise another Conversion of propositions, which draws not <lb/>
            only the order, but likewise the parts themselves to the con­ <lb/>
            trary ; so that, what is defined, becomes undefined; and, on <lb/>
            the other hand, what is undefined (becomes) defined. This <lb/>
            conversion the two remaining, (namely,) the Universal Af­ <lb/>
            firmative and the Particular Negative, admit in turn ; as, <lb/>
            " Every man is an animal;" (and) " Every thing, that is not <lb/>
            an animal, is not a man;" in like manner, " A certain ani­ <lb/>
            mal is not rational;" (and) "A certain thing, which is not <lb/>
            rational, is (not)2 an animal." Now that this is so constantly, <lb/>
            as we have said, you will discover by exploring all the five <lb/>
            species before-mentioned.</p>
          <p>[7.] The combination of propositions is said to be their <lb/>
            connexion through another common part,3 by which they are <lb/>
            united ; for they can thus agree towards one conclusion. Now <lb/>
            that common part must needs be in both propositions the <lb/>
            Subject, or in both the Predicate; or in one the Subject, <lb/>
            (and) in the other the Predicate. The forms therefore become <lb/>
            three; of which let that be called the first, when that com­ <lb/>
            mon part is in one the Subject, in the other the Predicate ; <lb/>
            which order 4 is content not with an enumeration only, but <lb/>
            with the worthiness of the conclusions ;4 since the third form <note type="footnote"> 1—1 This is now called “ a conversion by contraposition," which takes <lb/>
            place, says Floridus, when a proposition is inverted, although its quantity <lb/>
            is preserved, so that defined terms become undefined by the addition of <lb/>
            the negative particle ; and in this manner alone is a Particular Negative <lb/>
            inverted. With regard, however, to the words, there seems to be a want <lb/>
            of precision here ; for elsewhere " conversio " and " reflexio " are sy­ <lb/>
            nonymous, and so too are " conclusio " and " illatio." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 I have inserted, what Floridus has suggested, the negative particle, <lb/>
            required by the sense. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 This is now called in Logic “ a middle term," as remarked by <lb/>
            Floridus. </note><note type="footnote"> 4—4 Such is the literal version of the text, and this the Delphin editor's <lb/>
            interpretation, " which arrangement depends not merely upon an acci­ <lb/>

            there is nothing in the text to answer to " fortuita," that word has been <lb/>
            evidently introduced to make something like sense out of what seemed to </note> <pb n="391"/>
             <note type="margin">c. 7.] <lb/>
            </note>is the last; because from it nothing is inferred, except a Par­ <lb/>
            ticular ; (but) superior to this is the second, which contains <lb/>
            Universal inferences, but only of a Negative kind: and the <lb/>
            first is thus the powerful one, because in it1 every kind of <lb/>
            inferences is contained. Now I call that an inference or in­ <lb/>
            ferential question2 which is collected and inferred from ad­ <lb/>
            missions. Moreover an admission is the proposition, which <lb/>
            is conceded by the respondent; for instance, should a person <lb/>
            propose (this question)—Is every honourable thing good ?— <lb/>
            it is a proposition; and if (the respondent)3 says that he <lb/>
            assents, there is, on the question being removed, an admission ; <lb/>
            which is itself in common parlance the proposition—“ Every <lb/>
            honourable thing is good." To this you may unite another <lb/>
            admission proposed and conceded in a similar manner­ <lb/>
            “ Every good thing is useful." From this combination arises, <lb/>
            as we shall presently show, the inferential (kind) of the first <lb/>
            mode; Universal, if (stated) Directly—“ Therefore every <lb/>
            honourable thing is useful;" (but) Particular, if (stated) In­ <lb/>
            versely,5—“ Therefore a useful thing is honourable;" because <lb/>
            a Universal Affirmative can be converted in the manner of a <lb/>
            Particular only in the case of Inverted Propositions. Now <lb/>
            an inference I say is made Directly 6when the same part is <lb/>
            the Subject, as well in the combination as in the inference it­ <lb/>
            self;6 and likewise the Predicate is the same, when it exists <lb/>
            in both ways; but it is made Inversely, 7when the same <lb/>
            thing takes place in an inverse order.7 <note type="footnote">be otherwise nonsense. One MS. has "numeri ratione," from which <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin"> [BOOK III. </note> [8.] Now let the whole of the reasoning, which is made up of <lb/>
            admissions and inferences, be called by the name of a gather­ <lb/>
            ing-together of a conclusion ; (and) it may be most conveni­ <lb/>
            ently defined, according to Aristotle, 1 as " a discourse, in which <lb/>
            some things being conceded, something else beside what have <lb/>
            been conceded, necessarily turns out, but yet through what <lb/>
            have been conceded." In which definition no other kind of a <lb/>
            discourse is to be understood than what is enunciable ; which, <lb/>
            as we have stated above,2 is alone either true or false. And <lb/>
            the expression, " some things being conceded," is put in the <lb/>
            plural on that account, because a gathering together can­ <lb/>
            not take place from one admission; although it appears to <lb/>
            Antipater the Stoic,3 contrary to the opinion of all, that <lb/>
            (this) 4 conclusion is complete-" Thou seest; therefore thou <lb/>
            art alive;" whereas it would be complete in this way-" If <lb/>
            thou seest, thou art alive; but thou dost see, therefore thou <lb/>
            art alive." Moreover, because we want to draw a Conclusion <lb/>
            not in what is conceded, but in what is denied, on that ac­ <lb/>
            count (it is stated)5 in the definition that something else <lb/>
            necessarily turns out, beside what has been conceded." On <lb/>
            which account the forms adopted by the Stoics are super­ <lb/>
            fluous, that go through not the same thing in a different man­ <lb/>

              the (major) proposition. But this we will refute in this man­ <lb/>

              now light; but it is taken in a different manner in the (minor) <lb/>
              proposition, in which it is not said, that it is now light, but <lb/>
              merely that it follows, that, if there be day, there will be <lb/>
              likewise light. Now there is a great difference, whether you <lb/>
              affirm that something exists in this way now, or merely that <lb/>
              it is wont to be, when something else goes before. That too <lb/>
              has taken place-namely, that in the same definition the idea <lb/>
              of necessity has been included-in order that the force of the <lb/>
              Conclusion may be distinguished from the likeness to an In­ <lb/>
              duction. For in an Induction some things are conceded; for <lb/>
              instance-“ A man moves the lower jaw; a horse moves <lb/>
              the lower jaw; and so does the ox and dog." From these <lb/>
              admissions something else is inferred in the Conclusion­ <lb/>
              "Therefore every animal likewise moves the lower jaw." <lb/>
              But as this is not true in the case of the crocodile, you can­ <lb/>
              not, although the preceding are conceded, admit the inference, <lb/>
              which it would not have been lawful for you to refuse in <lb/>
              the Conclusion ; since the inference is comprehended in the <lb/>
              admission itself; and on this account there has been added <lb/>
              the expression-“ turn out necessarily." Nor is even the last <lb/>
              part of the definition superfluous ; but it shows from the very <lb/>
              things, which it has conceded, that the inference ought to <lb/>
              turn out, but not that it would be established.</p>
          <p>[9.] But on these points enough has been said. And we <lb/>
            must now lay down, by what modes and combinations true con­ <lb/>
            clusions take place within a determinate number of the Pre­ <lb/>
            dicative kind (of propositions). 1 In the first form there are <lb/>
            found nine modes, taken by themselves, but six combinations ; <lb/>
            in the second, four modes, (but) three combinations; in the <lb/>
            third, six modes, (but) five combinations ;1 respecting which <note type="footnote"> 1_1 On these forms, modes, and combinations, the inquisitive reader <lb/>
            must turn to Martian. Capell. iv. 411, and to the treatises on Logic by <lb/>
            Aldrich and others. </note> <pb n="394"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK in. </note> <lb/>
            (taken) in their order I will here put down the proofs, pre­ <lb/>
            mising that a conclusion cannot be established from Particular <lb/>
            propositions alone, or from Negative alone, because they can <lb/>
            often lead even to what is false; moreover, that although, if <lb/>
            either Negative is united to many Affirmatives, an inference <lb/>
            is produced, not Affirmative, but Negative, (still) only one <lb/>
            (Negative), mixed with the rest, has any power. Similar too <lb/>
            is the force of Particular propositions. For either of them,2 <lb/>
            if mixed with Universals, produces a particular inference.</p>
          <p>Hence in the first form the first mode is that, which de­ <lb/>
            duces3 from Universal Affirmatives an Universal Affirmative <lb/>
            directly, as,-“ Every just thing is honourable. (Now) every <lb/>
            honourable thing is good. Therefore every just thing is good." <lb/>
            But if you draw the inference by a bend,4 (for instance,) <lb/>
            " Therefore a certain good thing is just," there is produced <lb/>
            by the same combination the fifth mode; for in this manner <lb/>
            alone I have shown above can an Universal Affirmative un­ <lb/>
            dergo a bend.5</p>
          <p>The second mode is that, which deduces from Universals, <lb/>
            Affirmative and Negative, an Universal Negative directly, <lb/>
            as—“ Every just thing is honourable. (But) no honourable <lb/>
            thing is base. Therefore no just thing is base." Now if you <lb/>
            draw the inference by a bend, as, “ Therefore no just thing is <lb/>
            base," you will produce the sixth mode; for, as it has been <lb/>
            stated, an Universal Negative is bent back on itself. We <lb/>
            ought however to remember only that the Subject is to be <lb/>
            drawn from the Affirmative to the inference in the second <lb/>
            mode, and on that account it (the Affirmative) is to be con­ <lb/>
            sidered the prior, although the Negative is enunciated pre­ <lb/>
            viously. In like manner in the case of the rest that, which <note type="footnote"> 1 General or Particular. </note><note type="footnote">2 Affirmative or Negative. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 I have translated here and elsewhere, as if the text were “deducit,” <lb/>

            has the same meaning as " colligere-” which is found in the same sense <lb/>

            is the prior in power, 1 is to be undestroyed as the prior (in <lb/>
            order). But in the sixth mode the Subjective is drawn from <lb/>
            the Negative; (and) this is their only difference.</p>
          <p>Further, the third mode (is that), which deduces from Af­ <lb/>
            firmatives, Particular and Universal, a Particular Affirmative, <lb/>
            as, "A certain just thing is honourable. (But) every hon­ <lb/>
            ourable thing is useful. Therefore a certain just thing is <lb/>
            useful." But if you draw an inference with a bend-There­ <lb/>
            fore a certain useful thing is just-you will produce the <lb/>
            seventh mode; for, as it has been stated, a Particular Affirm­ <lb/>
            ative is turned back on itself.</p>
          <p>The fourth mode is that, which deduces from a Particular <lb/>
            Affirmative and an Universal Negative a Particular Negative <lb/>
            directly, as, "A certain just thing is honourable. (But) no <lb/>
            honourable thing is base. Therefore a certain just thing is <lb/>
            not base." From this mode are discovered the changes con­ <lb/>
            trary to the preceding ; 2 since the eighth and ninth preserve <lb/>
            the inference of that (proposition), not as it is bent by it; <lb/>
            (and) the (two) merely bend the combination itself2 by pro­ <lb/>
            positions (called)3 Equivalent, and in an inverted order, so <lb/>
            that the Negative becomes the prior ; and thus (the mode) 4 <lb/>
            is said to deduce both by an inversion of the combinations. <lb/>
            For if you insert the Universal Negative of the fourth (mode) <lb/>
            and subjoin to it the Universal Affirmative, which the Par­ <lb/>
            ticular Affirmative shall have inverted, there will be produced <lb/>
            the eighth mode,5 which deduces from Universals, Negative <note type="footnote"> 1 i. e. which contains the Subject. </note><note type="footnote"> 2-2 Such is the literal version of the text of Oudendorp, who has <lb/>
            adopted, with Floridus, the readings of the Carnot MSS. in lieu of the <lb/>

            understand " non ut illi reflexam-” and the less so, as I do not know <lb/>
            why " illi " should thus follow " ejus—” I suspect there is an omission <lb/>
            here of some matter, which Apuleius drew from another source than <lb/>
            Aristotle ; who, as remarked by Floridus, rejects the five indirect modes <lb/>
            of the first form as useless. </note><note type="footnote"> * I have inserted " called," remembering the passage in iii. § 5, where <lb/>
            Apuleius defines the expression " propositions sequipollentes.” </note><note type="footnote"> 4 Oudendorp thus supplies " modus " as the nominative to " dicitur." <lb/>
            Floridus adopts " dicuntur ” from the Carnot MSS. But he is then com­ <lb/>
            pelled to take "conducere" in the sense of " concludere," a meaning <lb/>
            which seems scarcely admissible. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 Since three modes, namely, the fifth, sixth, and seventh, here omitted, <lb/>
            are found in the abridgment made of this book of Apuleius by Isidorus <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [BOOK III. </note> <lb/>
            and Affirmative, a Particular Negative, in a bent manner, as, <lb/>
            " No base thing is honourable. (But) every honourable thing <lb/>
            is just. Therefore a certain just thing is not base."</p>
          <p>But why the fourth mode alone should generate two <lb/>
            (others), (while) the rest (generate) only one each, the reason <lb/>
            is, that if we invert both propositions of the second mode, <lb/>
            there will be produced a vain combination of two Particular <lb/>
            (propositions) ; but if only one or the other,1 there will be <lb/>
            produced either the second form or the third.</p>
          <p>[10.] Of these nine modes in the first form the four first <lb/>
            are called " Non-Demonstrable ;” not because they cannot be <lb/>
            demonstrated, as 2the swelling of the tides of the whole sea, <lb/>
            which has not been demonstrated as yet by a person, who knows <lb/>
            the things of Nature, and 2 the squaring of the circle; but <lb/>
            because they are so simple and so manifest, as not to require <lb/>
            demonstration ; so that they produce themselves the rest, and <lb/>
            impart from themselves a belief in them.</p>
          <p>Of the second form we will now lay down the modes.</p>
          <p>The first mode in the second form is that, which deduces <note type="footnote"> which Isidorus met with in a more perfect MS. of Apuleius. But Hilde­ <lb/>
            brand says that " the three modes, which Colvius asserts are wanting, <lb/>
            have been explained already," and he refers to Martianus Capella iv. <lb/>
            411, but without remarking that there, as here, "Octavus modus—” <lb/>
            follows the mention of Quartus modus—” from which the just inference <lb/>
            would be. that the MS. of this treatise, used by Martian. Cape!!., was less <lb/>
            perfect than the one, which Isidorus possessed. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 I have adopted " alterutram," found in the Delphin interpretation, <lb/>
            in lieu of " alteram," in the text at present; which cannot be opposed <lb/>
            to " utramque—” </note><note type="footnote"> 2_2 So I have translated, as if the text were " universi marls æstum <lb/>
            tumentia, quod nondum demonstratum naturæ res scienti, et—” which <lb/>
            I have elicited by uniting the readings of ills. Carnot, " universi maris <lb/>
            sestimat quod non demonstrentur sicut," with that of MS. Petav., " uni­ <lb/>
            versi maris estum quod nondum demonstratum ei sit ut—” where “ æs­ <lb/>
            tuum tumentia " might easily have been corrupted into " sestimat," and <lb/>
            “naturæ res scienti" into "-entur sicut;" while “tumentia” might be <lb/>
            used for a substantive, as " faventia " is. But though no demonstration <lb/>
            had been given of the cause of the tides by any Natural philosopher, still <lb/>
            it had been remarked that " menstruis cursibus Lunæ decrementa et ac­ <lb/>
            cessus fretorum atque æstuum deprehenduntur," to use the language of <lb/>
            Apuleius, de Mundo, p. 731 = 332, where Elmenhorst refers to Strabo, <lb/>
            iii. p. 173 = 262, and other writers, who have alluded to the subject. <lb/>
            Oudendorp, however, proposes to read " ut universim Aristo æstimat, aut <lb/>
            quod nondum demonstratum ei sit, ut—” conceiving that Apuleius alluded <lb/>
            to Aristo, the Peripatetic philosopher of Alexandria, mentioned a little <lb/>
            below, and by Diogenes Laert. in Zeno, § 164. </note> <pb n="397"/>
             <note type="margin">c. 11.] </note> <lb/>
            from Universals, Affirmative and Negative, an Universal <lb/>
            Negative directly, as, " Every just thing is honourable. (But) <lb/>
            no base thing is honourable. Therefore that, which is not <lb/>
            just, is dishonourable." This' (mode) is reduced to the se­ <lb/>
            cond not-demonstrable by its second terms being inverted.</p>
          <p>The second mode is that, which deduces from the Univer­ <lb/>
            sals, Negative and Affirmative, an Universal Negative directly, <lb/>
            as, “ No base thing is honourable. (But) every just thing is <lb/>
            honourable. Therefore no base thing is just." This mode does <lb/>
            not differ from the former combination, except that it draws <lb/>
            the Subjective portion from the Negative to the inference; <lb/>
            because the order of the enunciation is varied in this way, a <lb/>
            circumstance that could not take place in the first form.</p>
          <p>The third mode is that, which deduces from a Particular <lb/>
            Affirmative and an Universal Negative a Particular Negative <lb/>
            directly, as, "A certain just thing is honourable. (But) no <lb/>
            base thing is honourable. Therefore a certain just thing is <lb/>
            not base." In this proposition if we invert the Universal <lb/>
            Negative, there will arise2 the fourth not-demonstrable; <lb/>
            3from which this is produced.3</p>
          <p>The fourth mode is that, which deduces from a Particular <lb/>
            Negative and an Universal Affirmative a Particular Negative <lb/>
            directly, as, " A certain just thing is not base. (But) every <lb/>
            bad thing is base. Therefore a certain just thing is not bad." <lb/>
            Now this mode alone is proved through the impossible alone; <lb/>
            about which kind of proposition we will speak, while explain­ <lb/>
            ing the modes of the third form.</p>
          <p>[11.] In the third form the first mode is that, which de­ <lb/>
            duces from Universal Affirmatives a Particular Affirmative <lb/>
            as well directly as inversely, as, " Every just thing is honour­ <lb/>
            able. (And) every just thing is good. Therefore a certain <lb/>
            honourable thing is good," or thus, "Therefore a certain good <lb/>
            thing is honourable." Since it matters not, what part from <lb/>
            each proposition you make the Subject, as it does not matter, <lb/>
            which you first enunciate. Hence Theophrastus does not <note type="footnote"> 1 I have adopted, with the Delphin interpreter, " hie " from MS. Petav. <lb/>
            in lieu of " hæc—” which is without regimen. Compare, just below, <lb/>
            " Hic—non differt-” </note><note type="footnote"> 2 I have translated, as if the text were " fiet," not " fit—” </note><note type="footnote"> 3—3 I confess I do not see any necessity for the words between the <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [BOOK III. </note> <lb/>
            rightly decide that on this account there is not one mode, but <lb/>
            two.</p>
          <p>The second mode is that, which deduces from Affirmatives, <lb/>
            Particular and Universal, an Affirmative Particular directly, <lb/>
            as, "A certain just thing is honourable. (And) every just <lb/>
            thing is good. Therefore a certain honourable thing is good."</p>
          <p>The third mode is that, which deduces from Affirmatives, <lb/>
            Universal and Particular, an Affirmative Particular directly, <lb/>
            as, "Every just thing is honourable. (And) a certain just <lb/>
            thing is good. Therefore a certain good thing is honourable."</p>
          <p>The fourth mode is that, which deduces from Universals, <lb/>
            Affirmative and Negative, a Negative Particular directly, as, <lb/>
            " Every just thing is honourable. (But) no just thing is bad. <lb/>
            Therefore a certain honourable thing is not bad."</p>
          <p>The fifth mode is that, which deduces from an Affirmative <lb/>
            Particular and a Negative Universal an Affirmative Particular <lb/>
            directly, as, " A certain just thing is honourable. (But) no <lb/>
            just thing is bad. Therefore a certain honourable thing is <lb/>
            not bad."</p>
          <p>The sixth mode is that, which deduces from an Affirmative <lb/>
            Universal and a Negative Particular, a Negative Particular <lb/>
            directly, as, " Every just thing is honourable. (And) a cer­ <lb/>
            tain just thing is not bad. Therefore1 a certain honourable <lb/>
            thing is not bad."</p>
          <p>[12.] Of these six modes, the three first are reduced to the <lb/>
            third not-demonstrable, by the first proposition of the first and <lb/>
            second (mode) being inverted; while the third has the same <lb/>
            combination with the second, (but) differing in this alone, <lb/>
            that it takes from an Universal its Subjective portion, inas­ <lb/>
            much as it is reduced to the third by the inversion not only <lb/>
            of the proposition but of the inference. In like manner the <lb/>
            fourth and fifth are produced from the fourth not-demonstra­ <lb/>
            ble by their first propositions being inverted. But the sixth <lb/>
            mode cannot be reduced to any not-demonstrable mode by <lb/>
            either both propositions, or one, or the other,2 being inverted; <lb/>
            but it is proved merely by what is impossible; just as the <lb/>
            fourth mode in the second form ; and on that account both are <lb/>
            numbered the last. But of the rest the arrangement is made <note type="footnote"> 1 I have adopted " igitur " from MS. Petav. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Here, as in iii. § 9, p. 396, n. 1, I have translated, as if the text were <lb/>
            " alterutra," not " altera," which cannot mean " one of two." </note> <pb n="399"/>
             <note type="margin">c. 12.] </note> <lb/>
            in all the forms according to the difference of the combinations <lb/>
            and inferences. For since to make an assertion is prior to <lb/>
            giving a denial, and an Universal has a greater power than a <lb/>
            Particular, Universals are prior to Particulars; and to both <lb/>
            are similar an Affirmation and an Inference; and that mode <lb/>
            is placed before, which is reduced more quickly to the not- <lb/>
            demonstrable mode, that is to say, by one inversion; which <lb/>
            is one method of proving that those modes are fixed for a <lb/>
            conclusion. There is likewise another method, which is com­ <lb/>
            mon to all, even the not-demonstrable, and which is said to <lb/>
            be through what is impossible, and is called by the Stoics the <lb/>
            first laying down or the first exposition; which they define <lb/>
            thus, “ If from two (assertions) a third is deduced, one of <lb/>
            them, 1when it collects inferences (from) a contrary, leaves <lb/>
            the contrary.1 But the old (logicians) have thus defined, <lb/>
            " When one or the other of (two) propositions is assumed, if <lb/>
            the 2inference of every conclusion is done away,2 the remain­ <lb/>
            ing (proposition) is done away." Now this was invented in <lb/>
            opposition to those, who, after admissions have been made, <lb/>
            impudently refuse (to receive) what is deduced from them; <lb/>
            while from that, which they deny, something may be dis­ <lb/>
            covered contrary to that, which they had previously conceded. <lb/>
            Moreover, (since)3 it is impossible for contraries to be at one <lb/>
            and the same time true, they are consequently driven by what <lb/>
            is impossible to the conclusion. Nor have logicians vainly <lb/>
            laid down that that mode is true, in which the contrary to an <lb/>
            inference, together with an admission, of one or the other <lb/>
            (proposition), does away the remaining one. But the Stoics <lb/>
            conceive that an inference is rejected, by merely prefixing a <note type="footnote"/><note type="footnote">1–1 Such is the literal and unintelligible version of the text, where <lb/>
            Oudendorp confesses he sticks fast; and so too did Floridus; who would <lb/>

          <p>[13.] There are then produced against each Conclusion eight <lb/>
            of a contrary kind, which may be opposed to it; since each ad­ <lb/>
            mission may be done away by two methods ; and there are pro­ <lb/>
            duced twice four conclusions by a negative particle being at <lb/>
            one time prefixed to the inference, and at another, by one or <lb/>
            the other2 of the inferences being accepted. Let there be, as <lb/>
            an example, the first not-demonstrable (mode)–“ Every just <lb/>
            thing is honourable. (And) every honourable thing is good. <lb/>
            Therefore every just thing is good." Now he who, after ad­ <lb/>
            mitting the propositions, denies the inference, must necessarily <lb/>
            say—“ Some one just thing is not good." To this if you pre­ <lb/>
            fix3 the former of the two conceded-“ Every just thing is <lb/>
            honourable," an inference is produced, according to the second <lb/>
            mode in the third form,—“ Therefore some one honourable <lb/>
            thing is not good;" which is repugnant to the second pro­ <lb/>
            position, that had conceded that " Every honourable thing is <lb/>
            good." In like manner this conclusion is altogether an op­ <lb/>
            posite one, if, while things remain the same, you introduce its <lb/>
            equivalent, as for instance,-“ Therefore not every thing <lb/>
            honourable is good." In a similar manner two other con­ <lb/>
            clusions would be produced, if, as we have just now laid down <lb/>
            the former proposition, so we assume the latter-“ Some one <lb/>
            just thing is not good. (But) every honourable thing is good," <lb/>
            there will be produced4 a double inference belonging to the <lb/>
            fourth mode of the second form, (namely)-“ Therefore not <lb/>
            every just thing is honourable," or-“ Therefore some one <lb/>
            just thing is not honourable;" both of which are equally re­ <lb/>
            pugnant to the former proposition, which had conceded that­ <lb/>
            "Every just thing is honourable." While these four con­ <lb/>
            clusions remain, the proposition alone being changed, if, in <lb/>
            lieu of that, which was- “Some one just thing is not good," <note type="footnote"> I Hildebrand has introduced here from MS. Petav. " Veteres vero et <lb/>

            you make the proposition-“Not every just thing is good," <lb/>
            so that the inference may be done away in two methods, there <lb/>
            will be through the same changes four conclusions of the second <lb/>
            form. In like manner, if in lieu of the same proposition, you <lb/>
            make it-" No just thing is good," so that the inference may <lb/>
            be done away by three methods, there will be four conclusions <lb/>
            of the third form, but only in the case of those which have an <lb/>
            Universal inference. For that alone can be done away by <lb/>
            three methods; but in the others there are only eight; which, <lb/>
            if a person wishes, he will be able to arrange1 singly under <lb/>
            each mode through all the forms, after the example we have <lb/>
            laid down, so that, 2in the manner of persons arguing hypo­ <lb/>
            thetically by means of letters,2 the order of the propositions <lb/>
            being changed, while their power remains, the first not-de­ <lb/>
            monstrable mode may be—“ A (is affirmed) of every B. And <lb/>
            B of every C. Therefore A is of every C." 3 They begin from <lb/>
            the Declaring, and consequently from the second proposition. <lb/>
            This mode then, made perfect according to these, becomes <lb/>
            backwardly of this kind3—4“Every C (is) B. (And) every <lb/>
            B (is) A. Therefore every C (is) A."4 The Stoics however <lb/>
            instead of letters adopt numbers,5 as-" If there is a first, <lb/>
            there is a second. But there is a first. Therefore there <lb/>
            is a second." But Aristotle puts forth in the first form only <lb/>
            four modes not-demonstrable; while Theophrastus and the <note type="footnote"/><note type="footnote">1 Such seems to be what the train of thought requires. The MSS. <lb/>

            rest enumerate five ; for *by uniting an Indefinite proposition,1 <lb/>
            they deduce likewise an Indefinite inference. But this it is <lb/>
            needless to bring forward ; since an Indefinite (proposition) is <lb/>
            done away in the place of a Particular (one); and the modes <lb/>
            become the same as those in the case of a Particular pro­ <lb/>
            position.</p>
          <p>[14.] So too we have shown there are four in the first form; <lb/>
            which if a person wishes to double, by accepting an Indefinite <lb/>
            in the place of a Particular, and subjoining an Indefinite in­ <lb/>
            ference, there will be in all twenty-nine.2 But Aristo of <lb/>
            Alexandria and some younger Peripatetics suggest moreover <lb/>
            five other modes of an Universal inference, (namely,) three in <lb/>
            the first form and two in the second; in the place of which <lb/>
            they deduce 3 something of a Particular one; for it is very silly 3 <lb/>
            for him, 4 to whom more has been conceded, to infer less.4 <lb/>
            Now it is proved that all the determinate modes in the three <lb/>
            forms are only the nineteen, which we have shown above. <lb/>
            (For) there are four propositions, (namely,) two Particulars <lb/>
            (and) two Universals. Each of these, says Aristotle, is com­ <lb/>
            bined in four ways, so that it may be subjoined to itself,5 and <lb/>
            be put before three others; and thus there will be sixteen <lb/>
            combinations in each form. Of these there are six that pos­ <lb/>
            sess a power equally in all; two, when of Negatives either <lb/>
            one precedes the other; but four, when of Particulars any <lb/>
            one precedes itself, or is subjoined to another. For nothing <lb/>
            can be concluded, whenever there are either two Particulars <note type="footnote"> 1—1 Here is evidently something defective. For it should be stated to <lb/>

            or two Negatives. There remain then for each form ten <lb/>
            combinations. Moreover out of these, as well in the first as <lb/>
            second form, two possess no power, when an Universal Affirm­ <lb/>
            ative is placed before a Particular one. Similarly in both the <lb/>
            first and second form two may be cut out, in which a Particu­ <lb/>
            lar Negative precedes either of the Universals. From whence <lb/>
            it arises that there remain of the first form six combinations, <lb/>
            in nine modes; (and) still eight for the two remaining forms; <lb/>
            of which there is one, that is proved in neither of them, when <lb/>
            an Universal Negative precedes a Particular Affirmative. Of <lb/>
            those seven, which remain, there are four in the second form <lb/>
            peculiar (and) false, when an Universal Affirmative is united <lb/>
            either to itself or to its Particular in any place, or when the <lb/>
            other precedes. In like manner two in the third form are <lb/>
            peculiar (and) possess no power, when either of the Negatives <lb/>
            precedes an Universal Affirmative; but the remaining three <lb/>
            in the second form, and five in the third, we have shown to be <lb/>
            determinate, when we reduced them to six combinations of <lb/>
            the first form. Hence out of forty-eight combinations fourteen <lb/>
            alone are proved. The remaining thirty-four, which I have <lb/>
            reckoned up, are rejected, because they are able to exhibit <lb/>
            false conclusions from true premises; of which it is easy for <lb/>
            any one to make a trial by means of the five significations <lb/>
            mentioned above, of kind, peculiarity, &amp;c. But of those <lb/>
            fourteen, which we have proved, the inferences themselves <lb/>
            show that there are not more modes than have been stated <lb/>
            above, so that they may be received as well directly as in­ <lb/>
            versely, as far as the very truth permits ; and on that account <lb/>
            their number cannot be increased. <note type="footnote"> 2 D 2</note></p>

          </ab>
          <p>BEFORE the reader enters on the perusal of this section, it is proper <lb/>
            that he should be informed of what he is to expect. When the editor <lb/>
            first heard that the works of Plato had been the subject of Mr. Gray's <lb/>
            serious and critical attention, and that he had illustrated them by an <lb/>
            analysis and by ample annotations, his curiosity was raised to no ordinary <lb/>
            height. When the names of Plato and of Gray, of the philosopher and <lb/>
            of the poet, were thus united, it was difficult to set bounds to his, or in­ <lb/>
            deed to any, expectation. But when the volume, containing these im­ <lb/>
            portant remarks, was first delivered into his hands, his sensation at the <lb/>
            time reminded him of that which was experienced by an eminent scholar, <lb/>
            at his discovery of the darker and more sublime hymns which antiquity has <lb/>
            ascribed to Orpheus. His words on that occasion are as pleasing and as <lb/>
            interesting as the enthusiasm was noble which inspired them : " In abys­ <lb/>
            sum quendam mysteriorum descendere videbar, quum silente mundo, <lb/>
            soils vigilantibus astris et lunâ, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μελανήφτους</foreign> istos hymnos in manus <lb/>
            sumpsi." 1 Many a learned man will acknowledge, as his own, the feel­ <lb/>
            ings of this animated scholar.</p>
          <p>It might, indeed, be conceived that, from the intense contemplation on <lb/>
            the subjects offered to him by Plato, so full of dignity and so pregnant <lb/>
            with the materials of thought, Mr. Gray might have indulged himself in <lb/>
            a continuation of the discussions, by expanding still wider the exalted <lb/>
            and diversified ideas of his sublime original. He had a spirit equal and <lb/>
            adapted to such an exertion, and congenial with that of the philosopher; <lb/>
            but it seems as if he had, on purpose, restrained his own powers and <lb/>
            tempered their ardour. What he chiefly sought and aimed at, and what <lb/>
            he indeed effected, was to exhibit the sobriety of truth, the importance of <lb/>
            the doctrines, and the great practical effects of true philosophy on life, on <lb/>
            manners, and on policy;</p><figure type="illustration">

          <p>He never for a moment deviated from his original; as he was desirous <lb/>
            only to lay before himself and his reader the sum and substance of the <note type="footnote"> 1 See the Preface of Eschenbach to the Argonautics, the Hymns, &amp;c. of Orpheus, <lb/>

            dialogues as they are, when divested of the peculiar attractions which so <lb/>
            powerfully recommend these conversations on the banks of the Ilyssus. <lb/>
            As a scholar, and as a reflecting man, he sat down to give an account to <lb/>
            himself of what he had read and studied; and he gave it in words of his <lb/>
            own, without addition, without amplification, and without the admix­ <lb/>
            ture of any ideas with those of Plato. He made large and valuable <lb/>
            remarks and annotations, drawn from the stores of his own unbounded <lb/>
            erudition, with a felicity and an elegance which never lost sight of utility <lb/>
            and of solid information, without the display of reading, or the en­ <lb/>
            cumbrance of pedantic research. He never pretended to have consulted <lb/>
            manuscripts, but, whenever he thought that an alteration of the text was <lb/>
            necessary, or when a passage appeared to him to be obscure or corrupted, <lb/>
            he proposed his own conjectural emendation. Yet it is pleasing to know, <lb/>
            that Mr. Gray neither despised nor depreciated the advantages which <lb/>
            may be derived from minuter and more subtle verbal criticism, and from <lb/>
            the rectifying, or from the restoration, of the text of any author by that <lb/>
            steady light which shone full on Bentley, and which, in after times, de­ <lb/>
            scended upon Person. What he proposed to himself, that he effected; <lb/>
            and through the whole of these writings there is such a perspicuity of ex­ <lb/>
            pression, an eloquence so temperate, a philosophic energy so calm and <lb/>
            unaffected, and the train of the specific arguments in each composition is <lb/>
            presented so entire and unbroken, that his spirit may be said to shine <lb/>
            through them; and, in this point of view, the words of Alcinous to Ulysses <lb/>
            have a peculiar force, when applied to Mr. Gray;</p><figure type="illustration">
            <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_26_fig72.jpg"/></figure>
          <p>His illustrations from antiquity, and from history, are as accurate as <lb/>
            they are various and extensive. When, for instance, we peruse many of <lb/>
            his notes drawn from those sources, we have often, as it were, the memoirs <lb/>
            of the time and the politics of Syracuse; and scarcely could a modern <lb/>
            writer feel himself more at home in the reign of Charles the Second, than <lb/>
            Mr. Gray in the court of Dionysius. Or, if we turn to subjects of a dif­ <lb/>
            ferent nature, where shall we find a nobler specimen of judicious analysis, <lb/>
            and of manly, eloquent, interesting, and animated composition, than in his <lb/>
            account of the Protagoras ? But it would be useless, or invidious, to <lb/>
            specify particulars where all is excellent. It is a proud consideration for <lb/>
            Englishmen, that Mr. Gray composed all his remarks in his own native <lb/>
            tongue, and with words of power unsphered the spirit of Plato.</p>
          <p>In an age like this, it would be superfluous to speak of the merits and <lb/>
            the character of the great philosopher, who has found such a commentator. <lb/>
            We all know, that when Cicero looked for the master and for the example <lb/>
            of eloquence and of finished composition, he found that master and that <lb/>
            example in Plato; and all succeeding times have confirmed his judg­ <lb/>
            ment.</p>
          <p>Plato has certainly ever been, and ever will be, the favourite philoso­ <lb/>
            pher of great orators and of great poets. He was himself familiar with <lb/>
            the father of all poetry. The language of Plato, his spirit, his animated <note type="footnote"> 1 Odyss. xi. 365. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="408"/>
            reasoning, his copiousness, his invention, the rhythm and the cadence of <lb/>
            his style, the hallowed dignity and the amplitude of his conceptions, and <lb/>
            that splendour of imagination with which he illuminated every subject, <lb/>
            and threw into the gloom of futurity the rays of hope and the expect­ <lb/>
            ations of a better life, have always endeared and recommended him to <lb/>
            the good and to the wise of every age and of every nation. From the <lb/>
            legitimate study of his works, from that liberal delight which they afford, <lb/>
            and from the expanded views which they present, surely it cannot be <lb/>
            apprehended that any reader should be " spoiled through philosophy and <lb/>
            vain deceit."</p>

            <title type="main">A GENERAL VIEW OF THE WORKS OF PLATO BY FLOYER SYDENHAM.</title>
          </head>
          <p>THE dialogues1 of Plato are of various kinds, not only with <lb/>
            regard to those different matters, which are the subjects of them, <lb/>
            but in respect also of the manner in which they are composed or <lb/>
            framed, and of the form under which they make their appearance <lb/>
            to the reader. It will not therefore be improper to distinguish the <lb/>
            several kinds; by dividing them, first, into the most general, and <lb/>
            then, subdividing them into the subordinate kinds: till we come to <lb/>
            those lower species, which particularly and precisely denote the <lb/>
            nature of the several dialogues, and from which they ought to <lb/>
            take their respective denominations.</p>
          <p>The most general division of the writings of Plato is, into those <lb/>
            of the sceptical, and into those of the dogmatical, kind. In the <lb/>
            former, nothing is expressly either proved or asserted; as some <note type="footnote"> I Socrates, the hero of these dramatic dialogues, lived a private life at <lb/>
            Athens ; quiet and studious, yet in the highest degree social, deigning his <lb/>
            converse and communicating his knowledge, in proper measure, to all sorts <lb/>
            of people: in this city therefore must of course lie the ordinary scene of <lb/>
            those conversations, in which Socrates presides, or hath a share. As how­ <lb/>
            ever that wise man used much exercise, and died before his days of exer­ <lb/>
            cise were past, probability admits the scene to be now and then diversified, <lb/>
            by being changed to the adjacent country. Nor is it in these cases either <lb/>
            confined to one spot of ground, or in general only, and at large, rural; some­ <lb/>
            times it opens into the walks round the city-walls, and, at other times, is <lb/>
            lengthened along the way to some appendant sea-port or village: now it is <lb/>
            widened into the fields and groves; and now winds along the banks of the <lb/>
            Ilyssus. Of those conversations which pass within the city, the particular <lb/>
            spot is no less varied: here it is the open street; there the private house of <lb/>
            one of the company; but oftenest one or other public place of general re­ <lb/>
            sort ; the place of exchange, or some court of judicature ; the place where <lb/>
            the gymnic exercises were used, or some school where they were taught: <lb/>
            neither is the banquet-room nor the prison wanting, to complete the variety. <lb/>
            But in every dialogue the exactest care is taken to adapt the scene as much <lb/>
            as possible to the subject, and even in the same dialogue the scene is <lb/>
            shifted, if the economy of the drama require the different parts of it to be <lb/>
            disposed in different places. By all this diversification propriety is pre­ <lb/>
            served, the fancy, which is fond of change, is entertained, and the speculative <lb/>
            mind is presented with a true, that is, with a variegated picture of human <lb/>
            life. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="410"/>
            philosophical question only is considered and examined, and the <lb/>
            reader is left to himself to draw such conclusions, and to discover <lb/>
            such truths, as the philosopher means to insinuate. This is done <lb/>
            either in the way of inquiry, or in that of controversy and of dis­ <lb/>
            pute. In the way of controversy are carried on all such dialogues, <lb/>
            as tend to eradicate false opinions; and that is done, either in­ <lb/>
            directly, by involving them in difficulties and embarrassing the <lb/>
            maintainers of them; or directly, by confuting them. In the way <lb/>
            of inquiry proceed those dialogues, whose tendency is to raise in <lb/>
            the mind right opinions; which is effected, either by exciting to <lb/>
            the pursuit of some part of wisdom and by showing in what man­ <lb/>
            ner to investigate it, or by leading the way and helping the mind <lb/>
            forward in the search.</p>
          <p>The dialogues of the other kind, namely, the dogmatical or <lb/>
            didactic, teach explicitly some point of doctrine: and this they <lb/>
            do, either by laying it down in the authoritative way, or by proving <lb/>
            it in the way of reason and of argument. In the authoritative <lb/>
            way the doctrine is delivered sometimes by the speaker himself <lb/>
            magisterially, and at other times as derived to him by tradition <lb/>
            from wise men. The argumentative or demonstrative method of <lb/>
            teaching, used by Plato, proceeds either through analytical reason­ <lb/>
            ing, resolving things into their principles, and from known or <lb/>
            allowed truths tracing out the unknown; or through induction, <lb/>
            from a multitude of particulars inferring some general thing in <lb/>
            which they all agree.</p>
          <p>According to this division is framed the following scheme, or <lb/>
            table:</p><figure type="illustration">
            <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_26_fig73.jpg"/></figure>
          <p>The philosopher, in thus varying his manner and diversifying <lb/>
            his writings into these' several kinds, means not merely to enter­ <lb/>
            tain the reader with their variety, nor to teach him, on different <lb/>
            occasions, with more or less plainness and perspicuity, nor yet to <lb/>
            insinuate different degrees of certainty in the doctrines themselves: <lb/>
            but he takes this method as a consummate master of the art of <lb/>
            composition in the dialogue-way of writing; and from the different <lb/>
            characters of the speakers, as from different elements in the frame <lb/>
            of these dramatic dialogues, or from different ingredients in their <lb/>
            mixture, he produces some peculiar genius and turn of temper, as <lb/>
            it were, in each.</p><pb n="411"/>
            
          <p>Socrates, indeed, is in almost all of them' the principal speaker, <lb/>
            but when he falls into the company of some arrogant sophist, when <lb/>
            the modest wisdom and clear science of the one are contrasted with <lb/>
            the confident ignorance and the blind opinionativeness of the other, <lb/>
            dispute and controversy must of course arise; where the false pre­ <lb/>
            tender cannot fail of being either puzzled or confuted. To puzzle <lb/>
            him only is sufficient, if there be no other persons present, because <lb/>
            such a man can never be confuted in his own opinion ; but when <lb/>
            there is an audience round them, in danger of being misled by <lb/>
            sophistry into error, then is the true philosopher to exert his <lb/>
            utmost, and the vain sophist must be convicted and exposed.</p>
          <p>In some dialogues, Plato represents his great master mixing in <lb/>
            conversation with young men of the best families in the common­ <lb/>
            wealth. When these persons happen to have docile dispositions <lb/>
            and fair minds, then is occasion given to the philosopher to call <lb/>
            forth the latent seeds of wisdom, and to cultivate the noble plants <lb/>
            with true doctrine, in the affable and familiar way of joint inquiry. <lb/>
            To this is owing the inquisitive genius of such dialogues ; in which, <lb/>
            by a seeming equality in the conversation, the curiosity or zeal of <lb/>
            the mere stranger is excited, and that of the disciple is encouraged, <lb/>
            and, by proper questions, the mind also is aided and forwarded in <lb/>
            the search of truth.</p>
          <p>At other times, the philosophic hero of these dialogues is in­ <lb/>
            troduced in a higher character, engaged in discourse with men of <lb/>
            more improved understandings and of more enlightened minds. <lb/>
            At such seasons he has an opportunity of teaching in a more ex­ <lb/>
            plicit manner, and of discovering the reasons of things: for to such <lb/>
            an audience truth, with all the demonstration possible in the <lb/>
            teaching it, is due. Hence, in the dialogues composed of these <lb/>
            persons, naturally arises the justly argumentative or demonstrative <lb/>
            genius: it is of the analytical kind, when the principles of mind or <lb/>
            of science, the leading truths, are to be unfolded; and of the in­ <lb/>
            ductional kind, when any subsequent truth of the same rank with <lb/>
            others, or any part of science, is meant to be displayed.</p>
          <p>But when the doctrine to be taught admits not of demonstration; <lb/>
            of which kind is the doctrine of outward nature, being only hypo­ <lb/>
            thetical and a matter of opinion ; the doctrine of antiquities, being <lb/>
            only traditional and a matter of belief; and the doctrine of laws, <lb/>
            being injunctional and the matter of obedience; the air of au­ <lb/>
            thority is then assumed: in the former cases, the doctrine is tra­ <lb/>
            ditionally handed down to others from the authority of ancient <lb/>
            sages; but in the latter, it is magisterially pronounced with the <lb/>
            authority of a legislator. That this turn may be given to such <lb/>
            dialogues with propriety, and with justice to the character of the <lb/>
            speakers, the reasoning Socrates is laid aside, or he only sustains <lb/>
            some lower and obscure part; while that which is the principal, or <lb/>
            the shining, part is allotted to some other philosopher, to whom <lb/>
             <pb n="412"/>
            may properly be attributed a more authoritative manner; or to such <lb/>
            an antiquary, as may be credited or may be deemed to have re­ <lb/>
            ceived the best information; or finally, to such a statesman or <lb/>
            politician, as may fairly be presumed best qualified for making <lb/>
            laws.</p>
          <p>4 Thus much for the manner in which the dialogues of Plato are <lb/>
            severally composed, and for the turn of genius which is given to <lb/>
            them in their composition. The form under which they appear, <lb/>
            or the external character that marks them, is of three sorts: 1. <lb/>
            Either purely dramatic, like the dialogue of tragedy or comedy; <lb/>
            or, 2. Purely narrative, where a former conversation is supposed <lb/>
            to be committed to writing and communicated to some absent <lb/>
            friend; or, 3. It is of the mixed kind, like a narration in dramatic <lb/>
            poems, where the story of things past is recited to some person <lb/>
            present.</p>
          <p>Having thus divided the dialogues of Plato, with respect to that <lb/>
            inward form or composition, which creates their genius; and again <lb/>
            with reference to that outward form, which marks them, like <lb/>
            flowers and other vegetables, with a certain character; we are to <lb/>
            make a further division of them, with regard to their subject and <lb/>
            to their design, beginning with their design or end, because for the <lb/>
            sake of this are all the subjects chosen. The end of all the <lb/>
            writings of Plato is that, which is the end of all true philosophy or <lb/>
            wisdom, I mean, the perfection and the happiness of man. Man <lb/>
            therefore is the general subject; and the first business of philosophy <lb/>
            must be to inquire, what is that being, called man, who is to be <lb/>
            made happy; and what is his nature, in the perfection of which is <lb/>
            placed his happiness.</p>
          <p>The philosopher considers man as a compound being, consisting <lb/>
            of body and of soul, the superior part of which soul is mind, by <lb/>
            which he is intimately connected with the divine nature, and of <lb/>
            near kindred to it; while the inferior part is made up of passions <lb/>
            and of affections, reducible all to two kinds, having all of them <lb/>
            either pain or pleasure for their object: by means of which, and <lb/>
            also of his body, he is outwardly related to the fellows of his own <lb/>
            species, and is connected with them and with all outward nature. <lb/>
            He is moved by some commanding power within him, the principle <lb/>
            of action, commonly called Will; and when the motion, given by <lb/>
            it, is right, and in a right direction, it moves him for his real good. <lb/>
            The motion and the direction are both right, when the one is <lb/>
            measured and the other dictated by right reason. The motion is <lb/>
            thus measured, and the direction is thus dictated; or, in other <lb/>
            words, the measure and the rule of a man's actions are agreeable <lb/>
            to right reason, when the governing power within him (i. e. the <lb/>
            reason of his own mind) harmonizes with reason universal: and <lb/>
            this it does, when his mind sees things as they are, and partakes of <lb/>
            truth; because truth is the standard of right reason, is the same in <lb/>
             <pb n="413"/>
            every and in all mind, and is the perfection and the end of mind <lb/>
            itself. By means of truth therefore, or by the knowledge of it, <lb/>
            (for the mind is in possession of truth by knowing it,) is a man's <lb/>
            reason empowered to govern him, and his will is enabled to move <lb/>
            him, for his good. Now the power of so governing and of so <lb/>
            moving him is man's virtue; the virtue of every thing being its <lb/>
            power to produce, or to procure, some certain good. Thus the two <lb/>
            great objects of the Platonic philosophy are truth and virtue; <lb/>
            truth, which is the good of all mind; and virtue, which is the good <lb/>
            of the whole man.</p>
          <p>Every truth, in every particular science, is the relation of any <lb/>
            two or more things, that is, of such things as are the subjects of <lb/>
            that science; and in the knowledge of all of which that science con­ <lb/>
            sists. The subjects of every science are things in their real essences, <lb/>
            or ideas; and truth universal comprehends all the relations of all <lb/>
            the real essences of all things. These relations being eternal, <lb/>
            absolute, and independent on any particular mind, the real essences <lb/>
            of things themselves not only must always be, but must always <lb/>
            have the same manner also of being; that is, they must be always <lb/>
            uniform and invariable, not subject to the differences or to the <lb/>
            changes of any thoughts concerning them, and must indeed be <lb/>
            seated above the comprehension or the reach of any particular <lb/>
            minds. Our ideas, when true, are the exact copies or perfect <lb/>
            images of these essences; and when we know them to be such, <lb/>
            and can resolve them into their principles, then have we true <lb/>
            science, properly so called. It is the nature of the human soul to <lb/>
            have these ideas generated in her, and to partake of mind eternal <lb/>
            and immutable. Hence she is the offspring, and the image, of the <lb/>
            divine nature; and hence, by a participation of that nature which <lb/>
            is eternal, and whose principle is unity, she is herself indissoluble <lb/>
            and immortal.</p>
          <p>The resemblances of those real essences are also in outward <lb/>
            things, serving first to excite in the soul those true ideas: but, <lb/>
            because of the ever-changing and transient nature of such things, <lb/>
            (those resemblances being uncertain,) they are no less apt to raise <lb/>
            false fancies, and to give birth to erroneous opinions.</p>
          <p>But besides these natural representations of things, there-are <lb/>
            others which are arbitrary; invented by men, in order to express, <lb/>
            or to signify to each other, whatever they perceive, or fancy, or <lb/>
            know, or think. These are words framed into propositions and <lb/>
            discourses; in which we give an account of what we think, or <lb/>
            would have others think. They are delivered in three ways: <lb/>
            either, I. In the way of reason, applying themselves to the under­ <lb/>
            standing with pretensions to prove; or, 2. In the way of oratory, <lb/>
            addressing the passions in order to persuade; or, 3. In the way of <lb/>
            poetry, engaging the imagination with a view to please. The mind <lb/>
            therefore is in danger of being seduced into error by words, in four <lb/>
             <pb n="414"/>
            different ways: either, 1. By wrong names attributed to things, <lb/>
            disguising thus their real nature; or, 2. By sophistical arts of <lb/>
            reasoning, thus exhibiting falsehood in a dress like that of truth; <lb/>
            or, 3. By the adulterated colours of rhetoric, deluding us; or, 4. By <lb/>
            the fantastic figuring of poetry, enchanting us. In this manner <lb/>
            does Plato warn his readers against the ways which lead aside <lb/>
            into error; while he conducts his followers along the road of truth.</p>
          <p>As to the other object of Platonic wisdom, namely, virtue, or the <lb/>
            settled power in the soul of governing man rightly; when it is con­ <lb/>
            sidered as adhering to its divine principle, truth, it takes the form <lb/>
            of sanctity; when considered as presiding over every word and <lb/>
            action, it has the nature of prudence; when it is employed in con­ <lb/>
            trolling and ordering the concupiscible part of the soul, or the <lb/>
            affections and passions which regard pleasure, it is called tem­ <lb/>
            perance ; and when it is engaged in composing and directing the <lb/>
            irascible part of the soul, or the affections and passions relative to <lb/>
            pain, it assumes the name of fortitude. And thus far it respects <lb/>
            private good immediately, yet it also extends its influence to the <lb/>
            good of others through the connexions of kindred nature and of <lb/>
            social life.</p>
          <p>But since every man is a member of some civil community, since <lb/>
            he is linked with the fellows of his own species, and is related to <lb/>
            every nature superior and divine, and is also a part of universal <lb/>
            nature; he must always of necessity participate of the good and <lb/>
            evil of every whole, greater as well as less, to which he belongs; <lb/>
            and he has an interest in the well-being of every species with <lb/>
            which he is connected. Virtue therefore, with immediate reference <lb/>
            to the good of others, to the public good, to the general good of <lb/>
            mankind, and to universal good, (yet remotely, and by way of con­ <lb/>
            sequence, affecting private good,) virtue, we say, as she regulates <lb/>
            the conduct of man, in order to these ends, has the title given her <lb/>
            of justice, (universal, or particular in all its various branches,) <lb/>
            friendship, patriotism, humanity, equity, and piety, with every <lb/>
            subordinate duty springing out of these.</p>
          <p>But since, in order to effect thoroughly, and fully to accomplish, <lb/>
            the good of any vital whole, there must be a conspiration and a <lb/>
            co-operation of all the parts; there ought in every public body to <lb/>
            be one mind or law presiding over, disposing, and directing all; <lb/>
            that through all may run one spirit, and that in all one virtue may <lb/>
            operate. To illustrate this, the idea is presented of a perfect <lb/>
            commonwealth, and a just model is framed of public laws: and in <lb/>
            this the nature of virtue is seen most godlike, that is, of herself most <lb/>
            diffusive and productive of the most good in her making all happy, <lb/>
            as she is political and legislative.</p>
          <p>Thus all virtue is order and proportion, whether in the soul of <lb/>
            man, or in a civil state; and by putting measure into all the man­ <lb/>
            ners, and into every action, whether of private or of public life, it <lb/>
             <pb n="415"/>
            produces in them symmetry and beauty; for of these proportioned <lb/>
            measure is the principle. Virtue can do this, because the rule, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to which the virtuous mind or the will governs, is beauty <lb/>
            itself; and the science, through which she governs, is the science <lb/>
            of that beauty: for truth and beauty concur in one; and wherever <lb/>
            they are, there also is good found. The love of beauty then is <lb/>
            nothing different from that first and leading motive in all minds to <lb/>
            the pursuit of every thing, namely, that motive whence the philoso­ <lb/>
            pher sets out in his inquiry after wisdom, the desire of good. Thus <lb/>
            the perfection of man consists in his similitude to this supreme <lb/>
            beauty; and in his union with it is found his supreme good.</p>
          <p>The dialogues of Plato, with respect to their subjects, may be <lb/>
            divided, conformably to this sketch of their design, into the specu­ <lb/>
            lative and the practical, and into such as are of a mixed nature. <lb/>
            The subjects of these last are either general, which comprehend <lb/>
            both the others; or differential, which distinguish them. The <lb/>
            general subjects are either fundamental, or final: those of the <lb/>
            fundamental kind are philosophy, and human nature, and the soul <lb/>
            of man: those of the final kind are love, and beauty, and good. <lb/>
            The differential subjects regard knowledge, as it stands related to <lb/>
            practice, in which are considered two questions; one of which is, <lb/>
            whether virtue is to be taught; the other is, whether error in the <lb/>
            will depend on error in the judgment. The subjects of the specu­ <lb/>
            lative dialogues relate either to words or to things: of the former <lb/>
            sort are etymology, sophistry, rhetoric, and poetry: of the latter sort <lb/>
            are science, true being, the principles of mind, and outward na­ <lb/>
            ture. The practical subjects relate either to private conduct and <lb/>
            to the government of the mind over the whole man, or to his duty <lb/>
            towards others in his several relations, or to the government of a <lb/>
            civil state and to the public conduct of a whole people. Under <lb/>
            these three heads the particular subjects practical rank in order; <lb/>
            namely, virtue in general, sanctity, temperance, and fortitude; <lb/>
            justice, friendship, patriotism, and piety; the ruling mind in a civil <lb/>
            government, the frame and order of a state, and law in general; <lb/>
            and lastly, those rules of government and of public conduct which <lb/>
            constitute the civil laws.</p>
          <p>Thus, for the sake of giving the reader a scientific, that is, a <lb/>
            comprehensive, and at the same time a distinct, view of Plato's <lb/>
            writings, it has been attempted to exhibit to him their just and <lb/>
            natural distinctions; whether he choose to consider them with re­ <lb/>
            gard to their inward form or essence, or to their outward form or <lb/>
            appearance, or to their matter or their end, that is, with regard <lb/>
            to their genius, to their character, to their subject, and to their <lb/>
            design.</p>

          <p>A MAN of fortune; his estate was worth above eight talents, <lb/>
            which in Athens was very considerable. Had served the offices <lb/>
            of gymnasiarch, choregus, &amp;c., the most expensive of the city. Of <lb/>
            an amorous disposition; negligent of economy; a lover of dramatic <lb/>
            spectacles ; he married a very young, inexperienced woman, with <lb/>
            whom he conversed very little :15 he was present at the entertain­ <lb/>
            ment given by Callias to Autolycus, Socrates, and others, and at <lb/>
            that time was newly married. 01. 89, 4. He was remarkable for <lb/>
            his beauty; his fine panegyric on it: was passionately fond of <lb/>
            Clinias. Crito, the father of the latter, introduced him to the ac­ <lb/>
            quaintance of Socrates, that he might cure him of this passion.16</p>

            <title type="sub">ISCHOMACHUS.</title>

          <p>HE was called in Athens, by way of pre-eminence, <foreign xml:lang="grc">όκαλός <lb/>
            κᾲγαθός</foreign>; he married a young maid under fifteen years of age, <lb/>

            His instruction and treatment of his slaves; his knowledge in <lb/>
            agriculture. His father before him was a great lover of that art. 17 <lb/>
            He meddled not much in public affairs :18 was believed, while he <lb/>

              Callias was in love with Autolycus, the son of Lyco, who gained <lb/>
              the victory (while yet a boy) in the Pancratium during the greater <lb/>
              Panathenaea, 01. 89, 4, upon which occasion Callias gave an enter­ <lb/>
              tainment to his friends24 at his house in the Piræeus. He had <lb/>
              been scholar to the sophists Protagoras, Gorgias, and Prodicus; was <lb/>
              very wealthy; and had learned the art of memory from Hippias of <lb/>
              Elis, at the recommendation of Antisthenes. He was <foreign xml:lang="grc">Προξενος</foreign> of <lb/>
              the Lacedæmonians who came to Athens ; was hereditary priest of <lb/>
              the Eleusinian deities, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁΔᾳδου̃Χος</foreign>; was remarkable for his nobility <lb/>
              and the gracefulness of his person; 25 he had two sons, who were <lb/>
              instructed by Evenus, the Parian sophist; 26 he entertained Prota­ <lb/>
              goras, Prodicus, and Hippias, and other sophists, their companions, <lb/>
              in his house, 01. 90, 1.27</p>

          <p>He was son to the famous Nicias; was present at the symposium <lb/>
            of Callias, 01. 89, 4, and then newly married. He could repeat by <lb/>
            heart the whole Iliad and Odyssey, and had been scholar to Stesim­ <lb/>
            brotus and Anaximander. He was very wealthy and somewhat <lb/>
            covetous ; was fond of his wife, and beloved by her; 28 was scholar <lb/>
            to Damon, the famous musician, who had been recommended to <lb/>
            his father by Socrates; 29 and finally, he was put to death by order <lb/>
            of the Thirty, with his uncle Eucrates. 30</p>

          <p>He was extremely poor, but with a contempt of wealth; was <lb/>
            present in the symposium of Callias, where he proved that riches <lb/>
            and poverty are in the mind alone, and not in externals. His way <lb/>
            of life was easy and contented: he passed whole days in the com­ <lb/>
            pany of Socrates, who taught him (he says) to be mentally rich. <lb/>
            He was much beloved in the city, and his scholars were esteemed <lb/>
            by the public. He recommended Prodicus and Hippias the Elean <lb/>
            to Callias; 31 bore great affection to Socrates, and was present at <lb/>
            his death.32</p>

            the liberties of the people; he fled to and returned with Thrasy­ <lb/>
            bulus ; he died before Socrates's trial, for he is mentioned in Socra­ <lb/>

            his death must therefore have happened between 01, 93, 4, and <lb/>

            were wiser than Socrates. His brother, Chaerecrates, survived <lb/>

          <p>THIS is supposed to be the first dialogue which Plato wrote, <lb/>

            spicuity; and he remarks that he sometimes rises to a true sub­ <lb/>
            limity, and sometimes falls into an ungraceful redundancy of words <lb/>
            and of ill-suited figures, ungraceful and obscure.</p>
          <p>There is a good analysis of the Phædrus by the Abbé Sallier, <lb/>
            wherein he shows its true subject and intention. It is upon elo­ <lb/>
            quence, and is designed to demonstrate, that no writer, whether <lb/>
            legislator, orator, historian, or poet, can do any thing excellent <lb/>
            without a foundation of philosophy. The title prefixed to it, " On <lb/>
            the Beautiful," cannot be genuine. It has no other relation to it, <lb/>
            than that beauty is accidentally the theme of Socrates's second little <lb/>
            oration, which is contained in this dialogue; not that it is, directly, <lb/>
            even the subject of that, for the tendency of it is to prove, that a <lb/>
            person ought to gratify rather the party who loves, than the one <lb/>
            who does not, as the two preceding orations were to show the con­ <lb/>
            trary. These are what Diogenes Laertius calls questions of a juve­ <lb/>
            nile kind, though he may mean it of the whole dialogue, which is <lb/>
            something juvenile and full of vanity, and such, Dionysius very <lb/>
            justly says, was the character of Plato.</p>
          <p>The Socratic dialogues are a kind of drama, wherein the time, <lb/>
            the place, and the characters are almost as exactly marked as in a <lb/>
            true theatrical representation. Phædrus here is a young man par­ <lb/>
            ticularly sensible to eloquence and to fine writing, and thence a <lb/>
            follower and an admirer of the famous Lysias, whose reputation <lb/>
            was then at its height in Athens. He had been sitting the greatest <lb/>
            part of the morning at the house of Epicrates, near the Olympium, <lb/>
            to hear Lysias recite a discourse; and, having procured a copy of <lb/>
            it, is meditating upon it with pleasure, as he walks without the <lb/>
            city walls, where Socrates meets him. To avoid the heat of the <lb/>
            day they retire to the shade of an ancient plane-tree, that over­ <lb/>
            shadows a fane of Acheloüs and the Nymphs on the banks of a <lb/>
            rivulet, which discharges itself at a little distance into the Ilyssus. <lb/>
            The spot lay less than a quarter of a mile above the bridge, which <lb/>
            led over the river to the temple of Diana Agræa. Here they <lb/>
             <pb n="422"/>
            pursue their conversation during the hours of noon, till the sun <lb/>
            grows lower and the heat becomes more mild.</p>
          <p>We may nearly fix the year when this conversation is supposed <lb/>
            to have happened. Lysias was now at Athens; he arrived there <lb/>
            from Thurii in Italy in the forty-seventh year of his age, 01. 92, <lb/>
            1. Euripides is also mentioned as still in the city; he left it to go <lb/>
            into Macedonia, 01. 92, 4, and, consequently, it must have hap­ <lb/>
            pened in some year of that Olympiad, probably the 2nd or 3rd, <lb/>
            and Plato must have written it in less than ten years afterwards, <lb/>
            for his Lysis was written before the death of Socrates, which was <lb/>
            01. 95, 1, but the Phædrus was still earlier, being his first com­ <lb/>
            position ; so he was between twenty and twenty-nine years of age.</p>

            plainly in the course of these little orations, and must appear a most <lb/>
            strange subject of conversation for Socrates, to all who are unacquainted <lb/>
            with the manners of Greece. The President de Montesquieu has <lb/>
            observed, but too justly, on the nature of their love and gallantry. Esprit <lb/>

            general and shocking depravity ?</p>
          <p>P. 235. Nothing from myself. <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρά γε ἐμαυτου̃ οὐδὲν</foreign>.] It is ob­ <lb/>
            servable, that Socrates, whenever he would discourse affirmatively on <lb/>
            any subject, or when he thought proper to raise and adorn his style, does <lb/>
            it not in his own person, but assumes the character of another, Thus, <lb/>
            for instance, he relates the beautiful fable between Virtue and Pleasure <lb/>
            after Prodicus ; he treats of the miseries of human life in the words of <lb/>
            the same sophist; lie describes the state of souls after death from the <lb/>
            information of Gobryas, one of the Magi; he makes a panegyric on <lb/>
            wine in the style of Gorgias ; and here he does not venture to display his <lb/>
            eloquence, till the Nymphs and the Muses have inspired him. This is <lb/>
            consistent with that character of simplicity and of humility which he <lb/>
            assumed.</p>
          <p>P. 241. <foreign xml:lang="grc">̕̕̕̕Οστρά̕̕̕κου μεταπεσόντος</foreign>.] A proverb, taken from a game in <lb/>
            use among children, called '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Οστρακί̕νδα</foreign>, described by Jul. Pollux, ix. <lb/>
            154, and by Eustathius. They were divided into two parties, which fled <lb/>
            or pursued each other alternately, as the chance of a piece of broken <lb/>
            potsherd, thrown up into the air, determined it: the boy who threw it <lb/>
            cried out <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νὑξ η̃</foreign> ‛<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ημέρα</foreign> ; if the black (or pitched) side came uppermost, <lb/>
            his party ran away, and the other gave them chase; if the white one, the <lb/>
            others ran, and they pursued them. Hence '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Οστράκου Περιστροφ</foreign>n<foreign xml:lang="grc">̀</foreign> was <lb/>
            used to describe a total reverse of fortune. Erasmus, in his Adagia, has <lb/>
            not explained it well.</p>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εὔφ</foreign>n<foreign xml:lang="grc">μα φώνει</foreign>, as though in a part of a river, where there was a long and <lb/>
            dangerous winding, the sailors used this piece of flattery by way of pro­ <lb/>
            pitiating the Nile; but this does not fully clear up the passage here. <lb/>
            That this proverb was so used may appear from the words of Athenæus, <lb/>

            call the place of the women's contest pleasant bend;'" which last may <lb/>
            mean, a specious term to cover their ignominy. Casaubon does not <lb/>
            explain it: here it seems applied to such as speak one thing and mean <lb/>
            another.</p>
          <p>P. 259, § 90. Falling asleep.] The Greeks usually slept at noon in <lb/>

            countries.</p>
          <p>P. 259, § 91. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τεττἰγων</foreign>.] The tettix, in Latin " cicada," is an animal <lb/>
            with wings, the size of a man's thumb, of a dark brown colour, which <lb/>
            sits on the trees and sings, that is, makes a noise like a cricket; but much <lb/>
            more shrill, and without any intervals, which grows louder as the sun <lb/>
            grows hotter. Some supposed it to live on the air, others, on dew only. <lb/>
            It does in reality live on the exudations of plants, having a proboscis, like <lb/>
            flies, to feed with; but is capable of living a long time, like many of the <lb/>
            insect race, without any nourishment at all. The tettigometra, which is <lb/>
            this creature in its intermediate state between a worm and a fly, was <lb/>
            esteemed a delicacy to eat by the Greeks.</p>
          <p>P. 261. The Eleatic Palamedes.] Quintilian, iii. 1—10, informs <lb/>
            us, that the person here meant is Alcidamas of Elea. Diogen. Laert. <lb/>
            ix. 25, takes it to be meant of Zeno Eleates, who is looked upon as the <lb/>
            inventor of disputation and of logic, and who was at Athens when So­ <lb/>
            crates was not above eight years old, that is, above fifty years earlier <lb/>
            than the time of this dialogue; but his contemporary Empedocles was <lb/>
            the first who cultivated rhetoric as an art, and taught it to Gorgias, who <lb/>
            published a book on that subject.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>THERE is no circumstance in this dialogue to inform us when <lb/>
            it happened; but it is certain that Plato wrote it when he was <lb/>
            yet a young man, before 01. 95, 1, for Socrates heard it read. <lb/>
            The scene of it is in a Palæstra, then newly built, a little with­ <lb/>
            out the walls of Athens, near the fountain of Panops, between <lb/>
            the Academia and the Lycæum. The interlocutors are, Socrates ; <lb/>
            Hippothales and Ctesippus, two young men of Athens; Lysis, a <lb/>
            boy of noble birth and fortune, beloved by Hippothales; and <lb/>
            Menexenus, also a boy, and cousin to Ctesippus, and friend to <lb/>
            Lysis. The characters are, as usual, elegantly drawn; but what <lb/>
            is the end or meaning of the whole dialogue, I do not pretend <lb/>
            to say. It turns upon the nature and definition of friendship. <lb/>
            Socrates starts a hundred notions about it, and confutes them <lb/>
            all himself; nothing is determined, the dialogue is interrupted and <lb/>
            there is an end. Perhaps a second dialogue was designed on the <lb/>
            same subject and never executed. As to all the mysteries which <lb/>
            Serranus has discovered in it, they are mere dreams of his own. <lb/>
            The first part of this dialogue is of that kind called <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μαιευτικός</foreign>, <lb/>
            " Obstetrical," and the second part, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πειϱαστικός</foreign>, " Tentative."</p>
          <p>N. B. The discourse with Menexenus is intended to correct a <lb/>
            boy of a bolder and more forward nature than Lysis, by showing <lb/>
            him that he knows nothing ; and leaves him in the opinion of his <lb/>
            own ignorance. The second title of the dialogue is a false or an <lb/>
            incorrect one, for friendship is only by accident a part of it. The <lb/>
            intent of the whole seems to be, to show in what manner we should <lb/>
            converse with young people according to their different dispositions.</p>

          <p>P. 204—211. Thus far the dialogue is very easy and elegant, par­ <lb/>
            ticularly the short conversation with Lysis, which is an example how <lb/>
            children of fortune and family ought to be treated, in order to correct <lb/>
            that arrogance which those advantages are apt to inspire, and to win <lb/>

          <p>THE title expressing the subject of this dialogue (like that of <lb/>
            Lysis, is wrong. Dacier rightly observes, that the titles are com­ <lb/>
            monly nothing to the purpose; but he is strangely mistaken in <lb/>
            saying, they are of modern invention, and that Diogenes Laertius <lb/>
            makes no mention of them. That author actually mentions them <lb/>
            all, and from his account they appear to be more ancient than <lb/>
            Thrasyllus, who lived probably under Augustus and Tiberius, and <lb/>
            who seemingly took them to be all of Plato's own hand.</p>
          <p>The true subject certainly is, to demonstrate the necessity of <lb/>
            knowing one's self, and that, without this foundation, all other <lb/>
            acquisitions in science are not only useless, but pernicious.</p>
          <p>The time of this dialogue is towards the end of Alcibiades' nine­ <lb/>
            teenth year, which (as Dodwell reckons) is 01. 87, 1. Socrates was <lb/>

            court of Areopagus were inspectors of the education of youth. The <lb/>
            members of it divided that care among them, and each of them in his <lb/>
            province took note of such fathers as gave not their children an education <lb/>
            suitable to their fortune and way of life, as Isocrates shows at large in <lb/>
            his beautiful Areopagitic oration. At what time their vigilance on this <lb/>
            head began to decline, I cannot fix ; but it was probably towards the be­ <lb/>
            ginning of the administration of Pericles, when the authority of that vener­ <lb/>
            able body was lessened and restrained by Ephialtes, that is, before 01. <lb/>

            force of it: for Æschines, in Axioch. p. 367, § 8, speaking of the discipline <lb/>
            young men were subject to, from about the age of eighteen to twenty, <lb/>
            says that " The whole period of youth is under Moderators, and the se­ <lb/>

            and its surrender to Lysander, when that point was carried after a great <lb/>

            prieties of character which must be the consequences of Dacier's <lb/>
            supposition. It is plain that Socrates continues, as in the preceding <lb/>
            discourse, to treat Alcibiades with a certain gentle superiority of <lb/>
            understanding, and that he prescribes to, and instructs him in, a <lb/>
            manner extremely proper to form the mind of a youth just enter­ <lb/>
            ing into the world, but ill-bred and impertinent to a man of forty <lb/>
            years of age, who had passed through the highest dignities of the <lb/>
            state and through the most extraordinary reverses of fortune. Plato <lb/>
            himself may convince us of this, by what he makes Socrates say in <lb/>
            the first Alcibiades, p. 127, § 48: " But now you ought to take <lb/>
            courage. For if you had perceived that you were suffering so at <lb/>
            the age of fifty, it would have been difficult to take care of yourself. <lb/>
            But now you are at the very time of life, when it is meet for you to <lb/>
            perceive it."</p>
          <p>The principal difficulties are that he speaks of Pericles as yet <lb/>
            living, who died 01. 87, 4, and of the murder of Archelaus king of <lb/>
            Macedon as a fact then recent, which did not happen till 01. 95, 1, <lb/>
            the same year with Socrates's death, and near five years after that <lb/>
            of Alcibiades.</p>

          <p>P. 141. Ta <foreign xml:lang="grc">παιδικα</foreign>.] Craterus conspired with Hellenocrates and De­ <lb/>
            camnichus to murder that prince, (Archelaus of Macedonia,) as he was <lb/>
            hunting. Aristotle calls him Cratæus, and gives a fuller account of this <lb/>
            conspiracy than any other author. Aristot. Politic, v. 10. Archelaus <lb/>
            had promised him one of his daughters in marriage, for he had two, but <lb/>
            gave one to the king of Elimea and the other to his own son Amyntas. <lb/>
             <pb n="428"/>
            Hellenocrates was a Larissæan who had likewise been subservient to the <lb/>
            king's pleasures.</p>
          <p>P. 148. Sacrifices the most numerous.] The Athenians were re­ <lb/>
            mark-ably sumptuous in their temples and public worship, beyond any <lb/>
            other people. Two months in the year were taken up entirely in these <lb/>
            solemnities. See Schol. on Aristoph. in Vesp. vs. 655, and Xenoph. Rep. <lb/>
            Athen. p. 699.</p>
          <p>P. 150. It is he of whose care you are the object.] Socrates may <lb/>
            either mean the Divinity here, as in the former dialogue, Alcibiad. 1. p. <lb/>
            122, § 37 ; for it was the character of Socrates to assume nothing to him­ <lb/>
            self, but all to the demon, who directed him, whom he calls his, ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Επίτϱο­ <lb/>
            πος</foreign>, " Guardian:" or Socrates may here mean himself, as I rather think. <lb/>
            Some Christian writers indeed would give a very extraordinary turn to <lb/>
            this part of the dialogue, as though Plato meant to prove the necessity of <lb/>
            a Revelation. But I can see no such mysteries in it. Socrates has <lb/>
            proved that we are neither fit to deal with mankind, till we know them <lb/>
            by knowing ourselves ; nor to address ourselves to the Divine power, till <lb/>
            we know enough of his nature to know what we owe him: what that <lb/>
            nature is, he defers examining till another opportunity, which is done to <lb/>
            raise the curiosity and impatience of the young Alcibiades, and to avoid <lb/>
            that prolixity, into which a disquisition so important would have naturally <lb/>
            led him.</p>

          <p>DEMODOCUS of Anagyrus, an old Athenian who had passed with <lb/>
            reputation through the highest offices of the state, and now, after <lb/>
            the manner of his ancestors, lived chiefly on his lands in the <lb/>
            country, employed in agriculture and rustic amusements, brings <lb/>
            with him to Athens his son Theages, a youth impatient to improve <lb/>
            himself in the arts then in vogue, and to shine among his compani­ <lb/>
            ons who studied eloquence,' and practised politics, as soon as ever <lb/>
            their age would permit them to appear in the popular assemblies.</p>
          <p>Socrates, at the father's desire, enters into conversation with <lb/>
            the young man, and decoys him by little and little into a confession <lb/>
            that he wanted to be a great man, and to govern his fellow citizens. <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristophanes ridicules in many places this turn of the age in which he <lb/>
            lived. Reading, and the knowledge of the Belles Lettres, having more <lb/>
            generally diffused itself through the body of the people, than it had done <lb/>
            hitherto, had an ill effect on the manners of a nation naturally vain and <lb/>
            lively. Every one had a smattering of eloquence and of reasoning, and <lb/>
            every one would make a figure and govern; but no one would be governed: <lb/>
            the authority of age and of virtue was lost and overborne, and wit and a <lb/>
            fluency of words supplied the place of experience and of common sense. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="429"/>
            After diverting himself with the naïveté, of Theages, he proposes <lb/>
            ironically several sophists of reputation, and several famous states­ <lb/>
            men, who were fit to instruct him in this grand art: but as it does <lb/>
            not appear that the disciples of those sophists, or even the sons of <lb/>
            those statesmen, have been much the better for their lessons, both <lb/>
            Demodocus and Theages entreat and insist that Socrates himself <lb/>
            would admit him to his company and favour him with his instruc­ <lb/>
            tions. The philosopher very gravely tells them stories of his demon, <lb/>
            without whose permission he undertakes nothing, and upon whom <lb/>
            it entirely depends, whether his conversation shall be of any use, <lb/>
            or not, to his friends; but at last he acquiesces, if Theages cares to <lb/>
            make the experiment.</p>
          <p>The scene of the dialogue is in the portico, described by Pausa­ <lb/>

            street of Athens; and the time 01. 92, 3-4, during the expedition of <lb/>
            Thrasyllus, in which he was defeated at Ephesus by the Persians <lb/>

            called " king," meets while he is walking in the portico, where that <lb/>
            magistrate used to sit in judgment, with Euthyphro, a person <lb/>
            deeply versed in the knowledge of religious affairs, as sacrifices, <lb/>
            oracles, divinations, and such matters, and full of that grave kind <lb/>
            of arrogance which these mysterious sciences use to inspire. His <lb/>
            father, having an estate in the isle of Naxus, had employed among <lb/>
            his own slaves a poor Athenian who worked for hire. This man, <lb/>
            having drunk too much, had quarrelled with and actually murdered <lb/>
            one of the slaves. Upon which, the father of Euthyphro appre­ <lb/>
            hended and threw him into a jail, till the Interpreters, <lb/>
            had been consulted, in order to know what should be done. The <lb/>
            man, not having been taken much care of, died in his confinement: <lb/>
            upon which Euthyphro determines to lodge an indictment against <lb/>
            his own father for murder. Socrates, surprised at the novelty of <lb/>
            such an accusation, inquires into the sentiments of Euthyphro with <lb/>
            regard to piety and the service of the gods, by way of informing <lb/>
            himself on that subject against the time of his trial, and by frequent <lb/>
            questions, entangling him in his own concessions, and forcing him <lb/>
            to shift from one principle and definition to another, soon lays <lb/>
            open his ignorance, and shows that all his ideas of religion were <lb/>
            founded on childish fables and on arbitrary forms and institutions.</p>
          <p>The intention of the dialogue seems to be, to expose the vulgar <lb/>
            notions of piety, founded on traditions unworthy of the Divinity, <lb/>
            and employed in propitiating him by puerile inventions and by the <lb/>
            vain ceremonies of external worship, without regard to justice and <lb/>
            to those plain duties of society, which alone can render us truly <lb/>
            worthy of the Deity.</p>

            <title type="sub">THE APOLOGY OF SOCRATES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>PLATO was himself present at the trial of Socrates, being then <lb/>
            about twenty-nine years of age; and he was one of those who <lb/>
            offered to speak in his defence, though the court would not suffer <lb/>
            him to proceed, and to be bound as a surety for the payment of his <lb/>
            fine: yet we are not to imagine, that this oration was the real de- <note type="footnote"> Antipho Orat. de cæde Herodis, and de cæde Choreutæ. Informations <lb/>
            might also (as it seems) be laid in the court of Heliæa before the Thes­ <lb/>
            mothetæ. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 The at Athens, like the Pontifices at Rome, were applied <lb/>
            to, when ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εξηγηταὶ</foreign> any prodigy had happened, or any violent death, to settle the rites <lb/>
            of expiation, or to propitiate the manes of the dead. </note> <lb/>

            fence which Socrates made. Dionysius Halicarnassus says, that <lb/>
            it " never saw even the door of the Judgment-Hall, nor of the Agora, <lb/>
            but was written with some other design;" and what that design <lb/>
            was, he explains himself by saying, that, under the cover of an <lb/>
            apology, it is a delicate satire on the Athenians, a panegyric on <lb/>
            Socrates, and a pattern and character of the true philosopher. <lb/>
            Nevertheless, it is founded on truth; it represents the true spirit <lb/>
            and disposition of Socrates, and many of the topics used in it are <lb/>
            agreeable to those which we find in Xenophon, and which were <lb/>
            doubtless used by Socrates himself; as where he mentions his <lb/>
            demon, and the reasons he had for preferring death to life, his <lb/>
            account of the oracle given to Chærepho, and the remarkable <lb/>
            allusion to Palamedes, &amp;c., the ground-work is manifestly the same <lb/>
            though the expressions are different. In one thing only they seem <lb/>
            directly to contradict each other: Xenophon says, he neither <lb/>
            offered himself any thing in mitigation of his punishment, nor <lb/>
            would suffer his friends to do so, looking upon this as an acknow­ <lb/>
            ledgment of some guilt. If the word in the text, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑποτμια̃σθαι</foreign>, means <lb/>
            that he would not submit to ask for a change of his sentence into <lb/>
            banishment, or perpetual imprisonment, so far it is agreeable to <lb/>
            Plato, p. 37; but if it means, that he would not suffer any mulct <lb/>
            himself, nor permit his friends to mention it, we see the con­ <lb/>
            trary, p. 38, where he fines himself one mina, all he was worth, <lb/>
            and where his friends Crito, Critobulus, Plato, and Apollodorus, <lb/>
            offer thirty minæ, (£96 17s. 6d.,) which was, I suppose, all they <lb/>
            could raise, to save him. Now this being a fact, at that time easily <lb/>
            proved or disproved, I am of opinion that Plato never would have <lb/>
            inserted into his discourse a manifest falsity, and, therefore, we are <lb/>
            to take Xenophon's words in that restrained sense which I have <lb/>
            mentioned.</p>
          <p>Potter says, that from the nature of the crime ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ασἑβεια</foreign>, "Impiety," <lb/>
            it is evident that the trial was before the court of Areopagus. But <lb/>
            I take the contrary to be evident from the style both here and in <lb/>
            Xenophon. He always addresses his judges by the name of <foreign xml:lang="grc">῎Ανδρες</foreign>, <lb/>
            " Men," or <foreign xml:lang="grc">῎Ανδϱες</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αθηνα</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">οι</foreign>, " Men of Athens ;" whereas the form of <lb/>
            speaking either to the Areopagites or to the senate of Five Hun­ <lb/>
            dred was constantly <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὤ Βουλή</foreign>, " Oh ! thou the Council:” and in the <lb/>
            courts of justice, <foreign xml:lang="grc">῎Ανδϱες Δικασταὶ</foreign>, " Jurymen," or sometimes <foreign xml:lang="grc">῎Ανδϱες</foreign> <lb/>
            ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αθηνα</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">οι</foreign>, " Men of Athens," or<foreign xml:lang="grc">῎ Ανδϱες</foreign>, " Men," alone: he therefore <lb/>
            was judged in some of these courts.</p>

          <p>P. 32. ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εβουλευσα δέ</foreign>.] Socrates was in the senate of Five Hun­ <lb/>
            dred, 01. 93, 3, being then sixty-five years of age. The Prytanes pre­ <lb/>
            sided in the assemblies of the people, were seated in the place of honour, <lb/>
             <pb n="432"/>
            and attended by the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τοξ</foreign>ó<foreign xml:lang="grc">ται</foreign>, who, by their orders, seized any persons <lb/>
            who made a disturbance; they introduced ambassadors, gave liberty of <lb/>
            speaking to the orators, and of voting to the people ; and (as it appears) <lb/>
            any one of them could put a negative on their proceedings, since Socrates <lb/>
            alone, at the trial of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Στϱατηγοί</foreign>, insisted, that the question was contrary <lb/>
            to law, and would not suffer it to be put to the assembly.</p>
          <p>P. 34. One still a youth, and two young children.] Socrates had <lb/>
            three sons, (says Diogen. Laert. ii. 26,) Lamprocles, Sophroniscus, and <lb/>
            Menexenus, the first by Xanthippe, the two others (as it is said) by Myrto, <lb/>
            grand-daughter to the famous Aristides. Some say he married the latter <lb/>
            first; but that is impossible, because he had Lamprocles, his eldest son, <lb/>
            by Xanthippe; and she certainly survived him; therefore, if Myrto were <lb/>
            his wife, he must have had two wives together. This is indeed affirmed <lb/>
            in a treatise on nobility ascribed to Aristotle, and by Aristoxenus and <lb/>
            Callisthenes his scholars, as well as by Demetrius Phalereus, and others. <lb/>
            It is a very extraordinary thing, that such men should be deceived in a <lb/>
            fact which happened so near their own time ; yet Panætius, in his Life of <lb/>
            Socrates, expressly refuted this story : and it is sure, that neither Xeno­ <lb/>
            phon, nor Plato, nor any other of his contemporaries, mentions any wife <lb/>
            but Xanthippe.</p>

          <p>THIS famous dialogue was supposed by Panætius, in Antholog. <lb/>
            Gr. i. 44, the Stoic, a great admirer of Plato, not to be genuine, or <lb/>
            at least interpolated, rather, as it seems, from his own persuasion <lb/>
            of the soul's mortality, than from any thing in the piece itself unlike <lb/>
            the manner or the tenets of the philosopher, to whom it has always <lb/>
            been ascribed. The whole course of antiquity has regarded it <lb/>
            as one of his principal works; and what seems decisive, Aristotle <lb/>
            himself cites it as a work of his master.</p>
          <p>The historical part of it is admirable, and, though written and <lb/>
            disposed with all the art and management of the best tragic writer, <lb/>
            for the slightest circumstance in it wants not its force and meaning, <lb/>
            it exhibits nothing to the eye but the noble simplicity of nature. <lb/>
            Every intelligent reader will feel what those who were eye-wit­ <lb/>
            nesses are said to have felt, namely, " a certain unusual mixture <lb/>
            compounded of pleasure and pain simultaneously." The inno­ <lb/>
            cence, the humanity, the cheerfulness, and the unaffected intre­ <lb/>
            pidity of Socrates, will draw some tears from him, as it did many <lb/>
            from them, as for the loss of a father ; and will, at the same time, <lb/>
            better than any arguments, show him a soul, which, if it were not <lb/>
            so, at least deserved to be immortal.</p><pb n="433"/>
            
          <p>The reasoning part is far inferior, sometimes weak, sometimes <lb/>
            false, too obscure, too abstracted, to convince us of any thing; yet <lb/>
            with a mixture of good sense and with many fine observations. <lb/>
            The fabulous account of a future state is too particular and too <lb/>
            fantastic an invention for Socrates to dwell upon at such a time, <lb/>
            and has less decorum and propriety in it than the other parts of <lb/>
            the dialogue.</p>
          <p>Socrates attempts in this dialogue to prove that true philosophy <lb/>
            is but a continual preparation for death; its daily study and <lb/>
            practice being to wean and separate the body from the soul, whose <lb/>
            pursuit of truth is perpetually stopped and impeded by the numerous <lb/>
            avocations, the little pleasures, pains, and necessities of its com­ <lb/>
            panion. That, as death is but a transition from its opposite, life, (in <lb/>
            the same manner as heat is from cold, weakness from strength, <lb/>
            and all things, both in the natural and in the moral world, from <lb/>
            their contraries,) so life is only a transition from death ; whence he <lb/>
            would infer the probability of a metempsychosis. That, such pro­ <lb/>
            positions, as every one assents to at first, being self-evident, and <lb/>
            no one giving any account how such parts of knowledge, on which <lb/>
            the rest are founded, were originally conveyed to our mind, there <lb/>
            must have been a pre-existent state, in which the soul was ac­ <lb/>
            quainted with these truths, which she recollects and assents to on <lb/>
            their recurring to her in this life. That, as truth is eternal and <lb/>
            immutable, and not visible to our senses, but to the soul alone; and <lb/>
            as the empire, which she exercises over the body, bears a resemblance <lb/>
            to the power of the Divinity, it is probable that she, like her object, <lb/>
            is everlasting and unchangeable, and, like the office she bears, <lb/>
            something divine. That, it cannot be, as some have thought, <lb/>
            merely a harmony resulting from a disposition of parts in the body, <lb/>
            since it directs, commands, and restrains the functions of that very <lb/>
            body. That, the soul, being the cause of life to the body, can never <lb/>
            itself be susceptible of death; and that, there will be a state of <lb/>
            rewards and punishments, the scene of which he takes pains in <lb/>
            describing, though he concludes, that no man can tell exactly <lb/>
            where or what it shall be.</p>

          <p>THE scene lies in the school of Dionysius the grammarian, who <lb/>
            was Plato's own master. The design is to show, that philosophy <lb/>
            consists not in ostentation, nor in that insight (which the sophists <lb/>
            affected) into a variety of the inferior parts of science, but in the <lb/>
            knowledge of one's self, and in a sagacity in discovering the <lb/>
            characters and dispositions of mankind, and of correcting and of <lb/>
            modelling their minds to their own advantage.</p>
          <p>The dialogue is excellent, but too short for such a subject. The <lb/>
            interlocutors are not named, nor is there any mark of the time <lb/>
            when it happened.</p>

          <p>1. Lysimachus, son to the famous Aristides, surnamed The Just.</p>
          <p>2. Melesias, son to that Thucydides who was the great rival of <lb/>
            Pericles in the administration.</p>
          <p>3. Nicias, so often the general in the Peloponnesian war, cele­ <lb/>
            brated for his goodness, for his conduct, and for his success, till the <lb/>
            fatal expedition to Syracuse, in which he perished.</p>
          <p>4. Laches, son of Melanopus of the district Æxone, and tribe <lb/>
            Cecropis, commander of the fleet sent to the assistance of the <lb/>
            Leontines in Sicily, 01. 88, 2, in which expedition he defeated the <lb/>
            Locrians, reduced Messene, Mylæ, and other places, and after his <lb/>
            recall seems to have been prosecuted by Clean for corruption in <lb/>

            this very year; whence it appears, that he was in the battle of <lb/>
            Delium.</p>
          <p>5. Thucydides, son to Melesias. )</p>
          <p>6. Aristides, son to Lysimachus. Two youths under twenty years of age.</p>
          <p>7. Socrates, then in his forty-seventh year.</p>
          <p>The two first of these persons, being then very ancient, and pro­ <lb/>
            bably about seventy years of age, and sensible of that defect in <lb/>
            their own education, which had caused them to lead their lives in <lb/>
            an obscurity unworthy the sons of such renowned fathers, were <lb/>
            the more solicitous on account of their own sons, who were now <lb/>
            almost of an age to enter into the world. They therefore invite <lb/>
            Nicias and Laches, men of distinguished abilities and bravery, but <lb/>
            some years younger than themselves, to a conference on that <lb/>
            subject; and after having been spectators together of the feats of <lb/>
            arms exhibited by Stesilaus, a professed master in the exercise of <lb/>
            all weapons, they enter into conversation. Socrates, who happened <lb/>
            to be present, is introduced by Laches to Lysimachus, as a person <lb/>
            worthy to bear a part in their consultation. The first question is <lb/>
            occasioned by the spectacle which they had just beheld, namely, <lb/>
            " whether the management of arms be an exercise fit to be learned <lb/>
            by young men of quality?" Nicias is desired first to deliver his <lb/>
            opinion, which is, that it may give grace and agility to their <lb/>
            persons, and courage and confidence to their minds; that it may <lb/>
            make them more terrible to their enemies in battle, and more <lb/>
            useful to their friends; and at the same time may inspire them <lb/>
            with a laudable ambition to attain the higher and more noble parts <lb/>
            of military knowledge. Laches has a direct contrary opinion of it: <lb/>
            he argues from his own experience, that he never knew a man, who <lb/>
            valued himself upon this art, that had distinguished himself in the <lb/>
            war; that the Lacedæmonians, who valued and cultivated military <lb/>
            discipline beyond all others, gave no encouragement to these <lb/>
            masters of defence; that, to excel in it, only served to make a <lb/>
            coward more assuming and impudent, and to expose a brave man <lb/>
            to envy and calumny, by making any little failing or oversight <lb/>
            more conspicuous in him.</p>
          <p>Socrates is then prevailed upon to decide the difference, who <lb/>
            artfully turns the question of much greater importance for a young <lb/>
            man of spirit to know, namely, " what is valour, and how it is <lb/>
            distinguished from a brutal and unmeaning fierceness." By inter­ <lb/>
            rogating Laches and Nicias, he shows, that such as had the highest <lb/>
            reputation for courage in practice, were often very deficient in the <lb/>
            theory; and yet none can communicate a virtue he possesses, <lb/>
            without he has himself a clear idea of it. He proves, that valour <lb/>
            must have good sense for its basis; that it consists in the know­ <lb/>
            ledge of what is and what is not to be feared; and that, con­ <lb/>
            sequently, we must first distinguish between real good and evil, <lb/>
            and that it is closely connected with the other virtues, namely, <note type="footnote"> 2 F 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="436"/>
            justice, temperance, and piety, nor can it ever subsist without them. <lb/>
            The scope of this fine dialogue is to show, that philosophy is the <lb/>
            school of true bravery.</p>
          <p>The time of this dialogue is not long after the defeat of the <lb/>
            Athenians at Delium, 01. 89, 1, in which action Socrates had be­ <lb/>
            haved with great spirit, and thence recommended himself to the <lb/>
            friendship of Laches.</p>

          <p>THE intention of the dialogue is to show, that all mankind in <lb/>
            their actions equally tend to some imagined good, but are commonly <lb/>
            mistaken in the nature of it; and that nothing can properly be <lb/>
            called gain which, when attained, is not a real good.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>THIS dialogue is too remarkable to be passed over slightly: we <lb/>
            shall therefore annex the principal heads of it. The question is, <lb/>
            " What is the supreme good of mankind? " and, " whether pleasure <lb/>
            or wisdom have the better pretension to it ? "</p>
          <p>The persons are, Protarchus, the son of Callias, who supports the <lb/>
            cause of pleasure, and Socrates, who opposes it: Philebus, who <lb/>
            had begun the dispute, but was grown weary of it, and many others <lb/>
            of the Athenian youth, are present at the conversation. The time <lb/>
            of it is no where marked. The end of the dialogue is supposed to <lb/>
            be lost.</p>
          <p>P. 12. The name of pleasure, variously applied, to the joys <lb/>
            of intemperance and folly, and to the satisfaction arising from <lb/>
            wisdom, and from the command of our passions.</p>
          <p>Though of unlike, and even of opposite natures, they agree so <lb/>
            far, as they are all pleasures alike; as black and white, though <lb/>
            contrary the one to the other, are comprehended under the general <lb/>
            head of colours.</p><pb n="437"/>
            
          <p>Though included under one name, if some are contrary and of <lb/>
            opposite natures to others, they cannot both be good alike.</p>
          <p>P. 14. Vulgar inquiry, how it is possible for many to be one, <lb/>
            and one many, laid aside by consent as childish. Obscure ques­ <lb/>
            tion on our abstracted idea of unity.</p>
          <p>P. 15. The vanity and disputatious humours of a young man, <lb/>
            who has newly tasted of philosophy and has got hold of a puzzling <lb/>
            question, are well described.</p>
          <p>Every .subject of our conversation has in it a mixture of the <lb/>
            infinite and of the finite.</p>
          <p>P. 16. The true logician will, as the ancients prescribed, first <lb/>
            discover some single and general idea, and then proceed to two <lb/>
            or three subordinate to it, which he will again subdivide into <lb/>
            their several classes, which will form, as it were, a medium beneath <lb/>
            finite and infinite.</p>
          <p>Example in the alphabet. The human voice is one idea, but <lb/>
            susceptible of a variety of modulations, and to be diversified even <lb/>
            to infinity: to know that it is one, and to know that it is infinite, <lb/>
            are neither of them knowledge; but there can be no knowledge <lb/>
            without them.</p>
          <p>When we first attain to the unity of things, we must descend <lb/>
            from number to infinity, if we would know any thing: and when <lb/>
            we first perceive their infinity, we must ascend through number to <lb/>
            unity. Thus the first inventor of letters remarking the endless <lb/>
            variety of sounds, discovered a certain number of vowels, distin­ <lb/>
            guished others of a different power, called consonants, some of <lb/>
            which were mutes, and others liquids, and to the whole combin­ <lb/>
            ation of elements he gave the form and name of an alphabet.</p>
          <p>P. 20. The good, which constitutes happiness, must be in it­ <lb/>
            self sufficient and perfect, the aim and end of all human crea­ <lb/>
            tures.</p>
          <p>A life of mere pleasure considered by itself, which, if pleasure <lb/>
            only be that good, must need no mixture nor addition.</p>
          <p>If we had no memory nor reflection, we could have no enjoyment <lb/>
            of past pleasure, nor hope of future, and scarcely any perception of <lb/>
            the present, which would be much like the life of an oyster: on <lb/>
            the other hand, a life of thought and reflection, without any sense <lb/>
            of pleasure or of pain, seems no desirable state. Neither contem­ <lb/>
            plation therefore nor pleasure are the good we seek after, but pro­ <lb/>
            bably a life composed of both.</p>
          <p>P. 22. Whether the happiness of this mixed state is the re­ <lb/>
            suIt of pleasure, or rather of wisdom, and which contributes most <lb/>
            to it?</p>
          <p>P. 23. Division of all existence into the infinite, the limited,1 <note type="footnote"> 1 Or rather, that which limits and gives bounds, such as figure, which <lb/>
            gives bounds to extension; as time, which limits duration, &amp;c. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="438"/>
            the mixed, which is composed of the two former, and the supreme <lb/>
            cause of all.</p>
          <p>Example of the first; all that admits of increase or decrease, <lb/>
            greater or less, hotter or colder, &amp;c., i. e. all undetermined quantity.</p>
          <p>Of the second; all that determines quantity, as equality, duplicity, <lb/>
            and whatever relation number bears to number, and measure to <lb/>
            measure.</p>
          <p>Of the third, or mixed; all created things, in which the infinity <lb/>
            of matter is, by number and measure, reduced to proportion.</p>
          <p>P. 27. Pleasure and pain, having no bounds1 in themselves, are <lb/>
            of the nature of the infinite.</p>
          <p>P. 28, § 49. The supreme power and wisdom of the Deity asserted.</p>
          <p>P. 28, § 53. But a small portion of the several elements is visible <lb/>
            in our frame. Our soul is a small portion of the spirit of the <lb/>
            universe, or fourth kind mentioned above.</p>
          <p>P. 31. Pain is a consequence of a dissolution of that sym­ <lb/>
            metry and harmony in our fabric, which is the cause of health, <lb/>
            strength, &amp;c.; as pleasure results from the return and restoration of <lb/>
            the parts to their just proportions.</p>
          <p>Thus hunger and thirst are uneasinesses proceeding from emp­ <lb/>
            tiness ; eating and drinking produce pleasure by restoring a proper <lb/>
            degree of repletion. Excess of cold is attended with a sensation of <lb/>
            pain, and warmth brings with it an equal pleasure.</p>
          <p>Pleasures and pains of the soul alone arise from the 3 expectation <lb/>
            of pleasure or pain of the body: these are hopes and fears, and <lb/>
            depend upon the memory.</p>
          <p>A state of indifference is without pleasure or pain, which is con­ <lb/>
            sistent with a life of thought and contemplation.</p>
          <p>P. 33. Sensation is conveyed to the soul through the organs <lb/>
            of the body ; the body may receive many motions and alterations <lb/>
            unperceived by the mind.</p>
          <p>P. 34. Memory is the preserver of our sensations. <lb/>
            Recollection, an act of the mind alone, restores to us ideas im­ <lb/>
            printed in the memory, after an intermission. <note type="footnote"> 1 Happiness and misery, says Mr. Locke, are the names of two extremes, <lb/>
            the utmost bounds whereof we know not: but of some degrees of them we <lb/>
            have very lively ideas. (Chapt. of Power, i. 41.) </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This is an idea of Timæus, the Locrian, p. 100, C. § 7. And Mr. Locke <lb/>
            makes much the same observation. Excess of cold, (says he,) as well as <lb/>
            heat, pains us; because it is equally destructive of that temper, which is <lb/>
            necessary to the preservation and the exercise of the several functions of the <lb/>
            body, and which consists in a moderate degree of warmth, or, if you please, <lb/>
            a motion of the insensible parts of our bodies confined within certain bounds. <lb/>
            Essay on H. U. ch. vii. § 4. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 " Hope is that pleasure in the mind, which every one finds upon the <lb/>
            thought of a profitable future enjoyment of a thing which is apt to delight <lb/>
            him. Fear is an uneasiness upon the thought of future evil, likely to befall <lb/>
            us." Locke, ib. ch. xx. </note></p><pb n="439"/>
            
          <p>Desire, in the mind alone, by which it supplies the wants of the <lb/>
            body: it depends on memory.</p>
          <p>In the appetites, pleasure and pain go together, a proportionable <lb/>
            satisfaction succeeding, as the uneasiness abates.</p>
          <p>Memory1 of a past pleasing sensation inspires hope of a future <lb/>
            one, and thereby abates an uneasiness actually present; as the <lb/>
            absence of hope doubles a present pain.</p>
          <p>P. 36. Whether truth and falsehood belong to pleasures and <lb/>
            pains ?</p>
          <p>They do: as these are founded on our opinions2 of things pre­ <lb/>
            conceived, which may, undoubtedly, be either true or false.</p>
          <p>P. 38. Our opinions are founded on our sensations, and the <lb/>
            memory of them. Thus we see a figure at a distance beyond a <lb/>
            certain rock, or under a certain tree, and we say to ourselves, it is a <lb/>
            man; but on advancing up to it, we find a rude image of wood <lb/>
            carved by a shepherd.</p>
          <p>P. 39. The senses, the memory, and the passions, which at­ <lb/>
            tend on them, write on our souls, or rather delineate, a variety of <lb/>
            conceptions and representations, of which, when justly drawn, we <lb/>
            form true opinions and propositions; but when falsely, we form <lb/>
            false ones.</p>
          <p>On these our hopes and fears are built, and consequently are <lb/>
            capable of truth and falsehood, as well as the opinions on which <lb/>
            they are founded.</p>
          <p>P. 40. The good abound in just and true hopes, fears, and de­ <lb/>
            sires ; the bad, in false and delusive ones.</p>
          <p>P. 41. As pleasures 3 and pains are infinite, we can only mea­ <lb/>
            sure them by comparison, one with the other.</p>
          <p>P. 42, § 89. Our hopes and fears are no less liable to be de­ <lb/>
            ceived by the prospect of distant objects, than our eyes. As we <lb/>
            are always comparing those which are far off, with others less <lb/>
            remote or very near, it is no wonder that we are often mistaken; <lb/>
            especially as a pleasure, when set next a pain, does naturally <lb/>
            appear greater than its true magnitude, and a pain less.</p>
          <p>P. 42, § 90. So much then of pains and pleasures as exceeds or <lb/>
            falls short of its archetype, is false.</p>
          <p>P. 42, § 92. A state of indolence, or of apathy, is supposed by the <lb/>
            school of Heraclitus to be impossible, on account of the perpetual <lb/>

          <p>Motions and alterations1 proved to happen continually in our <lb/>
            body, of which the soul has no perception.</p>
          <p>P. 43. Therefore, (though we should allow the perpetual mo­ <lb/>
            tion of things,) there are times when the soul feels neither pleasure <lb/>
            nor pain ; so that this is a possible state.</p>
          <p>Pleasure, and its contrary, are not the consequences of any <lb/>
            changes in our constituent parts,- but of such changes as are con­ <lb/>
            siderable and violent.</p>
          <p>P. 44. The sect of philosophers, who affirm 2 that there is no <lb/>
            pleasure but the absence of pain, is in the wrong, but from a <lb/>
            noble principle.</p>
          <p>P. 45. To know the nature of pleasure, we should consider <lb/>
            such as are strongest: bodily pleasures are such.</p>
          <p>Pleasure is in proportion to our desires. The desires and long­ <lb/>
            ings of sick persons are the most violent: the mad and thoughtless <lb/>
            feel the strongest3 degree of pleasure and of pain; so that both the <lb/>
            one and the other increase with the disorder and depravity of our <lb/>
            body and mind.</p>
          <p>P. 46. Pleasures of lust have a mixture of pain, as the pain <lb/>
            of the itch4 has a mixture of pleasure, and both subsist at the same <lb/>
            instant.</p>
          <p>Anger, grief, love, envy, are pains of the soul, but with a mixture5 <lb/>
            of pleasure. Exemplified in the exercise of our compassion and <lb/>
            terror at a tragic spectacle, and of our envy at a comic one. <lb/>
            The pleasure of ridicule arises from vanity and from the ignorance <lb/>
            of ourselves. We laugh at the follies of the weak, and hate those <lb/>
            of the powerful.</p>
          <p>P. 47. Pure and unmixed pleasures6 proved to exist: those <lb/>
            of the senses resulting from regularity of figure, beautiful co­ <lb/>
            lours, melodious sounds, odours of fragrance, &amp;c., and all whose <lb/>
            absence is not necessarily accompanied with any uneasiness. <lb/>
            Again: satisfactions of the mind resulting from knowledge, the <lb/>
            absence or loss of which is not naturally attended with any pain.</p>
          <p>P. 53, § 121. A small portion of pure and uncorrupted pleasure <lb/>
            is preferable to a larger one of that which is mixed and impure.</p>
          <p>P. 53, § 122. The opinion of some philosophers, that pleasure is <lb/>
            continually generating, but is never produced, i. e. it has no real <lb/>
            existence, seems true with regard to mere bodily pleasures.</p>

            such of them as approach the nearest to real knowledge, are the <lb/>
            most' considerable, being founded on number, weight, and 2 mea­ <lb/>

          <p>P. 55, § 131. Secondly, those attainable only by use and frequent <lb/>
            trial, being founded on conjecture and experiment, such as music, <lb/>

          <p>THE subject of the dialogue is this: That virtue is knowledge, <lb/>
            and that true philosophy alone can give us that knowledge.</p>
          <p>I see nothing in this dialogue to make one think that Plato in­ <lb/>
            tended to raise the character of Meno. He is introduced as a <lb/>
            young man who seems to value himself on his parts, and on the <lb/>
            proficiency he has made under Gorgias the Leontine, whose notions <lb/>
            are here exposed, and the compliments Socrates makes him on his <lb/>
            beauty, wealth, family, and other distinctions, are only little polite­ <lb/>
            nesses ordinarily used by that philosopher to put persons into good <lb/>
            humour, and draw them into conversation with him.</p>
          <p>The time of the dialogue seems to be not long before the expe­ <lb/>
            dition of the ten thousand into Asia, for Meno was even then a very <lb/>
            young man, and still beardless, as he is represented here; and the <lb/>
            menaces of Anytus (p. 94) show, that it was not long before the <lb/>
            accusation of Socrates; so that we may place it 01. 94, 4, if Plato <lb/>
            may be trusted in these small matters of chronology, which, we <lb/>
            know, he sometimes neglected. Gorgias was yet at Athens, Ol. 93, 4, <lb/>
            and it is probable, that the approaching siege of that city might <note type="footnote"> 1 Vid. de Republ. x. p. 602. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 And above all, logic, to which we owe all the evidence and certainty we <lb/>

            drive him thence into Thessaly, and he returned not till after <lb/>
            Socrates's death.</p>
          <p>Socrates here distinguishes (p. 75) the true method of disputa­ <lb/>
            tion from the false.</p>
          <p>P. 77. Meno's first definition of virtue is, that it consists in <lb/>
            desiring good, and in being able to attain it. Socrates proves <lb/>
            that all men desire good, and consequently all men are so far <lb/>
            equally virtuous, which is an absurdity ; it must therefore consist <lb/>
            in the ability to attain it: which is true in Socrates's sense of the <lb/>
            word good, (which makes him say, <foreign xml:lang="grc">῎Ισως ἄν εὔ λέγοις</foreign>): but it is <lb/>
            necessary to know if men's ideas of it are the same. Upon inquiry, <lb/>
            Meno's meaning appears to be, health, honour, riches, power, &amp;c.; <lb/>
            but, being pressed by Socrates, he is forced to own, that the attain­ <lb/>
            ment of these is so far from virtue, that it is vice, unless accom­ <lb/>
            panied with temperance, with justice, and with piety ; as then the <lb/>
            virtue of such an attainment consists in such adjuncts, and not in <lb/>
            the thing attained; and as these are confessedly parts of virtue <lb/>
            only, subordinate to some more general idea, they are no nearer <lb/>
            discovering what virtue in the abstract is, than they were at first.</p>
          <p>Though the doctrine of reminiscence, repeated by Plato in several <lb/>
            places, be chimerical enough; yet this, which follows it, (p. 84,) <lb/>
            is worth attending to, where Socrates shows how useful it is to be <lb/>
            sensible of our own ignorance. While we know nothing, we doubt <lb/>
            of nothing; this is a state of great confidence and security. From <lb/>
            the first distrust we entertain of our own understanding springs an <lb/>
            uneasiness and a curiosity, which will not be satisfied till it attains <lb/>
            to knowledge.</p>
          <p>Whoever reads the dialogue, "On Virtue, whether it is to be <lb/>
            taught," attributed to Æschines the Socratic, will see so great a <lb/>
            resemblance to this of Plato, and at the same time find so great a <lb/>
            difference in several respects, that he will believe both one and the <lb/>
            other to be sketches of a real conversation, which passed between <lb/>
            Socrates and some other person, noted down both by Æschines <lb/>
            and by Plato at the time: the former left his notes in that un­ <lb/>
            finished condition, but the latter supplied them as he thought fit, <lb/>
            and worked them up at his leisure into this dialogue.</p>

            was the most celebrated in Greece; and when the cities of Thessaly <lb/>
            were united among themselves, they could raise a body of six thousand, <lb/>
            equal to any cavalry in the world. (Xenophon, Hellenic, vi. p. 339. <lb/>
            Pausan. x. p. 799. Plato in Hipp. Maj. p. 284.) They were of great <lb/>
            service to Alexander in his expeditions. The country was very rich <lb/>
            in pasture and in corn, and, as their government was generally remiss <lb/>
            and ill-regulated, their wealth naturally introduced a corruption (Athe­ <lb/>
             <pb n="443"/>
            naeus, xiv. p. 663) of manners, which made them first slaves themselves, <lb/>
            and then the instruments of slavery to other people. It was they who <lb/>
            invited the Persian (Herod. vii. and ix.) into Greece; and afterwards <lb/>
            gave rise to the power of the Macedonians. Isocrates (Orat. de Pace, p. <lb/>
            183) produces them as an example of a strong and wealthy people, <lb/>
            reduced by their own bad management to a low and distressed con­ <lb/>
            dition.</p>
          <p>P. 70. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αϱιστιππου του Λαϱισσαιου</foreign>.] Aristippus of Larissa, one of the <lb/>
            potent house of the Aleuadæ, descendants of Hercules, from which the <lb/>
            Thessalians had so often elected their <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ταγοί</foreign>, or captains-general. There <lb/>
            had been a friendship kept up between them and the royal family of <lb/>
            Persia, ever since the invasion of Greece by Xerxes, in which they were <lb/>
            of great use to him. This Aristippus had particular connexions with the <lb/>
            younger Cyrus, (Xenoph. Anab. i. 145, and ii. 173,) who lent him a <lb/>
            body of four thousand mercenaries, which he made use of to subdue the <lb/>
            faction which opposed him in Thessaly, and seems to have established a <lb/>
            sort of tyranny there. Meno (also of Larissa) son of Alexidemus, led a <lb/>
            body of fifteen hundred men to the assistance of Cyrus in his expedition <lb/>
            against his brother, Artaxerxes, 01. 94, 4, and (after the death of Cyrus) <lb/>
            betrayed the Greek commanders into the hands of the Persian, who cut <lb/>
            off their heads. He himself survived not above a year, but was destroyed <lb/>
            by the Persians. His character is admirably drawn by Xenophon, (Anab. <lb/>
            ii. p. 173,) and many have looked on this as a mark of the enmity be­ <lb/>
            tween Plato and Xenophon. See Athenæus, xi. p. 505 and 506 ; Diog. <lb/>

            should read <foreign xml:lang="grc">σωμάτων</foreign>, in lieu of <foreign xml:lang="grc">σχημάτων</foreign>,) is that there is from that <lb/>
            efflux, or those effluvia, of figured bodies, an efflux which is proportioned <lb/>
            to our sense of seeing. This is true, if understood of the particles of <lb/>
            light reflected from bodies; but not otherwise. Empedocles, however, <lb/>
            and after him Epicurus, in Diogen. Laert. x. 49, thought, that the im­ <lb/>
            mediate objects of vision were certain particles detached from the surface <lb/>

            all of that species have a wide mouth and prominent eyes, the face of <lb/>
            Socrates, who had these two remarkable features, reminds Meno of this <lb/>
            fish. Its figure and extraordinary property of benumbing any creature <lb/>
            which touches it are described by Mr. Reaumur, in the Memoires de <lb/>

          <p>P. 563. There is much good sense in this part of the dialogue: <lb/>
            he distinguishes the arts, which form and improve the body, into <lb/>
            the gymnastic, which regulates its motions and maintains its <lb/>
            proper habit, and the medical, which corrects its ill habits and <lb/>
            cures its distempers: those of the soul, which answer to the <lb/>
            former, are the legislative, which prescribes rules for its conduct <lb/>
            and preserves its uprightness, and the judicative, which amends <lb/>
            and redresses its deviation from those rules. Flattery, ever ap­ <lb/>
            plying herself to the passions of men, without regarding any <lb/>
            principle or proposing any rational end, has watched her oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity, and assuming the form of these several arts, has introduced <lb/>
            four counterfeits in their room, viz. 1. Cookery, which, while it <lb/>
            tickles the palate, pretends to maintain the body in health and <lb/>
            vigour; 2. Cosmetics, which conceal our defects and diseases <lb/>
            under a borrowed beauty; 3. Sophistry, which, by the false lights <lb/>
            it throws upon every thing, misleads our reason and palliates our <lb/>
            vices; and, 4. Rhetoric, which saves us from the chastisement we <lb/>
            deserve and eludes the salutary rigour of justice.</p>

            the wicked man is doing he knows not what, and sins only <lb/>
            through ignorance: and that the end of his actions, like that of <lb/>
            all other men, is good, but he mistakes the nature of it, and uses <lb/>
            wrong means to attain it.</p>

            dialogue plainly appears (from that passage in p. 473, "Last <lb/>
            year becoming by lot one of the council," which is taken no­ <lb/>
            tice of by Athenæus, in v. p. 217) to be 01. 93, 4, the year <lb/>
            after the sea-fight at Arginusæ, these words must be taken in a <lb/>
            larger sense, as we say of a thing long since past, " It happened <lb/>
            but the other day," when we would compare it with more ancient <lb/>
            times; for Archelaus had now reigned at least nine years, and <lb/>
            continued on the throne about six years longer. So in p. 503, <lb/>
            by the words, "Pericles recently dead," we must understand <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">νεωστὶ</foreign>, “recently," in the same manner, for Pericles had been dead <lb/>
            twenty-three years. But the time is there compared with that of <lb/>
            Cimon, Themistocles, and Miltiades, who died many years before. <lb/>
            Socrates indeed might have seen and remembered Cimon, the <lb/>
            other two he could not. These particulars of Archelaus's history <lb/>
            are curious and not to be met with elsewhere: viz. That he was <lb/>
            the bastard son of Perdiccas by a female slave belonging to his <lb/>
            brother Alcetas; that he caused his uncle and master Alcetas, <lb/>
            together with Alexander his son, to be murdered after a banquet, <lb/>
            to which he had invited them; that he caused his own brother, <lb/>
            a child of seven years old, (the true heir to the crown and the son <lb/>
            of Perdiccas by his wife Cleopatra,) to be drowned in a well. <lb/>
            Athenæus (in xi. p. 506) is absurd enough to question the truth <lb/>
            of these particulars, or, supposing them true, he says, that they <lb/>
            are instances of Plato's ingratitude, who was much in favour with <lb/>
            Archelaus. The passage, which he cites immediately after from <lb/>
            Carystius of Pergamus, disproves all this, for it shows Plato's <lb/>
            connexion to have been with Perdiccas the Third, who began to <lb/>
            reign thirty-five years after Archelaus's death, and was elder <lb/>
            brother to the famous Philip of Macedon. We have an epistle of <lb/>
            Plato to that prince still remaining. At the time of Archelaus's <lb/>
            death, Plato was under thirty years of age.</p>
          <p>P. 481. Demus, the son of Pyriiampes, was much in the <lb/>
            friendship of Pericles, and remarkable for being the first man <lb/>
            who brought peacocks to Athens, and bred them in his volaries. <lb/>
            (Plutarch in Pericle, and Athenæus, ix. p. 397.) Plato often <lb/>
            put much truth and good sense into the mouth of characters <lb/>
            which he did not approve. The Protagoras is a remarkable in­ <lb/>
            stance of this, where Socrates is introduced in the beginning, <lb/>
            arguing against the very doctrine, which naturally follows from <lb/>
            those principles, which he himself lays down in the end, and of <lb/>
            which he obliges the sophist to confess the truth.</p>
          <p>P. 488. First proof against Callicles, who had advanced that, <lb/>
            by the law of nature, the stronger had a right to govern the <lb/>
            weaker, that the many are stronger than the few, and conse­ <lb/>
            quently ought to govern them: so that the positive law of the <lb/>
            commonwealth is the result of the law of nature.</p>
          <p>P. 501. Cinesias, the son of Meles, was a dithyrambic poet <lb/>
             <pb n="446"/>
            in some sort of vogue among the people at this time. He was <lb/>
            still a worse man than a writer, and the depravity of his character <lb/>
            made even his misfortunes ridiculous; so that his poverty, his <lb/>
            deformities, and his distempers, were not only produced on the <lb/>
            stage, but frequently alluded to by the orators, and exposed to the <lb/>
            scorn of the multitude. The comic poet, StraWs, who lived at this <lb/>
            time, made Cinesias the subject of an entire drama.</p>
          <p>P. 503. The bold attack made in this place on some of the <lb/>
            greatest characters of antiquity, has drawn much censure on Plato; <lb/>
            but we are to consider that he is here proving his favourite point, <lb/>
            which seems to me the grand aim and intention of this dialogue, <lb/>
            that philosophy alone is the parent of virtue, the discoverer of <lb/>
            those fixed and unerring principles, on which the truly great and <lb/>
            good man builds his whole scheme of life, and by which he directs <lb/>
            all his actions; and that he, who practises this noblest art, and <lb/>
            makes it his whole endeavour to inspire his fellow-citizens with a <lb/>
            love for true knowledge, and this was the constant view and the <lb/>
            employment of Socrates, has infinitely the superiority not only over <lb/>
            the masters of those arts which the public most admires, as music, <lb/>
            poetry, and eloquence, but over the most celebrated names in <lb/>
            history, as heroes and statesmen; as the first have generally applied <lb/>
            their talents to flatter the ear, to humour the prejudices, and to in­ <lb/>
            flame the passions of mankind; and the latter, to soothe their <lb/>
            vanity, to irritate their ambition, and to cheat them with an ap­ <lb/>
            parent, not a real, greatness.</p>

          <p>P. 515. To giving pay.] The administration of Pericles <lb/>
            was the ruin of the Athenian constitution. By abridging the <lb/>
            power of the Areopagus, and by impairing their authority, who <lb/>
            were the superintendents of education and the censors of public <lb/>
            manners, he sapped the foundations of virtue among them; by <lb/>
            distributing the public revenue among the courts of justice, he <lb/>
            made them mercenary and avaricious, negligent of their private <lb/>
            affairs, and ever meddling in those of their neighbours; by the <lb/>
            frequency and magnificence of the public spectacles, he inured <lb/>
            them to luxury and to idleness; and by engaging them in the <lb/>
            Peloponnesian war, he exposed them to be deserted by all their <lb/>
            allies, and left to the mercy of the braver and more virtuous Lace­ <lb/>
            dæmonians. Isocrates, although he had no prejudice against Peri­ <lb/>
            cles, and does justice to his disinterestedness and honesty in the <lb/>
             <pb n="447"/>
            management of the public money, still he looked upon the first of <lb/>
            these alterations as the ruin of his country, in Orat. Areopag. p. <lb/>
            147, &amp;c.</p>
          <p>The <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μισθὸς Δικαστικὸς</foreign> “ the pay of the jurymen," here spoken of <lb/>
            by Socrates, was three oboli a day, paid to 6000 citizens, for so <lb/>
            many sat in the courts of justice, which was to the state a yearly <lb/>
            expense of one hundred and fifty talents; i. e. reckoning ten <lb/>
            months to the year, for two months were spent in holidays, when <lb/>
            the courts did not meet. A payment, appointed by Agyrrius about <lb/>
            01. 96, 4, was made by every Athenian citizen who came to the <lb/>
            assembly of the people. The ill effect which this had upon their <lb/>
            manners is painted by Aristophanes with much humour in several <lb/>
            of his dramas, and particularly in the Vespæ.</p>
          <p>P. 517. Neither the true nor the flattering.] This shows that <lb/>
            Plato meant only to distinguish between the use of eloquence <lb/>
            and its abuse ; nor is he in earnest when he says just above, that <lb/>
            we have not known a single good man, who has been good for <lb/>
            state affairs—for he afterwards himself names Aristides, as a man <lb/>
            of uncommon probity, but only to show that he had puzzled <lb/>
            Callicles, who could not produce one example of a statesman, who <lb/>
            had abilities, or art, sufficient to preserve him from the fury of the <lb/>
            people.</p>
          <p>Ib. Nor do I blame.] Hence it appears that he only means to <lb/>
            show how much superior the character of a real philosopher is to <lb/>
            that of a statesman.</p>

          <p>THIS dialogue takes its name, as also does the Hipparchus, not <lb/>
            from either of the persons introduced in it, but from the Cretan <lb/>
            Minos, whose character and laws are mentioned pretty much at <lb/>
            large. Socrates, and another Athenian nearly of the same age, <lb/>
            who is not named, are considering the nature of laws in it; and <lb/>
            the intention of Plato is to show, that there is a law of nature and <lb/>
            of truth, common to all men, to which all truly legal institutions <lb/>
            must be conformable, and which is the real foundation of them all.</p>

            was in use among the Carthaginians : the sacrifices of the Lycians and of <lb/>
            the descendants of Athamas, though people of Greek origin, were bar­ <lb/>
            barous ; the ancient Attic custom is mentioned of sacrificing victims near <lb/>
            the bodies of dead persons, before they were carried out to burial, and <lb/>
            hiring ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εγχυτϱιστϱιαὶ</foreign>, and the still more ancient one of interring them in <lb/>

          <p>P. 318. Lycurgus.] The time of this dialogue is no where marked; <lb/>
            but we see from p. 321, that Socrates was now advanced in years ; sup­ <lb/>
            posing him then to be only sixty, it is 367 years from the first Olym­ <lb/>
            piad of Corœbus; but most critics agree that Lycurgus lived one <lb/>
            hundred and eight years before that time, and Eratosthenes, with the <lb/>
            most accurate chronologers, affirms, that he was still more ancient. Plato <lb/>
            therefore places him half a century later than any one else has done. The <lb/>
            computation of Thucydides, who reckons it something more than 400 <lb/>
            years to the end of the Peloponnesian war, from the time of the institu­ <lb/>
            tion of Lycurgus's laws, comes nearest to that of Plato. For as the war <lb/>
            ended 01. 94, 1, Lycurgus settled the constitution about 27 years before <lb/>
            the first Olympiad of Corœbus.</p>

          <p>THE subject of this dialogue is 'H “Temperance; <lb/>
            and what was Plato's real opinion of that virtue, may be seen in <lb/>
            Rep. iv. p. 430, and Laws, iii. p. 696.</p>

          <p>P. 153. That a battle had taken place.] I take the par­ <lb/>
            ticular action here mentioned to be the attack made on the city, <lb/>
            soon after the arrival of Hagno and Cleopompus with fresh troops. <lb/>
            See Thucyd. ii. 58. If we consider the purport of the narration <lb/>
            there we shall find that Thucydides meant to say that Phormio <lb/>
            and his 1600 soldiers, among whom were Socrates and Alcibiades, <lb/>
            had returned from their expedition into Chalcidice, mentioned in <lb/>
            i. 65, and had joined the army newly arrived from Potidea.</p>
          <p>Ib. Critias.] It is extraordinary that Plato, from a partiality to <lb/>
            his own family, should so often introduce into his writings the <lb/>
            character of Critias, his cousin, whose very name, one should <lb/>
            imagine, must be held in detestation at Athens even to remotest <lb/>
             <pb n="449"/>
            times, he being a monster of injustice and cruelty. Plato seems <lb/>
            to have been not a little proud of his family. See Rep. ii. p. 368.</p>
          <p>P. 156. Zamolxis.] This person, said by some to have been <lb/>
            a slave of Pythagoras, but by Herodotus, in iv. 94, to have <lb/>
            been of much greater antiquity, was the king and prophet of the <lb/>
            Getes, who were at first only a clan of the Thracians, but after­ <lb/>
            wards, having passed the Danube, became a great and powerful <lb/>
            nation. It is very remarkable, that they had a succession of these <lb/>
            high priests, who lived sequestered from mankind in a grotto, and <lb/>
            had communication only with the king, in whose power they had <lb/>
            a great share from Zamolxis down to the time of Augustus, and <lb/>
            possibly long after. See Strabo vii. p. 297.</p>
          <p>P. 167. The third to the Saviour.] A proverbial expression <lb/>
            frequent with Plato, as in Philebus, p. 66, D., and in Epist. <lb/>
            vii. p. 340, A. I imagine it alludes to the Athenian custom <lb/>
            detailed by Athenæus from Philochorus in ii. p. 38, which was to <lb/>
            serve round after supper a little pure wine, with these words, <lb/>
            ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αγαθῳ̃</foreign> Aaipovi, " To the good Genius," and afterwards as much <lb/>
            wine and water as every one called for, with the form of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διἴ Σωτη̃ϱι</foreign>, <lb/>

          <p>As to the time of this dialogue, Athenæus, in v. p. 217, tells us, <lb/>
            that Agatho first gained the prize when Euphemus was Archon, <lb/>
            which was 01. 90, 4. What he adds, namely, that Plato was then <lb/>
            only fourteen years old, and consequently could not be at this en­ <lb/>
            tertainment, is very true, but nothing to the purpose ; for it is not <lb/>
            Plato who uses those words which he cites, but Apollodorus, who <lb/>
            recounts the particulars of this banquet, as he had them from <lb/>
            Aristodemus, who was present at it ten or twelve years before.</p>
          <p>Among the ancients, Cicero, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Her­ <lb/>
            mogenes, Athenæus, Gellius, and Ausonius, and among the <lb/>
            moderns, Jos. Scaliger, Petavius, Ger. Vossius, Fraguier, Freret, <lb/>
            and La Mothe le Vayer, believed the Cyropædia of Xenophon to <lb/>

            The folly of Athenæus, in v. c. 15, who would prove, against the <lb/>
            authority of Plato and of Antisthenes, that Socrates was not in any <lb/>
            of these actions, is justly exposed by Casaubon. We may add, <lb/>
            that if the silence of Thucydides could prove any thing with re­ <lb/>
            gard to Socrates, it would prove, at least as strongly, that Al­ <lb/>
            cibiades was not at Potidæa neither; but the contrary is certain <lb/>
            from that very oration of Isocrates, to which Athenæus refers, <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πεϱὶ</foreign> Z<foreign xml:lang="grc">εύγους</foreign>, p. 352, where he is said to have gained the ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αϱιστε</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">α</foreign>, <lb/>
            namely, a crown and a complete suit of armour, before that city; <lb/>
            and if the orator had not totally suppressed the name of Socrates, <lb/>
            it would have been highly injudicious in a discourse pronounced <lb/>
            by the son of Alcibiades, where he was to exalt the character of <lb/>
            his father, and by no means to lessen the merit of any of his <lb/>
            actions. He left that to his enemies, who, it is likely, did not for­ <lb/>
            get the generosity of Socrates on this occasion. It is clear from <lb/>
            the many oversights of Athenæus here, that he either trusted to <lb/>
            his memory, or only quoted from his own extracts, and not from <lb/>
            the originals. Plato mentions no second ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αϱιστε</foreign>ī<foreign xml:lang="grc">α</foreign> gained at Delium, <lb/>
            and only speaks of the coolness and presence of mind shown by <lb/>
            Socrates in his retreat; as he has done also in the Laches. <lb/>
            Athenæus affirms, that Alcibiades was not in the battle of Delium, <lb/>
            but he assigns no reasons. If he concludes it from the silence of <lb/>
            Thucydides, as before, this is nothing; since that historian men­ <lb/>
            tions none but the commanders-in-chief on any of these occasions, <lb/>
            and often only one or two of the principal of these: but probably <lb/>
            Alcibiades and Laches might then only serve as private men. <lb/>
            This dialogue, particularly the end of it, the Protagoras, the <lb/>
            Gorgias, the Euthydemus, &amp;c., are strong instances of Plato's <lb/>
            genius for dramatic poetry in the comic kind, noticed by Athenæus, <lb/>
            in v. p. 187. See also Olympiodor. in the Life of Plato. The <lb/>

          <p>THERE is a good deal of humour, and even of the " vis comica," <lb/>
            in this dialogue. Its end is to expose the vanity and weakness <lb/>
            of two famous sophists, and to show, by way of contrast, the art <lb/>
            of Socrates in leading youth into the paths of virtue and of right <lb/>
            reason.</p>
          <p>P. 287. Are you so Saturn-like,] i. e. "simple and old­ <lb/>
            fashioned." It is scarcely possible to see with patience Plato <lb/>
            seriously confuting these childish subtleties, as low as any logical <lb/>
            quibbles, used by our scholastic divines in the days of monkery <lb/>
            and of deep ignorance. But he best knew the manners of his own <lb/>
            age, and doubtless saw these things in a graver light than they of <lb/>
            themselves deserve, by reflecting on the bad effects which they had <lb/>
            on the understandings and on the morals of his countrymen, who <lb/>
            not onlv spent their wit and their time in playing with words, <note type="footnote"> 2 G 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="452"/>
            when they might have employed them in inquiring into things; <lb/>
            but, by rendering every principle doubtful and dark alike, must <lb/>
            necessarily induce men to leave themselves to the guidance of <lb/>
            chance and of the passions, unassisted by reason. Whereas if, in <lb/>
            reality, there be no certain truth attainable by human knowledge, <lb/>
            both the means and the end of disputation are absolutely taken <lb/>
            away, and it becomes the most absurd and the most childish of all <lb/>
            occupations.</p>

          <p>WE learn from this dialogue in how poor a condition the art of <lb/>
            reasoning on moral and abstracted subjects was, before the time of <lb/>
            Socrates ; for it is impossible that Plato should introduce a sophist <lb/>
            of the first reputation for eloquence and knowledge in several <lb/>
            kinds, talking in a manner below the absurdity and weakness of a <lb/>
            child, unless he had really drawn after the life. No less than <lb/>
            twenty-four pages are here spent in vain, only to force it into the <lb/>
            head of Hippias, that there is such a thing as a general idea; and <lb/>
            that, before we can dispute on any subject, we should give a de­ <lb/>
            finition of it.</p>
          <p>The time of the conversation seems to be after 01. 89, 2, for the <lb/>
            war had permitted no intercourse between Athens and Elis before <lb/>
            that year, and we see in the Protagoras that Hippias was actually <lb/>
            at Athens 01. 90, 1, so that it seems to fall naturally between these <lb/>
            two years.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>THE time of this dialogue is after the Hippias Major, with which <lb/>
            it may be ranked.</p>
          <p>P. 368. Hippias appeared at Olympia in a dress of his own <lb/>
            weaving, buskins of his own cutting out and sewing, with a ring <lb/>
            on his finger, and a seal engraved by himself, and a beautiful zone <lb/>
            of his own embroidery. He brought with him epic poems, <lb/>
            dithyrambics, tragedies, and orations, all of his own composi­ <lb/>

            <title type="sub">OBSERVATIONS ON THE DATE OF THIS DIALOGUE.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>PLATO, in this dialogue, one of the noblest he ever wrote, has <lb/>
            fallen, through negligence, into some anachronisms, as Athenæus <lb/>
            has remarked, (in v. p. 218,) though some things in reality are <lb/>
            only mistakes of his own, and others he has omitted, which are <lb/>
            real faults. Dacier undertakes wholly to justify Plato. We shall <lb/>
            show that neither of them are quite in the right.</p>
          <p>There are two marks, which fix the time of this conversation, as <lb/>
            it is generally thought, and as Athenæus has shown. One, that <lb/>
            Callias is mentioned in p. 315, as then master of himself, and <lb/>
            in possession of the estate of his father, Hipponicus, who was slain <lb/>
            in the battle of Delium, 01. 89, I, so that it must be after that <lb/>
            year; the other, that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">῎Αγϱιοι</foreign>, "The Savages," a comedy of <lb/>
            Pherecrates, alluded to, is said to have been played the year be­ <lb/>
            fore. Now that play was brought upon the stage in the magis­ <lb/>
            tracy of Aristion, 01. 89,4; consequently this must have happened <lb/>
            01. 90, 1.</p><pb n="454"/>
            
          <p>There is yet a third circumstance which may ascertain the date <lb/>
            of the dialogue. Athenaeus produces it as an instance of Plato's <lb/>
            negligence; but he has only discovered his own by it. Hippias <lb/>
            the Elean, he says, and others of his countrymen are introduced, <lb/>
            in p. 315, as then present at Athens, whereas it is impossible <lb/>
            ■ they could be there during the Peloponnesian war, while the <lb/>
            Eleans were confederates with Sparta against the Athenians; for <lb/>
            though a truce was agreed upon for one year, under Isarchus, 01. <lb/>
            89, 1, yet it was broken through presently, and no cessation of arms <lb/>
            ensued. But in reality Hippias might be at Athens any year after <lb/>
            Isarchus's magistracy; since though the war broke out afresh <lb/>
            afterwards with Sparta, yet the allies of Sparta entered not into <lb/>
            it, as at first, but either continued neuter, or joined the Athenians, <lb/>
            and Elis particularly entered into a defensive league with them <lb/>
            this very year, as shown by Thucyd. v. 47; so that when Athe­ <lb/>
            næus speaks of the truce as not remaining, it is plain that he did <lb/>
            not know but that Sparta entered the war again with all the con­ <lb/>
            federates which she had at first, and consequently he had read <lb/>
            Thucydides very negligently. This very thing then may fix it to <lb/>
            01. 90, 1, at least it will prove that it could not be earlier than 01. <lb/>
            89, 1.</p>
          <p>Athenæus further remarks, that Eupolis in his <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κόλακες</foreign>, " The <lb/>
            Flatterers," which was played 01. 89, 3, speaks of Protagoras as <lb/>
            then present at Athens, and that Ameipsias in his Kó<foreign xml:lang="grc">ννος</foreign>, " Con­ <lb/>
            nus," acted two years before, has not introduced him into his <lb/>
            chorus of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φϱοντισταί</foreign>, " The Men of Thought;" so that it is pro­ <lb/>
            bable that he arrived at Athens in the interval between the repre­ <lb/>
            sentation of these two dramas, which is three or four years earlier <lb/>
            than the dialogue, in which Plato nevertheless says that he had <lb/>
            not been three days come; and that after many years' absence. <lb/>
            Dacier attempts to answer this, but makes little of it; and indeed <lb/>
            it was impossible to do better, since both the comedies are lost, <lb/>
            and we do not know to what parts of them Athenæus alludes, as <lb/>
            he cites nothing.</p>
          <p>But in truth there are other circumstances inconsistent with <lb/>
            the date of the dialogue, of which neither Athenæus nor Dacier <lb/>
            have taken any notice. 1st, Alcibiades is represented as just on <lb/>
            the confines of youth and manhood, whereas in 01. 90, 1, he was <lb/>
            turned of thirty. 2ndly, Criso of Himera, celebrated for gaining <lb/>
            three victories successively in the course at Olympia, the first <lb/>
            of which was 01. 83, is spoken of in p. 335, as in the height of <lb/>
            his vigour. Now it is scarcely possible, that one, who was a man <lb/>
            grown at the time I have mentioned, should continue in full <lb/>
            strength and agility twenty-nine years afterwards: but this I do <lb/>
            not much insist upon. 3rdly, Pericles is spoken of in p. 320, <lb/>
            as yet living, although he died nine years before; and what is <lb/>
            worse, his two sons, Xanthippus and Paralus, are both represented <lb/>
             <pb n="455"/>
            as present at this conversation, though they certainly died during <lb/>
            the plague some time before their father.</p>

            <title type="sub">ANALYSIS OF THE DIALOGUE.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Socrates is wakened before day-dreak with a hasty knocking at <lb/>
            his door: it is Hippocrates, a young man, who comes eagerly to <lb/>
            acquaint him with the arrival of Protagoras, the celebrated sophist, <lb/>
            at Athens, and to entreat him to go immediately and present him to <lb/>
            that great man; for he is determined to spare no pains nor ex­ <lb/>
            pense, so he may be but admitted to his conversation. Socrates <lb/>
            moderates his impatience a little, and while they take a turn <lb/>
            about the hall together, waiting for sun-rise, inquires into his <lb/>
            notions of a sophist, and what he expected from him ; and finding <lb/>
            his ideas not very clear upon that head, shows him the folly of <lb/>
            putting his soul into the hands of he knew not whom, to do with <lb/>
            it he knew not what. If his body had been indisposed, and he <lb/>
            had needed a physician, he would certainly have taken the advice <lb/>
            and recommendation of his family and friends; but here, where <lb/>
            his mind, a thing of much greater importance, was concerned, he <lb/>
            was on the point of trusting it, unadvisedly and at random, to the <lb/>
            care of a person, whom he had never seen nor spoken to. That a <lb/>
            sophist was a kind of merchant, or rather a retailer of food for the <lb/>
            soul, and, like other shop-keepers, would exert his eloquence to <lb/>
            recommend his own goods. The misfortune was, we could not <lb/>
            carry them off, like corporeal viands, set them by a while, and <lb/>
            consider them at leisure, whether they were wholesome or not, <lb/>
            before we tasted them; that in this case we have no vessel, but <lb/>
            the soul, to receive them in, which will necessarily retain a <lb/>
            tincture, and perhaps much to its prejudice, of all which is in­ <lb/>
            stilled into it. However, by way of trial only, they agree to wait <lb/>
            upon Protagoras, and accordingly they go to the house of Callias, <lb/>
            where both he and two other principal sophists, Prodicus and <lb/>
            Hippias, with all their train of followers, were lodged and enter­ <lb/>
            tained.</p>
          <p>The porter, an eunuch, wearied and pestered with the crowd of <lb/>
            sophists who resorted to the house, mistaking them for such, <lb/>
            gives them a short answer, and shuts the door in their face. At <lb/>
            last they are admitted, and find Protagoras with Callias, and more <lb/>
            company, walking in the porticos. The motions of Protagoras's <lb/>
            followers are described with much humour; how at every turn <lb/>
            they divided and cast off, as in a dance, still falling in, and mov­ <lb/>
            ing in due subordination behind the principal performer. Hippias <lb/>
            is sitting in a great chair, on the opposite side of the court, dis­ <lb/>
            coursing on points of natural philosophy to a circle, who are <lb/>
            seated on forms round him; while Prodicus, in a large inner <lb/>
             <pb n="456"/>
            apartment, in bed and wrapped up in abundance of warm clothes, <lb/>
            lies discoursing with another company of admirers. Socrates <lb/>
            approaches Protagoras, and presents the young Hippocrates to <lb/>
            him. The sophist, having premised something to give an idea of <lb/>
            his own profession, its use and dignity, the rest of the company, <lb/>
            being summoned together from all quarters, seat themselves about <lb/>
            him; and Socrates begins by entreating Protagoras to inform him, <lb/>
            what was the tendency and usual effect of his lessons, that <lb/>
            Hippocrates might know what he was to expect from him. His <lb/>
            answers show, that he professed to accomplish men for public and <lb/>
            private life, to make them good and useful members of the state, <lb/>
            and of a family. Socrates admires the beauty of his art, if indeed <lb/>
            there be such an art, which, he confesses, he has often doubted; <lb/>
            for if virtue is a thing which may be taught, what can his country­ <lb/>
            men the Athenians mean, who in their public assemblies, if the <lb/>
            question turn on repairing the public edifices, consult the architect, <lb/>
            and if on their fleet, the ship-builder, and laughed at such as, on <lb/>
            pretence of their wit, of their wealth, or of their nobility, should <lb/>
            interfere in debates which concern a kind of knowledge, in which <lb/>
            they have neither skill nor experience; but if the point to be con­ <lb/>
            sidered relate to the laws, to the magistracy, to the administration <lb/>
            of peace and war, and to such subjects, every merchant, every <lb/>
            little tradesman and mechanic, the poor as well as the rich, the <lb/>
            mean as well as the noble, deliver their opinion with confidence, <lb/>
            and are heard with attention. Besides, those greatest statesmen, <lb/>
            who have been esteemed the brightest examples of political virtue, <lb/>
            though they have given their children every accomplishment of <lb/>
            the body which education could bestow, do not at all appear to <lb/>
            have improved their minds with those qualities for which they <lb/>
            themselves were so eminent, and in which consequently they were <lb/>
            best able to instruct them, if instruction could convey these virtues <lb/>
            to the soul at all.</p>
          <p>Protagoras answers by reciting a fable delivered in very beauti­ <lb/>
            ful language. The substance of it is this. Prometheus and <lb/>
            Epimetheus, when the gods had formed all kinds of animals with­ <lb/>
            in the bowels of the earth, and the destined day approached for <lb/>
            producing them into light, were commissioned to distribute among <lb/>
            them the powers and qualifications which were allotted to them. <lb/>
            The younger brother prevailed upon the elder to let him perform <lb/>
            this work; and Prometheus consented to review afterwards and cor­ <lb/>
            rect his disposition of things. Epimetheus then began, and directed <lb/>
            his care to the preservation of the several species, that none might <lb/>
            ever be totally lost. To some he gave extreme swiftness, but <lb/>
            they were deficient in strength; and the strong he made not <lb/>
            equally swift: the little found their security in the lightness of <lb/>
            their bodies, in their airy wings, and in their subterraneous re­ <lb/>
            treats ; while those of vast magnitude had the superiority of their <lb/>
             <pb n="457"/>
            bulk for a defence. Such as were formed to prey on others, he <lb/>
            made to produce but few young ones; while those, who were to <lb/>
            serve as their prey, brought forth a numerous progeny. He <lb/>
            armed them against the seasons with hoofs of horn and callous <lb/>
            feet, with hides of proof and soft warm furs, their native bed and <lb/>
            clothing all in one. But when Prometheus came to review his <lb/>
            brother's work, he found that he had lavished all his art and all <lb/>
            his materials upon the brute creation, while mankind, whose turn <lb/>
            it was next to be produced to light, was left a naked, helpless <lb/>
            animal, exposed to the rigour of the seasons and to the violence of <lb/>
            every other creature round him. In compassion therefore to his <lb/>
            wants, Prometheus purloined the arts of Pallas and of Vulcan, <lb/>
            and with them fire, without which they were impracticable and <lb/>
            useless, and bestowed them on this new race, to compensate <lb/>
            their natural defects. Men then, as allied to the divinity and <lb/>
            endowed with reason, were the only part of the creation which <lb/>
            acknowledged the being and the providence of the gods. They <lb/>
            began to erect altars and statues ; they formed articulate sounds, <lb/>
            and invented language; they built habitations, covered themselves <lb/>
            with clothing, and cultivated the ground. But still they were <lb/>
            lonely creatures, scattered here and there; for Prometheus did not <lb/>
            dare to enter the citadel of Jove, where Policy, the mother and <lb/>
            queen of social life, was kept near the throne of the god himself; <lb/>
            otherwise he would have bestowed her too on his favourite man­ <lb/>
            kind. The arts which they possessed, just supported them, but <lb/>
            could not defend them against the multitude and fierceness of the <lb/>
            wild beasts : they tried to assemble and live together, but soon found <lb/>
            that they were more dangerous and mischievous to one another <lb/>
            than the savage creatures had been. In pity then to their con­ <lb/>
            dition, Jove, lest the whole race should perish, sent Mercury to <lb/>
            earth, with Shame and Justice; and when he doubted how he <lb/>
            should bestow them, and whether they should be distributed, as <lb/>
            the arts had been, this to one, and that to another, or equally <lb/>
            divided among the whole kind; Jove approved of the latter, and <lb/>
            he commanded that if any did not receive his share of that bounty <lb/>
            he should be extirpated from the face of the earth, as the pest <lb/>
            and destruction of his fellow-creatures.</p>
          <p>This then, continues Protagoras, is the reason, why the Atheni­ <lb/>
            ans, and other nations, in debates, which turn on the several arts, <lb/>
            attend only to the advice of the skilful; but give ear in matters of <lb/>
            government, which are founded on ideas of common justice and <lb/>
            probity, to every citizen indifferently among them : and that this <lb/>
            is the common opinion of all men, may hence appear. If a person <lb/>
            totally ignorant of music should fancy himself an admirable per­ <lb/>
            former, the world would either laugh or be angry, and his friends <lb/>
            would reprimand or treat him as a madman : but if a man should <lb/>
            have candour and plain-dealing enough to profess himself a vil­ <lb/>
             <pb n="458"/>
            lain and ignorant of common justice, what in the other case would <lb/>
            have been counted modesty, the simple confession of truth and of <lb/>
            his own ignorance, would here be called impudence and madness. <lb/>
            He that will not dissemble here, will be by all regarded as an <lb/>
            idiot; for to own that one knows not what justice is, is to own <lb/>
            that one ought not to live among mankind.</p>
          <p>He proceeds to show, that no one thought our idea of justice to <lb/>
            be the gift of nature; but that it is acquired by instruction and by <lb/>
            experience: for with the weak, the deformed, or the blind man, <lb/>
            no one is angry; no reprimands, no punishments attend the un­ <lb/>
            fortunate, nor are employed to correct our natural defects; but <lb/>
            they are the proper consequences of our voluntary neglects or <lb/>
            offences. Nor is the punishment, which follows even these, in­ <lb/>
            tended to redress an evil already past, for that is impossible, but <lb/>
            to prevent a future, or at least to deter others from like offences; <lb/>
            which proves, that wickedness is by all regarded as a voluntary <lb/>
            ignorance.</p>
          <p>Next he shows, how this knowledge is acquired. It is by educa­ <lb/>
            tion. Every one is interested in teaching another the proper vir­ <lb/>
            tue of a man, on which alone all his other acquisitions must be <lb/>
            founded, and without which he cannot exist among his fellow- <lb/>
            creatures. His parents, as soon as understanding begins to dawn <lb/>
            in him, are employed in prescribing what he ought to do and what <lb/>
            he ought not to do ; his masters, in filling his mind with the pre­ <lb/>
            cepts, and forming it to the example, of the greatest men, or in <lb/>
            fashioning his body to perform with ease and patience whatever <lb/>
            his reason commands ; and lastly, the laws of the state lay down a <lb/>
            rule, by which he is necessitated to direct his actions. If then the <lb/>
            sons of the greatest men do not appear to be greater proficients in <lb/>
            virtue than the ordinary sort, it must not be ascribed to the parent's <lb/>
            neglect; much less must it be concluded, that virtue is not to be <lb/>
            acquired by instruction : it is the fault perhaps of genius and of <lb/>
            nature. Let us suppose, that to perform on a certain instrument <lb/>
            were a qualification required in every man, and necessary to the <lb/>
            existence of a city, ought we to wonder, that the son of an ad­ <lb/>
            mirable performer fell infinitely short of his father in skill ? Should <lb/>
            we attribute this to want of care, or say, that music were not at­ <lb/>
            tainable by any art ? or should we not rather ascribe it to defect of <lb/>
            genius and to natural inability ? Yet every member of such a <lb/>
            state would doubtless far surpass all persons rude and unpractised <lb/>
            in music. In like manner, the most worthless member of a <lb/>
            society, civilized by some sort of education and brought up under <lb/>
            the influence of laws and of policy, will be an amiable man, if <lb/>
            compared with a wild and uncultivated savage.</p>
          <p>It is hard indeed to say, who is our particular instructor in the <lb/>
            social virtues; as, for the same reason, it is hard to say, who <lb/>
            taught us our native tongue: yet no one will therefore deny that <lb/>
             <pb n="459"/>
            we learned it. The public is in these cases our master; and all <lb/>
            the world has a share in our instruction. Suffice it, continues the <lb/>
            sophist, to know, that some there are among us, elevated a little <lb/>
            above the ordinary sort, in the art of leading mankind to honour <lb/>
            and to virtue; and among these I have the advantage to be dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished.</p>
          <p>Socrates continues astonished for a time and speechless, as <lb/>
            though dazzled with the beauty of Protagoras's discourse. At <lb/>
            last, recovering himself, he ventures to propound a little doubt <lb/>
            which has arisen in his mind, though perfectly satisfied, he says, <lb/>
            with the main question, whether temperance, fortitude, justice, and <lb/>
            the rest, which Protagoras has so often mentioned, and seemed to <lb/>
            comprehend under the general name of virtue, are different things, <lb/>
            and can subsist separately in the same person; or whether they <lb/>
            are all the same quality of mind, only exerted on different occa­ <lb/>
            sions. Protagoras readily agrees to the first of these; but is in­ <lb/>
            sensibly betrayed by Socrates into the toils of his logic, and makes <lb/>
            such concessions, that he finds himself forced to conclude the <lb/>
            direct contrary of what he had first advanced. He is sensible of <lb/>
            his disgrace, and tries to evade this closer kind of reasoning by <lb/>
            taking refuge in that more diffuse eloquence, which used to gain <lb/>
            him such applause. But when he finds himself cut short by So­ <lb/>
            crates, who pleads the weakness of his own memory, unable to <lb/>
            attend to long-continued discourses, and who entreats him to bring <lb/>
            down the greatness of his talents to the level of a mind so much <lb/>
            inferior, he is forced to pick a frivolous quarrel with Socrates, and <lb/>
            break off the conversation in the middle. Here Callias interposes, <lb/>
            and Alcibiades, in his insolent way, by supporting the request of <lb/>
            Socrates and by piquing the vanity of Protagoras, obliges him to <lb/>
            accommodate himself to the interrogatory method of disputation, <lb/>
            and renews the dialogue.'</p>
          <p>To save the dignity of Protagoras, and to put him in humour <lb/>
            again, Socrates proposes that he shall conduct the debate, and <lb/>
            state the questions, while he himself will only answer them; pro­ <lb/>
            vided Protagoras will in his turn afterwards condescend to do the <lb/>
            same for him. The sophist begins by proposing a famous ode of <lb/>
            Simonides, which seems to carry in it an absolute contradiction, <lb/>
            which he desires Socrates to reconcile. Socrates appears at first <lb/>
            puzzled, and after he has played awhile with Protagoras and with <lb/>
            the other sophists, that he may have time to recollect himself, he <lb/>
            gives an explanation of that poem, and of its pretended inconsist­ <lb/>
            ency, in a manner so new and so just as to gain the applause of <note type="footnote"> 1 The episodical characters of Prodicus and Hippias, introduced as medi­ <lb/>
            ating a reconciliation, are great ornaments to the dialogue; the affectation of <lb/>
            eloquence and of an accurate choice of words in the former, and the stately <lb/>
            figurative diction of the latter, being undoubtedly drawn from the life. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="460"/>
            the whole company. He then brings back Protagoras, in spite of <lb/>
            his reluctance, to his former subject, but without taking advan­ <lb/>
            tage of his former concessions, and desires again his opinion on the <lb/>
            unity, or on the similitude, of the virtues. Protagoras now owns, <lb/>
            that there is a near' affinity between them all, except valour, which <lb/>
            he affirms that a man may possess, who is entirely destitute of all <lb/>
            the rest. Socrates proves to him, that this virtue also, like the <lb/>
            others, is founded on knowledge and is reducible to it; that it is <lb/>
            but to know what is really to be feared, and what is not; that <lb/>
            good and evil, or in other words, pleasure and pain,2 being the great <lb/>
            and the only movers of the human mind, no one can reject plea­ <lb/>
            sure, but where it seems productive of a superior degree of pain, <lb/>
            or prefer pain, unless the consequence of it be a superior pleasure. <lb/>
            That to balance these one against the other with accuracy, to judge <lb/>
            rightly of them at a distance, to calculate the overplus of each, is <lb/>
            that science on which our happiness depends, and which is the <lb/>
            basis of every virtue. That, if our whole life's welfare and the <lb/>
            interests of it were as closely connected with the judgment, which <lb/>
            we should make on the real magnitude of objects and on their true <lb/>
            figure, or with our not being deceived by the appearance which <lb/>
            they exhibit at a distance, who doubts but that geometry and <lb/>
            optics would then be the means of happiness to us, and would <lb/>
            become the rule of virtue ? That there is a kind of knowledge no <lb/>
            less necessary to us in our present state, and no less a science; <lb/>
            and that, when we pretend to be misled by our passions, we ought <lb/>
            to blame our ignorance, which is the true source of all our follies <lb/>
            and vices. And now, continues Socrates, who would not laugh at <lb/>
            our inconsistency ? You set out with affirming that virtue might <lb/>
            be taught, yet in the course of our debate you have treated it as a <lb/>
            thing entirely distinct from knowledge, and not reducible to it: <lb/>
            I, who advanced the contrary position, have shown that it is a <lb/>
            science, and consequently that it may be learned.</p>
          <p>Protagoras, who has had no other share in the dispute than to <lb/>
            make, without perceiving the consequence, such concessions as <lb/>
            absolutely destroy what he set out with affirming, tries to support <lb/>
            the dignity of his own age and reputation, by making an arrogant <lb/>
            compliment to Socrates, commending his parts, very considerable, <lb/>
            he says, and very promising for so young a man, and doing him <note type="footnote"> 1 See Gorgias, p. 507. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Plato reasons on the principles of the most rational Epicurean in this <lb/>
            place, and indeed on the only principles which can be defended. As our <lb/>

          <p>P. 320. At liberty.] Every divinity had some such animals, which fed <lb/>
            at liberty within the sacred enclosures and pastures. Such were the <lb/>
            oxen of the Sun, in Homer, Od. M.; the owls of Minerva in the Acro­ <lb/>
            polis at Athens, (Aristoph. Lysist.,) the peacocks of Juno at Samos, <lb/>
            (Athenæus, xiv. p. 655,) the tame serpents of Æsculapius, at Epidaurus, <lb/>
            (Pausan. ii. 28, and at Athens, Aristoph. Pluto 733,) the fishes of the <lb/>
            Syrian goddess, &amp;c. (Xenoph. Anabas. i. p. 254.)</p>
          <p>P. 328. Worthy of the money I make.] It is remarkable in what <lb/>
            general esteem and admiration Protagoras was held throughout all <lb/>
            Greece. If any scholar of his thought the price he exacted was too high, <lb/>
            he only obliged him to say upon his oath, what he thought the precepts he <lb/>
            had given were worth, and Protagoras was satisfied with that sum. Yet <lb/>
            he got more wealth by his profession than Phidias the statuary, and any <lb/>
            other ten the most celebrated artists of Greece, as we learn from Meno, p. <lb/>
            91, and Hipp. Maj. p. 282. Quintilian says, in iii. 1, that Euathlus gave <lb/>
            him 10,000 drachmæ (about £300 sterling) for his art of rhetoric in <lb/>
            writing. He was the first sophist in Greece who professed himself a <lb/>
            teacher of education and virtue, and such an one as could make men <lb/>
            better and better every time he conversed with them. See p. 318, <lb/>
            and 349.</p>
          <p>P. 357. The want of instruction.] The true key and great moral of the <lb/>
            dialogue is, that knowledge alone is the source of virtue, and ignorance the <lb/>
            source of vice. It was Plato's own principle, as shown in Epist. vii. p. <lb/>
            336, and elsewhere. The consequence of it is, that virtue may be taught, <lb/>
            and may be acquired; and that philosophy alone can point us out the <lb/>
            way to it.</p><pb n="462"/>

          <p>As Serranus, and, I think, every commentator after him, has read <lb/>
            this dialogue with a grave countenance, and understood it in a <lb/>
            literal sense, though it is throughout a very apparent and continued <lb/>
            irony; it is no wonder if such persons, as trust to their accounts <lb/>
            of it, find it a very silly and frivolous thing. Yet under that irony, <lb/>
            doubtless, there is concealed a serious meaning, which makes a <lb/>
            part of Plato's great design, a design which runs through all his <lb/>
            writings. He was persuaded that virtue must be built on know­ <lb/>
            ledge, not on that counterfeit knowledge, which dwells only on <lb/>
            the surface of things, and is guided by the imagination rather than <lb/>
            by the judgment, (for this was the peculiar foible of his country­ <lb/>
            men, a light and desultory people, easily seduced by their fancy <lb/>
            wherever it led them,) but on the knowledge which is fixed and <lb/>
            settled on certain great and general truths, and on principles as <lb/>
            ancient and as unshaken as nature itself, or rather as the author <lb/>
            of nature. To this knowledge, and consequently to virtue, he <lb/>
            thought that philosophy was our only guide : and as to all those <lb/>
            arts, which are usually made merely subservient to the passions of <lb/>
            mankind, as politics, eloquence, and poetry, he thought that they <lb/>
            were no otherwise to be esteemed than as they are grounded on <lb/>
            philosophy, and are directed to the ends of virtue. They, who <lb/>
            had best succeeded in them before his time, owed, as he thought, <lb/>
            their success rather to a lucky hit, to some gleam of truth, as it <lb/>
            were providentially breaking in upon their minds, than to those <lb/>
            fixed and unerring principles which are not to be erased from a <lb/>
            soul, which has once been thoroughly convinced of them. Their <lb/>
            conduct therefore in their actions, and in their productions, has <lb/>
            been wavering between good and evil, and unable to reach per­ <lb/>
            fection. The inferior tribe have caught something of their fire, <lb/>
            merely by imitation, and form their judgments, not from any real <lb/>
            skill they have in these arts, but merely from (what La Bruyere <lb/>
            calls) a gout de comparaison. The general applause of men has <lb/>
            pointed out to them what is finest; and to that, as to a principle, <lb/>
            they refer their taste, without knowing or inquiring in what its <lb/>
            excellence consists. Each Muse (says Plato in this dialogue) in­ <lb/>
            spires and holds suspended her favourite poet in immediate con­ <lb/>
            tact, as the magnet does a link of iron, and from him, through <lb/>
            whom the attractive virtue passes and is continued to the rest, <lb/>
            hangs a long chain of actors, and singers, and critics, and inter­ <lb/>
            preters of interpreters.</p><pb n="463"/>

          <p>P. 533. Dædalus was the son of Palamaon, of that branch of the royal <lb/>
            family called Metionidæ, being sprung from Metion, the son of Erectheus. <lb/>
            (See Pausan. vii. p. 531, and i. p. 13:) There were statues of his work­ <lb/>
            manship still preserved in several cities of Greece, at Thebes, Lebadea, <lb/>
            Delos, Olus, and Gnossus, even in the time of Pausanias, above six hun­ <lb/>
            dred years after this. See Pausan. ix. p. 793, and Plato, Hippias Maj. p. <lb/>
            282. Epeus, the son of Panopeus, was the inventor of the Trojan horse ; <lb/>
            in the temple of the Lycian Apollo at Argos, was preserved a wooden <lb/>
            figure of Mercury made by him. Theodorus, the Samian, son of Te­ <lb/>
            lecles, first discovered the method of casting iron, and of forming it into <lb/>
            figures: he also (with his countryman Rhæcus the son of Philæus) was <lb/>
            the first who cast statues in bronze; he worked likewise in gold, and <lb/>
            graved precious stones.</p>
          <p>P. 533. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ὄλυμπου</foreign>.] Olympus, the Phrygian, lived in the time of Midas, <lb/>
            before the Trojan war, yet his compositions, as well the music as the <lb/>
            verses, were extant even in Plutarch's days. Aristotel. Politic, viii. c. 5, <lb/>
            and Plato, Sympos. p. 215. Hence also it seems that they had the music of <lb/>
            Orpheus, of Thamyris, and of Phemius, then in being. (See Horn. <lb/>
            Odyss. A. 325, and X. 330.)</p>
          <p>P. 533. The Magnesian.] Euripides gave it this name, probably from <lb/>
            the city of Magnesia near the hill of Sipylus, where it was found. Mr. <lb/>
            Chishull tells us, that as they were ascending the castle-hill of this city, a <lb/>
            compass, which they carried with them, pointed to different quarters, as <lb/>
            it happened to be placed on different stones, and that at last it entirely <lb/>
            lost its virtue; which shows that hill to be a mine of loadstone. Its <lb/>
            power of attracting iron and of communicating its virtue to that iron, we <lb/>
            see, was a thing well known at that time, yet they suspected nothing of <lb/>
            its polar qualities.</p>
          <p>P. 534. <foreign xml:lang="grc">῾Υπορχήματα</foreign>.] Pindar was famous for this kind of compo­ <lb/>
            sitions, though we have lost them, as well as his dithyrambics. Xeno­ <lb/>
            demus also, Bacchylides, and Pratinas the Phliasian, excelled in them. <lb/>
            Athenæus has preserved a fine fragment of this last poet, xiv. p. 617. <lb/>
            These compositions were full of description, and were sung by a chorus <lb/>
            who danced at the same time, and represented the words by their move­ <lb/>
            ments and gestures. Tynnichus of Chalcis, whose pæan was famous, <lb/>

          <p>TERPSION meeting Euclides at Megara, and inquiring where he <lb/>
            has been, is informed that he has been accompanying Theætetus, <lb/>
            who is lately come on shore from Corinth, in a weak and almost <lb/>
            dying condition, upon his return to Athens. This reminds them <lb/>
            of the high opinion which Socrates had entertained of that young <lb/>
            man, who was presented to him (not long before his death) by <lb/>
            Theodorus of Cyrene, the geometrician. The conversation, which <lb/>
            then passed between them, was taken down in writing by Eu­ <lb/>
            elides, who, at the request of Terpsion, orders his servant to read <lb/>
            it to them.</p>
          <p>The Abbé Sallier, in Memoires de l'Academie des Inscriptions, <lb/>
            vol. xiii. p. 317, has given an elegant translation of the most shin­ <lb/>
            ing part of this dialogue ; and also in vol. xvi. p. 70, has translated <lb/>
            all that part of the dialogue, in which Plato has explained the <lb/>
            system of Protagoras. The description of a true philosopher in <lb/>
            p. 172, though a little exaggerated, and more in the character <lb/>
            of Plato than of Socrates, has yet an elevation in it which is ad­ <lb/>
            mirable. The Abbé Sallier has also given a sketch of the dialogue, <lb/>
            which is a very long one, and, as he rightly judges, would not be <lb/>
            much approved in a translation. It is of that kind called <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πειρασ­ <lb/>
            τικός</foreign>, " Tentative," in order to make trial of the capacity of Theæ­ <lb/>
            tetus, while Socrates, as he says, only plays the midwife, and brings <lb/>
            the conceptions of his mind to light. The question is, What is <lb/>
            knowledge? and the purpose of the dialogue is rather to refute the <lb/>
            false definitions of it, as established by1 Protagoras in his writings, <lb/>
            and resulting from the tenets of Heraclitus,2 of Empedocles, and <lb/>
            of other philosophers, than to produce a better definition of his <lb/>
            own. Yet there are many fine and remarkable passages in it, <lb/>
            such as the observations of Theodorus on the faults of temper, <lb/>
            which usually attend on brighter parts, and on the defects of <lb/>
            genius often found in minds of a more sedate and solid turn ; So­ <lb/>

            matter, arising from the perpetual flux and motion of all things, <lb/>
            which was the doctrine of Heraclitus and others; the reflections <lb/>

            the little cunning and narrow thoughts of mere men of business; <lb/>
            the description of Heraclitus's followers, then very numerous in <lb/>
            Ionia, particularly at Ephesus ; the account of the tenets of Par­ <lb/>
            menides and of Melissus, directly contrary to those of the former; <lb/>
            the distinction between our senses, the instruments through <lb/>
            which the mind perceives external objects, and the mind itself, <lb/>
            which judges of their existence, their likeness, and their difference, <lb/>
            and founds its knowledge on the ideas which it abstracts from <lb/>
            them; to which we may add, the comparison of ideas fixed in the <lb/>
            memory to .. impressions made in wax, and the dwelling on this <lb/>
            similitude in order to show the several imperfections of this <lb/>

          <p>I AM convinced that this is a continuation of the Theætetus, <lb/>
            which ends with these words, " To-morrow, Theodorus, let us meet <lb/>
            here again," as this begins with " According to our agreement, So­ <lb/>
            crates, yesterday, we are come ourselves in due order.” The persons <lb/>
            are the same, except the philosopher of the Eleatic school, who is <lb/>
            here introduced, and who carries on the disputation with Theætetus, <lb/>
            while both Theodorus and Socrates continue silent. The apparent <lb/>
            subject of it is the character of a sophist, which is here at large <lb/>
            displayed in opposition to that of a philosopher; but here too he <lb/>
            occasionally attacks the opinions of Protagoras, Heraclitus, Em­ <lb/>
            pedocles, and others, on the incertitude of all existence and on the <lb/>
            perpetual flux of matter.</p>
          <p>This dialogue, in a translation, would suit the taste of the <lb/>
            present age still less even than the Theætetus; particularly that <lb/>
            part, which is intended to explain the nature of existence and of <lb/>
            non-existence, which to me is obscure beyond all comprehension, <lb/>
            partly perhaps from our ignorance of the opinions of those phi­ <lb/>
            losophers, which are here refuted; and partly from the abstracted <lb/>
            nature of the subject; and not a little, I doubt, from Plato's manner <lb/>
            of treating it.</p>
          <p>The most remarkable things in this dialogue appear to be, his <note type="footnote"> VOL. VI. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 H </note> <lb/>

            description of that disorder and want of symmetry in the soul, <lb/>
            produced by ignorance, which puts it off its bias on its way to <lb/>
            happiness, the great end of human actions: the distinction he <lb/>
            makes between ”<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αγνοια</foreign>, " the want of knowledge," and '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αμαθία</foreign>, <lb/>
            " the want of learning;" of which the former is simply our ignor­ <lb/>
            ance of a thing, the latter, an ignorance which mistakes itself <lb/>
            for knowledge, and which, as long as this sentiment attends it, is <lb/>
            without hope of remedy: the explanation of the Socratic mode <lb/>
            of instruction, adapted to this peculiar kind of ignorance, by <lb/>
            drawing a person's errors gradually from his own mouth, ranging <lb/>
            them together, and exposing to his own eyes their inconsistency <lb/>
            and weakness : the comparison of that representation of things, <lb/>
            given us by the sophists, and pieces of painting, which, placed at a <lb/>
            certain distance, deceive the young and inexperienced into an <lb/>
            opinion of their reality: and the total change of ideas in young <lb/>
            men when they come into the world, and begin to be acquainted <lb/>

          <p>THIS dialogue is a continuation of the Sophist, as the Sophist is <lb/>
            a continuation of the Theætetus; and they were accordingly <lb/>
            ranged together by Thrasyllus in that order, as stated by Diog. <lb/>
            Laert. iii. 58, though Serranus in his edition has separated them. <lb/>
            The persons are the same, only that here the younger Socrates is <lb/>
            introduced, instead of Theætetus, carrying on the conversation <lb/>
            with the stranger from Elea. The principal heads of it are the <lb/>
            following:</p>
          <p>P. 258. The division of the sciences into speculative and prac­ <lb/>
            tical.</p>
          <p>P. 259. The master, the economist, the politician, the king; <lb/>
            which are taken as different names for men of the same profession.</p>
          <p>The private man, who can give lessons of government to such <lb/>
            as publicly exercise this art, deserves the name of royal no less than <lb/>
            they.</p>
          <p>No difference between a great family and a small common­ <lb/>
            wealth.</p>
          <p>The politician must command on his own judgment, and not by <lb/>
            the suggestion of others.</p>
          <p>P. 262. The absurdity of the Greeks, who divided all man­ <lb/>
            kind into Greeks and barbarians. The folly of all distinction and <lb/>
            division without a difference.</p>
          <p>P. 269. The fable of the contrary revolutions in the universe <lb/>
            at periodical times, with the alternate destruction and repro­ <lb/>
            duction of all creatures.</p>
          <p>P. 273. The disorder and the evil in the natural world, ac­ <lb/>
            counted for from the nature of matter, while it was yet a chaos.</p>
          <p>The former revolution, in which the Divinity himself immedi­ <lb/>
            ately conducted every thing, is called the Saturnian age; the <lb/>
            present revolution, when the world goes the contrary way, being <lb/>
            left to its own2 conduct. Mankind are now guided by their own <lb/>
            free-will, and are preserved by their own inventions.</p>
          <p>P. 275. The nature of the monarch in this age is no other <note type="footnote"> I Plato, with the Pythagoreans, looked upon matter as co-eternal with the <lb/>
            Deity, but receiving its order and design entirely from him. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Here too, as in the Timacus, p. 63, A., he considers the universe as one <lb/>

             <pb n="468"/>
            than that of the people which he commands. His government <lb/>
            must be with the consent of the people,</p>
          <p>P. 276. Clear and certain knowledge is rare and in few in­ <lb/>
            stances ; we are forced to supply this defect by comparison and <lb/>
            by analogy. Necessity of tracing things up to their first principles. <lb/>
            Examples of logical division.</p>
          <p>Greater, or less, with respect to our actions, are not to be con­ <lb/>
            sidered as mere relations only depending on one another, but are to <lb/>
            be referred to a certain middle term, which forms the standard of <lb/>
            morality.</p>
          <p>P. 284. All the arts consist in measurement, and are divided <lb/>
            into two classes: 1st, Those arts which compare dimensions, <lb/>
            numbers, or motions, each with its contrary, as greater with <lb/>
            smaller, more with less, swifter with slower; and 2dly, Those, <lb/>
            which compare them by their distances from some middle point, <lb/>
            seated between two extremes, in which consists what is right, fit, <lb/>
            and becoming.</p>
          <p>The design of these distinctions, and of the manner used before <lb/>
            in tracing out the idea of a sophist and a politician, is to form the <lb/>
            mind to a habit of logical division.</p>
          <p>The necessity of illustrating our contemplations, on abstract <lb/>
            and spiritual subjects, by sensible and material images, is stated.</p>
          <p>P. 286. An apology for his prolixity.</p>
          <p>Principal, and concurrent, or instrumental causes, are named; <lb/>
            the division of the latter, with their several productions, is into <lb/>
            seven classes of arts which are necessary to society: viz.</p>
          <p>1. To <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρωτογενές εἶδος</foreign>. That class which furnishes materials for <lb/>

          <p>4. ”<foreign xml:lang="grc">Οχημα</foreign>. Carriages, seats, vehicles for the land and water, &amp;c., <lb/>

          <p>THE scene of this dialogue lies at the house of Cephalus, a rich <lb/>
            old Syracusan, father to Lysias the orator, then residing in the <lb/>
            Piræeus, on the day of the Bendidea, a festival, then first celebrated <lb/>
            on the 19th day of the month Thargelion, answering to the middle <lb/>
            of June, with processions, races, and illuminations in honour of the <lb/>
            Thracian Diana. The persons engaged in the conversation, or <lb/>
            present at it, are Cephalus himself, Polemarchus, Lysias, and <lb/>
            Euthydemus, his three sons; Glauco and Adimantus, sons of <lb/>
            Aristo and brothers to Plato; Niceratus, son of Nicias ; Thrasy­ <lb/>
             <pb n="470"/>
            machus the sophist of Chalcedon; Clitophon, son of Aristonymus, <lb/>
            and Charmantides of Pæania, and Socrates.</p>
          <p>As to the time of these dialogues, it is certain that Cephalus <lb/>
            died about 01. 84, 1, and that his son Lysias was born fifteen <lb/>
            years before 01. 80, 2, consequently they must fall between these <lb/>
            two years, and probably not long before Cephalus's death, when <lb/>
            he was seventy years old or more; and Lysias was a boy of ten or <lb/>
            twelve and upwards. Therefore I should place it in the 83rd 01. <lb/>
            See Fastos Atticos, Corsini, vol. ii. Dissert. 13, p. 312. But I must <lb/>
            observe that this is not easily reconcilable with the age of Adi­ <lb/>
            mantus and Glauco, who are here introduced as men grown up, <lb/>
            and consequently must be at least thirty-six years older than their <lb/>
            brother Plato. If this can be allowed, the action at Megara there <lb/>
            mentioned must be that which happened 01. 83, 2, under Pericles; <lb/>
            and the institution of the Bendidea must have been 01. 83, 3 or 4. <lb/>
            It is observable also that Theages is mentioned in vi. p. 496 of <lb/>
            this dialogue, as advanced in the study of philosophy. He was <lb/>
            very young, when his father Demodocus put him under the care <lb/>
            of Socrates, which was in 01. 92, 3, and consequently thirty-five <lb/>
            years after the time which Corsini would assign to this convers­ <lb/>

          <p>The pleasures of old age and the advantages of wealth.</p>
          <p>P. 335. The just man hurts no one, not even his enemies.</p>
          <p>P. 338. The sophist's definition of justice, namely, that it is the <lb/>
            advantage of our superiors, to which the laws of every govern­ <lb/>
            ment oblige the subject to conform, is refuted.</p>
          <p>P. 3-11. The proof, that the proper office of every art is to act <lb/>
            for the good of its inferiors.</p>
          <p>P. 343. The sophist's attempt to show, that justice is not the <lb/>
            good of those who possess it, but of those who do not; and that in­ <lb/>
            justice is only blamed in such as have not the art to carry it to its <lb/>
            perfection, refuted.</p>
          <p>P. 347. In a state composed all of good men, no one would be <lb/>
            ambitious of governing.</p>
          <p>P. 349. The perfection of the arts consists in attaining a certain <lb/>
            rule of proportion. The musician does not attempt to excel his <lb/>
            fellows by straining or stopping his chords higher or lower than <lb/>
            they; for that would produce dissonance and not harmony, the <lb/>
            phpsician does not try to exceed his fellows by prescribing a <lb/>
            larger or less quantity of nourishment, or of medicines, than <lb/>
            conduces to health ; and so of the rest. The unjust man therefore, <lb/>
            who would surpass all the rest of his fellow-creatures in the <lb/>
             <pb n="471"/>
            quantity of his pleasures and powers, acts like one ignorant in the <lb/>
            art of life, in which only the just are skilled.</p>
          <p>P. 351. The greatest and most signal injustices, which one <lb/>
            state and society can commit against another, cannot be perpetrat­ <lb/>
            ed without a strict adherence to justice among the particular mem­ <lb/>
            bers of such a state and society: so that there is no force nor <lb/>
            strength without a degree of justice.</p>
          <p>P. 352. Injustice even in one single mind must set it at per­ <lb/>
            petual variance with itself, as well as with all others.</p>
          <p>P. 353. Virtue is the proper office, the wisdom, the strength, <lb/>
            and the happiness of the human soul.</p>

          <p>P. 357. Good is of three kinds : the First we embrace for itself, <lb/>
            without regard to its consequences; such are all innocent delights <lb/>
            and amusements. The Second, both for itself and for its conse­ <lb/>
            quences, as health, strength, sense, &amp;c. The Third, for its conse­ <lb/>
            quences only, as labour, medicine, &amp;c. The second of these is the <lb/>
            most perfect: the justice of this class. Objection-To consider it <lb/>
            rightly we must separate it from honour and from reward, and <lb/>
            view it simply as it is in itself.</p>
          <p>P. 358. Injustice is a real good to its possessor, and justice is an <lb/>
            evil: but as men feel more pain in suffering than inflicting injury, <lb/>
            and as the greater part are more exposed to suffer it than capable <lb/>
            of inflicting it, they have by compact agreed neither to do nor to <lb/>
            suffer injustice; which is a medium calculated for the general <lb/>
            benefit, between that which is best of all, namely, to do injustice <lb/>
            without fear of punishment, and that which is worst, to suffer it <lb/>
            without a possibility of revenge. This is the origin of what we <lb/>
            call justice.</p>
          <p>Such as practise the rules of justice do it from their inability to <lb/>
            do otherwise, and consequently against their will. Story of Gyges's1 <lb/>
            ring, by which he could make himself invisible at pleasure. No <lb/>
            person, who possessed such a ring, but would do wrong.</p>
          <p>P. 360. Life of the perfectly unjust man, who conceals his true <lb/>
            character from the world, and that of the perfectly just man, who <lb/>
            seems the contrary in the eye of the world, are compared : the hap­ <lb/>
            piness of the former is contrasted with the misery of the latter.</p>
          <p>P. 362. The advantages of probity are not therefore, according <lb/>
            to this representation, in itself, but in things exterior to it, in <note type="footnote"> 1 See Cic. de Offic. iii. c. 9, where he attributes to Gyges himself what <lb/>
            Plato relates of one of his ancestors. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="472"/>
            honours and rewards, and they attend not on being, but on seem­ <lb/>
            ing honest.</p>
          <p>P. 363. Accordingly the praises bestowed on justice, and the <lb/>
            reproaches on injustice, by our parents and governors, are em­ <lb/>
            ployed not on the thing itself, but on its consequences. The <lb/>
            Elysian fields and the punishments of Tartarus are painted in the <lb/>
            strongest colours by the poets; while they represent the practice <lb/>
            of virtue as difficult and laborious, and that of vice, as easy and <lb/>
            delightful. They add, that the gods often bestow misery on the <lb/>
            former, and prosperity and success on the latter; and, at the same <lb/>
            time, they teach us how to expiate our crimes, and even how to <lb/>
            hurt our enemies, by prayers, by sacrifices, and by incantations.</p>
          <p>P. 366. The consequence is, by this mode of argument, that to <lb/>
            dissemble well with the world is the way to happiness in this life; <lb/>
            and for what is to come, we may buy the favour of the gods at a <lb/>
            trifling expense.</p>
          <p>P. 369. The nature of political justice. The image of a society <lb/>
            in its first formation : it is founded on our natural imbecility, and <lb/>
            on the mutual occasion we have for each other's assistance. Our <lb/>
            first and most pressing necessity, is that of food; the second, of <lb/>
            habitation; the third, of clothing. The first and most necessary <lb/>
            society must therefore consist of a ploughman, a builder, a shoe­ <lb/>
            maker, and a weaver: but, as they will want instruments, a car­ <lb/>
            penter and a smith will be requisite; and as cattle will be <lb/>
            wanted, as well for their skins and wool, as for tillage and carriage, <lb/>
            they must take in shepherds and the herdsmen. As one country <lb/>
            produces not every thing, they will have occasion for some im­ <lb/>
            ported commodities, which cannot be procured without exporta­ <lb/>
            tions in return, so that a commerce must be carried on by <lb/>
            merchants ; and if it be performed by sea, there will be an occasion <lb/>
            for mariners and pilots. Further; as the employment of the shep­ <lb/>
            herds, agricultors, mechanics, merchants, and such persons will <lb/>
            not permit them to attend the markets, there must be retailers, <lb/>
            and tradesmen, and money to purchase with; and there must be <lb/>
            servants to assist all these, that is, persons who let out their <lb/>
            strength for hire. Such an establishment will not be long without <lb/>
            a degree of luxury, which will increase the city with a vast variety <lb/>
            of artificers, and require a greater extent of territory to support <lb/>
            them: they will then encroach on their neighbours. Hence the <lb/>
            origin of war. A militia will be required; but as this is an art, <lb/>
            which will engross the whole man, and take up all his time, to <lb/>
            acquire and exercise it, a distinct body will be formed of chosen <lb/>
            men for the defence of the state.</p>
          <p>P. 374. The nature of a soldier: he must have quickness of <lb/>
            sense, agility, and strength, invincible spirit tempered with gentle­ <lb/>
            ness and goodness of heart, and an understanding apprehensive <lb/>
            and desirous of knowledge.</p><pb n="473"/>
            
          <p>P. 376. The education of such a person. Errors and dangerous <lb/>
            prejudices are instilled into young minds by the Greek poets. The <lb/>
            scandalous fables of Homer and of Hesiod, who attribute injustice, <lb/>
            enmity, anger, and deceit to the gods, are reprobated; and the <lb/>
            immutable goodness, truth, justice, mercy, and other attributes of <lb/>
            the Divinity are nobly asserted.</p>

          <p>P. 363. '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Επαγωγαί καὶ κατάδεσμοι τω̃ν Θεω̃ν</foreign>.] Incantations and magical <lb/>
            rites, to hurt one's enemies, were practised in Greece and taught by vaga­ <lb/>
            bond priests and prophets: a number of books ascribed to Musæus and <lb/>
            Orpheus were carried about by such people, prescribing various expiatory <lb/>
            ceremonies and mysterious rites: so the chorus of Satyrs in the Cyclops <lb/>

            in the fire. See Athenæus, ii. p. 54; Theocritus, Id. vii. 65. Crobylus <lb/>

          <p>P. 386. Wrong notions of a future state are instilled into youth <lb/>
            by the poets, whence arises an unmanly fear of death.</p>
          <p>P. 388. Excessive sorrow and excessive laughter are equally <lb/>
            unbecoming a man of worth.</p>
          <p>P. 389. Falsehood and fiction are not permitted, but where <lb/>
            they are for the good of mankind; and consequently they are not <lb/>
            to be trusted but in skilful hands.</p>
          <p>P. 390. Examples of impiety and of bad morality in the <lb/>
            poets, and in other ancient writers.</p>
          <p>P. 392. Poetic eloquence is divided into narration, in the <lb/>
            writer's own person, and imitation, in some assumed character. <lb/>
            Dithyrambics usually consist wholly of the former ; dramatic <lb/>
            poesy, of the latter; the epic, &amp;c., of both mixed.</p>
          <p>P. 395. Early imitation becomes a second nature. The soldier <lb/>
            is not permitted to imitate any thing misbecoming his own charac­ <lb/>
            ter, and consequently he is neither permitted to write, nor to play, <lb/>
            any part which he himself would not act in life.</p>
          <p>P. 396. Imitative expression in oratory, or in gesture, is re­ <lb/>
            strained by the same principle.</p>
          <p>P. 398. Music must be regulated. The Lydian, Syntono- <lb/>
            Lydian, and Ionian harmonies are banished, as accommodated to <lb/>
            the soft, enervate passions; but the Dorian and the Phrygian <lb/>
             <pb n="474"/>
            harmonies are permitted, as manly, decent, and persuasive. All <lb/>
            instruments of great compass and of luxuriant harmony, the lyra, <lb/>
            the cythara, and the fistula, are allowed; and the various rhythms <lb/>
            or movements are in like manner restrained.</p>
          <p>P. 401. The same principle is extended to painting, sculpture, <lb/>
            architecture, and to the other arts.</p>
          <p>P. 403. Love is permitted, but abstracted from bodily enjoy­ <lb/>
            ment. Diet and exercises, plain and simple meats, are prescribed.</p>
          <p>P. 405. Many judges and physicians are a sure sign of a society <lb/>
            ill-regulated both in mind and in body. Ancient physicians knew <lb/>
            no medicines but for wounds, fractures, epidemical distempers, and <lb/>
            other acute complaints. The dietetic and gymnastic method of <lb/>
            cure, or rather of protracting diseases, was not known before He­ <lb/>
            rodicus introduced it.</p>
          <p>P. 409. The temper and disposition of an old man of probity, <lb/>
            fit to judge of the crimes of others, is described.</p>
          <p>P. 410. The temper of men, practised in the exercises of the <lb/>
            body, but unacquainted with music and with letters, is apt to run <lb/>
            into an obstinate and brutal fierceness; and that of the contrary <lb/>
            sort, into indolence and effeminacy. The gradual neglect of this, <lb/>
            in both cases, is here finely painted.</p>
          <p>P. 412. Choice of such of the soldiery, as are to rise to the <lb/>
            magistracy; namely, of those who, through their life, have been <lb/>
            proof to pleasure and to pain.</p>
          <p>P. 414. An example of a beneficial fiction. It is difficult to fix <lb/>
            in the minds of men a belief in fables, originally; but it is very <lb/>
            easy to deliver it down to posterity, when once established.</p>
          <p>P. 416. The habitation of the soldiery: all luxury in building <lb/>
            to be absolutely forbidden them: they are to have no patrimony, <lb/>
            nor possessions, but to be supported and furnished with necessaries <lb/>
            from year to year by the citizens; they are to live and eat in com­ <lb/>
            mon, and to use no plate, nor jewels, nor money.</p>

            hands the government is placed, will have less happiness and en­ <lb/>
            joyment of life than any of the meanest citizens.</p>
          <p>Answer-That it is not the intention of the legislature to be­ <lb/>
            stow superior happiness on any one class of men in the state; but <lb/>
            that each shall enjoy such a measure of it, as is consistent with <lb/>
            the preservation of the whole.</p>
          <p>P. 421. Opulence and poverty are equally destructive of a <lb/>
            state; the one producing luxury, indolence, and a spirit of inno­ <lb/>
             <pb n="475"/>
            vation; the other producing meanness, cunning, and a like spirit <lb/>
            of innovation.</p>
          <p>The task of the magistracy is to keep both the one and the <lb/>
            other out of the republic.</p>
          <p>P. 422. Can such a state, without a superfluity of treasure, <lb/>
            defend itself, when attacked by a rich and powerful neighbour ?</p>
          <p>As easily as a champion, exercised for the Olympic games, could <lb/>
            defeat one or more rich fat men unused to fatigue, who should fall <lb/>
            upon him in a hot day.</p>
          <p>The advantage of such a state, which neither needs riches nor <lb/>
            desires them, in forming alliances.</p>
          <p>Every republic formed on another plan, though it bear the <lb/>
            name of a state, is in reality several states included under one <lb/>
            name; the rich making one state, the poor another, and so on; <lb/>
            always at war among themselves.</p>
          <p>P. 423. A body of a thousand men bred to war, and united by <lb/>
            such an education and government as this, is superior even in <lb/>
            number to any thing that almost any state in Greece could produce.</p>
          <p>P. 424. No innovation is to be ever admitted in the original <lb/>
            plan of education. A change of music in a country betokens a <lb/>
            change in their morals.</p>
          <p>P. 425. Fine satire on the Athenians, and on their demagogues.</p>
          <p>P. 428. The political wisdom of the new-formed state is seated <lb/>
            in the magistracy.</p>
          <p>P. 429. Its bravery is seated in the soldiery : in what it consists.</p>
          <p>P. 430. The nature of temperance: the expression of subduing <lb/>
            one's self, is explained; when reason, the superior part of the mind, <lb/>
            preserves its empire over the inferior, that is, over our passions <lb/>
            and desires. The temperance of the new republic, whose wisdom <lb/>
            and valour, in the hands of the soldiery, exercise a just power over <lb/>
            the inferior people by their own consent, is described.</p>
          <p>P. 433. Political justice distributes to every one his proper pro­ <lb/>
            vince of action, and prevents each from encroaching on the other.</p>
          <p>P. 435. Justice in a private man: its similitude to the former <lb/>
            is stated. The three distinct faculties of the soul, namely, appetite, <lb/>
            or desire, reason, and indignation, or the concupiscible, the rational, <lb/>
            and the irascible, are described.</p>
          <p>P. 441. The first made to obey the second, and the third to <lb/>
            assist and to strengthen it. Fortitude is the proper virtue of the <lb/>
            irascible, wisdom of the rational, and temperance of the concupis­ <lb/>
            cible, preserving a sort of harmony and consent between the three.</p>
          <p>P. 443. Justice is the result of this union, maintaining each <lb/>
            faculty in its proper office.</p>
          <p>P. 444. The description of injustice.</p>
          <p>P. 445. The uniformity of virtue, and the infinite variety of vice. <lb/>
            Four more distinguished kinds of it are enumerated, whence arise <lb/>

          <p>P. 451. On the education of the women. There is no natural <lb/>
            difference between the sexes, but in point of strength; their exer­ <lb/>
            cises, therefore, both of body and mind, are to be alike, as are <lb/>
            their employments in the state.</p>
          <p>P. 452. Custom is forced in time to submit to reason. The sight <lb/>
            of men exercising2 naked was once held indecent in Greece, till <lb/>
            the Cretans first, and then the Lacedaemonians, introduced it: it <lb/>
            is still held scandalous by the Persians, and by other barbarians.</p>
          <p>P. 454. When the entire sexes are compared with each other, <lb/>
            the female is doubtless the inferior; but, in individuals, the woman <lb/>
            has often the advantage of the man.</p>
          <p>P. 456. Choice of the female soldiery.</p>
          <p>P. 457. Wives in common to all men of the same class. Their <lb/>
            times of meeting to be regulated on solemn days, accompanied with <lb/>
            solemn ceremonies and sacrifices, by the magistracy, who are to <lb/>
            contrive by lots, the secret management of which is known to them <lb/>
            alone, that the best and bravest of the men may be paired with <lb/>
            women of like qualities, and that those, who are less fit to breed, <lb/>
            may come together very seldom. <note type="footnote"> 1 It is probable that this 5th book, and perhaps the 3rd, were written <lb/>
            when Plato was about thirty-five years old, for he says in his 7th Epistle, <lb/>
            p. 326, when speaking of himself before his first voyage to Sicily- <lb/>
            And I was compelled to say while praising true philosophy, &amp;c.; and Aulus <lb/>
            Gellius asserts in xiv. 3, that Xenophon, after reading the two books of <lb/>
            Plato's Republic which were first published, wrote in opposition to them <lb/>
            his Cyropedia. I know not how ancient the division of this work into ten <lb/>
            books may be; but there is no reason at all for it, the whole being one con­ <lb/>
            tinued conversation. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The Lacedæmonians, says Thucydides in i. 6, were the first to undress <lb/>
            themselves and to appear naked in public ; whereas formerly the Athletes <lb/>
            in the Olympic contests wore a girdle round their middle; and not many <lb/>
            years have passed since the custom was left off. This change is said to have <lb/>
            been made about the 32nd Olymp.] </note></p><pb n="477"/>
            
          <p>P. 460. Neither fathers nor mothers are to know their own <lb/>
            children, which, when born, are to be conveyed to a separate part <lb/>
            of the city, and there, so many of them as the magistrate shall <lb/>
            choose, to be brought up by nurses appointed for that purpose.</p>
          <p>The time of propagation to be limited, in the men from thirty <lb/>
            years of age to fifty-five, in the women from twenty to forty. No <lb/>
            children born of parents under or above this term to be brought up, <lb/>
            but exposed, and the parents severely censured; as are all who <lb/>
            meet without the usual solemnities, and without the licence of the <lb/>
            magistrate.</p>
          <p>P. 461. All children, born within seven or ten months from the <lb/>
            time any person was permitted to propagate, are to be considered <lb/>
            as their own children : all that are born within the time, in which <lb/>
            their parents are suffered to breed, are to regard each other as <lb/>
            brethren. Marriage is to be prohibited between persons in these <lb/>
            circumstances.</p>
          <p>P. 462. Partiality and dissension among the soldiery are pre­ <lb/>
            vented by these appointments. A fellow-feeling of pleasures and <lb/>
            of pains is the strongest band of union which can connect mankind.</p>
          <p>P. 466. Children are to be carried out to war very early, to see <lb/>
            and to learn their intended profession, and wait on their parents in <lb/>
            the field.</p>
          <p>P. 468. A soldier who deserts his rank, or throws away his <lb/>
            arms, is to be reduced to the rank of a mechanic: he who is taken <lb/>
            prisoner alive is never to be ransomed.-The reward of the bravest.</p>
          <p>P. 469. It is not permitted to reduce a Greek to captivity, nor to <lb/>
            strip the dead of any thing but of their arms, which are forbidden to <lb/>
            be dedicated in the temples; it is not permitted to ravage the country <lb/>
            further than to destroy the year's crop, or to burn the buildings.</p>
          <p>P. 472. The reason why a state, thus instituted, seems an im­ <lb/>
            possibility. No people will ever be rightly governed, till kings <lb/>
            shall be philosophers, or philosophers be kings.</p>
          <p>P. 474. The description of a genius truly philosophic.</p>
          <p>P 476. The distinction of knowledge and opinion.</p>

          <p>P. 460. This was actually the practice of Sparta, as we learn from <lb/>
            Plutarch in Lycurg., where the old men of each tribe sat in judgment <lb/>
            on the new-born infants, and, if they were weakly or deformed, ordered <lb/>
            them to be cast into a deep cavern, near Mount Taygetus. Thence also <lb/>
            are borrowed the prohibition of gold and silver, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξυσσιτία</foreign>, " the eating <lb/>
            together " in public, the naked exercises of the women, the community <lb/>
            of goods, the general authority of the old men over the young, the sim­ <lb/>
            plicity of music and of diet, the exemption of the soldiery from all other <lb/>
            business, and most of the fundamental institutions in Plato's republic, as <lb/>
            Plutarch observes in his Lycurgus.</p><pb n="478"/>

          <p>Plato is no where more admirable than in this book: the <lb/>
            thoughts are as just as they are new, and the elocution is as <lb/>
            beautiful as it is expressive; it can never be read too often: but <lb/>
            towards the end it is excessively obscure.</p>
          <p>P. 485. The love of truth is the natural consequence of a genius <lb/>
            truly inclined to philosophy. Such a mind will be little inclined <lb/>
            to sensual pleasures, and consequently will be temperate, and a <lb/>
            stranger to avarice and to illiberality.</p>
          <p>P. 486. Such a mind, being accustomed to the most extensive <lb/>
            views of 'things and to the sublimest contemplations, will contract <lb/>
            an habitual greatness, and look down, as it were, with disregard on <lb/>
            human life and on death, the end of it; and consequently will <lb/>
            possess the truest fortitude. Justice is the result of these virtues.</p>
          <p>Apprehension and memory are two fundamental qualities of a <lb/>
            philosophic mind.</p>
          <p>P. 487. Such a genius is made by nature to govern mankind. <lb/>
            Objection from experience-That such as have devoted them­ <lb/>
            selves to the study of philosophy, and have made it the employ­ <lb/>
            ment of their maturer age, have turned out either very bad men, <lb/>
            or entirely useless to society.</p>
          <p>P. 488. Their inutility, with regard to government, is allowed <lb/>
            and accounted for. The comparison of a bad government to a <lb/>
            ship, where the mariners have agreed to let their pilot have no <lb/>
            hand in the steerage, but to take that task upon themselves.</p>
          <p>P. 491. Those very endowments, before described as necessary <lb/>
            to the philosophic mind, are often the ruin of it, especially when <lb/>
            joined to the external advantages of strength, beauty, nobility, and <lb/>
            wealth, when they light in a bad soil, and do not meet with their <lb/>
            proper nurture, which an excellent education only can bestow.</p>
          <p>Extraordinary virtues and extraordinary vices are equally the <lb/>
            produce of a vigorous mind: little souls are alike incapable of one <lb/>
            or of the other.</p>
          <p>The corruption of young minds is falsely attributed to the <lb/>
            sophists, who style themselves philosophers: it is the public <lb/>
            example which depraves them; the assemblies of the people, the <lb/>
            courts of justice, the camp, and the theatres inspire them with <lb/>
            false opinions, elevate them with false applause, and fright them <lb/>
            with false infamy. The sophists do no more than confirm the <lb/>
            opinions of the public, and teach how to humour its passions and <lb/>
            to flatter its vanities.</p>
          <p>P. 495. As few great geniuses have strength to resist the general <lb/>
            contagion, but leave philosophy abandoned and forlorn, though it <lb/>
             <pb n="479"/>
            is their own peculiar province, the sophists step into their vacant <lb/>
            place, assume their name and air, and cheat the people into an <lb/>
            opinion of them. They are compared to a little old slave, worth <lb/>
            money, dressed out like a bridegroom to marry the beautiful, but <lb/>
            poor, orphan daughter of his deceased lord.</p>
          <p>P. 495, § 10. A description of the few of true genius who escape <lb/>
            depravation, and devote themselves really to philosophy; which <lb/>
            happens commonly either from some ill fortune, or from weakness <lb/>
            of constitution. The reason why they must necessarily be ex­ <lb/>
            cluded from public affairs, unless in this imaginary republic.</p>
          <p>P. 500. The application of these arguments to the proof of his <lb/>
            former proposition, namely, that until princes shall. be philoso­ <lb/>
            phers or philosophers shall be princes, no state can be completely <lb/>
            happy.</p>
          <p>P. 503. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φύλακες</foreign>, " Guardians," therefore, are to be real philo­ <lb/>
            sophers. The great difficulty is to find the requisite qualifications <lb/>
            of mind united in one person. Quickness of apprehension and a <lb/>
            retentive memory, vivacity and application, gentleness and mag­ <lb/>
            nanimity, rarely go together.</p>
          <p>P. 508. The idea of the supreme good is the foundation of <lb/>
            philosophy, without which all acquisitions are useless. The cause <lb/>
            of knowledge and of truth is compared to light; truth, to the <lb/>
            power which bodies have of reflecting light, or of becoming visible; <lb/>
            and the sovereign good itself is compared to the sun, the lord and <lb/>
            father of light.</p>
          <p>P. 509. The author of being is superior to all being.</p>
          <p>P. 510. There are different degrees of certainty in the objects of <lb/>
            our understanding.</p>

          <p>P. 485. The existence that is for ever.] Our general abstracted ideas, <lb/>
            as they exist in the mind independent of matter, which is subject to con­ <lb/>
            tinual changes, were regarded by Plato as the sole foundations of know­ <lb/>
            ledge, and emanations, as it were, from the divinity himself.</p>
          <p>P. 497. Those who engage in it, &amp;c.] This is a remarkable passage, as it <lb/>
            shows the manner in which the Athenians usually studied philosophy, <lb/>
            and Plato's judgment about it, which was directly opposite to the com­ <lb/>
            mon practice.</p>

          <p>P. 514. The state of mankind is compared to that of persons <lb/>
            confined in a vast cavern from their birth, with their legs fettered, <lb/>
            and with their heads so placed in a machine that they cannot <lb/>
             <pb n="480"/>
            turn them to the light, which shines full in at the entrance of the <lb/>
            cave; nor can they see such bodies as are continually in motion, <lb/>
            passing and repassing behind them, but only the shadows of them, <lb/>
            as they fall on the sides of the grotto directly before their eyes.</p>
          <p>If any one should set them free from this confinement, oblige <lb/>
            them to walk, and drag them from their cavern into open day, <lb/>
            they would hang back or move with unwillingness or pain ; their <lb/>
            eyes would be dazzled with the brightness of each new object, and <lb/>
            comprehend nothing distinctly; they would long for their shadows <lb/>
            and darkness again, till, being more habituated to light, they <lb/>
            would first be brought to gaze on the images of things reflected in <lb/>
            the water, or elsewhere; then on the bodies themselves; then on <lb/>
            the skies, on the stars, and the moon, and gradually on the sun <lb/>
            himself, whom they would learn to be the source and the author <lb/>
            of all these beautiful appearances.</p>
          <p>If any thing should induce one of these persons to descend <lb/>
            again into his native cavern, his eyes would not for a long time <lb/>
            be reconciled to darkness, his old fellow-prisoners would treat him <lb/>
            as stupid and blind, would say that he had spoiled his eyes in <lb/>
            those upper regions, and grow angry with him, if he proposed to <lb/>
            set them at liberty.</p>
          <p>P. 518. An early good education is the only thing which can <lb/>
            turn the eyes of our mind from the darkness and uncertainty of <lb/>
            popular opinion to the clear light of truth. It is the interest of <lb/>
            the public neither to suffer unlettered and unphilosophic minds to <lb/>
            meddle with government, nor to allow men of knowledge to give <lb/>
            themselves up for their whole life to contemplation, as the first <lb/>
            will have no principle to act upon, and the others no practice nor <lb/>
            inclination to business.</p>
          <p>P. 526. The use of the mathematics, in education, is princi­ <lb/>
            pally to abstract the mind from sensible and material objects, and <lb/>
            to turn it to contemplate certain general and immutable truths, <lb/>
            whence it may aspire to the knowledge of the supreme good, who <lb/>
            is immutable, and is the object only of the understanding.</p>
          <p>The great improvement of a mind versed in these sciences, <lb/>
            which quicken and enlarge the apprehension, and inure us to <lb/>
            intense application, and what are their practical uses, particularly <lb/>
            in military knowledge, is eloquently described.</p>
          <p>P. 537. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φύλακες</foreign>, " Guards," to be initiated in mathematical <lb/>
            knowledge and studies before seventeen, and for three years more <lb/>
            are to be confined to their continual and necessary exercises of <lb/>
            the body, that is, till about twenty years of age; they are not to <lb/>
            enter upon logic till after thirty, in which they are to continue <lb/>
            five years.</p>
          <p>Knowledge is not to be implanted in a free-born mind by force <lb/>
            and violence, but by gentleness accompanied with art, and by every <lb/>
            kind of invitation.</p><pb n="481"/>
            
          <p>The dangerous situation of the mind, when it is quitting the <lb/>
            first prejudices of education and has not yet discovered the true <lb/>
            principles of action, is here admirably described. It is compared <lb/>
            to a youth brought up in affluence, and surrounded by flatterers, <lb/>
            by persons who have passed hitherto for his parents, but are not <lb/>
            really so; when he has found out the imposition, he will neglect <lb/>
            those whom he has hitherto obeyed and honoured, and will <lb/>
            naturally incline to the advice of his flatterers, till he can discover <lb/>
            those persons to whom he owes his duty and his birth.</p>
          <p>The levity, the heat, and the vanity of our first youth make it <lb/>
            an improper time to be trusted with reasoning and disputation, <lb/>
            which is only fit for a mind grown cooler and more settled by <lb/>
            years; as old age on the other hand weakens the apprehension, <lb/>
            and renders us incapable of application.</p>
          <p>From thirty-five to fifty years of age the <foreign xml:lang="grc">φύλακες</foreign>, " Guards;: are <lb/>
            to be obliged to administer the public affairs, and to act in the in­ <lb/>
            ferior offices of the magistracy; after fifty they are to be admitted <lb/>
            into the highest philosophy, the doctrine of the supreme good, and <lb/>
            are in their turn to submit to bear the superior offices of the <lb/>
            state.</p>

          <p>Plato here resumes the subject which he had dropped at the <lb/>
            end of the fourth book.</p>
          <p>P. 544. Four distinct kinds of government are enumerated, <lb/>
            which deviate from the true form, and gradually grow worse and <lb/>
            worse: namely, 1. The timocracy, so he calls the Lacedæmonian <lb/>
            or Cretan constitution; 2. The oligarchy; 3. The democracy; and <lb/>
            4. Tyranny: they are produced by as many different corruptions <lb/>
            of the mind and manners of the inhabitants.</p>
          <p>P. 545. The change from the true aristocracy (or constitution <lb/>
            of Plato's republic) to a timocracy is described. Every thing, <lb/>
            which has had a beginning, is subject to corruption. The intro­ <lb/>
            duction of property, and the division of land among the <foreign xml:lang="grc">φύλακες</foreign>. <lb/>
            The encroachment on the liberty of the inferior part of the com­ <lb/>
            monwealth. Secret avarice and love of pleasure are the conse­ <lb/>
            quence of private property. The neglect of music and of letters. <lb/>
            The preference given to the exercises of the body. The prevalence <lb/>
            of the irascible over the rational part of the soul.</p>
          <p>The character of a citizen in such a state and the origin of such <lb/>
            a character are described.</p>
          <p>P. 550. The change from a timocracy into an oligarchy, where <lb/>
            none are admitted to the honours and offices of the commonwealth, <note type="footnote"> VOL. VI. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 I </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="482"/>
            who do not possess a certain proportion of property. The progress <lb/>
            of avarice is the cause of this alteration. Such a state is always <lb/>
            divided into two, always at enmity among themselves, the rich and <lb/>
            the poor, which is the cause of its weakness. The alienation of <lb/>
            property, which is freely permitted by the wealthy for their own <lb/>
            interest, will still increase the disproportion of fortune among the <lb/>
            citizens. The ill consequences of prodigality, and of its attendant <lb/>
            extreme poverty, in a state. The poor are compared to drones in a <lb/>
            bee-hive, some with stings and some without.</p>
          <p>P. 552. The gradual transition of the mind from the love of <lb/>
            honour to the love of money.</p>
          <p>When a young man has seen the misfortunes which ambition <lb/>
            has brought upon his own family, as fines, banishment, confisca­ <lb/>
            tion, and even death itself, adversity and fear will break his spirit <lb/>
            and humble his parts, which he will now apply to raise a fortune <lb/>
            by securer methods, by the slow and secret arts of gain : his rational <lb/>
            faculties and nobler passions will be subjected to his desire of <lb/>
            acquisition, and he will admire and emulate others only in propor­ <lb/>
            tion as they possess the great object of his wishes : his passion for <lb/>
            wealth will keep down and suppress in him the love of pleasure <lb/>
            and of extravagance, which yet, for want of philosophy and of a <lb/>
            right education, will continue alive in his heart and exert itself, <lb/>
            when he can find an opportunity to satisfy it by some secret in­ <lb/>
            justice at the expense of others.</p>
          <p>P. 555. The source of a democracy: namely, when the meaner <lb/>
            sort, increasing with a number of men of spirit and abilities, re­ <lb/>
            duced to poverty by extravagance and by the love of pleasure, <lb/>
            begin to feel their own strength, and compare themselves to the <lb/>
            few wealthy persons who compose the government, whose body <lb/>
            and mind are weakened by their application to nothing but to the <lb/>
            sordid arts of lucre. The change of the constitution. The way <lb/>
            to the magistracy laid open to all, and decided by balloting. A <lb/>
            lively picture of the Athenian commonwealth.</p>
          <p>P. 558. The distinction between our necessary and unnecessary <lb/>
            desires, is stated; when the latter prevail over the former by in­ <lb/>
            dulgence, and by keeping bad company, they form a democratic <lb/>
            mind. The description of such a soul, when years have somewhat <lb/>
            allayed the tumult and violence of its passions; it is the sport of <lb/>
            humour and of caprice, inconstant in any pursuit, and incapable <lb/>
            of any resolution.</p>
          <p>P. 562. When liberty degenerates into extreme licence and an­ <lb/>
            archy, the democracy begins to tend towards tyranny. The picture <lb/>
            of the Athenian government and manners is continued with great <lb/>
            force and severity: where youth assumes the authority and <lb/>
            decisiveness of age, and age mimics the gaiety and pleasures of <lb/>
            youth; where women and slaves are upon the same looting with <lb/>
            their husbands and masters; and where even the dogs and horses <lb/>
             <pb n="483"/>
            march directly onwards, and refuse to give way to a citizen. The <lb/>
            common mutation of things from one extreme to another.</p>
          <p>P. 564. The division of those who bear sway in a democracy <lb/>
            into three kinds: 1. The busy, bold, and active poor, who are <lb/>
            ready to undertake and execute any thing; 2. The idle and insig­ <lb/>
            nificant poor, who follow the former, and serve to make a number <lb/>
            and a noise in the popular assemblies; and 3. The middling sort, <lb/>
            who earn their bread by their labour, and have naturally little in­ <lb/>
            clination to public affairs, nor are easily brought together, but <lb/>
            when allured by the hopes of some gain, yet, when collected, are <lb/>
            the strongest party of all. The conversion of a demagogue into a <lb/>
            tyrant, from necessity and from fear, the steps which he takes to ' <lb/>
            attain the supreme power, the policy of tyrants, and the misery of <lb/>
            their condition, are excellently described.</p>
          <p>P. 568. The accusation of the tragic poets, as inspiring a love <lb/>
            of tyranny, and patronized by tyrants; they are encouraged also in <lb/>
            democracies, and are little esteemed in better governments.</p>

          <p>P. 544. The Cretan.] Lycurgus borrowed his constitution from that <lb/>
            of the Cretans, as Herodotus, Strabo, Plutarch, and other writers, allow; <lb/>
            and it is plain, that Plato thought it the best form of government that any <lb/>
            where existed, which seems indeed to have been the general opinion of <lb/>
            the greatest men in Greece.</p>
          <p>P. 547. Dwellers around and domestics.] The Lacedæmonians gave <lb/>
            the name of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Περίοικοι</foreign>, "Dwellers around," to their subjects, the inhabit­ <lb/>
            ants of Laconia, who were not Spartans. As they were used, I imagine, <lb/>
            hardly enough by their superiors, and had no share in the government, <lb/>
            many authors do not distinguish them from the Heliotæ, who were abso­ <lb/>
            lutely slaves ; yet, in reality, they seem to have been on a distinct footing, <lb/>
            being reckoned free men, and employed by the Spartan government to <lb/>
            command such troops as they often send abroad, consisting of Heliotae, to <lb/>
            whom they had given their liberty. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">Περίοικοι</foreign> likewise seem to <lb/>
            have had the property of lands, for when Lycurgus divided the country into <lb/>
            thirty thousand portions, and gave nine thousand of them to the Spartans, <lb/>
            to whom did the other twenty-one thousand portions belong, unless to <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Περίοικοι</foreign> ? who else should people the hundred cities, besides villages, <lb/>
            which were once in Laconia ? It is plain also, that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Περίοικοι</foreign> served <lb/>
            in war, as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὸπλ</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ται</foreign>, " heavy-armed foot," which the Heliotæ never did, <lb/>
            as we learn from Thucydides, iv. p. 238, and as in the battle of Platææ, <lb/>
            according to Herodotus in ix. 29, there were ten thousand Lacedæ­ <lb/>
            monians, of which five thousand were Spartans; it follows, that the other <lb/>
            five thousand were <foreign xml:lang="grc">Περίοικοι</foreign>; for he mentions the Heliotæ by themselves, <lb/>
            as light-armed troops in number thirty-five thousand, that is, seven to <lb/>
            each Spartan ; and Xenophon, in Lacedæmon. Republ. p. 2S9, and Græc. <lb/>
            Hist. i. p. 256, plainly distinguishes the ‘<foreign xml:lang="grc">Υπομείονες</foreign>, who were Spartans, <lb/>
            but excluded from the magistracy, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νεοδαμώδεις</foreign>, who were Heliotæ <note type="footnote"> 2 I 2 </note> <lb/>

          <p>P. 571. The worst and most lawless of our unnecessary desires <lb/>
            are described, which are particularly active in sleep, when we go <lb/>
            to our repose after drinking freely, or eating a full meal.</p>
          <p>P. 572. The transition of the mind from a democratic to a <lb/>
            tyrannical constitution. Debauchery, and what is called love, are <lb/>
            the great instruments of this change. Lust and drunkenness, <lb/>
            names for two different sorts of madness, between them produce a <lb/>
            tyrant.</p>
          <p>P. 573. Our desires from indulgence grow stronger and more <lb/>
            numerous. Extravagance naturally leads to want, which will be <lb/>
            supplied either by fraud or by violence.</p>
          <p>P. 575. In states in which there are but a few persons of this <lb/>
            turn, and the body of the people are uncorrupted, they usually <lb/>
            leave their own country, and enter into the guards of some foreign <lb/>
            prince, or serve him in his wars: or, if they have not this oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity, they stay at home and turn informers, false evidences, <lb/>
            highwaymen, and housebreakers, cut-purses, and such characters ; <lb/>
            but, if they are numerous and strong, they form a party against <lb/>
            the laws and liberties of the people, set at their head commonly <lb/>
            the worst among them, and erect a despotic government.</p>
          <p>The behaviour of a tyrannical nature in private life; unacquainted <lb/>
            with friendship, always domineering over, or servilely flattering, <lb/>
            his companions.</p>
          <p>P. 577. The comparison between a state enslaved, and the mind <lb/>
            of a tyrant. The servitude, the poverty, the fears, and the anguish <lb/>
            of such a mind are described; and it is proved to be the most <lb/>
            miserable of human creatures.</p>
          <p>P. 578. The condition of any private man of fortune, who has <lb/>
            fifty or more slaves. Such a man with his effects, wife and family, <lb/>
            supposed to be separated from the state and his fellow-citizens, in <lb/>
            which his security consists, and placed in a desert country at some <lb/>
            distance, surrounded with a people, who look upon it as a crime to <lb/>
            enslave one's fellow-creatures, and are ready to favour any con­ <lb/>
            spiracy of his servants against him: how anxious and how intoler­ <lb/>
            able would be his condition! Such, and still worse, is that of a <lb/>
            tyrant.</p>
          <p>P. 581. The pleasures of knowledge and of philosophy are <lb/>
             <pb n="485"/>
            proved to be superior to those which result from honour or from <lb/>
            gain; and from the satisfaction of our appetites. The wise man, <lb/>
            the ambitious man, the man of wealth and pleasure, will each of <lb/>
            them give the preference to his favourite pursuit, and will under- <lb/>
            value that of the others, but experience is the only proper judge <lb/>
            which can decide the question, and the wise man alone possesses <lb/>
            that experience; the necessity of his nature must have acquainted <lb/>
            him with the pleasure which arises from satisfying our appetites. <lb/>
            Honour and the public esteem will be the consequence of his life <lb/>
            and studies, as well as of the opulent or of the ambitious man ; so <lb/>
            that he is equally qualified with them to judge of their pleasures, <lb/>
            but not they of his, which they have never experienced.</p>
          <p>P. 584. Most of our sensual joys are only a cessation from <lb/>
            uneasiness and pain, as are the eager hopes and expectations <lb/>
            which attend them. A fine image is drawn of the ordinary life of <lb/>
            mankind, of their sordid pursuits, and of their contemptible <lb/>
            passions.</p>
          <p>P. 588. The recapitulation, and conclusion, that the height of <lb/>
            injustice and of wickedness is the height of misery.</p>
          <p>P. 590. The intention of all education and laws is to subject the <lb/>
            brutal part of our nature to the rational. A scheme of life, worthy <lb/>
            of a philosophic mind, is laid down.</p>

          <p>P. 578. Fifty slaves.] The more wealthy Greeks had very large fami­ <lb/>
            lies of slaves. In Athens the number of slaves was to that of citizens as <lb/>
            20 to 1: the latter being about 21,000 ; the former, 400,000. Mnaso of <lb/>
            Phocis, a friend of Aristotle, had 1000 slaves or more, as had likewise <lb/>
            Nicias, the famous Athenian. In Corinth, there were reckoned 460,000 <lb/>
            slaves; at Ægina, above 470,000; and many a Roman had in his own <lb/>
            service above 20,000: this was a computation made 01. 110, by Deme­ <lb/>

          <p>P. 595. Plato's apology for himself. His reasons for banishing <lb/>
            all imitative poetry from his republic: 1. Because it represents <lb/>
            things not as they really are, but as they appear; 2. The wisdom of <lb/>
            the poets is not equal to their reputation; 3. There is no example <lb/>
            of a state having been better regulated, or of a war better con­ <lb/>
            ducted, or of an art improved, by any poet s instructions; and 4. <lb/>

          <p>P. 602. Their art concurs with the senses to deceive us and to <lb/>
            draw off the mind from right reason, it excites and increases the <lb/>
            empire of the passions, enervates our resolution, and seduces us by <lb/>
            the power of ill example.</p>
          <p>P. 604. The passions and vices are easy to imitate by reason of <lb/>
            their variety; but the cool, uniform, and simple character of virtue <lb/>
            is very difficult to draw, so as to touch or delight a theatre, or any <lb/>
            other mixed assembly of men.</p>
          <p>P. 60/. The power of numbers and of expression over the soul <lb/>
            is great, which renders poetry more particularly dangerous.</p>
          <p>P. 608. Having shown that virtue is most eligible on its own <lb/>
            account, even when destitute of all external rewards, he now <lb/>
            comes to explain the happiness which waits upon it in another <lb/>
            life, as well as in the present. The immortality of the soul and a <lb/>
            state of future rewards and of future punishments are asserted.</p>

          <p>P. 595. Plato professes a great admiration, even from a child, for <lb/>
            Homer, but yet is forced to exclude him from his commonwealth, for a <lb/>
            man is not to be held in honour before truth. The Greeks had carried <lb/>
            their admiration for Homer to a high pitch-of enthusiasm in Plato's time : <lb/>
            it was he, they said, who first had formed Greece to knowledge and hu­ <lb/>
            manity ; and in him were contained all the arts, all morality, politics, and <lb/>
            divinity.</p>
          <p>P. 600. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Εἰς τέχνας</foreign>.] Thales is said to have discovered the annual <lb/>
            course of the sun in the ecliptic, and to have made several improvements <lb/>
            in astronomy and geometry. To Anacharsis is ascribed the invention of <lb/>
            anchors, and of the potter's wheel. See Diog. Laertius.</p>
          <p>P. 608. By Zeus, not I.] Is it possible that the immortality of the soul <lb/>
            should be a doctrine so unusual, and so little known at Athens, as to <lb/>
            cause this surprise in Glauco ?-Yet in the Phædo likewise, p. 70, Cebes <lb/>
            treats this point in the same manner.</p>

            on the funeral pile, came to life again, and related all he had seen in <lb/>

            of tyrants, and of others guilty of enormous crimes, in Tartarus, the <lb/>
            spindle of Necessity, which turns the eight spheres, and the employment <lb/>
            of her three daughters, the Fates, are all described, with the allotment <lb/>

            permitted to those spirits who are again to appear on earth ; as of Orpheus. <lb/>

          <p>THE persons of the dialogue are Clinias, a Cretan of Gnossus, <lb/>

            called Megillus, the other an Athenian, who is not named, but who <lb/>
            appears by the character and sentiments to be Plato himself. <lb/>
            See Diog. Laert. iii. 52. They are, all three, men far advanced in <lb/>
            years, and as they walk or repose themselves in the fields under <lb/>
            the shade of ancient cypress trees, which grew to a great bulk <lb/>
            and beauty, in the way that led from the city of Gnossus to the <lb/>
            temple and grotto of Jupiter, (where Minos was believed to have <lb/>
            received his laws from the god himself,) they enter into convers­ <lb/>

          <p>There is no proœmium nor introduction to the dialogue, as there <lb/>

            the time of the dialogue, and of the characters of the persons intro­ <lb/>
            duced in it. In reality the entire four first books of " the Laws" <lb/>

            and the less reasonable. An internal war is maintained in the <lb/>
            breast of each particular man, who labours to subdue himself by <lb/>
            establishing the empire of reason over his passions and his desires.</p>
          <p>' P. 628. A legislator, who makes it the great end of his con­ <lb/>
            stitution to form the nation to war, is shown to be inferior to him <lb/>
            . who reconciles the members of it among themselves, and prevents <lb/>
            intestine tumults and divisions.</p>
          <p>P. 631. The view of the true lawgiver is to train the mind and <lb/>
            manners of his people to the virtues in their order, that is, to <lb/>
            wisdom, to temperance, and to justice, and, in the fourth place, to <lb/>
            valour. The method he ought to lay down in the disposition of <lb/>
            his laws is stated.</p>
          <p>P. 634. The fault of the Cretan and of the Lacedæmonian laws <lb/>
            is, that they do not foitifv the soul as well against pleasure as <lb/>
            against pain. Youth is not permitted to examine into the rectitude <lb/>
            of those laws by which they are governed, nor to dispute about <lb/>
            them; this is the privilege of age, and only to be practised in <lb/>
            private.</p>
          <p>P. 636, § 8. The division of the citizens into companies, called <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ξυσσιτία</foreign>, which daily assembled to eat together in public, was apt <lb/>
            to create seditions and conspiracies. The regular naked exercises <lb/>
            of the youth were often the cause of an unnatural passion among <lb/>
            them. Crete and Lacedæmon are blamed particularly on this <lb/>
            account.</p>
          <p>P. 636, § 9. Pleasure and pain are the two great sources of all <lb/>
            human actions: the skill of a legislator consists in managing and <lb/>
            opposing one of them to the other.</p>
          <p>P. 639. The use of wine, when under a proper direction, in the <lb/>
            education of youth.</p>
          <p>P. 642. An apology for his own garrulity and diffuseness, which <lb/>
            is the characteristic of an Athenian.</p>
          <p>P. 643. The nature and intent of education.</p>
          <p>P. 644. Mankind are compared to puppets: but whether they <lb/>
            are formed by the gods for their diversion, or for some more serious <lb/>
            purpose, (he says,) is uncertain. Their pleasures and pains, their <lb/>
            hopes and fears, are the springs which move them, and often draw <lb/>
            contrary ways at once. Reason is the master-spring which ought <lb/>
            to determine their motions; but as this draws gently and never <lb/>
            uses violence, some of the passions must be called to its aid, which <lb/>
            may give it strength to resist the force of the others.</p>
          <p>P. 645. The effects of wine upon the soul: it heightens all our <lb/>
            passions and diminishes our understanding, that is, in reality, it <lb/>
            reduces us again to childhood. As physicians, for the sake of our <lb/>
            body, give us certain potions, which for a time create sickness and <lb/>
            pain in us, and put our whole frame into disorder; so possibly <lb/>
            might the legislator, by a singular experiment, make wine sub­ <lb/>
            servient to a good purpose in education, and, without either pain <lb/>
             <pb n="489"/>
            or danger, put the prudence, the modesty, and the temper of youth <lb/>
            to the trial, and see how far they could resist the disorder of the <lb/>
            mind which is naturally produced by this liquor.</p>
          <p>P. 647, § 14. The fear of dishonour is opposed to the fear of <lb/>
            pain; the first is a great instrument in the hands of a wise legis­ <lb/>
            lator to suppress and to conquer the latter.</p>
          <p>P. 647, § 15. If there were any drug or composition known that <lb/>
            would inspire us with fear and with dejection of spirits, for the <lb/>
            time its influence lasted, what need would there be of fatiguing our <lb/>
            youth with long laborious exercises, or of exposing them in battle <lb/>
            -to real danger, in order to fortify the soul against the attacks of <lb/>
            fear and of pain P This draught alone, properly applied, would be <lb/>
            a sufficient trial of our valour under the eye of the magistrate, who <lb/>
            might confer honour and disgrace on a youth, according to his <lb/>
            behaviour during the operation. Unluckily, there is no such drug <lb/>
            discovered; but there is a potion which exalts our spirits, and <lb/>
            kindles in the mind insolence, and imprudence, and lust, and every <lb/>
            fiercer passion, while it lays open to view our ignorance, our <lb/>
            avarice, and our cowardice. Why should we wait till these vices <lb/>
            exert themselves into real action, and produce their several mis­ <lb/>
            chiefs in society; when, by a well-regulated use of this liquor, we <lb/>
            might, without danger, discover them lurking in the disposition of <lb/>
            youth, and suppress them even in their infancy?</p>

          <p>P. 629. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διαβάντες δὲ εὖ</foreign>.] The Spartans, when they passed the frontier <lb/>
            of their own state to enter into the territory of an enemy, always per­ <lb/>
            formed sacrifice ; and if the victims proved inauspicious, they retired, and <lb/>
            gave over their enterprise.</p>
          <p>P. 630. Of the mercenaries.] In Plato's time, about 01. 106, and <lb/>
            soon after, the intestine tumults in the Greek cities, joined to a sort of <lb/>
            fashion, which prevailed, of going to seek their fortune in a foreign <lb/>
            service, had so depopulated Greece, that Isocrates tells Philip of Macedon, <lb/>
            that he might form a better and stronger army out of these mercenaries, <lb/>
            than he could out of the citizens themselves, who continued in their own <lb/>
            country. The strength of the Persian king's armies was entirely com­ <lb/>
            posed of these Greeks, as was that of his enemies also, the kings of Egypt <lb/>
            and of Cyprus, and the revolted viceroys in Asia Minor. They were also <lb/>
            employed by Athens, and by other states of Greece, to save their own <lb/>
            troops; so that the Athenian heavy-armed infantry now consisted of mer­ <lb/>
            cenaries, though the citizens themselves served as rowers on board the <lb/>
            fleet; just contrary to what had been the ancient practice, when the <lb/>
            ships were manned by foreigners and slaves, and the Athenians them­ <lb/>
            selves were the heavy-armed.</p>
          <p>P. 636. '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Επιτήδευμα</foreign>.] This seems to me to be the nominative, and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νόμιμον</foreign> the accusative ; and the sense will thus be, " This practice (of <lb/>
            exercising constantly naked) appears to me to have weakened greatly <lb/>
             <pb n="490"/>
            that ancient and natural law, by which the pleasures of love, not only <lb/>
            among human creatures, but even in the brute creation (mutually belong <lb/>
            to the two sexes)." This is a remarkable passage : and Tully judges in <lb/>
            the same manner of these exercises. How far the Cretans indulged their <lb/>
            passions in the way here mentioned, may be seen in Ephorus, quoted by <lb/>
            Strabo x. The purity of manners at Sparta is strongly asserted by Xeno­ <lb/>
            phon, De Lacedæmon. Republ. p. 395, and by Plutarch in Lycurgus ; but <lb/>
            here is a testimony on the other side at least of equal authority,</p>
          <p>P. 637. “<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ωσπερ ἐν ὰμαξαις</foreign>.] A sort of drunken farces performed in the <lb/>
            villages of Attica, during the Dionysia, which seem to be the origin of the <lb/>
            aucient comedy and tragedy. Hence the proverb, '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εξ ὰμαξης λέγειν</foreign> : and <lb/>
            hence, too, Aristophanes gives the name of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τραγῳδία</foreign> to comedy. A char­ <lb/>
            uenses, vs. 498, 499, and 627. They seem to have still continued in use <lb/>
            in the country.</p>
          <p>P. 642. The hearth of our city.] As each private family had its Vesta, <lb/>
            to whom the hearth was particularly sacred, so that of the public was <lb/>
            seated in the Prytaneum, as we learn from Pindar, Nem. Od. 11; where <lb/>
            in most cities a perpetual lamp was kept burning in honour of this god­ <lb/>
            dess : and as every private family of rank had their <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρόξενοι</foreign>, "public <lb/>
            hosts," in several cities of Greece, with whom they were connected by the <lb/>
            ties of hospitality, and in whose houses they were lodged and entertained, <lb/>
            so cities themselves had a like connexion with each other; and there were <lb/>
            public <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρόξενοι</foreign> nominated to receive and to defray the expenses of such <lb/>
            as came on business from other cities in alliance with them.</p>
          <p>P. 647. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αἰδω̃</foreign>.] This is, what we call honour, that is, the fear of shame; <lb/>
            and which is left to supply, as well as it can, the place of all the virtues <lb/>
            among us. Plato calls this sentiment, in p. 674, <foreign xml:lang="grc">θε</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ος φόβος</foreign>, " a divine <lb/>
            fear." Montesquieu makes it the grand principle of monarchical govern­ <lb/>
            ments, in L'Esprit des Loix, i. 6, and in France its effects are most con­ <lb/>
            spicuous.</p>

          <p>P. 653. The great purpose of a right education is, to fix in the <lb/>
            mind an early habit of associating its ideas of pleasure and of <lb/>
            desire with its ideas of virtue, and those of pain and aversion with <lb/>
            that of vice: so that reason, when it comes to maturity, and happy <lb/>
            are they with whom, even in their old age, it does come to ma­ <lb/>
            turity! may look back with satisfaction, and may approve the <lb/>
            useful prejudices instilled into the soul in its infancy.</p>
          <p>The early inclination of children to noise and motion is noticed, <lb/>
            which, when reduced to order and symmetry, produce harmony and <lb/>
            grace, which are two pleasures known only to humankind. The <lb/>
            origin of music and of the dance.</p>
          <p>P. 655. In what kind of imitation their true beauty consists. <lb/>
            Every sound or movement, or attitude, which naturally accom­ <lb/>
             <pb n="491"/>
            panics and expresses any virtue, or any laudable endowment of <lb/>
            mind and of body, is beautiful, as the contrary is deformed and <lb/>
            unpleasing. The error of such as make pleasure the sole end of <lb/>
            these arts.</p>
          <p>Reasons for the diversity of men's taste and judgment in them <lb/>
            are assigned. Some from having been early depraved, and little <lb/>
            accustomed to what is lovely, come to approve and take delight in <lb/>
            deformity: others applaud what is noble and graceful, but feel no <lb/>
            pleasure from it, either because their mind has a natural depravity <lb/>
            in it, though their education has been good, or because their <lb/>
            principles are right, but their habits and practice have not been <lb/>
            conformable to them. The danger of this last defect is stated, <lb/>
            when men delight in what their judgment disapproves.</p>
          <p>P. 657. The restraint, which ought to be laid on poets in all <lb/>
            well-disciplined states, is named. Musicians in Egypt1 were COIl­ <lb/>
            fined by law, even from the remotest antiquity, to certain simple <lb/>
            species of melody, and the painters and sculptors to some peculiar <lb/>
            standards for their measures arid attitudes, from which they were <lb/>
            not to deviate.</p>
          <p>P. 658. A reflection on the usual wrong determinations of the <lb/>
            persons appointed to judge of their musical and poetical entertain­ <lb/>
            ments at Athens, who, though they took an oath to decide im­ <lb/>
            partially, were biassed, either through fear or from the affectation of <lb/>
            popularity, by the opinion of the crowd; whereas they ought to <lb/>
            have considered themselves as masters and directors of the public <lb/>
            taste. From this weakness arose the corruption of their theatrical <lb/>
            entertainments. In Italy and in Sicily the victory was adjudged <lb/>
            by the whole audience to that poet who had the greatest number <lb/>
            of hands held up for him.</p>
          <p>P. 659. The manners, exhibited in a drama to the people, ought <lb/>
            always to be better than their own.</p>
          <p>P. 662. The morality inculcated by the poets, even in Sparta <lb/>
            and in Crete, where all innovations were by law forbidden, was <lb/>
            defective enough. What sentiments they ought to inspire. Plato's 2 <lb/>
            great principles are explained, namely, that happiness is insepar­ <lb/>
            able from virtue and misery from wickedness, and that the latter <lb/>
            is rather an error of the judgment than of the will.</p>
          <p>P. 663. If these opinions were actually as false, as they are <lb/>
            immutably founded on truth, yet a wise lawgiver would think <note type="footnote"> I This will account for the little improvement the Egyptians ever made <lb/>
            in the fine arts, though they were perhaps the inventors of them: for un­ <lb/>
            doubtedly the advancement and perfection of these things, as well as their <lb/>
            corruption, are entirely owing to liberty and innovation. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Aristotle looked upon this as the distinguishing part of Plato s doc­ <lb/>
            trine ; as we see from a fragment of his elegy to Eudemus, preserved in <lb/>
            Olympiodorus's commentary on the Gorgias. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="492"/>
            himself obliged to inculcate them as true, by every method <lb/>
            possible.</p>
          <p>It is easy to persuade men, even of the most absurd fiction; how <lb/>
            much more of an undoubted truth !</p>
          <p>P. 664. The institution of the three choruses, which are to <lb/>
            repeat in verse, accompanied with music and with dances, these <lb/>
            great principles of society, and to fix them in the belief of the <lb/>
            public: the first chorus is composed of boys under eighteen, and <lb/>
            sacred to the Muses; the second, from that age to thirty, and <lb/>
            sacred to Apollo; the third, to Bacchus, consisting of all from <lb/>
            thirty to sixty years of age.</p>
          <p>P. 666. The use of wine is forbidden to boys ; it is allowed, but <lb/>
            very moderately, to men under thirty; after that age, with less <lb/>
            restraint: the good effects of it in old age are mentioned.</p>
          <p>P. 667. The principles and qualifications which are required in <lb/>
            such as are fit to judge of poetry, and of the other imitative arts.</p>
          <p>P. 669. Instrumental music by itself, which serves not to <lb/>
            accompany the voice, is condemned, as uncertain and indefinite in <lb/>
            its expression. The three arts of poetry, of music, and of the <lb/>
            dance, (or action,) were not made to be separated.</p>
          <p>P. 671. The regulation of entertainments, with the manner of <lb/>
            presiding at them, is enforced; without which the drinking of wine <lb/>
            ought not to be permitted at all, or in a very small degree.</p>

          <p>P. 658. It is here said, that puppet-shows and jugglers' tricks are best <lb/>
            accommodated to the taste of young children ; as comedy is to that of <lb/>
            bigger boys, tragedy to that of young men, and of the women of the better <lb/>
            sort, and of the bulk of the people in general, and the rhapsodi to that of <lb/>

          <p>P. 676. The immense antiquity of the earth, and the innumerable <lb/>
            changes it has undergone in the course of ages. Mankind are <lb/>
            generally believed to have been often destroyed, a very small <lb/>
            remnant excepted, by inundation and by pestilence.</p>
          <p>The supposition of a handful of men, probably shepherds, who <lb/>
             <pb n="493"/>
            were feeding their cattle on the mountains, and were there preserv­ <lb/>
            ed with their families from a general deluge, which had over­ <lb/>
            whelmed all the cities and inhabitants of the country below.</p>
          <p>P. 677. The destruction of arts and sciences, with their slow <lb/>
            and gradual revival among this infant society, is nobly described.</p>
          <p>P. 680. The beginnings of government: the paternal way first <lb/>
            in use, which he calls the justest of all monarchies. Assemblies of <lb/>
            different families agree to descend from the mountain-tops, and to <lb/>
            settle in the hill-country below them; and as each of them has a <lb/>
            head or a prince of its own, and customs in which it has been <lb/>
            brought up, it will be necessary to describe certain laws in common, <lb/>
            and to settle a kind of senate, or of aristocracy.</p>
          <p>P. 683. The causes of the increase and declension of states, are <lb/>
            exemplified in the history of Sparta, Messene, and Argos. The <lb/>
            original league between the three kingdoms founded by the <lb/>
            Heraclidæ, and the mutual engagements entered into by the <lb/>
            several kings and by their people, are stated.</p>
          <p>P. 684. The easiness of establishing an equality of property in <lb/>
            a new conquest, which is so difficult for a legislator to accom­ <lb/>
            plish, who would give a better form to a government already estab­ <lb/>
            lished.</p>
          <p>P. 688. States are destroyed, not so much for the want of valour <lb/>
            and of conduct, as for the want of virtue, which only is true wisdom. <lb/>
            The greatest and the most pernicious of all ignorance is, when we <lb/>
            do not love what we approve.</p>
          <p>P. 691. Absolute power, unaccountable to any and uncontrolled, <lb/>
            is not to be supported by any mortal man. The aiming at this <lb/>
            was the destruction of the Argive and Messenian monarchs. That <lb/>
            which probably preserved the Lacedæmonian state, was the ori­ <lb/>
            ginally lodging the regal power in the hands of two; then the <lb/>
            institution of the senate by Lycurgus; and lastly, that of the <lb/>
            Ephori by Theopompus. Had the three kingdoms been united <lb/>
            and governed in the Spartan manner, the Persian king would never <lb/>
            have dared to invade Greece: his repulse was entirely due to the <lb/>
            Athenians and Lacedæmonians, and not to the common efforts <lb/>
            of the Greeks.</p>
          <p>P. 693. The two great forms of government, from which all the <lb/>
            rest are derived, are monarchy and democracy: Persia is an ex­ <lb/>
            ample of the first carried to its height, and Athens an example of <lb/>
            the latter. The best constitution is formed out of both.</p>
          <p>P. 694. The reason of the variations observable in the Persian <lb/>
            power is given; the different administration of different princes, <lb/>
            who succeeded one another, and the cause of it, is accounted for <lb/>
            from their education. The care of Cyrus's children, while he was <lb/>
            abroad in the field, was trusted entirely to the women, who bred <lb/>
            them up in high notions of that grandeur to which they were to <lb/>
            succeed, and in the effeminate and luxurious manners of the Medes. <lb/>
             <pb n="494"/>
            Darius, who succeeded them, had been bred as a private soldier, <lb/>
            and he restored the declining empire to its former greatness. <lb/>
            Xerxes, his son, brought up as great princes usually are, by his <lb/>
            folly weakened it again, and ever since it has been growing worse <lb/>
            and worse.</p>
          <p>P. 696. Honour is the proper reward of virtue only; in what <lb/>
            manner it ought to be distributed in a well-regulated state.</p>
          <p>P. 697. The impossibility is stated of any government's sub­ <lb/>
            sisting long, where the people are enemies to the administration, <lb/>
            which, where despotism in its full extent prevails, must always be <lb/>
            the case.</p>
          <p>P. 698. A picture of the reverse of this, a complete democracy, <lb/>
            as at Athens. The constitution of that state was different before <lb/>
            the Persian invasion. The reasons for their distinguished bravery <lb/>
            on that occasion. An account of the change introduced in their <lb/>
            music, and the progress of liberty, or rather of licence, among <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>P. 701. The great aim of a legislator is to inspire liberty, wisdom, <lb/>
            and concord. Clinias, being appointed with nine other citizens to <lb/>
            superintend and to form a body of laws for a new colony they are <lb/>
            going to settle, asks advice of the Athenian and Lacedæmonian <lb/>
            strangers on that head.</p>

          <p>P. 704. The advantages and disadvantages arising from the <lb/>
            situation of a city, and the great difficulty of preserving the con­ <lb/>
            stitution and the morals of a maritime and trading state, are <lb/>
            described.</p>
          <p>P. 706. The manner of carrying on a war by sea is unworthy of <lb/>
            a brave and free people; it impairs their valour, depends too much <lb/>
            on the lower and more mechanic arts, and is hardly ever decisive. <lb/>
            The battles of Artemisium and of Salamis could not have pre­ <lb/>
             <pb n="495"/>
            served Greece, as it has been commonly thought, from the Persians, <lb/>
            had they not been defeated in the action at Platææ.</p>
          <p>P. 768. The difficulties which attend new colonies, if sent out by <lb/>
            a single city, are stated: they will more hardly submit to a new <lb/>
            discipline, and to laws different from those of their native country: <lb/>
            but then they concur more readily in one design, and act with <lb/>
            more strength and uniformity among themselves. If they are <lb/>
            collected from various states, they are weak and disjointed, but <lb/>
            more apt to receive such forms and impressions as a legislator <lb/>
            would give them.</p>
          <p>The constitution of states and of their laws is owing more to <lb/>
            nature, or to chance, or to the concurrence of various accidents, <lb/>
            ithan to human foresight: yet the wise lawgiver will not therefore <lb/>
            idespair, but will accommodate his art to the various circumstances <lb/>
            and opportunities of things. The mariner cannot command the <lb/>
            winds and the waves, yet he can watch his advantages, and make <lb/>
            the best use possible of both, for the expedition and security of <lb/>
            )his voyage.</p>
          <p>P. 709. The greatest advantage which a lawgiver can ever meet <lb/>
            with is, when he is supported by an arbitrary prince, young, sober, <lb/>
            and of good understanding, generous and brave; the second lucky <lb/>
            (opportunity is, when he can find a limited monarch of like dispo­ <lb/>
            sition to concur in his designs; the third is, when he can unite <lb/>
            himself to the leading men in some popular government; and the <lb/>
            fourth and most difficult is, in an oligarchy.</p>
          <p>P. 711. The character and manners of a whole people, in a <lb/>
            despotic government, are easily changed by the encouragement and <lb/>
            by the example of their prince.</p>
          <p>P. 712. The best governments are of a mixed kind, and are not <lb/>
            reducible to any of the common forms. Thus those of Crete and <lb/>
            of Sparta were neither tyrannical, nor monarchical, nor aristo­ <lb/>
            cratical, nor democratical, but had something of all these.</p>
          <p>P. 713. The fable of the Saturnian age is introduced, when the <lb/>
            gods or daemons in person reigned over mankind. No mortal <lb/>
            nature is fit to be trusted with an absolute power of commanding <lb/>
            its fellow-creatures: and therefore the law, that is, pure reason, <lb/>
            divested of all human passions and appetites, the part of man <lb/>
            which most resembles the divinity, ought alone to be implicitly <lb/>
            obeyed in a well-governed state.</p>
          <p>P. 715. The first address to the citizens of the new colony, is to <lb/>
            inculcate the belief of providence and of divine justice, humility, <lb/>
            moderation, obedience to the laws, and piety to the gods and to <lb/>
            parents: this should be by way of proœmium to the laws; for free­ <lb/>
            men are not to be treated like slaves; they are to be taught and to <lb/>
            be persuaded, before they are threatened and punished.</p>

          <p>P. 704. The great advantage of a maritime power with respect to its <lb/>
            influence, its commerce and riches, its politeness of manners and language, <lb/>
            and the enjoyment of every pleasure and convenience of life, are ad. <lb/>
            mirably explained by Xenophon in Athen. Republ. p. 204, who considers <lb/>
            it in every light, in which Montesquieu and the best modern <unclear>politica</unclear> <lb/>
            writers would do. But Plato extended his views farther. He never re­ <lb/>
            garded statesmanship as the art of preserving mankind in a certain form <lb/>
            of society, or of securing their property or their pleasures, or of enlarging <lb/>
            their power, unless so far as all these were consistent with the preserv­ <lb/>
            ation of their virtue, and of that happiness which is the natural result ol <lb/>
            it. Isocrates, in Panathen. p. 256, is constrained to own, that wher <lb/>
            Athens became a great naval power, she was forced to sacrifice her good <lb/>
            order and morals to her ambition; although he justifies her for doing so <lb/>
            from necessity; but in the Orat. on Peace, p. 174, he speaks his mind <lb/>
            more freely, and shows that the dominion of the sea was every way the <lb/>
            ruin of the Athenians, and afterwards of the Lacedæmonians.</p>
          <p>P. 714. Conducive to the continuance of its own power.] This was <lb/>
            the doctrine of Thrasymachus, and it is in appearance that of Montesquieu <lb/>
            in his Esprit des Loix; but this great man did not dare to speak his mind, <lb/>
            in a country almost despotically governed, without disguise. Let any <lb/>
            one see the amiable picture which Montesquieu draws of freer govern­ <lb/>
            ments, and, in contrast to it, his idea of a court, and they will not be at <lb/>
            a loss to know his real sentiments.. That constitution and policy which <lb/>
            is founded, as he says himself, on every virtue, must be the only one <lb/>
            worthy of human nature.</p>

          <p>P. 726. After showing the reason of that duty, which men owe <lb/>
            to the gods and to their parents, he comes to that, which we owe to <lb/>
            ourselves; and first, of the reverence due to our own soul; that it <lb/>
            consists not in flattering its vanity, nor indulging its pleasures, nor <lb/>
            in soothing its indolence, nor in satisfying its avarice.</p>
          <p>P. 723. The second honours are due to our body, whose per­ <lb/>
            fection is not placed in excess of strength, of bulk, of swiftness, of <lb/>
            beauty, nor even of health, but in a mediocrity of all these qualities; <lb/>
            for a redundancy, or a deficiency, in any one of them is always <lb/>
            prejudicial to the mind.</p>
          <p>The same holds with regard to fortune. The folly of heaping <lb/>
             <pb n="497"/>
            up riches for our children is exposed, as the only valuable inherit­ <lb/>
            ance which we can leave them is a respect for virtue. The rever­ <lb/>
            ence due to youth is inculcated. True education consists not in <lb/>
            precept, but in example.</p>
          <p>The duty to relations and to friends : strict justice, hospitality, <lb/>
            and compassion, are due to strangers and foreigners, but above all <lb/>
            to suppliants.</p>
          <p>What is that habit of the mind which best becomes a man of <lb/>
            honour and a good citizen. Veracity is the prime virtue. Justice <lb/>
            consists in this; not only to do no injury, but to prevent others <lb/>
            from doing any, and to assist the magistrate in punishing those who <lb/>
            commit them. Temperance and wisdom : the persons who possess <lb/>
            these or any other virtues deserve our praise; those who impart <lb/>
            them to others, and multiply their influence, are worthy of double <lb/>
            honours. The use of emulation in a state: the hatefulness of envy <lb/>
            and detraction.</p>
          <p>P. 731. Spirit and indignation are virtues, when employed <lb/>
            against crimes and vices, which admit of no other cure than ex­ <lb/>
            treme severity: yet they are not inconsistent with lenity and tender <lb/>
            compassion, when we consider that no man is voluntarily wicked, <lb/>
            and that the fault is in his understanding, and not in his intention. <lb/>
            The blindness of what is called self-love. Excessive joy and <lb/>
            sorrow, are equally condemned.</p>
          <p>P. 733. A life of virtue is preferable to any other, even with <lb/>
            respect to its pleasures. This passage is admirable.</p>
          <p>P. 736. The method of purgation requisite in forming a society, <lb/>
            in order to clear it of its noxious parts, either by punishments, or <lb/>
            by sending out colonies.</p>
          <p>P. 737. The number of citizens limited. Equal divisions of <lb/>
            lands among them. The institution of temples and sacred rites, <lb/>
            in which nothing of novelty is to be permitted nor the slightest <lb/>
            alteration made; but ancient opinions and traditions are to be <lb/>
            religiously followed. Festivals and general assemblies serve to <lb/>
            familiarize the citizens to one another, and to bring the whole <lb/>
            people acquainted with the temper and character of each par­ <lb/>
            ticular man.</p>
          <p>P. 739. The recommendation of his first scheme of government <lb/>
            laid down in his Republica, v., p. 462, in which all things are in <lb/>
            common ; and the whole state, their possessions, their families, <lb/>
            their passions, are so united as that they may all act together, like <lb/>
            the faculties of a single person. The present scheme comes next <lb/>
            to it in perfection.</p>
          <p>The number of the shares allotted to the citizens is never to be <lb/>
            diminished nor increased. Each man is to choose one among his <lb/>
            sons who is to succeed to his portion; the rest to be given in adop­ <lb/>
            tion to those who have none of their own. The supreme magistrate <note type="footnote">VOL. VI. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 K </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="498"/>
            is to preside over this equality, and to preserve it. If the number <lb/>
            of children exceed the number of shares, he may send out a colony; <lb/>
            if it fall short, he may, in cases of great necessity, introduce the <lb/>
            sons of foreigners. No alienation of lands to be permitted.</p>
          <p>P. 741. The increase of fortune by commerce is to be prohibited, <lb/>
            and the use of gold or silver small money, of a species not valued, <lb/>
            nor in request with other people, only permitted for the ordinary <lb/>
            uses of life. The common coin of Greece is to be in the hands of <lb/>
            the public, or employed only on occasion of an embassy, or of an <lb/>
            expedition into foreign states. No private person may go abroad <lb/>
            without leave of the government; and if he bring back with him <lb/>
            any foreign money, he must deposit it in the hands of the <lb/>
            magistrate, or he, and all who are privy to the concealment, shall <lb/>
            forfeit twice the value and incur disgrace.</p>
          <p>P. 742. No securities shall be given among citizens in any case; <lb/>
            no fortune paid on a marriage; no money lent on interest.</p>
          <p>The folly of a legislator who thinks of making a great, a flourish­ <lb/>
            ing, a rich, and a happy state, without regard to the virtue of the <lb/>
            inhabitants.</p>
          <p>P. 743. The inconsistency of great wealth and of great virtue. <lb/>
            The good men will never acquire any thing by unjust means, nor <lb/>
            ever refuse to be at any expense on decent and honest occasions. <lb/>
            He, therefore, who scruples not to acquire by fair and by unfair <lb/>
            means, and will be at no expense on any occasion, must naturally <lb/>
            be thrice as rich as the former. A good man will not lavish all he <lb/>
            has in idle pleasures and prodigality; he will not therefore be very <lb/>
            poor. Business and acquisition ought to employ no more of our <lb/>
            time than may be spared from the improvement of our mind and <lb/>
            of our body.</p>
          <p>P. 744. A colony cannot be formed of men perfectly equal in point <lb/>
            of fortune: it will be therefore necessary to divide the citizens into <lb/>
            classes according to their circumstances, that they may pay impo­ <lb/>
            sitions to the public service in proportion to them. The wealthier <lb/>
            members are also, cæteris paribus, to be preferred before others to <lb/>
            offices and dignities of expense; which will bring every one's <lb/>
            fortune gradually to a level.</p>
          <p>Four such classes to be instituted: the first worth the value of <lb/>
            his land; the fourth, four times as much. Above or below this <lb/>
            proportion no one is to go, on pain of forfeiture and disgrace: <lb/>
            therefore, the substance of every man is to be publicly enrolled, <lb/>
            under the inspection of a magistracy.</p>
          <p>P. 745. The division of the country. Every man's lot is to <lb/>
            consist of two half-shares, the one near the city, the other near the <lb/>
            frontier: every one also is to have two houses, likewise within the <lb/>
            city, the one near the midst of it, the other near the walls. The <lb/>
            country is to be divided into twelve tribes, and the city into as <lb/>
             <pb n="499"/>
            many regions; and each of them to be dedicated to its several <lb/>
            divinity.</p>
          <p>P. 746. An apology for this scheme, which to some will seem <lb/>
            impracticable.</p>
          <p>P. 747. The great difference of climates and of situations, and <lb/>
            the sensible effects which they produce, not on the bodies alone, <lb/>
            but on the souls of men, are stated.</p>
          <p>[It is matter of just but unavailing regret that Mr. Gray pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded no further in his analysis and annotations on the books of <lb/>
            Plato De Legibus. The editor had once intended to endeavour <lb/>
            to analyse the remaining five books; but, on the maturest con­ <lb/>
            sideration, a respect for the reader and for the memory of Mr. <lb/>
            Gray prevented his attempting to offer any writing of his own, as <lb/>
            a continuation of the work of so great and so consummate a <lb/>
            master.</p>
          <p>Perhaps, indeed, the reader may be inclined to consider this <lb/>
            fragment in that point of view in which the elder Pliny, in lan­ <lb/>
            guage of refined eloquence, speaks of some productions of ancient <lb/>
            art, as peculiarly interesting from the very circumstance of their <lb/>
            being left unfinished; " In lenocinio commendationis dolor est <lb/>

          <p>DIOGENES Laertius, who lived probably about the time of <lb/>
            Septimius Severus, in the catalogue he gives us of Plato's works, <lb/>
            counts thirteen epistles, and enumerates their titles, by which they <lb/>
            appear to be the same as those which we now have. Yet we are <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>This letter is not from Plato, but from his favourite scholar, the <lb/>
            famous Dion; nor is it possible that the philosopher himself could <lb/>
            have any hand in it, he being with Dionysius at Syracuse, as he <lb/>
            tells us himself, when Dion was forced away, and continuing there <lb/>
            some time after. It is sent by Baccheus, who had conducted Dion <lb/>
            on his way, together with a sum of money, which Dionysius had <lb/>
            ordered to be given to him for his expenses, which he returns to <lb/>
            the tyrant with much contempt. The spirit of it and the senti­ <lb/>
            ments are not amiss; and yet it is not very consistent with the <lb/>
            indignation which Dion must have felt, and with the suddenness <lb/>
            of the occasion, to end his letter with three scraps of poetry, <lb/>
            though never so well applied. To say the truth, I much doubt of <lb/>
            this epistle, and the more so as it contradicts a fact in Plutarch, <lb/>
            who assures us that at the very time when Dion was hurried <lb/>
            away, his friends were permitted to load two ships with his wealth <lb/>
            and furniture, and to transport them to him in Peloponnesus; <lb/>
            besides which, his revenues were regularly remitted to him, till <lb/>
            Plato went into Sicily for the last time, which was at least six <lb/>
            years after.</p>

          <p>This epistle appears to have been written soon after Plato's <lb/>
            return from his third voyage to Syracuse, and the interview which <lb/>
            he had with Dion at the Olympic games, which he himself men­ <lb/>
            tions, Epist. vii. p. 350, and in this place also. Archedemus, who <lb/>
            brought the letter from Dionysius, and returned with this answer, <lb/>
            was a friend and follower of Archytas, the Pythagorean of Taren­ <lb/>
            turn, as stated in Epist. vii. p. 339, p. 521, but was himself probably <lb/>
            a Syracusan; at least he had a house in that city where Plato was <lb/>
            lodged, after he had been turned out of the citadel, as shown in <lb/>
            p. 349. He was sent on board a ship of war, with Diony­ <lb/>
            sius's letters of invitation to Plato, wherein he pressed him to <lb/>
            come the third time into Sicily, as a person well known and much <lb/>
            esteemed by the philosopher, and he is mentioned as present in the <lb/>
            gardens of the palace at an interview which Plato had with <lb/>
            Dionysius, about three weeks before he returned home again. <lb/>

          <p>This epistle, like those to the friends of Dion afterwards, was <lb/>
            apparently written to be made public, and is a justification of <lb/>
            Plato's conduct, as well as an invective against the cruelty and <lb/>
            falsehood of Dionysius. The beginning of the letter is a reproach, <lb/>
            the more keen for being somewhat disguised; and in the rest of <lb/>
            it he observes no longer any measures with the tyrant: whence I <lb/>
            conclude that it was written after Dion's expedition against him <lb/>
            was professedly begun, and perhaps after his entry into Syracuse, <lb/>
            particularly from p. 315, But now that I have taught Dion to <lb/>

          <p>Perdiccas, the second son of Amyntas, succeeded to the crown <lb/>
            of Macedon, after the death of his brother-in-law, Ptolemy of <lb/>
            Alorus, 01. 103, 4. There seem to have been ancient ties of <lb/>
            hospitality and of friendship between the royal family of Macedon, <lb/>
            from Archelaus's time, and the principal literati of Athens. Plato <lb/>
            here recommends his friend and scholar, Euphræus, a native of <lb/>
            Oreus in Eubœa, to be of Perdiccas's council, and his secretary. <lb/>
            He grew into the highest favour with Perdiccas, and was trusted <lb/>
            with the entire management of all his affairs. He used his power <lb/>
            arbitrarily enough. Caristius, of Pergamus, quoted by Athenæus, <lb/>
            xi. p. 506, and 508, gives the following instance of it, that he <lb/>
            would not suffer any one to sit at the king's table who was ignor­ <lb/>
            ant of geometry or of philosophy. And yet to Plato and to <lb/>
            Euphræus did the great Philip of Macedon owe his succession to <lb/>
            the kingdom, as Speusippus writes in a letter to Philip reproach­ <lb/>
            ing him with his ingratitude, for by them was his brother Perdiccas <lb/>
            persuaded to bestow on him some districts as an appanage, where, <lb/>
            after his death, Philip was enabled to raise troops and to recover <lb/>
            the kingdom. Euphræus, upon the death of his master, having <lb/>
             <pb n="502"/>
            rendered himself hateful to the principal Macedonians, was <lb/>
            obliged, as it seems, to retire into his own country; where, soon <lb/>
            after Philip was settled on the throne, Parmenio was ordered to <lb/>
            murder him.</p>
          <p>Ficinus and H. Stephanus, finding in the margin of some <lb/>
            manuscripts this fifth epistle ascribed to Dion and not to Plato, <lb/>
            seem inclined to admit that correction, but without reason. Plato <lb/>
            has in his other undoubted epistles spoken of himself, as he has <lb/>
            done in this, in the third person. He is here apologizing for his <lb/>
            recommendation of a man who was to have a share in the ad­ <lb/>
            ministration of a kingdom. Some may object, says he, " How <lb/>
            should Plato be a competent judge, he who has never meddled in <lb/>
            the government of his own country, nor thought himself fit to <lb/>
            advise his own citizens ? " He answers this by showing his reasons <lb/>
            for such a conduct; but the last sentence is not at all clear. The <lb/>
            thought is the very same with that in the 7th Epistle, p. 330, but <lb/>
            some principal word seems to be omitted; perhaps after <foreign xml:lang="grc">δρᾶσαι</foreign> av <lb/>

          <p>This letter, cited by Clemens Alexandrinus in Strom. v., and <lb/>
            by Origen contra Celsum vi., Menage, in Diog. Laert. iii., tells us is <lb/>
            no longer extant among the epistles of Plato, and is supposed to be <lb/>
            a fiction of the Christians. Bentley, in Phileluther. Lips., had <lb/>
            reason to wonder at the negligence of that critic, who did not <lb/>
            know that the epistle was still preserved: and he adds, that there <lb/>
            is no cause to believe the letter not to be genuine, as there are <lb/>
            passages in the Dialogues themselves as favourable to the Chris­ <lb/>
            tian opinions as any thing in this epistle. The passage which <lb/>
            those Fathers cite is at the end of the letter, and has indeed much <lb/>
            the air of a forgery. I do not know any passages in the Dialogues <lb/>
            equally suspicious ; nor do I see why it might not be tacked to the <lb/>
            end of an undoubtedly original letter: there is nothing else here <lb/>
            but what seems genuine.</p>
          <p>Erastus and Coriscus were followers of Plato, and born at <lb/>
            Scepsis, a city of Troas, seated on Mount Ida, not far from the <lb/>
            sources of the Scamander and of the Æsepus; they seem to have <note type="footnote"> 1 See Strabo, xiii. p. 602, and 607. The Coriscus here mentioned has a. <lb/>
            son called Neleus, a follower of Aristotle and a particular friend of Theo­ <lb/>
            phrastus, who left his library, in which was contained all that Aristotle had <lb/>
            ever written, in the original manuscript, to him when he died. It continued <lb/>
            in the possession of his family at Scepsis, about one hundred and fifty years, <lb/>
            when Apellicon of Teos purchased and transferred it to Athens, whence, <lb/>
            soon after, Sylla carried it to Rome. </note> <lb/>

            attained a principal authority in their little state, and Plato recom­ <lb/>
            mends to them here to- cultivate the friendship of Hermias their <lb/>
            neighbour, and sovereign of Assus and Atarneus, two strong towns <lb/>
            on the coast of the Sinus Adramyttenus near the foot of Ida. <lb/>
            Coriscus had also been scholar to Plato, though an eunuch, and <lb/>
            slave to Eubulus, a Bithynian and a banker. His master, having <lb/>
            found means to erect a little principality in the places before men­ <lb/>
            tioned, made Hermias his heir. He gave his niece Pythias in <lb/>
            marriage to Aristotle, who lived with him near three years, till 01. <lb/>
            107, 4, about which time Memnon, the Rhodian general to the <lb/>
            Persian king, by a base treachery got him into his hands, and <lb/>
            sending him to court he was there hanged. See Strabo xiii. p. 610, <lb/>
            and Suidas. Aristotle wrote his epitaph, and a beautiful ode or <lb/>

          <p>Callippus, after the treacherous murder of Dion, was attacked <lb/>
            in Syracuse by the friends of that great man, but they were worst­ <lb/>
            ed by him and his party; and being driven out they fled to the <lb/>
            Leontini, and he maintained his power in the city for thirteen <lb/>
            months, as we learn from Diodor. Sic. xvi. 36; until Hipparinus, <lb/>
            nephew to Dion, and half-brother to Dionysius, found means to <lb/>
            assemble troops; and while Callippus was engaged in the siege of <lb/>
            Catana, he, at the head of Dion's party, re-entered Syracuse, and <lb/>
            kept possession of it for two years. At the end of which time, <lb/>
            Hipparinus in a drunken debauch was assassinated, but by whom <lb/>
            I do not find; and his younger brother, Nyssæus, succeeded to his <lb/>
            power, and made the most arbitrary use of it for near five years; <lb/>
            when Dionysius, returning from Locri, as stated by Plutarch in the <lb/>
            Life of Timoleon, became once more master of Syracuse, and, as it <lb/>
            seems, put Nyssæus to death.</p>
          <p>Who were the friends of Dion to whom Plato writes, it is hard <lb/>
            to enumerate. The principal were his son Hipparinus, and his <lb/>
            sister's son, likewise called Hipparinus, and his brother, Megacles, <lb/>
            if living, though I rather imagine he had been killed in the course <lb/>
            of the war before the death of Dion; and Nicetas, who afterwards <lb/>
            was tyrant of the Leontines.</p>
          <p>Plato was about forty years of age when first he came to <lb/>

          <p>P. 324. Relations and acquaintances.] Critias, a man as remarkable <lb/>
            for the brightness of his parts as for the depravity of his manners and <lb/>
            for the hardness of his heart, was Plato's second cousin by the mother's <lb/>
            side; and Charmides, the son of Glauco, was his uncle, brother to his <lb/>
            mother Perictione.. The first was one of the Thirty, the latter one of the <lb/>
            Ten, and both were slain in the same action. Plato's family were <lb/>
            deeply engaged in the oligarchy; for Callæschrus, as we learn from <lb/>
            Lysias in Eratosthen. p. 215, his great-uncle, had been a principal man <lb/>
            in the Council of Four Hundred. (01. 92, 1.) It is a strong proof of <lb/>
            Plato's honesty and resolution, that his nearest relations could not seduce <lb/>
            him to share in their power or in their crimes at that age. His uncle, <lb/>
            though a great friend of Socrates and of a very amiable character, had <lb/>
            not the same strength of mind. <lb/>
            lb. Against one of the citizens.] The Thirty, during the short time <lb/>
            of their magistracy, which was less than a year, put fifteen hundred per­ <lb/>
            sons to death, as we learn from Isocrates in Areopag. p. 153, most of <lb/>
            whom were innocent, and they obliged about five thousand more to By. <lb/>
            The prisoner here meant was Leo, the Salaminian. See Apolog. p. 32,</p>
          <p>P. 328. And not as some imagined.] Plato had been most severely <lb/>
            reflected upon for passing his time at the court of Dionysius. Athenæus, <lb/>
            whose book is highly valuable for the numberless fragments of excellent <lb/>
            authors, now lost, of which it is composed, has preserved abundance of <lb/>
            scandal on this head, in xi. p. 507. This and the third Epistle are <lb/>
            Plato's justification of himself, and are written with a design to clear his <lb/>
            character.</p>
          <p>P. 342.] I know not what to say to this very uncommon opinion <lb/>
            of Plato, that no philosopher should put either his system, or the method <lb/>
            of attaining to a knowledge of it, into writing. The arguments he <lb/>
            brings in support of it are obscure beyond my comprehension. All I <lb/>
            conceive is, that he means to show how inadequate words are to express <lb/>
            our ideas, and how poor a representation even our ideas are of the <lb/>
            essence of things. What he says on the bad effects which a half-strained <lb/>
            and superficial knowledge produces in ordinary minds, is certainly very <lb/>
            just and very fine. See the Phædrus, p. 274—276, where he compares <lb/>
            all written arts to the gardens of Adonis, which look gay and verdant, but, <lb/>
            having no depth of earth, soon wither away. Lord Bacon, in Nov. Organ. <lb/>
            i. 43 and 59, expresses himself strongly on this head. See Book i. App. <lb/>

            country which lies round the Bay of Naples. See Aristot. Politic, viii. <lb/>
            10. In a passage cited from Aristotle by Dionys. Halic. i. p. 57, he seems <lb/>
            to extend the name to all the inhabitants of that coast to the south of the <lb/>
            Tuscans. Aristotle mentions the Opici as the same people with the Ausones. <lb/>
            But Polybius judged them to be a distinct people. See Strabo, v. p. 242. <lb/>
            The Siculi probably might speak the same tongue, having been driven out <lb/>
            of Italy, as we learn from Thucyd. vi., by these Opici some years after the <lb/>
            Trojan war, and settling in a part of this island. This name grew into a <lb/>
            term of reproach, which the more polished Greeks bestowed upon the <lb/>
            Romans, as Cato the censor complains in Pliny, xxix. 1, "Nos quoque <lb/>
            dictant barbaros, et spurcius nos quam alios Opicos appellatione fœdant;” <lb/>
            and in time it became a Latin word to signify barbarous and illiterate.</p>
          <p>P. 355. My own son.] This directly contradicts both Plutarch and <lb/>
            Cornelius Nepos, who particularly describe the tragical end of Hip­ <lb/>
            parinus, Dion's son, when just arrived at man's estate. All that story, <lb/>
            and the apparition which preceded it, must be false, if this epistle be <lb/>
            genuine, which I see no reason, but this, for doubting. The only way to <lb/>
            reconcile the matter is, by supposing that Plato might here mean the <lb/>
            infant soil of Dion, who was born after his father's death; and who was <lb/>
            not yet destroyed by Hicetas, for Plutarch intimates, that he continued <lb/>
            to treat both the child and its mother well for a considerable time after <lb/>
            the expulsion of Callippus. What makes against this supposition is, that <lb/>
            in the end of this letter, p. 357, he speaks of Dion's son, as of a <lb/>
            person fit to judge of, and to approve, the scheme of government which <lb/>
            he has proposed to all parties.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>In order of time this is the second epistle in the collection. It <lb/>
            is marked in the MSS. as spurious, and, I must own, it does <lb/>
            little honour to Plato's memory; yet it is sure that Plutarch <lb/>
            esteemed it genuine. He cites T. i. p. 966, E., a passage from it <lb/>
            relating to Areté, the wife of Dion; and in T. ii. p. 474, D., he <lb/>
            mentions the character of Helico the Cyzicenian, which is to be <lb/>
            found here. I know not what to determine; unless we suppose <lb/>
            some parts of it to be inserted afterwards by some idle sophist who­ <lb/>
            was an enemy to Plato's character. It is observable, that Plutarch, <lb/>
            in the place last mentioned, says it was written at the end of the <lb/>
            epistle, whereas the words alluded to are here not far from the <lb/>
            beginning. Possibly some fragments of the true epistle might <lb/>
            remain, which were patched together and supplied by some trifler.</p>
