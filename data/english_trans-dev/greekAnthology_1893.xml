          <p>OF all the remains of Greek literature, the most remarkable <lb/>
            is that which passes. under the name of the Anthology. It <lb/>
            n 3t only ranges over a longer period of time than can be as­ <lb/>
            signed to any other, but it likewise exhibits the productions <lb/>
            of poets, philosophers, and historians in their lighter hours; <lb/>
            while the names even of princes are found in the company <lb/>
            of those who have left no memorials of themselves except <lb/>
            as the writers of Epigrams.</p>
          <p>For the preservation of different portions of the fugitive <lb/>
            poetry of Greece we are indebted to a variety of authors, men­ <lb/>
            tioned by Jacobs in the Prolegomena to his edition of the <lb/>
            Anthologia, p. 34—90. But the principal labourer in " Flower <lb/>
            Collecting "—for such is the literal meaning of Anthology­ <lb/>
            was Meleager, a poet of Gadara, who flourished under the <lb/>
            last of the Seleucidæ, about 96 B. c., and culled his " Gar­ <lb/>
            land " from the works of forty-six of his predecessors, and <lb/>
            from not a few of his contemporaries; to these he added many <lb/>
            of his own, which are at least equal, if not superior, to any <lb/>
            in the collection.</p>
          <p>To Meleager succeeded Philip of Thessalonica, who gave <lb/>
            a supplement of Epigrams, obtained from thirteen writers not <lb/>
            mentioned by Meleager. The next collector was Stratoof Sar­ <lb/>
            dis, who directed his chief attention to poems of an amatory <lb/>
            cast, and those too not the most delicate. From this, COIl­ <lb/>
            stantine Oephalas. a friend and relation of the emperor leo, <lb/>
             <pb n="iv"/>
            made a selection, containing one hundred and sixty-five Epi­ <lb/>
            grams. After an interval of some four or five centuries ap­ <lb/>
            peared the collection made by Agathias of Myrine, entitled <lb/>
            " A Circle of Epigrams which he arranged under seven <lb/>
            different heads, instead of retaining the previous alphabetical <lb/>
            order.</p>
          <p>Of all these collections not one has come down to us in an <lb/>
            entire state; and even the fragments still extant would in <lb/>
            all probability have perished, had not Constantine Cephalas <lb/>
            collected and united them. From his MS. a transcript was <lb/>
            made, which is supposed to be the one formerly at Heidel­ <lb/>
            berg, and which, after being carried to Rome in 1623, and <lb/>
            subsequently to Paris, has at length found its way back to its <lb/>
            original depository.</p>
          <p>The last collector was Maximus Planudes, a monk of Con­ <lb/>
            stantinople ; who, in the early part of the 14th century, abridged <lb/>
            the collection made by Constantine Cephalas, and rejected the <lb/>
            indelicate Epigrams; but as he has, on the other hand, pre­ <lb/>
            served many relating to matters of Art, which are wanting in <lb/>
            the Heidelberg MS., it is evident that he had met with a <lb/>
            transcript of the collection of Cephalas more complete than <lb/>
            any known to us at present.</p>
          <p>Of the metrical translations into English, the first was pub­ <lb/>
            lished by the Rev. Robert Bland; who, after trying his hand <lb/>
            at some versions from the Minor Poets of Greece, in the <lb/>
            Monthly Magazine for 1805 and 1806, and shortly afterwards <lb/>
            in Dr. Aikin's Athenaeum, collected them into a volume, pub­ <lb/>
            lished in 1806, under the title of " Translations from the <lb/>
            Greek Anthology, with Tales and Miscellaneous Poems." Of <lb/>
            the translations many were the contributions of the authors <lb/>
            friends, the late J. H. Merivale, the present Lord Denman, and <lb/>
            Dr. Hodgson, the Provost of Eton College. Prefixed to the vo­ <lb/>
             <pb n="v"/>
            lume is a Preface on the lighter literature of Greece, and the <lb/>
            principal collectors of the Greek Anthology; from which an <lb/>
            extract will enable the reader to see what he is to expect in <lb/>
            such a garden of the poetry of Greece.</p>
          <p>" By the word Epigram, we are not to understand what is <lb/>
            generally meant by that term in modern times; but we must <lb/>
            bear in mind that it is literally an Inscription merely; and <lb/>
            was originally appropriated to the short sentences inscribed <lb/>
            on offerings made to the gods ; but was subsequently trans­ <lb/>
            ferred to inscriptions on statues, either of gods, heroes, or of <lb/>
            men even, whether living or dead, and on public buildings; <lb/>
            that it was adopted by the lawgiver to convey a moral precept, <lb/>
            and by a lover to express a tender sentiment, but most of <lb/>
            all by those who wished to perpetuate the affection felt by <lb/>
            the living for the dead; while the chief merit of a Greek Epi­ <lb/>
            gram consists in the justness of a single and natural thought <lb/>
            conveyed in harmonious and unaffected language; and that, <lb/>
            as very little can be done in the compass of a few couplets, <lb/>
            the principal aim of each writer seems to have been to do that <lb/>
            little with grace."</p>
          <p>As regards the intrinsic value of such fugitive pieces, Bland <lb/>
            has correctly observed that—" from the histories and orations <lb/>
            and nobler poems which have come down to us, we know how <lb/>
            to appreciate the bold and masterly characters of the heroes <lb/>
            and statesmen of Greece and Italy; but for private events and <lb/>
            domestic occurrences, we must look to fugitive pieces; for <lb/>
            there we meet with records beneath the dignity of history, and <lb/>
            catch a glimpse of the characters and customs of an otherwise <lb/>
            little-known age ; there we follow individuals into their re­ <lb/>
            tirements ; there we are present at their births, nuptials, and <lb/>
            deaths, and become the companions of their merriment at table, <lb/>
            and the spectators at their games."</p><pb n="vi"/>
            
          <p>Of the preceding extract, the greater portion is taken from <lb/>
            the second edition, published in 1813, of which there appeared <lb/>
            rather favourable notices in the Quarterly, Edinburgh, and <lb/>
            Monthly Reviews, and the Museum Criticum. After the death <lb/>
            of Mr. Bland in 1825, Mr. Merivale gave, in 1833, a new <lb/>
            edition, freed, as he says, from former blemishes. But though <lb/>
            this last edition is enriched with many new translations, it <lb/>
            comprises only a portion of those already contained in its pre­ <lb/>
            decessors ; and hence it has been necessary, for the purposes <lb/>
            of the present volume, to consult both. To these have been <lb/>
            added those contributed by Mr. Hay and others to the series <lb/>
            of articles written by Professor Wilson, in Blackwood's Maga­ <lb/>
            zine for 1833 and 1835.</p>
          <p>The last work of the kind which has appeared in England, <lb/>
            is the " Anthologia Polyglotta," of the Rev, Dr. H. Wellesley, <lb/>
            Principal of New Inn Hall, Oxford; who, with the assistance <lb/>
            of some University friends, has given a very beautiful volume <lb/>
            of versions from the Greek Anthology; where fidelity and <lb/>
            elegance are happily combined.</p>
          <p>In addition to the translations collected from these sources, <lb/>
            I have availed myself of a few to be found elsewhere, such <lb/>
            as the one by T. C., in Notes and Queries, vol. iii. p. 92, <lb/>
            and one from the Gentleman's Magazine. For those marked <lb/>
            M. A. S. I am indebted to a lady, who is desirous of concealing <lb/>
            her name ; and for those with the initials G. B. I am myself <lb/>
            responsible. The first 96 pages had been already printed, <lb/>
            before the work was put into my hands; and not only the <lb/>
            translation, but nearly all the notes in that portion, are from <lb/>
            the pen of an accomplished gentleman, educated at West­ <lb/>
            minster School.</p>
          <p>With regard to the selection of the Epigrams, the present <lb/>
            volume contains all that are to be found in the Collections <lb/>
             <pb n="vii"/>
            made for the use respectively of the schools at Westminster <lb/>
            and Eton; to which is added the fuller selection edited, in <lb/>
            1825, by the Rev. John Edwards, formerly Head Master of <lb/>
            King Edward's School at Bury St. Edmund's, and at present <lb/>
            Greek Professor in the University of Durham ; and lastly, <lb/>
            those Epigrams which have been versified by Bland and <lb/>
            Merivale, and are not contained in the preceding Selections. <lb/>
            Where the same Epigrams are repeated in one or other of <lb/>
            the Collections, it has been deemed advisable to give them <lb/>
            only in the place where they first occur, and to make a refer­ <lb/>
            ence to them afterwards.</p>

          <p>Theron, the [son] of Menippus, did, when a youth, <lb/>
            pour out [waste] his paternal wealth basely upon ex­ <lb/>

            family, when he perceived him now worn down by po­ <lb/>
            verty, dry as a stick, did, shedding tears, raise him up, <lb/>
            and made him the husband of his own daughter, and <lb/>
            gave many marriage presents. But when wealth came <lb/>
            to Theron contrary to his expectations, immediately he <lb/>
            indulged in the same expenses; and thus did a second <lb/>
            time the wave of destructive poverty flowing again hide <lb/>
            [overwhelm] Theron. A second time did Euctemon <lb/>
            weep, not for him, but for the dowry and the marriage-bed <lb/>
            of his daughter; and perceived that it is not possible for <lb/>
            a man, who had used improperly his own property, to be <lb/>
            trust-worthy in that of another.</p>

          <p>Nature has found amongst men nothing more baneful <lb/>
            than a man who makes a false show of pure friendship. <lb/>
            For we are not any longer on the watch as against an <lb/>

            the more. <note type="footnote"> 1 Here <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅμως</foreign> seems to be used for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁμοίως</foreign>, " equally." </note> <pb n="107"/>

            that the brother of my father would be of a long old­ <lb/>
            age. But Hermocleides alone said he was on the point <lb/>
            of death. Now he said [so], when we were within, strik­ <lb/>
            ing ourselves [through grief] for him a corpse.</p>
          <p>My uncle's sure to live through many a year; <lb/>
            So all, but one, the fortune-tellers swore. <lb/>
            Says Hermocleides, " He's short-lived, I fear;" <lb/>

          <p>With one voice all th' astrologers foretold <lb/>
            My uncle would not die till very old. <lb/>
            Alone said Hermocleides, " Death is nigh—" <lb/>
            When for the dead we raised the funeral cry. G. B.</p><figure type="illustration">

            would neither defend you from a difficult trouble and <lb/>
            calamity, nor be willing, while possessing a good, to <lb/>
            share it. In the case of him who does a good to bad <lb/>
            persons, the favour is most vain. It is equal to sowing <lb/>
            the sea of the white ocean. For neither in sowing the <lb/>
            sea would you reap a rich harvest, nor in doing good to <lb/>
            the bad would you receive any good in return. For the <lb/>
            bad have a feeling not to be satisfied. Should you fail <lb/>
            in one thing, the friendship arising from all previous <lb/>
            acts is poured out [lost]. But the good, who derive the <lb/>
            greatest advantage during their suffering, preserve a re­ <lb/>
            membrance of the good done, and a gratitude for the <lb/>
            future. Never make the bad man your friend and com­ <lb/>
            panion, but ever avoid him as a bad [unsafe] haven. <lb/>
            Many are the companions in drinking and eating; <lb/>
            but in a serious matter rather few.</p>
          <p>Let no persuasive art tempt you to place <lb/>

            How can it answer ? Will their help avail, <lb/>

            The blessing, which the gods in bounty send, <lb/>

            No. To bestrew the waves with scattered grain, <lb/>

            than to be wealthy, having obtained property unjustly. <lb/>
            All virtue, [to speak] comprehensively, consists in justice; <lb/>
            and every man, Cyrnus, is good by being just. Fortune <lb/>
            gives wealth even to a thoroughly bad man ; but virtue, <lb/>
            Cyrnus, follows a few men. Satiety begets insolence, <lb/>
            when wealth attends upon a bad man and one, to whom <lb/>
            there is not a sound mind. Never do thou, having been <lb/>
            annoyed, lay to the charge of a person his poverty, that. <lb/>
            destroys feelings, nor his wretched want of means. For <lb/>
            Zeus turns the balance to one person on one side and <lb/>
            on another to another, so as to be wealthy at one time, <lb/>
            and to have nothing at another. Never, Cyrnus, speak a <lb/>
            big word. For not a single person knows what a night <lb/>
            and day will bring to pass to a man.</p>
          <p>A part of this extract is thus translated by Frere— <lb/>
            Wealth nurses Insolence; and wealth we find, <lb/>
            When coupled with a poor and paltry mind, <lb/>
            Is evermore with Insolence combined. <lb/>
            Never in anger with the meaner sort <lb/>
            Be moved to a contemptuous harsh retort, <lb/>
            Deriding their distresses, nor despise <lb/>
            In hasty speech their wants and miseries. <lb/>
            Jove holds the balance, and the gods dispense <lb/>
            For all mankind riches and indigence.</p>

          <p>We seek, Cyrnus, rams and asses and well-bred horses, <lb/>
            and one wishes them to come from a good stock. But a <lb/>
            good man cares not to marry the bad [daughter] of a <lb/>
            bad [father], if he [the father] gives him [the man] much <lb/>
             <pb n="137"/>
            wealth. Nor does any [woman] refuse to be the wife of <lb/>
            a bad man of wealth; but she wishes a rich instead of a <lb/>
            poor [man]. Persons honour wealth. A good man has <lb/>
            married out of a bad [family], and a bad one out of a <lb/>
            good. Wealth has mingled the race.</p>
          <p>With kine and horses, Kurnus, we proceed <lb/>
            By reasonable rules, and choose a breed <lb/>
            For profit and increase, at any price, <lb/>
            Of a sound stock, without defect or vice. <lb/>
            But in the daily matches that we make <lb/>
            The price is every thing. For money's sake <lb/>
            Men marry ; women are in marriage given ; <lb/>
            The churl or ruffian, that in wealth has thriven, <lb/>

            be not alarmed; and I am wet; and I have been wan­ <lb/>
            dering through a moonless night." On hearing this I <lb/>
            pitied him. And straightway lighting a lamp, I opened <lb/>
            [the door] ; and I beheld a child bearing a bow, and <lb/>
            wings, and a quiver. And placing him by the hearth, I <lb/>
            warmed his hands in mine, and squeezed out the water <lb/>
            from his wet hair. But he, when the cold had left him, <lb/>
            says—“ Come, let us try this bow, whether the string is <lb/>
            at all injured by having been wetted. And he extends <lb/>
            [the arrow], and hits me in the middle of the liver, as if <lb/>
            he were the sting of the gad-fly. And he leaps up, <lb/>
            laughing, and, " Stranger," said he, “ rejoice with me. <lb/>
            The horn 1 is uninjured ; but you will have a pain at the <lb/>
            heart." <note type="footnote"> 1 The bows of the ancients, as of some of the moderns, were tipped with <lb/>
            horn. Hence a part of the bow is put for the whole. </note> <pb n="144"/>

          <p>T was midnight's hour; the Bear turned slow, <lb/>
            Urged by Bootes* hand below, <lb/>
            What time the race of men supine, <lb/>
            In heavy slumber's lap recline, <lb/>
            When Love stood knocking at my gate. <lb/>
            Who beats my door, thus loud and late, <lb/>
            And scares my dreams ? " 'Tis I am here-- <lb/>
            Open-a child ; you need not fear. <lb/>
            I drop with wet, and, gone astray <lb/>
            Through moonless night, have lost my way." <lb/>
            I melted as he begg'd so hard, <lb/>
            Rose; struck a light; the door unbarr'd. <lb/>
            A boy my threshold cross'd ; but lo ! <lb/>
            With wings, a quiver, and a bow. <lb/>
            Near the warm hearth I bade him stand, <lb/>
            And chafed in mine each tiny hand; <lb/>
            And wrung the ringlets of his hair <lb/>
            Rain-dropping on his face so fair. <lb/>
            When by degrees the cold had fled, <lb/>
            " Come, let me try the bow," he said, <lb/>
            " If wet has spoiled the flagging cord." <lb/>
            He spoke, and twang'd it at the word. <lb/>
            The arrow, fitted from his quiver, <lb/>
            Thrill'd, like a gad-fly, through my liver. <lb/>
            Laughing, the urchin leaped aside­ <lb/>
            " My kind host, give me joy," he cried, <lb/>
            " My bow-string yet is trim and sound ; <lb/>
            Your heart, I guess, will feel the wound." <lb/>

          <p>I wish, I wish to be in love. Cupid was persuading <lb/>
            me to love. But I having a mind not given to advice, <lb/>
            was not persuaded. And he taking up instantly his <lb/>
            bow and golden quiver, challenged me to a fight. And <lb/>
            I, taking on my shoulder a corslet, like Achilles, and <lb/>
            spears, and a builds hide [shield], fought with Cupid. <lb/>
            He hit me; and I fled. But when he had his arrows no <lb/>
            longer, he was annoyed, and shot himself as an arrow; <lb/>
            and he entered the middle of my heart, and dissolved <lb/>
            [my strength]. In vain do I possess a bull's hide [shield]. <lb/>
            or why should we be girt without, when a battle occu­ <lb/>

          <p>I will, I will Love's power obey. <lb/>
            Love woo'd me long to own his sway; <lb/>
            But when with thoughtless scorn elate <lb/>
            I mock'd submission to his state, <lb/>
            He snatch'd his bow and quiver'd pride, <lb/>
            And to fierce combat me defied. <lb/>
            In haste to my defence I flew; <lb/>
            My mail across my shoulders threw ; <lb/>
            Like some Achilles braved the field, <lb/>
            And shook my spear, and grasp'd my shield. <lb/>
            With Love I entered rebel-fight; <lb/>

            To Love, family is nothing. Wisdom, conduct is trodden <lb/>

          <p>Venus was making a loud cry after Love, her son— <lb/>
            " If any one has seen Love wandering in cross-roads, <lb/>
            the run-away is mine. The informer shall have a pre­ <lb/>
            sent. The child is very remarkable. You would know <lb/>
            him amongst twenty together. He is not pale, as to his <lb/>
            skin, but like fire. His eyes are rather sharp, and lit <lb/>
            up. His thoughts are wicked. His talk is pleasant; <lb/>
            for he does not mean and say alike. His voice is like <lb/>
            honey. But if he is in a passion, his mind is ungentle. <lb/>
            He is a deceiver, saying nothing true. A crafty child. <lb/>
            Savage in sport. He has a head of handsome hair, but <lb/>
            a pouting look. His weapons are tiny, but he shoots <lb/>
            them even to Acheron and the king of Hades. He is <lb/>
            naked as to his body; but his mind has a thick cloak. <lb/>
            And winged, like a bird, he flies at one time against <lb/>
            some men and women, and at another time against others. <lb/>
            And he settles on their entrails [heart]. He has a very <lb/>
            small bow, and upon the bow an arrow. The arrow is <lb/>
            a tiny one; but it is borne even to the sky. And there <lb/>
            is a golden quiver round his back. But there are sharp <lb/>
            arrows in it, with. which he wounds even myself. All <lb/>
            his [doings] are cruel, all. But much more is the torch, <lb/>
            that, although it is little, burns even the sun itself. If <lb/>
            you catch him, bind and bring him. Do not pity him. <lb/>
            And should you see him weeping, have a care lest he <lb/>
            deceive you. And if he laughs, drag him along. But <lb/>
            if he wants to kiss you, avoid him. His kiss is mis­ <lb/>
            chievous. His lips are a poison. But if he says, ' Take <lb/>
             <pb n="152"/>
            non-luxurious. And guard against doing that which <lb/>
            begets envy. Do not expend beyond what is season­ <lb/>
            able, like a person ignorant of what is honourable. Nor <lb/>
            be illiberal. Moderation in all things is best. And do <lb/>
            those things which will not injure you: and calculate <lb/>
            before the act. Nor receive sleep upon your softened <lb/>
            eyes before you have thrice gone over each act of the <lb/>
            day-What have I passed by? What have I done? <lb/>
            What necessary act has not been done by me ? And be­ <lb/>
            ginning from the first, go through them. And then, if <lb/>
            you have acted improperly, reproach yourself; but if <lb/>
            properly, be glad. So labour; so practise: these precepts <lb/>
            it is meet for you to love. These will place you on the <lb/>

            stooping towards the ground; and such a word she said <lb/>
            —" Take Love, dear herdsman, and teach him to play." <lb/>
            As she said this, she went away. And I, a simpleton, <lb/>
            began to teach Love, as if he were willing to learn, what <lb/>
            herdsman's lore I knew; how that Pan discovered the <lb/>

            love ditties, and taught me the desires of mortals and <lb/>
            immortals, and the doings of his mother. And I indeed <lb/>
            forgot whatever I had taught Love; but whatever Love <lb/>

            And that she said to me familiarly­ <lb/>
            " Take Love, and teach him how to play to me." <lb/>
            She vanish'd then. And I, poor fool, must turn <lb/>

            I taught him all the pastoral songs I knew <lb/>

            And told me of the loves of gods and men, <lb/>
            And of his mother's doings ; and so then <lb/>
            I forgot all I taught him for my part, <lb/>

          <p>O SOUL, soul,. who art tost in cares, where the means <lb/>
            of escape are difficult, keep thyself up, and protect thy­ <lb/>
            self by throwing the breast before the foe, and stand <lb/>
            firmly near the enemy in ambush ;2 and neither, when a <lb/>
            victor, be openly elated; nor, when vanquished, fall <lb/>
            down in the house and mourn. But neither joy (too <lb/>
            much) in things of joy, nor be dispirited too much in <lb/>
            'he midst of ills ; but understand what kind of measure <lb/>
            keeps men (within bounds).</p>
          <p>Soul, oh ! soul, when round thee whelming <lb/>
            Cares, like mountain surges, close, <lb/>
            Patient bear their mighty rage, and <lb/>
            With thy strength their strength oppose. <lb/>
            Be a manly breast your bulwark; <lb/>
            Your defence firm-planted feet; <lb/>
            So in serried line of battle <lb/>
            Spears with calm composure meet. <lb/>
            Yet in victory's golden hour <lb/>
            Raise not your proud vaunts too high; <lb/>
            Nor if vanquished, meanly stooping <lb/>
            Pierce with loud laments the sky. <note type="footnote"> ' In this address to his soul, Archilochus imitated the Homeric <unclear/> <lb/>

            and, on the other hand, deem happy such as, leaving <lb/>

          <p>Health, brightest visitant from heaven, <lb/>
            Grant me with thee to rest; <lb/>
            For the short term by nature given, <lb/>
            Be thou my constant guest. <lb/>
            For all the pride that wealth bestows; <lb/>

            with a garland1 (on his head), upon a well-turned mar­ <lb/>

            ous. and moist, and has drawn his robe down to his <lb/>
            heels; but one of his slippers he has, like a drunken <lb/>

            And he is singing either of the lovely Bathyllus, or <lb/>

            Still, Bathylla, still, Megisté, <lb/>

            A wretch, at her disposal, from the grave. <lb/>
            Listening she wept. But soon her tears were dried, <lb/>

            O pity, said I, a man dying, my treasure, <lb/>
            And save him the breath of life, hastening to flee. <lb/>
            Thus I spoke : and she wept. Soon the weeping was o'er ; <lb/>
            When she rose, and with lily hands show'd me the door. <lb/>

          <p>Farewell to wine ! or, if thou bid'st me sip, <lb/>
            Present the cup, more honoured, from thy lip. <lb/>
            Pour'd by thy hand, to rosy draughts I fly, <lb/>
            And cast away my dull sobriety. <lb/>
            For, as I drink, soft raptures tell my soul, <lb/>
            That lovely Glycera has kiss'd the bowl. BL.</p>
          <p>I love not wine; but thou hast power <lb/>
            To make me drunk at any hour. <lb/>
            Touch first the cup with thine own lip, <lb/>
            Then hand it round for mine to sip, <lb/>
            And temperance at once gives way; <lb/>
            My sweet cup-bearer wins the day. <lb/>
            That cup's a boat which ferries over <lb/>
            Thy kiss in safety to thy lover, <lb/>
            And tells by its delicious flavour, <lb/>
            How much it revels in thy favour. G. C. S.</p>

          <p>Nature, herself the modeller, has given to you, 0 <lb/>
            painter, the power to represent the Pierian (Muse) of <lb/>
            Mitylené. The transparency of her eyes is like that of <lb/>
            a fountain, and this clearly marks a fancy full of a suc­ <lb/>
            cessful aiming; and the flesh, which is naturally smooth <lb/>
            and not laboriously luxuriant,2 has the ease (of style) <lb/>
            portrayed by it; and from her countenance, mixed up <lb/>
            with what is joyous and intellectual, she proclaims a <lb/>
            Muse united to Venus.</p>
          <p>Nature herself this magic portrait drew, <lb/>
            And, painter, gave thy Lesbian Muse to view. <lb/>
            Light sparkles in her eyes ; and Fancy seems <lb/>
            The radiant fountain of those living beams ; <lb/>
            Through the smooth fulness of the unclouded skin, <lb/>
            Looks out the clear ingenuous soul within. <lb/>
            Joy melts to fondness in her glistening face, <lb/>
            And Love and Music breathe a mingled grace. <lb/>

            nor does gold impart splendour, when thy hair is not to <lb/>
            be combed.1 The Indian hyacinth possesses the beauty <lb/>
            of a dark splendour, but far inferior to thine eyes ; and <lb/>
            thy dewy lips, and the honey-mingled harmony of <lb/>
            manners is the cestus of the Paphian (Venus). By all <lb/>

            The pearl, in Persia's precious gulf that glows, <lb/>
            Yields to the dazzling whiteness of thy neck. <lb/>
            Gold adds not to the lustre of thy hair, <lb/>

            The Indian hyacinth's celestial hue <lb/>

            The Paphian cestus bathed thy lips in dew, <lb/>
            And gave thy form ambrosial harmony. <lb/>
            My soul would perish in the melting gaze, <lb/>
            But for thine eyes, where hope for ever plays. BL.</p>
          <p>No garland needs the rose ; nor thou, my fair, <lb/>

            Thy skin bedims the pearl; and dim the glare <lb/>
            Of gold beside thy wild luxuriant hair. <lb/>
            The Indian gem its flaming grace may prize, <lb/>

          <p>An unhappy man went to Diodorus the rhetorician <lb/>
            and made an inquiry of him on this point of law. My <lb/>
            female servant some time ago ran away. And some one <lb/>
            on finding her, and knowing that she was the servant of <lb/>
            a stranger, united her to his own male servant, and by <lb/>
            him she had children. Now of whom are the children <lb/>
            most justly the slaves. And he, after he had pondered <lb/>
            and looked into each book, said, turning (towards the <lb/>
            inquirer) his arched eye-brows—" Either to you or the <lb/>
            party who got hold of the female servant it must needs <lb/>
            be that those children, about whom you are speaking, <lb/>
            are the slaves. But do you seek out an intelligent2 <lb/>
            judge, and you will quickly obtain a decision of greater <lb/>
            authority, if you are stating what is just."3</p>
          <p>A plaintiff thus explained his cause <lb/>
            To counsel learned in the laws. <lb/>
            " My bond-maid lately ran away, <lb/>
            And in her fight was met by A; <lb/>
            Who, knowing she belonged to me, <lb/>
            Espoused her to his servant B. <lb/>
            The issue of this marriage, pray, <lb/>
            Do they belong to me or A?" <lb/>
            The lawyer, true to his vocation, <lb/>
            Gave signs of deepest cogitation ; <lb/>
            Look'd at a score of books, or near, <lb/>
            Then hemmed and said—" Your case is clear. <note type="footnote"> 1 Like Vulcan, who was the husband of Venus, who was the mother <lb/>

            sons 1 has the wave of the much-roaring sea overwhelmed, <lb/>
            and we have our lungs swollen with sorrow. But <lb/>
            for ills not to be cured have the gods, my friend, given <lb/>
            a remedy in a strong endurance. 2 One person has this <lb/>
            at one time, another at another.2 Now they are turned <lb/>
            against us, and we moan for a blood-producing sore; <lb/>
            and again they will pass on to others. But do ye endure <lb/>
            them very quickly,3 driving away a womanly grief. <note type="footnote"> 4 While lamenting the husband of his sister, who had <lb/>

          <p>There is nothing amongst men that remains firmly <lb/>
            fixed for ever; and this one sentiment the man of Chios <lb/>
            has expressed the best,—“ As is the race of leaves, such <lb/>
            is of men." But few mortals, receiving it through the <lb/>
            ears, deposit it in their breasts. For to each is present <lb/>
            the hope, which is implanted in the bosoms of young <lb/>
            men. And as long as a mortal possesses the much-de­ <lb/>
            sired flower of youth, he has light thoughts, and imagines <lb/>
            many things that are never to be accomplished. For he <lb/>
            has no expectation of becoming old or dying, nor, when <lb/>
            he is in health, has he any thought of sickness. Simple­ <lb/>
            tons (are they), whose mind lies in this direction, and <lb/>
            who know not that short is the period of youth and <lb/>
            life to mortals; but do you, after learning this, endure <lb/>
            to the end of life in gratifying your soul with good <lb/>
            things.</p>
          <p>All human things are subject to decay; <lb/>
            And well the man of Chios tuned his lay— <lb/>
            " Like leaves on trees, the race of man is found." <lb/>
            Yet few receive the melancholy sound, <lb/>
            Or in their breasts imprint this solemn truth; <lb/>
            For Hope is near to all, but most to youth. <lb/>
            Hope's vernal season leads the laughing hours, <lb/>
            And strews o'er every path the fairest flowers; <lb/>
            To cloud the scene no distant mists appear; <lb/>
            Age moves no thought, and death awakes no fear. <lb/>
            Ah ! how unmindful is the giddy crowd <lb/>
            Of the small span to youth and life allow'd! <lb/>
            Ye who reflect, the short-lived good employ, <lb/>

          <p>The Muses themselves1 beheld thee, Hesiod, tending <lb/>

            after plucking with their hands3 a branch with its beau­ <lb/>

            Helicon, which the heel of the winged steed had previ­ <lb/>

          <p>Of Nicostratus, another Aristotle, (and) equal to <lb/>
            Plato, the talker of the quibbles of wisdom most high, <lb/>
            a person made this inquiry on the subject of the soul: <lb/>
            " How may one say of the soul, that it is mortal, or, on <lb/>
             <pb n="493"/>
            the other hand, immortal ? and must we call it body, or <lb/>
            without body? and must it be ranked amongst things <lb/>
            to be grasped by the mind, or laid hold materially ? or <lb/>
            is it both together ? " When he had read over the books <lb/>
            of Aristotle on things Sublime, and his work on the <lb/>
            Soul, and, after poring over the sublimity of Plato in <lb/>
            the Phædo, had meditated upon the whole truth and on <lb/>
            every side, then wrapping his cloak round and stroking <lb/>
            down his beard to the tips, he put forth his solution (of <lb/>
            the inquiry). “ If there be to the soul! wholly a na­ <lb/>
            ture—for I really do not know-it is altogether mortal <lb/>
            or immortal, of a solid substance, or immaterial. But <lb/>
            when you shall have passed over Acheron, you will <lb/>
            know the truth there, as Plato does. Or if you like, <lb/>
            imitate Cleombrotus the Ambraciote, and from the roof <lb/>
            release your body (from life); and then you will know <lb/>
            yourself, as being separated from the body, having left <lb/>
            behind you that alone which you are seeking.</p>
          <p>Nicostratus, that second Stagirite, <lb/>
            Who sits, like Plato, perch'd on wisdom's height, <lb/>
            A simple scholar thus address'd one day: <lb/>
            " What is the soul, thou sage illumined, say- <lb/>
            Mortal or deathless ? substance or mere shade ? <lb/>
            Of reasoning sense, or naked feeling made ? <lb/>
            Or both alike ? Resolve my doubts," he said. <lb/>
            The sage his book of Meteors 'gan unroll, <lb/>

            And Plato's Phædon to its source explored, <lb/>
            Where truth from heaven's eternal fount is pour'd. <lb/>
            Then waved his wand-applied it to his chin- <lb/>
            And utter'd thus the oracle within: <lb/>
            " If all the world be soul-and if 'tis so <lb/>
            Or not, I must confess, I do not know- <lb/>
            But if, I say, all nature spirit be, <lb/>
            It must be mortal, or from death be free; <lb/>
            Must be substantial; or, if not, mere shade; <lb/>

            who has a lovely form, through being persuaded by his <lb/>
