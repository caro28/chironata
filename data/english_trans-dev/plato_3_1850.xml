          <p>THE present portion of the works of Plato having been <lb/>
            placed in my hands for translation, I undertook the <lb/>
            task the more readily, as it enabled me to renew my <lb/>
            acquaintance with an author to whose writings I formerly <lb/>
            paid considerable attention.</p>
          <p>It is now more than five and twenty years since I <lb/>
            prepared for the press, for Mr. Priestley, his variorum <lb/>
            edition of Plato, published in 1826; for which object I <lb/>
            carefully examined whatever had been contributed by <lb/>
            my predecessors, especially Routh, Fischer, Wytten­ <lb/>
            bach, Heusde, Heindorf, Buttman, Bekker, Ast, Schnei­ <lb/>
            der, and Stallbaum. Since then I have from time to time <lb/>
            read or looked into the more recent publications illus­ <lb/>
            trative of my author, and therefore feel myself competent <lb/>
            to pronounce an opinion on their labours.</p>
          <p>The seven Dialogues contained in the present volume <lb/>
            are confessedly among the most difficult, and this chiefly <lb/>
            because, with the exception of the Parmenides, they are <lb/>
            the most corrupt. Hence I have found myself compelled <lb/>
            to write longer and more frequent notes than would <lb/>
            otherwise have been requisite; and sometimes, with the <lb/>
            view of arriving at the probable meaning of the author, <lb/>
            to suggest new readings.</p>

          </head>
          <p>THE object of this dialogue is to inquire into the nature of Virtue <lb/>
            in the abstract; to ascertain whether it can or cannot be taught; <lb/>
            and to show that the knowledge we now possess is but the recollec­ <lb/>
            tion of what the mind was conversant with at some former period.</p>
          <p>On the first of these points Plato, as usual, arrives at no conclu­ <lb/>
            sion. For Socrates, who is merely Plato's mouth-piece, and not, as <lb/>
            many imagine, the exponent of his own opinions, never pretended to <lb/>
            know any thing in the abstract. He was therefore content to show, <lb/>
            that for the development of Virtue a correct moral conduct, founded <lb/>
            on prudence, temperance, and justice, is all that is requisite.</p>
          <p>With regard to the question, whether Virtue can or cannot be <lb/>
            taught, we are told that, as Virtue is not a science, it cannot, like <lb/>
            a science, be made the subject of teaching; and that the virtuous <lb/>
            person is such, rather by an act of the deity than by any efforts <lb/>
            made by man.</p>
          <p>Of the speakers, the principal is Meno, a Thessalian, who had been <lb/>
            a pupil of Gorgias, and is supposed to be the person mentioned by <lb/>
            Xenophon in the Anabasis, where his character is drawn in the <lb/>
            darkest colours, and reflecting to the life the conduct of those, who <lb/>
            had been taught by the Sophists of Greece :— <lb/>
            " quærenda pecunia primum; <lb/>
            Virtus post nummos." <lb/>
            Seek money first; and virtue after coin.</p>
          <p>Towards the latter part of the dialogue, Anytus, best known as <lb/>
            one of the accusers of Socrates, is introduced, as taking accidentally <lb/>
            a share in the conversation; partly because he was Meno's host; <note type="footnote"> B </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="2"/>
            but more, perhaps, with the view of enabling Plato to show, that <lb/>
            the answers which Anytus gives to questions on political subjects, <lb/>
            were less sensible than those, given by his own slave on geometrical <lb/>
            problems; and this too, although the former had been under the <lb/>
            cleverest masters, and the latter was merely self-taught.</p>

          <p>[1.] MenD. CAN1 you tell me, Socrates, is virtue to be <lb/>
            taught? or is it to be not taught, but acquired by (mental) <lb/>
            exercise ?2 or does it come to man neither by (mental) exer­ <lb/>
            cise, nor teaching, but by nature, or some other means ?</p>
          <p>Socrates. The Thessalians, Meno, have been of old in great <lb/>
            repute among the Grecians, and admired for their skill in <lb/>
            horsemanship,3 and for their wealth; and now, I think, (they <lb/>
            are) no less so for their wisdom.4 And not the least so, are <lb/>
            the fellow-citizens of your friend Aristippus of Larissa. Now <lb/>
            of this Gorgias is the cause. For when he came to the city <lb/>
            (of Larissa), he so captivated the chiefs of the Aleuadæ,5 one <lb/>
            of whom is your friend Aristippus, and those of the other <lb/>
            Thessalian families, that they fell in love with him for his <lb/>
            wisdom.6 And in truth this custom has habituated you to <lb/>
            answer fearlessly and with a high bearing, if any one asks <lb/>
            a question; as indeed becomes those who know a subject <note type="footnote"> 1 From the very abrupt opening of the dialogue, some persons have <lb/>
            supposed that the original commencement has been lost. But something <lb/>
            similar occurs in the Cratylus and Philebus. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The same question is touched upon in the Protagoras. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 See Plato's Hipp. Maj. Suidas in <foreign xml:lang="grc">῾Ιππε</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ς λευκοθώρακες</foreign>, and the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ζεύξις</foreign> and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἔρωτες</foreign> of Lucian. S. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 This is ironical. For Plutarch relates that, when Simonides was <lb/>
            asked why he had not deceived the Thessalians, he replied, " They are <lb/>
            too ignorant to be deceived by me." GEDIKE. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 This was the noblest family in Larissa. They were descended from <lb/>
            Aleuas, one of the kings of Thessaly, of the race of Hercules. </note><note type="footnote"> 6 Hence Philostratus, in the Proeme to his Lives of the Sophists, <lb/>
            says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦρξε τη̃ς ἀρχαιοτἑρας</foreign> [sc. <foreign xml:lang="grc">σοφιστικη̃ς</foreign>] <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γοργίας</foreign>; o <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λεοντ</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">νος ἐν <lb/>

             <pb n="4"/>
            thoroughly. Since he7 too offered himself for any of the Greeks <lb/>
            to interrogate him on any matter he might think proper; and <lb/>
            there was not one, to whom he did not give an answer. But <lb/>
            here, friend Meno, the very reverse has occurred. There is, as it <lb/>
            were, a dearth of wisdom; and there is a danger, that wisdom <lb/>
            has departed from this country, and has fled to yours. Should <lb/>
            you then be willing to put this question to any one here, there <lb/>
            is not a man who would not laugh and say, " I run the risk, <lb/>
            stranger, of seeming to you to be one of the blessed,8 in know­ <lb/>
            in,, whether virtue is to be taught, or comes by any other <lb/>
            means whatever; since I am so far from knowing whether it <lb/>
            is to be taught or not, that I happen not to know what virtue <lb/>
            is at all." Now this, Meno, is my own case. [2.] I am in <lb/>
            the same poverty of knowledge as my fellow-citizens in this <lb/>
            affair; and I blame myself for being totally ignorant of virtue. <lb/>
            How then can I know the quality of that, of which I know <lb/>
            nothing? Or do you think it possible for a man, wholly <lb/>
            ignorant, who Meno is, to know whether Meno is a handsome, <lb/>
            or rich, or generous spirit, or the reverse of all these charac­ <lb/>
            ters ? [Do you think it possible ?] 9</p>
          <p>Meno. I do not. But in good sooth, Socrates, do you really <lb/>
            not know what virtue is ? and shall I send home this report <lb/>
            of you ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Not only that, my friend, but this further-that I <lb/>
            never met any where with any person who, as I think, (did <lb/>
            know).</p>
          <p>Meno. Did you never then meet with Gorgias, when he <lb/>
            was here ?</p>
          <p>Soc. I did.</p>
          <p>Meno. And did he not seem to you to know ?</p>
          <p>Soc. I do not perfectly remember, Meno; so that I am not <lb/>
            able to say at present what I then thought of him. But per­ <lb/>
            haps both he knew himself, and you too, what he said. Do <lb/>
            you then bring to my recollection what he said; or, if you <note type="footnote"> 7 On this boldness of Gorges thus challenging persons to try his powers <lb/>
            as a sophist, see Plato Gorg. p. 447, D., and Cicero De Finib., from <lb/>
            which it would appear that he was the admirable Creighton of his day. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 By <foreign xml:lang="grc">μακάριος</foreign> is meant not simply blessed, but blessed as a god. So <lb/>

            would rather, tell it in your own words ; for surely you agree <lb/>
            with him in opinion.</p>
          <p>Meno. I do.</p>
          <p>Soc. Let us then put him aside; especially as he is absent. <lb/>
            But, by the gods, do you, Meno, tell me yourself what you <lb/>
            assert virtue to be; and do not grudge me (the knowledge of <lb/>
            it), in order that I may have uttered a most fortunate untruth, <lb/>
            should both you and Gorgias appear (to know), what I said <lb/>
            I had never met with a person (who did know).</p>
          <p>[3.] Meno. Nay, Socrates, it is by no means difficult to <lb/>
            telL In the first place, if you wish (me to tell) the virtue of <lb/>
            a man, it is easy (to say) that a man's virtue consists in his <lb/>
            being competent to manage the affairs of the state, and, man­ <lb/>
            aging them, to do good to its friends, evil to its enemies, <lb/>
            and to take care that he suffers himself nothing of that kind. <lb/>
            Then, if you wish to know the virtue of a woman, it is not <lb/>
            difficult to go through (the particulars): that it is to manage <lb/>
            well the affairs of her family, to keep safe the things in the <lb/>
            house, and to hearken to her husband. Another kind of virtue <lb/>
            is that of a child, either a girl or boy; and of a man advanced <lb/>
            in years; and, if you choose (to go on), of a free-man and of <lb/>
            a slave. Many more virtues are there, of all kinds; so that <lb/>
            there is no want of power to tell concerning virtue, what it <lb/>
            is. For in every action, and in every age of life, and for <lb/>
            every kind of business, there is ( a peculiar) virtue to each per­ <lb/>
            son : and similarly, Socrates, I think, there is (a peculiar) vice.</p>
          <p>Soc. I think myself greatly indeed favoured by fortune, <lb/>
            Meno. For, when I was only in quest of one virtue, I have <lb/>
            found, it seems, a whole swarm of virtues hiving with you. <lb/>
            But with regard to this simile, taken from bees, had I, Meno, <lb/>
            asked you respecting the nature of a bee, and you had told <lb/>
            me that bees were many and various, what answer would you <lb/>
            have given me, had I demanded of you further-Do you call <lb/>
            them many and various, and differing one from another, in <lb/>
            respect of their being bees; or do they differ not in this <lb/>
            respect, but with regard to something else, as beauty, or size, <lb/>
            or any other thing of a like kind ? Tell me, what answer <lb/>
            would you have made, had you been so questioned ?</p>
          <p>Meno. I (would have answered) thus; that so far as they <lb/>
            are bees, they differ not at all one from another.</p>
          <p>Soc. Had I then afterwards said-Tell me now, Meno, con­ <lb/>
             <pb n="6"/>
            corning this very thing, in respect of which they do not differ, <lb/>
            but are all the same; what say you is this ? Would you have <lb/>
            had any thing to say ?</p>
          <p>Meno. I should.</p>
          <p>[4.] Soc. Just so it is with the virtues. Although they <lb/>
            are many indeed, and of various kinds, yet they all agree in <lb/>
            one and the same idea, through which they are virtues; and <lb/>
            to which it is well for him to look, who by his answer would <lb/>
            point out to the inquirer what virtue happens to be. Do you <lb/>
            not comprehend what I am saying ?</p>
          <p>Meno. I think I do. But I do not grasp, as I could wish, <lb/>
            the question.</p>
          <p>Soc. Do you think only after this manner concerning virtue, <lb/>
            that the virtue of a man is one thing, the virtue of a woman <lb/>
            another thing, and so of the other virtues, (that they are all <lb/>
            different) ? or have you the same way (of thinking) as regards <lb/>
            health, size, and strength ? Do you consider the health of a <lb/>
            man to be one thing, the health of a woman to be another ? <lb/>
            or is the same kind (of health) every where, wherever health <lb/>
            is, whether it be in a man, or in any other subject whatever?</p>
          <p>Meno. The health of a man and of a woman, I think, is the <lb/>
            same thing.</p>
          <p>Soc. (The same then applies to) size and strength. A <lb/>
            woman, if she be strong, is strong according to the same <lb/>
            idea, and with the same strength, (as applies to a strong <lb/>
            man). By the same strength I mean this. That whether <lb/>
            strength be in a man, or in a woman, as regards the existence <lb/>
            of strength, there is no difference; or do you think there is <lb/>
            a difference ?</p>
          <p>Meno. I think there is not.</p>
          <p>Soc. Will there be any difference in virtue, with respect <lb/>
            to its being virtue, whether it be in a child or in an aged <lb/>
            person, in a woman or in a man ?</p>
          <p>Meno. This case, Socrates, seems to me somehow to be not <lb/>
            quite similar to the other.</p>
          <p>Soc. Why ? Did you not tell me that the virtue of a man <lb/>
            consisted in his well managing a state, and that of a woman, <lb/>
            in well managing a household ?</p>
          <p>Meno. I did.</p>
          <p>Soc. Is it, then, possible to manage well a state or household, <lb/>
            or any thing else whatever, without justice and prudence.</p><pb n="7"/>
            
          <p>MenD. By no means.</p>
          <p>Soc. If then the management be just and prudent, will not <lb/>
            the managers manage with justice and with prudence ?</p>
          <p>Meno. They will of necessity.</p>
          <p>Soc. Both of them, therefore, the woman and the man, <lb/>
            have need of the same things, (namely,) justice and prudence, <lb/>
            if they are about to be good (managers).</p>
          <p>Meno. It appears so.10</p>
          <p>Soc. What then, can a child, or an old man, ever be good, <lb/>
            if dissolute and dishonest ?</p>
          <p>Meno. By no means.</p>
          <p>Soc. But only if sober and honest ?</p>
          <p>Meno. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. All persons, surely, are good in the same way; for <lb/>
            they are good by possessing the same qualities.</p>
          <p>Meno. It seems so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Now, if virtue were not the same in them (all), they <lb/>
            surely would not be good in the same way.</p>
          <p>Meno. They would not.</p>
          <p>[5.] Soc. Since then the virtue is the same in them all, <lb/>
            endeavour to recollect and tell11 me, what says Gorgias of it, <lb/>
            and you with him.</p>
          <p>Meno. What else is it than to be able to govern men ? <lb/>
            If you are in search of one thing, applicable to all (persons).</p>
          <p>Soc. It is the very thing I am in search of. But is this <lb/>
            then the same virtue of a child, Meno, and of a slave, to be <lb/>
            able 12 to govern their master ? Do you think that he who <lb/>
            rules would be still a slave ?</p>
          <p>Meno. I do not think he would, Socrates, at all.</p>
          <p>Soc. For it is not reasonable, my very good (friend). Con­ <lb/>
            sider this again.13 You say (it is virtue) to be able to govern. <lb/>
            Shall we not subjoin the (word) justly, but not, unjustly.</p>
          <p>Meno. I think so. For justice, Socrates, is virtue.</p>
          <p>Soc. Is it, Meno, virtue, or some virtue ? <note type="footnote"> 10 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">φαίνονται</foreign>, one MS. has correctly <foreign xml:lang="grc">φαίνεται</foreign>. The other <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Meno. How say you this ?</p>
          <p>Soc. As respecting any thing else whatever. For instance, <lb/>
            if you please, respecting roundness, I would say that it is a <lb/>
            figure, and not thus absolutely that it is figure. And I should <lb/>
            say so for this reason, because there are other figures.</p>
          <p>Meno. You would thus speak rightly. Since I too myself <lb/>
            not only say that justice is a virtue, but that there are other <lb/>
            virtues.</p>
          <p>Soc. Say what these other (virtues) are; as I would, were <lb/>
            you to bid me, tell you other figures beside the round. Do <lb/>
            you then likewise mention to me other virtues beside justice.</p>
          <p>Meno. Well then, courage, I think, is a virtue, and tem­ <lb/>
            perance, and wisdom, and a lofty bearing, and a great many <lb/>
            other (qualities).</p>
          <p>Soc. Again, Meno, we have met with the same thing as <lb/>
            before. We have again found many virtues, while in search <lb/>
            of only one, but in a different way from that just now: but the <lb/>
            one virtue, which pervades all these, we are not able to find.</p>
          <p>[6.] Meno. For I am not able as yet, Socrates, to lay hold <lb/>
            of one such virtue as you are seeking, applicable to all, as in <lb/>
            the other instances.</p>
          <p>Soc. Probably so; but I will show a readiness to urge our­ <lb/>
            selves onward, if I can. Already you apprehend, in some <lb/>
            measure, that thus matters stand as regards every thing. For <lb/>
            had any person asked you, what was figure, the thing I just <lb/>
            now mentioned, and you had said it was roundness, had he <lb/>
            then said to you, as I did, Is roundness figure, or a figure ? <lb/>
            you would surely have said, It is a figure.</p>
          <p>Meno. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. And for this reason, because there are other figures ?</p>
          <p>Meno. For that very reason.</p>
          <p>Soc. And had he asked you further, of what sort those <lb/>
            other figures were, you would have told them.</p>
          <p>Meno. I should.</p>
          <p>Soc. And had he asked you in the same manner concern­ <lb/>
            ing colour, what it is ? If you had answered, It is whiteness ; <lb/>
            would not the interrogator have taken you immediately up with <lb/>
            this question-Is whiteness colour, or a colour ? and you would <lb/>
            have said, A colour; because there happen to be other colours.</p>
          <p>Meno. I should.</p>
          <p>Soc. And if he had bidden you to enumerate such other <lb/>
             <pb n="9"/>
            colours, you would have mentioned those, which happen to be <lb/>
            colours no less than white.</p>
          <p>Meno. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. If then he had pursued the argument as I do, and <lb/>
            said—We are always getting into a multitude. Do not (speak) <lb/>
            thus to me. But since you call all this multitude by one <lb/>
            name, and assert that there is none of them which is not <lb/>
            figure; and this too, notwithstanding they are contrary to one <lb/>
            another;14 what 15 is this thing which comprehends the round <lb/>
            as well as the straight, this to which you give the name of <lb/>
            figure ; and yet you say that the round is figure not more than <lb/>
            the straight ? or do you not say this ?</p>
          <p>Meno. I do.</p>
          <p>Soc. When you speak thus, do you mean that the round is <lb/>
            not more round than is the straight ? and that the straight is <lb/>
            not more straight than is the round?</p>
          <p>Meno. I do not mean this, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Soc. But you mean that the round is not more a figure <lb/>
            than is the straight, nor is this than the other.</p>
          <p>MenD. You say what is true.</p>
          <p>[7.] Soc. Endeavour then to tell me—What is that thing <lb/>
            which is called by the name of figure ? Now if to an inquirer <lb/>
            in this way concerning figure, or colour, you had said, I do <lb/>
            not comprehend what it is you would have, man, nor do I <lb/>
            know what it is you mean: he perhaps would have wondered, <lb/>
            and said, Do you not comprehend that I am inquiring what <lb/>
            is the same in all these? Would you have had nothing to <lb/>
            say even after this, Meno, had one inquired-What is that <lb/>
            applicable to the round, and to the straight, and to the other <lb/>
            things which you call figures, being the same for all ? Endea­ <lb/>
            vour to tell me what it is, in order that you may be ready, <lb/>
            by practice, to give a reply to the question respecting virtue.</p>
          <p>Meno. Not so, Socrates ; but do you yourself rather say <lb/>
            what figure is.</p>
          <p>Soc. Would you have me oblige you in this point?</p>
          <p>Meno. By all means.</p>
          <p>Soc. Shall you then be willing to tell me what virtue is ?</p>
          <p>Meno. I shall. <note type="footnote"> 14 Since rectilinear figures are contrary to circles. S. </note><note type="footnote"> 15 So Gedike; who reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅ, τι</foreign>. But the whole passage is scarcely <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Soc. Let me then show my readiness; for the cause is <lb/>
            worthy of it.</p>
          <p>Meno. Without all doubt.</p>
          <p>Soc. Come then; let us try if we can tell you what figure <lb/>
            is. See if you can accept it, as being this. Let then figure <lb/>
            be that which of all things is the only one, that always hap­ <lb/>
            pens to accompany colour. Does this suffice you ? or do you <lb/>
            seek for any thing further ? For I should be thus content, if <lb/>
            you would tell me virtue. IS</p>
          <p>Meno. But, Socrates, this surely is silly.</p>
          <p>Soc. How so ?</p>
          <p>Meno. According to your account, figure is that which <lb/>
            always accompanies colour.</p>
          <p>Soc. Be it so.16</p>
          <p>[8.] Meno. But should any person assert, that he knew <lb/>
            not what colour was, and was equally at a loss concerning <lb/>
            colour and concerning figure, what answer do you think you <lb/>
            would have given him?</p>
          <p>Soc. That I had answered with truth. And if the questioner <lb/>
            happened to be one of the wise men, fond of dispute and <lb/>
            contention, I would tell him—“ I had spoken; and that, if I <lb/>
            had not spoken rightly, it was your business to take up the <lb/>
            discourse, and to refute me." But if two parties, such as you <lb/>
            and I here, were inclined to have a discourse together, as <lb/>
            friends, they ought to answer each other in a milder and more <lb/>
            conversational manner. Now it is perhaps more conversa­ <lb/>
            tional to answer not only truthfully, but in terms which the <lb/>
            party questioned confesses he understands.17 Accordingly, I <lb/>
            shall now attempt to make you such a kind of answer. For <lb/>
            tell .me; do you call a certain thing by the name of end ? I <lb/>
            mean such a thing as bound or extreme ? For by all these <note type="footnote"> 15 From Sydenham's translation, " I should be well contented, if you <lb/>

              words I mean the same thing. Prodicus, indeed, might pos­ <lb/>
              sibly differ from us; but you at least would say, that a thing <lb/>
              has been bounded, or, has had an end. This is what I mean <lb/>
              to say; nothing many-coloured.</p>
          <p>Meno. Well, I do call (something end): and I think I un­ <lb/>
            derstand what you mean.</p>
          <p>Soc. And do you not call something a superficies ? and <lb/>
            another thing a solid ? such as are in geometry.</p>
          <p>Meno. Yes, I do.</p>
          <p>Soc. Now then, from these (premises) you can understand <lb/>
            what I mean by figure. For in every figure, that which <lb/>
            bounds the solid, I say, is figure; which (idea) I would con­ <lb/>
            cisely express by saying that figure is the bound of solid.</p>
          <p>[9.] Meno. And what say you colour is ?</p>
          <p>Soc. You are a saucy fellow, Meno. You impose upon an <lb/>
            old man the task of answering; yet are unwilling yourself to <lb/>
            recollect and tell (me) what Gorgias said that virtue was.</p>
          <p>Meno. But I will tell, after you have told me this, (what <lb/>
            colour is).</p>
          <p>Soc. A man with his eyes hoodwinked might perceive from <lb/>
            your way of conversing, Meno, that you are handsome, and <lb/>
            still have your admirers.</p>
          <p>Meno. How so ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Because you do nothing but command in conversation; <lb/>
            as foppish IS fellows do, as being lordlings, so long as they are <lb/>
            in the prime of beauty; and at the same time you have per­ <lb/>
            haps convicted me, as being subdued by beauty. I will there­ <lb/>
            fore gratify you and give an answer.</p>

            may most easily follow me ?</p>
          <p>Meno. I do wish it. How not ?</p>

            which those effluvia pass ?</p>
          <p>Meno. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. And that of those effluvia, some are fitted to some of <lb/>
            these pores, but that others are less or greater ?</p>
          <p>Meno. It is so.</p>
          <p>Soc. And do you not call something sight ?</p>
          <p>Meno. I do.</p>
          <p>Soc. From these (premises) "Understand," as Pindar has <lb/>
            said, " what I am saying." Colour then is the flowing off <lb/>
            from figures, agreeing with the sight, and by it perceived.21</p>
          <p>Meno. In this answer, Socrates, I think you have spoken as <lb/>
            well as possible.</p>
          <p>Soc. (You say so) perhaps because this has been said ac­ <lb/>
            cording to your habits; and because at the same time you per­ <lb/>
            ceive, I imagine, that you are able from thence to state what <lb/>
            is sound,22 and smell, and many other things of the like kind.</p>
          <p>Meno. It really is so.</p>
          <p>Soc. The answer, Meno, was tragical ;23 and so it was more <lb/>
            agreeable to you than that relating to figure. <note type="footnote"> wrote a poem in three books concerning nature, on the principles of Py­ <lb/>

          <p>Meno. To me it was.</p>
          <p>Soc. And yet, son of Alexidemus, I persuade myself, that <lb/>
            not this,24 but that, was the better answer. I conceive too, <lb/>
            that you would not have thought thus, unless, as you said yes­ <lb/>
            terday, there was necessity for you to go away before the <lb/>
            mysteries. But if you could stay and be initiated, * * * 25</p>
          <p>Meno. But if you would tell me many such things, I would <lb/>
            certainly stay.</p>
          <p>Soc. In my best endeavours to say such things I shall not <lb/>
            be wanting, for my own sake as well as yours. But (I fear) <lb/>
            I shall not be able to say much in that way. [10.] But <lb/>
            come now, and try yourself to perform your promise, by speak­ <lb/>
            ing of virtue, what it is in general: and cease making many <lb/>
            out of one; as persons say perpetually, when bantering those, <lb/>
            who pound any thing to pieces ;26 but leaving virtue whole <lb/>
            and entire, tell me what it is. Patterns of such a definition <lb/>
            you have had from me.</p>
          <p>Meno. I think then, Socrates, that virtue is, as the poet says, <lb/>
            In what is fair, to feel a joy, <lb/>
            And (o'er it) to have power — <lb/>
            and this, I say, is virtue-for him who has a desire for beau­ <lb/>
            tiful things, to be able to obtain them.</p>
          <p>Soc. Do you mean that the person, who desires beautiful <lb/>
            things, has a desire for good things ?</p>
          <p>Meno. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. Is it that there are some who have a desire for evil <lb/>
            things, and others, who have a desire for good things ? Do <lb/>
            you not think, my good (friend), that all men desire good things?</p>
          <p>Meno. I do not.</p>
          <p>Soc. But that some desire evil things ?</p>
          <p>Meno. I do. <note type="footnote"> Empedocles was inflated like that of tragedy. But as there is nothing of <lb/>

          <p>Soc. Say you that these men desire evil things, conceiving <lb/>
            them to be good ? or, knowing them to be evil, do they still <lb/>
            desire them ?</p>
          <p>MenD. Both these events, I think, occur.</p>
          <p>Soc. Is there any man, think you, who, knowing evil things <lb/>
            to be evil, yet nevertheless desires them ?</p>
          <p>Meno. Without doubt.</p>
          <p>Soc. What do you mean, by desiring them ? Is it not that <lb/>
            he may have them ?</p>
          <p>Meno. To have them. For what else (can I mean) ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Does he imagine that evil things profit the person <lb/>
            who has them, or does he know that evil things are hurtful, <lb/>
            to whomsoever they are present ?</p>
          <p>MenD. There are those who think that evil things are <lb/>
            profitable; and those who know them to be hurtful.</p>
          <p>Soc. Do you think that they know evil things to be evil, <lb/>
            who imagine such evil things to be profitable ?</p>
          <p>Meno. By no means do I think that.</p>
          <p>Soc. Is it not then evident, that those who do not desire evil <lb/>
            things know not the nature of the things (they desire); but <lb/>
            (rather), that they desire things which they imagine to be good, <lb/>
            but which are in reality evil ? So that they, who are igno­ <lb/>
            rant of them, and imagine them to be good, do, it is plain, <lb/>
            desire good things. Do they not ?</p>
          <p>MenD. They seem to be.</p>
          <p>Soc. But they who desire evil things, as you say, conceiv­ <lb/>
            ing at the same time that evil things are hurtful to the pos­ <lb/>
            sessor, surely know that they will be harmed by those (evil <lb/>
            things).</p>
          <p>MenD. This must be.</p>
          <p>Soc. But do they not think, that such as are harmed are <lb/>
            in an evil plight, so far as they are harmed ?</p>
          <p>Meno. This also must be.</p>
          <p>Soc. And that those in evil plight are unhappy ?</p>
          <p>Meno. Assuredly.</p>
          <p>Soc. Is there a man, then, who wishes to be in evil plight,27 <lb/>
            and to be unhappy ?</p>
          <p>Meno. I think not any, Socrates. <note type="footnote"> 27 Aristotle, in Nicomach. Eth. in. 5, quotes, probably from Euripides, <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Soc. No man then, Meno, wishes for evils; unless he <lb/>
            wishes to be such. For what else is it to be unhappy, than <lb/>
            to desire evil things, and to possess them ?</p>
          <p>Meno. You are saying, Socrates, what is nearly true. For28 <lb/>
            no man wishes evil things.</p>
          <p>[11.] Soc. Did you not say just now, that virtue consisted <lb/>
            in the wishing for, and having a power over, good things ?</p>
          <p>Meno. I did say so.</p>
          <p>Soc. From what has been said,29 is not this a wish to all men? <lb/>
            and in this respect one man is not better than another ?</p>
          <p>Meno. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Soc. But it is clear, that if one man is better than another, <lb/>
            he would be so in respect of his power.</p>
          <p>Meno. Undoubtedly.</p>
          <p>Soc. This then, as it seems, according to your account, is <lb/>
            virtue, the power of obtaining good things.</p>
          <p>Meno. The case seems to me, Socrates, to be entirely so, as <lb/>
            you now understand it.</p>
          <p>Soc. Let us see then if this too you say truly: for perhaps <lb/>
            you will say well. You say, that to be able to gain good <lb/>
            things is virtue.</p>
          <p>Meno. I do.</p>
          <p>Soc. Do you not call good things such as health and wealth ? <lb/>
            And I say,30 to possess gold and silver, and honours in the state, <lb/>
            and magistracies ? You do not speak of any other things as <lb/>
            good, except things of this kind ?</p>
          <p>Meno. No other ; I mean all such sort of things.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well then, to get money is virtue; as Meno says, the <lb/>
            hereditary guest of the great king.3t But do you add to this <lb/>

            this a matter of indifference to you ; but that, even if a person <lb/>
            acquires them unjustly, you call the act32 equally virtue?</p>
          <p>Meno. By no means, Socrates ; but (I call the act) wicked­ <lb/>
            ness.</p>
          <p>Soc. By all means then there ought, as it appears, to be <lb/>
            added to the act of acquisition justice, or prudence, or sanctity, <lb/>
            or some other part of virtue; for otherwise, it will not be vir­ <lb/>
            tue, notwithstanding it procures for us good things.</p>
          <p>Meno. For without those how could it be virtue ?</p>
          <p>Soc. And to not obtain gold and silver, whether for himself <lb/>
            or others, when the act is not just, is not this non-attainment <lb/>
            likewise virtue ?</p>
          <p>Meno. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Soc. The attainment then of these good things, is not more <lb/>
            virtue than the non-attainment; but, as it seems, that which <lb/>
            is combined with honesty, is virtue; and that which is separ­ <lb/>
            ated from all such things, is wickedness.</p>
          <p>Meno. I think it must of necessity be as you say.</p>
          <p>[12.] Soc. Did we not say a little while since, that honesty, <lb/>
            and prudence, and every thing of that kind, was a part of <lb/>
            virtue ?</p>
          <p>Meno. We did.</p>
          <p>Soc. Then, Meno, you are playing with me.</p>
          <p>Meno. How so, Socrates ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Because, when I just now desired you not to break <lb/>
            down nor split virtue into fractions, and gave you patterns, <lb/>
            by which you ought to answer, you have paid no regard to <lb/>
            them, but you tell me that virtue is the power of gaining good <lb/>
            things with justice; yet this, you say, is only a part of virtue.</p>
          <p>Meno. I do.</p>
          <p>Soc. It follows then, from what you confess yourself, that <lb/>
            to do whatever one does with a part of virtue, this is virtue. <lb/>
            For you say that justice, and each of those things (above-men­ <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Soc. (Truly) that, having been requested to tell me what <lb/>
            the whole of virtue is, you are far from stating what it is; but <lb/>
            you say, that every act is virtue, if it is performed with a part <lb/>
            of virtue; as though you had already told me what virtue <lb/>
            was in the whole, and that I should now know it, when you <lb/>
            split it into fractions. You have need therefore, as it seems <lb/>
            to me, of the same question again from the beginning, friend <lb/>
            Meno—What is virtue? Or34 can every act, accompanied <lb/>
            with a part of virtue, be said to be virtue itself? For it is to <lb/>
            say this, when one says that every act accompanied with jus­ <lb/>
            tice is virtue. Or do you think there is no need to you of <lb/>
            the same question; but do you think that one may know a <lb/>
            part of virtue, what it is, without knowing virtue itself?</p>
          <p>Meno. I think he cannot.</p>
          <p>Soc. For, if you remember, when I gave an answer just <lb/>
            now respecting figure, we rejected such a kind of answer, as <lb/>
            attempted to reply by terms still the subject of inquiry, and <lb/>
            not as yet confessedly understood.</p>
          <p>Meno. And we did rightly reject, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Soc. Do not then imagine, my very good (friend), while <lb/>
            we are as yet inquiring what virtue is in the whole, that, by <lb/>
            answering in terms relating to its parts, you will show clearly <lb/>
            to any one virtue itself; or, by speaking of any thing else <lb/>
            in this very same manner; but that there will be still need <lb/>
            again of the same question-Respecting virtue-as being <lb/>
            what,35 do you speak, what you speak ? Or do you think that <lb/>
            I am saying nothing (to the purpose) ?</p>
          <p>Meno. I think you are speaking correctly.</p>
          <p>[13.] Soc. Answer then again, (as) from the beginning,- <lb/>
            What do you and your friend say that virtue is ?</p>
          <p>Meno. I heard, Socrates, before I came together with you, <lb/>
            that you (do) nothing else than doubt yourself, and cause <lb/>
            others to doubt. And you seem to be now playing a wizard's <lb/>

            it.36 You seem to have done some such thing at present to <lb/>
            me, [to benumb 37 me]. For in very truth I am benumbed, <lb/>
            both in mind and mouth,38 and I have not what reply to give <lb/>
            you. And yet I have spoken very many discourses ten <lb/>

            tremely well too, as I thought myself; but now I have it not <lb/>
            in my power at all to tell what (virtue) is. I think that you <lb/>
            have consulted well for yourself in never sailing out from <lb/>
            hence nor travelling abroad. For if you were as a stranger <lb/>
            to act in this manner in another city, you would perhaps be <lb/>
            driven thence39 as a wizard.</p>
          <p>Soc. You are full of craftiness, Meno, and you have nearly <lb/>
            put a cheat upon me.</p>
          <p>Meno. How particularly so, Socrates ?</p>
          <p>Soc. I know why you brought a simile against me.</p>
          <p>Meno. Why think you ?</p>
          <p>Soc. That I might bring a simile against you in return. <lb/>
            For this I know respecting all handsome persons, that they <lb/>
            love to have likenesses made of them. For it is to their in­ <lb/>
            terest ; since of handsome persons the pictures too are hand­ <lb/>
            some. But I will not draw your likeness in return. As to <lb/>
            myself, if the torpedo be thus numb itself, and produces a <lb/>
            numbness in others also, then am I like to it; but if other­ <lb/>
            wise, I am not. For I do not, when not doubting myself, <lb/>
            cause others to doubt; but rather when I am in doubt myself, <lb/>
            I in like manner cause others to doubt. And now respect­ <lb/>

            a thing, which you do not know at all, what, it is? For by <lb/>
            placing before you what of the things, which you do not. <lb/>
            know, will you seek it ? Or, if you should fall in with it, how <lb/>
            will you know that this is the thing, of which you were <lb/>
            ignorant ?</p>
          <p>Soc. I understand, Meno, what you mean to say. See <lb/>
            you, how captious a method of reasoning you introduce? <lb/>
            That it is impossible for a man to seek, either what he does <lb/>
            know, or does not know. For no man would seek what he <lb/>
            knows; because he knows it already; and for such a person <lb/>
            there is no need of seeking. Nor (would any man seek) <lb/>
            what he knows not; because he does not know what he <lb/>
            would seek.</p>
          <p>Meno. Do you then, Socrates, think that this way of reason­ <lb/>
            ing is not fair ?</p>
          <p>Soc. I think it not (fair).</p>
          <p>Meno. Can you say in what way ?</p>
          <p>Soc. I can. For I have heard men and women wise in <lb/>
            divine matters-</p>
          <p>Meno. Saying what ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Things, I think, true and fair.</p>
          <p>Meno. What were they ? and who said them ?</p>
          <p>Soc. They, who said them, were belonging to the priests <lb/>
            and priestesses; whose business it is, and who are able to give <lb/>
            a reason for the things to which they put their hands. Pindar, <lb/>
            too, and many other of the poets, such as are divine, say them; <lb/>
            and what they say is this. But do you consider whether you <lb/>
            think they speak the truth. For they say that the soul of <lb/>
            man is immortal; and at one time it ends, which they call <lb/>
            dying; and that another it exists again; but is never de­ <lb/>
            stroyed ; and that for this reason we ought to live throughout <lb/>
            our lives as holy as possible. " To them, from whom has <lb/>
            Proserpine received the payment for an ancient act of grief, <note type="footnote"> 40 From the words of Ficinus, " ignoranti mihi assimilis," Sydenham <lb/>
            fancied the translator found in his MS. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμοὶ ὅμοιος εἶ οὐκ εἰδότι</foreign>; which he <lb/>
            says is a sense suited to the mask of ignorance, worn by Socrates <lb/>

          <p>[15.] The soul then, as being immortal, and born fre­ <lb/>
            quently, and having seen both the things here, and those in <lb/>
            Hades, and42 all things, there is nothing it has not learned; <lb/>
            so that it is no wonder that it is able to recollect, with regard <lb/>
            to virtue and other things, what it formerly knew. For the <lb/>
            whole of nature being of one kindred, and the soul having <lb/>
            heretofore known all things, there is nothing to prevent a <lb/>
            person, who remembers-what men call learning-only one <lb/>
            thing, from discovering again all the rest; if he has but <lb/>
            courage, and seeking faints not. For to search and to learn <lb/>
            is reminiscence all. We must not, therefore, submit to that <lb/>
            captious way of reasoning, for it would make us idle; since <lb/>
            to persons of a soft nature it is pleasant to hear it; whereas <lb/>
            this makes men active and inquiring ; and which I believing <lb/>
            to be true, I am willing with you to seek out what virtue is.</p>
          <p>Meno. With all my heart, Socrates. But how43 say you <lb/>
            this, that we do not learn, but that what we call learning is <lb/>
            reminiscence ? Have you it in your power to teach me that <lb/>
            this is so ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Even just now I said, Meno, that you are very <lb/>
            crafty. Since now you ask me, if I have the power to teach <lb/>
            you; I, who say there is not teaching, but (only) remini­ <lb/>
            scence ; so that I may appear directly to contradict myself.</p>
          <p>Meno. Not so, Socrates, by Jupiter. I did not say so <lb/>
            with an eye to this; but (merely) from habit. But if any <lb/>
            way you can prove to me that things are as you assert, <lb/>
            prove it.</p>

          <p>Soc. You see, Meno, that I teach this (boy)49 nothing, but <lb/>
            only question him about all. And now this boy thinks he <lb/>
            knows of what length is the line from which a space of eight <lb/>

          <p>Meno. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. View him now recollecting in order (things) as he <lb/>

            he knew not what is the line of the (above-mentioned) space <lb/>

            knew it, before he had fallen into a difficulty,54 by conceiving <lb/>
            he did not know, and had felt a desire to know ?</p>
          <p>Meno. I do not think, Socrates, he would.</p>
          <p>Soc. He was benefited, then, by being benumbed.</p>
          <p>Meno. I think so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Now mark what, after this difficulty, he will discover <lb/>
            by searching with me, (doing) nothing else but asking ques­ <lb/>
            tions, and not teaching. And watch me, if any where you <lb/>

          <p>Soc. Yet these very opinions existed in him. Or did they <lb/>
            not?</p>

          <p>Soc. In a man, therefore, who is ignorant, there exist true <lb/>
            opinions concerning those very things of which he is ignorant.59</p>
          <p>Meno. So it appears.</p>
          <p>Soc. These very opinions then have been lately stirred up <lb/>
            afresh in him, as if it were a dream. And should any one I <lb/>
            put questions to him respecting these same matters at many <lb/>
            times and in many places, be assured he will at length know <lb/>
            them not less accurately than any man.</p>
          <p>Meno. It seems so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Will he not then, without any one having taught <lb/>
            him, and by some one putting questions, recover, himself <lb/>

          <p>Soc. And yet he entertains these very opinions; does he not ?</p>
          <p>[21.] Meno. There appears, Socrates, the necessity.6o <lb/>
            Soc. If, having got (this knowledge), not in this present <lb/>
            life, he did not know this,60 it is plain that he possessed it in <lb/>
            some other time and had learnt it.</p>
          <p>Meno. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Soc. And is not then that the time, when he was not a <lb/>
            man ?</p>
          <p>Meno. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. If then, during the time when be is, and during the <lb/>
            time when he is not a man, true opinions exist in him, which, <lb/>
            roused up by questioning, become knowledge, will not his <lb/>
            soul have learnt through eternity ? for it is plain, that during <lb/>
            all time he either is, or is not a man.</p>
          <p>Meno. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Soc. If then the truth of things, that are, exists always in <lb/>
            the soul, the soul would be immortal; so that, whatever you <lb/>
            happen now not to know, that is, not to remember, you ought <lb/>
            to attempt with confidence to seek, and to recollect.</p>
          <p>Meno. You seem to me, Socrates, I know not how, to <lb/>
            speak rightly.</p>
          <p>Soc. And I (seem) to myself too, Meno. And yet in other <lb/>
            respects I would not contend very strenuously in defence of <lb/>
            my argument; but that in thinking we ought to seek the <lb/>
            things which one does not know, we should become better <lb/>
            and more manly, and less idle, than if we supposed it impos­ <lb/>

            greatest pleasure take into consideration, and hear you on the <lb/>
            question I first asked you, whether we must put our hand to <lb/>
            the inquiry about virtue as a thing to be taught, or as com­ <lb/>
            ino, by nature, or by some other means to man.</p>
          <p>Soc. Had I been master not only of myself, but of you too, <lb/>
            Meno, we would not have considered whether virtue is a thing to <lb/>
            be taught or not, before we had ascertained what is the first in­ <lb/>
            quiry, what virtue is. But since you do not even attempt to <lb/>
            master yourself in order that you may be a free-man, and yet <lb/>
            undertake to govern me, and actually do govern me, I shall <lb/>
            yield to you. For what must I do ? We are to consider then, <lb/>
            it seems, what belongs to a certain thing, whilst yet we know <lb/>
            not what the thing is. But do you relax if not some,61 yet <lb/>
            a little, the strictness of your rule, and agree to consider by­ <lb/>
            pothetically, whether virtue can be taught to a man, or how <lb/>
            otherwise (it is to be attained). I say hypothetically as geo­ <lb/>
            metricians often do in treating a question; when one asks them, <lb/>
            as it were, about a spacer whether it is possible for this space <lb/>

            would answer,—I know not as yet, of what kind 65 the triangle <lb/>
            is ; but I think I have, as it were,66 an hypothesis, that may <lb/>
            be of use for the matter (in hand) of this kind.-If the space <lb/>
            be of such a kind, as that by stretching 67 along the line given <lb/>

            suit ;68 but another, if this (hypothesis) were impossible to oc­ <lb/>
            cur. Laying down then an hypothesis, I am willing to tell you <lb/>
            what will happen respecting the placing of it ( the space) within <lb/>
            the circle, whether it be impossible or not.—[23.] And thus <lb/>
            too concerning virtue, since we know not, either what it is, or <lb/>
            what is its quality, we will lay down an hypothesis, and con­ <lb/>
            sider whether it is to be taught or not, by stating the question <lb/>
            thus. If virtue be in its quality one of things, which belongs <lb/>
            to the soul, is it to be taught, or not to be taught ? In the <lb/>
            first place, if it is either different from knowledge, or of the <lb/>
            same kind with it, is virtue or is it not to be taught, or (as <lb/>
            we said just now) to be recollected; for whichever of these <lb/>
            expressions we use, let it make no difference to us. Is then <lb/>
            virtue to be taught ? Now is it not evident to every one, that <lb/>
            a man is taught no other thing than knowledge ?</p>
          <p>Meno. To me it seems so.</p>
          <p>Soc. If then virtue be a kind of knowledge, it is evident <lb/>
            that virtue is to be taught.</p>
          <p>Meno. For how not ?</p>
          <p>Soc. From this question then we have been quickly re­ <lb/>
            lieved, that, if virtue be such a kind of thing (as knowledge), <lb/>
            it is to be taught; but not, if it be not such a kind of thing.</p>
          <p>Meno. Very true.</p>
          <p>Soc. Next after this, it seems, we must consider whether <lb/>
            virtue be knowledge or apart from knowledge.</p>
          <p>Meno. We must, I think, consider this in the next place.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well now; say we that virtue is any thing else but a <lb/>
            good; and shall we abide by this hypothesis, that virtue is a <lb/>
            good ?</p>
          <p>Meno. By all means.</p>
          <p>Soc. Now if there be also any other good apart from know­ <lb/>
            ledge, then perhaps virtue may not be a kind of knowledge. <lb/>
            But if there be no good which knowledge does not compre­ <lb/>
            hend, then in suspecting virtue to be a kind of knowledge we <lb/>
            should suspect justly. <note type="footnote"> 63 Of the problem to which Plato alludes, solutions have been suggested <lb/>

          <p>MenD. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. And if good, then useful. For all things that are <lb/>
            good are useful: are they not ?</p>
          <p>Meno. They are.</p>
          <p>Soc. Virtue then is a thing useful.</p>
          <p>Meno. It must needs be, from what has been admitted.</p>
          <p>[24.] Soc. Now let us consider what sort of things, taking <lb/>
            each by itself, are useful to us: health, we say, and strength, <lb/>
            and beauty, and wealth. These things and others of a like <lb/>
            kind we call useful: do we not ?</p>
          <p>Meno. We do.</p>
          <p>Soc. And say we not that these very things are sometimes <lb/>
            hurtful to us ? or do you say otherwise ? or thus ?</p>
          <p>Meno. Not (otherwise) ; but thus.</p>
          <p>Soc. Consider now, at what time is any one of each of these <lb/>
            things, when it leads, useful to us; and at what time is it <lb/>
            hurtful. Is it not, when a right use (leads), it is useful to us, <lb/>
            but when not, it is hurtful ?</p>
          <p>Meno. Certainly so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Further then let us consider the things belonging to <lb/>
            the soul. You call something by the name of temperance, <lb/>
            and of justice, and of fortitude, and of docility, and of memory, <lb/>
            and of high bearing, and of all such things.</p>
          <p>Meno. I do.</p>
          <p>Soc. Now consider such of these things, as you think to <lb/>
            be not knowledge, but apart from knowledge, whether they <lb/>
            are not sometimes hurtful, and sometimes useful ? for in­ <lb/>
            stance, unless prudence is present, fortitude is only a kind of <lb/>
            boldness. Is not a man hurt, when he is bold without <lb/>
            reason? but when he is bold with reason, is he not bene­ <lb/>
            fited ?69</p>
          <p>Meno. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Is it not so with temperance, and docility ? Are not <lb/>
            things learnt and prepared (for use) with understanding use­ <lb/>
            ful, but without understanding hurtful ?</p>
          <p>Meno. Very much so.</p>
          <p>Soc. In a word, do not all the endeavours and endurings <note type="footnote"> 69 So Horace—" Vis consilii expers, mole ruit suâ." </note> <lb/>

            imprudence leads, to the reverse ?</p>
          <p>Meno. It seems so.</p>
          <p>Soc. If virtue then be one of those things belonging to the <lb/>
            soul, and if it is necessary, as you say, for it to be useful, it <lb/>
            must be prudence: since all the things belonging to the soul <lb/>
            are of themselves neither useful nor hurtful; but imprudence <lb/>
            or prudence being added, they become hurtful or useful. Now <lb/>
            according to this reasoning it must needs be that virtue, being <lb/>
            useful, is a kind of prudence.</p>
          <p>Meno. So it seems to me.</p>
          <p>[25.] Soc. Now then as to the other things, which we said <lb/>
            just now were sometimes beneficial and sometimes hurtful, <lb/>
            both wealth and the things of that kind: does not prudence, <lb/>
            when leading the rest of the soul, make the things belonging <lb/>
            to the soul useful, but imprudence hurtful? and in like <lb/>
            manner does not the soul, by rightly using and leading them, <lb/>
            render them useful, but by (using) wrongly, hurtful ?</p>
          <p>Meno. Most certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. And does not a prudent soul rightly lead, but an im­ <lb/>
            prudent one, incorrectly ?</p>
          <p>Meno. Such is the fact.</p>
          <p>Soc. Thus then we may say universally, that in the case of <lb/>
            man all the other things70 depend on his soul; but the things <lb/>
            belonging to the soul itself depend on prudence, if they are <lb/>
            to be beneficial. And by this reasoning prudence would be <lb/>
            the useful. But we said that virtue was useful.</p>
          <p>Meno. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. We assert therefore that prudence is virtue, either <lb/>
            wholly, or in part.</p>
          <p>Meno. What has been said seems to me, Socrates, to have <lb/>
            been well said.</p>
          <p>Soc. If then it be so, the good are not good71 by nature.</p>
          <p>Meno. It seems to me, they are not.</p>
          <p>Soc. For then this too would follow. If the good were <lb/>
            good by nature we should have some where persons, who <note type="footnote"> 70 By the words ra <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἅλλα πάντα</foreign> are meant all the things which are <lb/>

            knew of our youths the naturally good; over whom, when <lb/>
            those had shown them to us, we should place a guard in the <lb/>
            citadel, putting a seal on them, rather than on gold, so that no <lb/>
            person might corrupt them, and that, when they, arrived at <lb/>
            manhood, they might become useful to the state.</p>
          <p>MenD. It were reasonable (to do so), Socrates.</p>
          <p>[26.] Soc. Since then the good are not good by nature, are <lb/>
            they by learning ?</p>
          <p>Meno. I think this is of necessity so. And it is plain, <lb/>
            Socrates, that if, according to the hypothesis, virtue is a <lb/>
            science, it is to be taught.</p>
          <p>Soc. Perhaps so, by Jove. But did we admit that correctly ?</p>
          <p>Meno. And yet it lately seemed to be fairly said.</p>
          <p>Soc. But I suspect, it ought not only to have seemed lately <lb/>
            to be said fairly, but to seem so at present, and hereafter too, <lb/>
            if there be any thing sound in it.</p>
          <p>Meno. What is the matter now ? looking to what are you <lb/>
            dissatisfied with it ? and why doubt that virtue is a science ?</p>
          <p>Soc. I will tell you, Meno. That virtue is to be taught, if <lb/>
            it be a science, is a position I do not retract,72 (so to say) <lb/>
            that it has not been correctly asserted. But consider whether <lb/>
            I appear to reasonably doubt, that virtue is a science. For <lb/>
            tell me this. If any thing is to be taught, not virtue only, <lb/>
            must there not be of necessity both teachers and scholars ?</p>
          <p>Meno. I think there must.</p>
          <p>Soc. Hence, on the contrary, that, of which there are <lb/>
            neither teachers nor scholars, should we conjecture rightly, in <lb/>
            conjecturing it is not to be taught ?</p>
          <p>Meno. Such is the fact. But do you not think that there <lb/>
            are teachers of virtue ?</p>
          <p>Soc. After a lengthened inquiry, whether there were any <lb/>
            teachers of virtue, I cannot, with all my efforts, discover any. <lb/>
            And yet do I make the search with many, and those, too, <lb/>
            whom I think would be the most skilled in the matter. And <lb/>
            just now, Meno, in happy time has Anytus73 sat down here <note type="footnote"> 72 In the verb <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνατίθεμαι</foreign>, (I put back for myself,) there is an allusion <lb/>

            by us, to whom we can give a share in the search. And with <lb/>
            reason should we give him a share. For, in the first place, he <lb/>
            is the son of the wealthy and the wise Anthemion, a man who <lb/>
            has become rich, not by accident, nor yet by a gift from any <lb/>
            one, as Ismenias74 of Thebes has done, who has lately obtained <lb/>
            the property of Polycrates, but having acquired his wealth <lb/>
            by his own wisdom and carefulness; and secondly, as regards <lb/>
            his other qualities, he is a citizen deemed to be neither <lb/>
            haughty nor puffed up, nor overbearing, but to conduct him­ <lb/>
            self like a decent and well-behaved man; and then, he has <lb/>
            brought up and educated his son here very well, in the opinion <lb/>
            of the Athenian multitude; for they elect him to the highest <lb/>
            offices in the state. With such men it is right then to make <lb/>
            a search after teachers of virtue, whether there are any or not, <lb/>
            and who they are. [27.] Do you then, Anytus, unite with <lb/>
            me, and Meno here, your guest, in our search after this very <lb/>
            thing, as to who are the teachers of it. Now consider the <lb/>
            matter in this way. If we wished this Meno to become a <lb/>
            good physician, to what teachers should we send him ? Should <lb/>
            we not send him to the physicians ?</p>
          <p>Anytus. By all means.</p>
          <p>Soc. And if we wished to make him a good currier, should <lb/>
            we not send him to the curriers ?</p>
          <p>Any. To be sure.</p>
          <p>Soc. And so as regards the rest of subjects ?</p>
          <p>Any. Without doubt.</p>
          <p>Soc. But concerning the same things tell me again this. In <lb/>
            sending him to the physicians we say we should do well, if <lb/>
            we wished to make him a good physician. Now when we <lb/>
            say this, do we not mean, that we should act with prudence <lb/>
            in sending him to those, who make that art their profession, <lb/>
            rather than to those who do not; and who making for them­ <lb/>
            selves a remuneration for this very thing, put themselves forth <lb/>
            as the teachers of any one willing to go and learn. Is it not <lb/>
            from looking to these matters that we should do well in send­ <lb/>
            ing him ?</p>
          <p>Any. Yes. <note type="footnote"> firmed by the best MS. Flor. x., even Stalbaum is disposed to adopt; <lb/>

          <p>Soc. Hence in the case of music, and the other (arts),. the <lb/>
            same things (take place). And it is a great folly for us, if we <lb/>
            wish to make any one a flute-player, to be willing to send him <lb/>
            not to such as profess to teach the art, and to make money by <lb/>
            it; but, to give trouble to some other persons, and to look for <lb/>
            his learning from those, who do not profess to be teachers, <lb/>
            and have not one pupil in that branch of instruction, which <lb/>
            we think proper that the person, whom we send, should <lb/>
            learn. Does not this seem to you to be very unreasonable ?</p>
          <p>Any. Yes, by Jupiter, and ignorance to boot.</p>
          <p>[28.] Soc. You say well. Now then you may consult in <lb/>
            common with me about this guest of yours, Meno here. For <lb/>
            he told me some while ago, Anytus, that he had a longing for <lb/>
            that wisdom and virtue, through which men govern well both <lb/>
            their household and the state, and pay attention to their pa­ <lb/>
            rents, and know how to receive both their countrymen and <lb/>
            foreigners, and to send them away in a manner worthy of a <lb/>
            good man. Consider then, to what persons (about to teach) 75 <lb/>
            this virtue, should we in sending him correctly send. Is it <lb/>
            not clear that, according to the reasons (detailed) just now, <lb/>
            (we should send him) to those who profess to be teachers of <lb/>
            virtue, and publicly proffer themselves common to any one <lb/>
            of the Greeks desirous to learn; after fixing the price, and <lb/>
            making it a matter of business.</p>
          <p>Any. Of what persons, Socrates, are you speaking ?</p>
          <p>Soc. You surely know that these are they whom men call <lb/>
            sophists.</p>
          <p>Any. 0 Hercules! speak fair words, Socrates. On none <lb/>
            of my relations, or family, or friends, or fellow-citizens, or <lb/>
            foreign guests, may ever such a madness seize, as to go and be <lb/>
            spoiled by them. For those fellows are clearly the bane and <lb/>
            corruption of their associates.</p>
          <p>Soc. How say you, Anytus ? Are they the only men among <lb/>
            those who, so widely different from all the rest, profess the <lb/>
            knowledge of doing something beneficial, and yet do not only <lb/>
            not improve, as others do, what one puts into their hands, but <note type="footnote"> 75 Bekk. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταύτην οὕν τήν ἀρευὴν σκόπει</foreign>. Stephens was the first to re­ <lb/>

            on the contrary, spoil it ? and do they think fit openly to make <lb/>
            money for themselves for this ? [29.] For my part, I know <lb/>
            not how to believe you. For I know that one man, Protagoras <lb/>
            (by name), has acquired singly more wealth from this wisdom, <lb/>
            than both 76 Phidias, who has produced works so conspicu­ <lb/>
            ously beautiful, and ten other statuaries besides. Indeed it is a <lb/>
            prodigy you are telling me; if when the menders of old shoes <lb/>
            and the patchers of old clothes could not escape for thirty days <lb/>
            from being publicly known, if they returned the clothes or <lb/>
            shoes in a worse condition than they received them, and if <lb/>
            they did so, they would soon perish by hunger ; yet, that Pro­ <lb/>
            tagoras should undiscovered corrupt the whole of Greece by <lb/>
            sending away his associates even worse men than he received <lb/>
            them, and this for above forty years. For I think he was <lb/>
            near seventy years of age when he died, after having passed <lb/>
            forty in his profession. And during all that time he never <lb/>
            ceased being in high repute, even to this day; and not only <lb/>
            Protagoras (met with this success), but very many others, <lb/>
            some born prior to him, and some still living. Shall we then <lb/>
            say, according to your account, that they knowingly deceived <lb/>
            and corrupted the youth, or that they did so unconscious of <lb/>
            it to themselves ? Shall we deem those to be so much out of <lb/>
            their senses, who, some say, were the wisest of mankind ?</p>
          <p>Any. They are far from being out of their senses, Socrates. <lb/>
            Much rather so are those youths, who give them money ; and <lb/>
            still more so than the youths are their relations in committing <lb/>
            them to such men; but most so of all are the states that suffer <lb/>
            them to come thither, and do not drive out a person, whether <lb/>
            foreigner or citizen, who endeavours to do any such thing.</p>
          <p>[30.] Soc. Has any of the sophists done you, Anytus, any <lb/>
            injury? or why are you so hard upon them?</p>
          <p>Any. I have never, by Jupiter, associated with one of them <lb/>

            you say yourself much wonder. But we were not inquiring, <lb/>
            what the persons are, to whom Meno might go, and become a <lb/>
            bad man. For let these, if you will, be the sophists. But <lb/>
            now speak to us of those others; and do an act of kindness <lb/>
            to this hereditary friend of yours, by telling him to what per­ <lb/>
            sons in this great city he may go and become worthy of note <lb/>
            for that virtue which I was just now detailing.</p>
          <p>Any. But why did you not tell him yourself ?</p>
          <p>Soc. What persons I conceived to be the teachers of these <lb/>
            things I have told already. But I happen to have said no­ <lb/>
            thing (to the purpose), as you inform me. 78 And perhaps <lb/>
            there is something in what you say. 78 Now, therefore, do you <lb/>
            in your turn tell him to whom of the Athenians he should go. <lb/>
            Mention the name of whomsoever you like.</p>
          <p>[31.] Any. What need is there of hearing the name of <lb/>
            any one man ? For whomsoever of the men of honour and <lb/>
            virtue among the Athenians he may meet, there is not one of <lb/>
            them who would not make him a better man, than the sophists <lb/>
            would, if he will be but persuaded.</p>
          <p>Soc. But did these men of honour and virtue become such <lb/>
            spontaneously, and without having learnt from any man (to <lb/>
            be so) ? and are they able to teach others, what they were <lb/>
            never taught themselves ?</p>
          <p>Any. They, I presume, learnt from their predecessors, being <lb/>
            men of honour and virtue. Or think you that many excellent <lb/>
            men have not been produced in this city ?</p>
          <p>Soc. I think, Anytus, that there are in this city men excel­ <lb/>
            lent in political affairs, and that there have been still not less <lb/>
            so than there are. But were they good teachers of their own <lb/>
            virtue ? For it is this, about which our present discourse <lb/>
            happens to be; not whether good men are at present here or <lb/>
            not; nor whether such have been produced formerly; but <note type="footnote"> 77 Steph. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἳ</foreign>. Wolf would read <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἷοι</foreign>, found subsequently in the two <lb/>

            whether virtue is to be taught or not, we have been for a long <lb/>
            time considering: and in considering that question, we are <lb/>
            come to consider this, whether those excellent men, either of <lb/>
            the present or former (day), knew how to hand over to another <lb/>
            that virtue, by which they themselves were good; or whether <lb/>
            this cannot be handed over to, or received by, one man from <lb/>
            another. This it is, which we have been long examining, I <lb/>
            and Meno. [32.] Consider then the question in this manner, <lb/>
            according to your own argument. Would you not say that <lb/>
            Themistocles was a good man ?</p>
          <p>Any. Yes, the best of all.</p>
          <p>Soc. And would you not then (say), that, if ever any other <lb/>
            man was the teacher of his own virtue, he was one ?</p>
          <p>Any. I suppose so, if he wished it.</p>
          <p>Soc. But would he not have wished, think you, for some <lb/>
            others to become men of honour and virtue, and especially his <lb/>
            own son ? Or do you think that he envied his son, and did de­ <lb/>
            signedly not band.over to him that virtue, in which he himself <lb/>
            was excellent? Have you not heard that Themistocles caused79 <lb/>
            his son Cleophantus to be taught to be 80 a good horseman ? <lb/>
            For example, he remained standing upright upon horses, and <lb/>
            upright (too) upon horses he threw a javelin, and performed <lb/>
            many other surprising feats, in which his father had caused <lb/>
            him to be instructed; and that he made him skilled in such <lb/>
            accomplishments as are connected with the having good <lb/>
            teachers ? Have you not heard this from the elderly people ?</p>
          <p>Any. I have heard it.</p>
          <p>Soc. No one then would have accused his son of being <lb/>
            of an evil nature.</p>

          <p>Soc. But what is this ? That Cleophantus, the son of The­ <lb/>

            himself was wise, not to make his son at all better than his <lb/>
            neighbours, if virtue could be taught ?</p>
          <p>Any. By Jove, perhaps not.</p>
          <p>[33.] Soc. Such a teacher of virtue then is this one of <lb/>
            yours, whom you yourself acknowledge to have been amongst <lb/>
            the best men of former times. And now let us consider an­ <lb/>
            other, Aristides, the son of Lysimachus. Do you not confess <lb/>
            that he was a good man ?</p>
          <p>Any. I do entirely.</p>
          <p>Soc. And did not he too give his son Lysimachus81 the <lb/>
            best education at Athens, so far as depended on teachers? <lb/>
            and do you think he made him a better man than any one <lb/>
            whatsoever? For you have associated with him, and you <lb/>
            see what sort of a man he is.82 But if you wish (another), <lb/>
            you know that Pericles, a man of such lofty bearing and <lb/>
            wisdom, bred up his two sons, Paralus and Xanthippus.</p>
          <p>Any. I do.</p>
          <p>Soc. These, as you know yourself, he taught to be horse­ <lb/>
            men not inferior to any of the Athenians; and he instructed <lb/>
            them in music and gymnastics, and the rest of accomplish­ <lb/>
            ments that depend on art, so as to be inferior to none. But <lb/>
            had he no wish to make them good men ? I believe he had <lb/>
            the wish; but I suspect it to be impossible (to teach virtue). <lb/>
            And that you may not think that a few persons, and the most <lb/>
            humble in means83 of the Athenians, were incompetent for <note type="footnote"> 81 It was common amongst the Athenians to give the eldest son the <lb/>
            name of his grandfather; so that two names were continued alternately <lb/>
            in the same family. S. </note><note type="footnote"> 82 We find nothing more of this Lysimachus, than what Plutarch states, <lb/>
            that the Athenians, out of respect for the memory of his father, who died <lb/>
            poor, gave him a small landed estate, a sum of money in hand, and a <lb/>
            trifling pension. He is one of the speakers, however, in Plato's Laches, <lb/>
            where he complains that his father, Aristides, had too much indulged <lb/>
            him in leading an idle and luxurious life, and, by giving himself up wholly <lb/>
            to state affairs, had neglected his son's education. S. </note><note type="footnote"> 83 By <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φαυλοτάτους</foreign> Sydenham, Gedike, and Schleiermacher under­ <lb/>

             <pb n="40"/>
            such an affair, consider that Thucydides84 likewise brought <lb/>
            up his two sons, Melesias and Stephanus, and educated them <lb/>
            well in other respects, and particularly in wrestling the best <lb/>
            of the Athenians. For he intrusted one to Xanthias, and the <lb/>
            other to Eudorus; and these (two) were thought to be the <lb/>
            best wrestlers of that time. Do you not remember this ?</p>
          <p>Any. I do by hearsay.</p>
          <p>[34]. Soc. Is it not plain then, that he would never have <lb/>
            taught his children those things, in the teaching of which he <lb/>
            must have been put to expense, and not have taught them to <lb/>
            be good men, which would have required him to spend <lb/>
            nothing, if such a thing could be taught? But Thucydides <lb/>
            perhaps was of very humble means, and had not very many <lb/>
            friends among the Athenians and their allies. (It was not so.) <lb/>
            For he was of a noble family, and had great influence in the <lb/>
            city and in the other Grecian states; so that if this could be <lb/>
            taught, he might have found out a person, either one of his <lb/>
            own countrymen or a foreigner, who might have made his <lb/>
            sons virtuous, if, through his superintendence of the state, he <lb/>
            had no leisure himself. But I fear, friend Anytus, that <lb/>
            virtue is a thing not to be taught.</p>
          <p>Any. You seem to me, Socrates, to speak ill of persons <lb/>
            with great facility. But I would advise you, if you are <lb/>
            willing to hearken to me, to be on your guard. For in <lb/>
            another city too it is perhaps more easy to do a man mischief <lb/>
            than good; but in this it is especially so; and I think you <lb/>
            are sensible of it yourself.</p>
          <p>[35.] Soc. Anytus seems to me to be angry, Meno.And <lb/>
            I am not at all surprised at it. For, in the first place, he <lb/>
            thinks I am speaking ill of those very persons; and then <lb/>
            he considers himself to be one of them. But if he should <lb/>
            ever know what it is to speak ill (of others), he will cease <lb/>
            to be angry; but at present he is ignorant of it. Do you then <lb/>
            tell me, are there not amongst us men of honour and virtue ?</p>
          <p>Meno. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. And are these men willing to offer themselves to <lb/>
            youths as teachers ? and to confess both that they are teachers <lb/>
            and that virtue is to be taught ? <note type="footnote"> 84 This Thucydides was not the historian, but a politician of the aris­ <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Meno. By Jupiter, Socrates, they do not. But you may <lb/>
            hear them (saying) at one time that it is to be taught, at <lb/>
            another, not.</p>
          <p>Soc. Shall we say then that these men are teachers of that <lb/>
            thing, about which they are not agreed ?</p>
          <p>Meno. I think not, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Soc. Well; but do those sophists, who alone proclaim <lb/>
            themselves teachers, appear to you to be so ?</p>
          <p>Meno. It is for this, Socrates, that I especially admire <lb/>
            Gorgias, because you would never hear him making such <lb/>
            professions. On the contrary, he laughs at the others, when­ <lb/>
            ever he hears them making such a promise; and conceives <lb/>
            that he ought to make men powerful in speaking.</p>
          <p>Soc. Do not then the sophists seem to you to be teachers <lb/>
            ( of virtue) ?</p>
          <p>Meno. I know not, Socrates, what to say. For I have <lb/>
            suffered myself, what the many do. Sometimes I think they <lb/>
            are, and sometimes, not.</p>
          <p>Soc. But you know, that not only to yourself and the others <lb/>
            versed in civil affairs, it seems at one time that this is to be <lb/>
            taught, and at another, not; and you know that the poet <lb/>
            Theognis says the very same thing.</p>
          <p>Meno. In what verses ?</p>
          <p>[36.J Soc. In his Elegiacs ;85 where he says, <lb/>
            With some drink thou and eat, and with some sit, <lb/>
            And pleasant be to those, whose power's far known: <lb/>
            Good from the good thou'lt learn; but with the bad <lb/>
            Mixing, thou'lt lose the good thoughts once thine own.</p>
          <p>Do you perceive that in these (verses) he speaks of virtue as <lb/>
            a thing to be taught ?</p>
          <p>Meno. So it appears.</p>
          <p>Soc. And yet in other verses he says, passing on a little <lb/>
            further, that <lb/>
            If wisdom could be made and placed in man, <lb/>
            they, who could accomplish this, <lb/>
            Many and great rewards would carry off; <lb/>

          <p>Do you observe, that in speaking upon the same subjects, he <lb/>
            contradicts himself ?</p>
          <p>Meno. So it appears.</p>
          <p>Soc. Can you tell me then of any other thing whatever, <lb/>
            of which they, who profess to be teachers, are not only not <lb/>
            held by others to be teachers, but who (confess) to be ignorant <lb/>
            of it themselves, and who act like knaves in that very thing, <lb/>
            which they profess to teach ; and where they, who are allowed <lb/>
            to be men of honour and virtue themselves, at one time say <lb/>
            it is to be taught, and at another, it is not ? Those then, who <lb/>
            are so tossed about in mind about any subject whatever, <lb/>
            would you say are the master-teachers of it ?</p>
          <p>[37.] Meno. By Jupiter, not I.</p>
          <p>Soc. If then neither the sophists, nor they who are men of <lb/>
            honour and virtue themselves, are teachers of this thing, it is <lb/>
            plain there can be no others beside.</p>
          <p>Meno. I think there can be none.</p>
          <p>Soc. But if no teachers, then no scholars.</p>
          <p>Meno. I think the matter is as you say.</p>
          <p>Soc. But we have agreed that the thing, of which there are <lb/>
            neither teachers nor scholars, is not to be taught.</p>
          <p>Meno. We have agreed.</p>
          <p>Soc. Of virtue then there appear no where any teachers.</p>
          <p>Meno. It is so.</p>
          <p>Soc. And if no teachers, then no scholars.</p>
          <p>Meno. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Virtue therefore cannot be taught.</p>
          <p>Meno. It seems so, if we have considered the matter rightly ; <lb/>
            so that, Socrates, I am led to wonder whether there are any <lb/>
            men really good; and if there are, what can be the manner <lb/>
            of producing good men.</p>
          <p>Soc. We are in danger, 0 Meno! of being, both you and <lb/>
            I, men of no mark; and that Gorgias has not taught you <lb/>
            sufficiently, nor Prodicus me. Above all things therefore we <lb/>
            ought to apply our minds to ourselves, and to seek a person, <lb/>
            who by one way at least would make us better men. I say <lb/>
            this with an eye to the inquiry lately made ; since it has <lb/>
            escaped us ridiculously, that it is not only under the guidance <lb/>
             <pb n="43"/>
            of science, that affairs are administered by men rightly and <lb/>
            well; or, [if we should not grant that, (namely,) that it is not <lb/>
            under the conduct of science only, but of some other thing <lb/>
            also,]86 perhaps the knowledge of the means, by which men <lb/>
            become good, has escaped us.</p>
          <p>Meno. How, Socrates, say you this ?</p>
          <p>[38.] Soc. In this way. Because, since we have rightly <lb/>
            agreed that good men must be useful to us, this87 cannot be <lb/>
            otherwise. Is it not so ?</p>
          <p>Meno. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. And that they will be useful, should they conduct <lb/>
            affairs rightly, did we not well admit this ?</p>
          <p>Meno. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. But are we like persons that have not rightly agreed, <lb/>
            (in saying) that unless one is prudent, it is not possible to <lb/>
            conduct (affairs) rightly ?</p>
          <p>Meno. How say you rightly ?</p>
          <p>Soc. I will tell you. If a man, who knew the way to <lb/>
            Larissa,88 or wherever else you please, were to walk, and act <lb/>
            as a guide to others, would he not conduct them well and <lb/>
            rightly ?</p>
          <p>Meno. Without doubt.</p>
          <p>Soc. What if one had only a correct opinion about the way, <lb/>
            but had never gone'it himself, nor had any certain know­ <lb/>
            ledge of it, would not he also conduct (others) rightly ?</p>
          <p>Meno. To be sure.</p>
          <p>Soc. And so long as he had anyhow a correct opinion of <lb/>
            things, of which the other man had a certain knowledge, he <lb/>
            would not be at all a worse guide, though (only) surmising <lb/>
            justly, and not knowing (clearly), than the other with his <lb/>
            (perfect) knowledge ?</p>
          <p>MenD. Not at all (worse).</p>
          <p>Soc. Correct opinion, therefore, with regard to correct <lb/>
            action, is not at all a worse guide than (perfect) knowledge. <note type="footnote"> 86 The Greek words for the English within brackets are omitted by all <lb/>

          <p>And this it is, which we omitted just now in considering of <lb/>

            only led to right action; now this is correct opinion.</p>
          <p>Meno. It seems so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Correct opinion therefore is not at all less beneficial <lb/>
            to man than (certain) knowledge.</p>
          <p>Meno. In this respect, however, Socrates, it is; because he, <lb/>
            who has a (perfect) knowledge, would always attain his <lb/>
            object; but he, who had only a correct opinion, would some­ <lb/>

            he had a correct opinion ?</p>
          <p>Meno. It appears to me that he must; so that, this being <lb/>
            the case, I wonder, Socrates, on what account it is that <lb/>
            science is so much more valuable than correct opinion ; and <lb/>
            in what respect it is that one is this thing, and the other <lb/>
            another.</p>
          <p>Soc. Do you know why you wonder ? or shall I tell you ?</p>
          <p>Meno. By all means tell me.</p>
          <p>Soc. It is because you never directed your mind to the <lb/>
            images89 made by Dædalus. But perhaps you have none of <lb/>
            them amongst you.</p>
          <p>Meno. With what view do you say this ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Because, if they are not fastened, they run away and <lb/>
            become fugitives; but if they are fastened, they stay.</p>
          <p>Meno. And what then ?</p>
          <p>Soc. To possess one of his works unfastened, is, like the <lb/>
            possessing a runaway slave, a matter of little value, because <lb/>
            it does not remain. But fastened, it is of great value; for <lb/>
            indeed they are works of great beauty. But why do I thus <lb/>
            speak of them ? It is with reference to true opinions. For true <lb/>
            opinions likewise, so long as they abide by us, are a valuable <lb/>
            possession, and procure for us all good things ; but they are not <lb/>
            willing to abide a long time, for they run away from the soul <lb/>

            it is on this very account that (perfect) knowledge is a thing <lb/>
            more valuable than correct opinion; and it is by this binding <lb/>
            that (perfect)knowledge differs from correct opinion.</p>
          <p>Meno. By Jupiter, Socrates, it seems like to some such <lb/>
            thing.91</p>
          <p>[40.] Soc. And yet I speak thus, not as one knowing, but <lb/>
            only from conjecture. But that correct opinion and science <lb/>
            are two different things, this I seem to myself not to con­ <lb/>
            jecture ; but if I should say I knew any thing else, (and there <lb/>
            are but few things I would say I know,) I would set down this <lb/>
            as one of those I do know.</p>
          <p>Meno. And you say rightly, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Soc. What then, (say I) not rightly this too, that correct <lb/>
            opinion, having the conduct of any work of action92 what­ <lb/>
            ever, executes (her office) not at all worse than (perfect) <lb/>
            knowledge ?</p>
          <p>Meno. And this too I think you say rightly.</p>
          <p>Soc. Correct opinion therefore is a thing not at all inferior <lb/>
            to (perfect) knowledge, nor less beneficial with regard to <lb/>
            action: nor is the man, who has a correct opinion, (inferior) <lb/>
            to the man of (perfect) knowledge.</p>
          <p>Meno. It is so.</p>
          <p>Soc. And it has been agreed, that a good man is useful.</p>
          <p>Meno. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Since then it is not through (perfect) knowledge alone <lb/>
            that men can be good and useful to their country, (if there <lb/>
            are any such men,) but by correct opinion likewise; and since <lb/>
            neither of these exists to men by nature, [neither science nor <note type="footnote"> 90 The Greek is air<foreign xml:lang="grc">ίας λογισμῳ̃</foreign>, by a rational account of the cause ; or <lb/>

            comes by nature ?</p>
          <p>Meno. Not I.</p>
          <p>Soc. Since then they are not by nature, neither is it by <lb/>
            nature that men could have been virtuous.</p>

          <p>Soc. Since then (virtue comes) not by nature, we inquired, <lb/>
            in the next place, whether it is to be taught.</p>
          <p>Meno. Just so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Did it not appear to us both, that it was to be taught, <lb/>
            if virtue were wisdom ?</p>
          <p>Meno. It did.</p>
          <p>Soc. And that if it were to be taught, then (virtue) would <lb/>
            be wisdom ?</p>
          <p>Meno. Very true.</p>
          <p>Soc. And that, if there were any teachers, it could be a <lb/>
            thing to be taught; otherwise, not ?</p>
          <p>Meno. Just so.</p>
          <p>Soc. But we have agreed that there are no teachers of it.</p>
          <p>Meno. It is so.</p>
          <p>Soc. We are agreed, therefore, that it is not to be taught, <lb/>
            nor is it wisdom.</p>
          <p>Meno. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. But we agreed besides, that it was something good.</p>
          <p>Meno. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. And that whatever conducted affairs rightly was a <lb/>
            thing beneficial.</p>
          <p>Meno. We did clearly.</p>
          <p>Soc. And that affairs are conducted rightly by these two <lb/>
            things only, correct opinion and (perfect) knowledge ; by pos­ <lb/>
            sessing which a man is a good guide. For what comes from <lb/>
            fortune is not the effect of human guidance. But where a <lb/>
            man is the guide to right, there are these two, correct opinion <lb/>
            and (perfect) knowledge.</p>
          <p>Meno. I think so. <note type="footnote"> 91 The words within brackets are evidently an explanation of the pre­ <lb/>

            has been set loose, nor can (perfect) knowledge be a guide in <lb/>

          <p>Meno. I think it cannot.</p>
          <p>Soc. Not therefore as being wise in any wisdom, did such <lb/>
            men take the lead in the state, as Themistocles, and the rest, <lb/>
            of whom Anytus here has just now spoken. And for this very <lb/>
            reason they were not able to make others such as themselves; <lb/>
            because it was not through (perfect) knowledge they were such.</p>
          <p>Meno. The case, 0 Socrates, seems to be as you represent it.</p>
          <p>Soc. If then it is not by (perfect) knowledge, it follows it <lb/>
            is by correct opinion ; of which politicians making an use, re­ <lb/>
            gulate states, being men not at all superior in wisdom to oracle- <lb/>
            singers and divine prophets; for these also utter many true <lb/>
            sayings, but know nothing of what they utter.</p>
          <p>Meno. This seem to be very near the fact.</p>
          <p>Soc. Is it not meet then, 0 Meno, to call these men divine, <lb/>
            who, without possessing a mind concerning what they do and <lb/>
            say, direct many and great things aright ?</p>
          <p>Meno. By all means.</p>
          <p>Soc. Rightly then should we call those men divine, whom <lb/>
            we just now mentioned, the oracle-singers and the prophets, <lb/>
            and all poetical persons. And not the least divine of such <lb/>
            persons should we say that statesmen are, and no less enthu­ <lb/>
            siasts, being inspired divinely, and possessed by the divinity, <lb/>
            when in their speeches they direct aright many and great <lb/>
            affairs, without knowing any thing of what they are saying.</p>
          <p>Meno. Certainly we should.</p>
          <p>Soc. And even women, Meno, call good men divine; and <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, when they celebrate with encomiums <lb/>
            any brave man, say, " This is a divine man."95</p>
          <p>Meno. And they appear, 0 Socrates, to speak justly too. <lb/>
            And yet, perhaps, Anytus here is offended at what you say.</p>
          <p>Soc. I care not. [42.] With him, Meno, we shall have <lb/>
            some discourse at another time. But if we, during all this <note type="footnote"> 95 On this expression, Casaubon on Athenæus, viii. p. 631, refers to <lb/>
            Aristot. Eth. Nicom. vii. 1, where it appears that Lacedæmonians said <lb/>

            conversation, have inquired and spoken correctly, virtue can <lb/>
            neither come by nature, nor yet be taught, but by a divine <lb/>
            fate is present to those, with whom it is present, without <lb/>
            intelligence; unless amongst statesmen there be such a per­ <lb/>
            son as is able to make another man a statesman; and if <lb/>
            there be, he might almost be said to be such among the living, <lb/>
            as Homer tells us Tiresias is among the dead; where, speak­ <lb/>
            ing of him, he says, [Od. x. 495,] that he alone, of those in <lb/>
            Hades, was intelligent; but (the rest), like shadows, flitted. <lb/>
            The same thing would forthwith 96 such a man be, with respect <lb/>
            to virtue, as a true thing is compared with shadows.</p>
          <p>Meno. You seem to me, Socrates, to speak most beautifully.</p>
          <p>Soc. From this reasoning then, Meno, it appears to us that <lb/>
            to whom virtue is present, it is present by a divine fate. But <lb/>
            on this point we shall then know the truth, when, previous to <lb/>
            our inquiries by what means is virtue present to men, we set <lb/>
            about searching first, what virtue is by itself. But it is now <lb/>
            time for me to go some where else. And do you, since you <lb/>
            are persuaded yourself on these points, persuade also your <lb/>
            guest Anytus here, in order that he may thus become more <lb/>
            mild; so that, should you persuade him, it is possible for you <lb/>
            to do some service to the Athenians likewise. <note type="footnote"> 96 None have as yet satisfactorily explained, nor could they explain, the <lb/>

            <title type="main">INTRODUCTION TO THE EUTHYDEMUS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>PLATO, having proved in the Meno the impossibility of teaching <lb/>
            virtue, in opposition to Gorgias, who boasted he could do it, has in <lb/>
            this dialogue shown how equally incompetent were the Sophists of <lb/>
            the schools of Protagoras and Prodicus to teach any of the arts and <lb/>
            sciences, which they not only said they knew, but the knowledge of <lb/>
            which they proclaimed they had the power to impart. For, like <lb/>
            some of the schoolmen of the middle ages, they were wont to speak <lb/>
            " de omnibus rebus et quibusdam aliis," with the view of showing, <lb/>
            as Horace has recorded, that a Sophist could with equal readiness <lb/>
            become a cobbler or a king; while to their vaunted universality of <lb/>
            attainments may be applied the well-known lines of Juvenal in S. <lb/>
            iii. 73—77, who drew his information partly from personal observa­ <lb/>
            tion, and partly probably from the perusal of this dialogue of Plato, <lb/>
            or the Clouds of Aristophanes; between which there is a curious <lb/>
            coincidence, as remarked by Winckelmann in the Prolegomena to <lb/>
            the Euthydemus, p. xlv.</p>
          <p>Ingenium velox, audacia perdita, sermo <lb/>
            Promptus et Isæo torrentior. Ede, quid ilium <lb/>
            Esse putes ? Quemvis hominem secum attulit ad nos, <lb/>
            Grammaticus, Rhetor, Geometres, Pictor, Aleiptes, <lb/>
            Augur, Schœnobates, Medicus, Magus. Omnia novit.</p>
          <p>In genius quick, of desperate impudence, <lb/>
            Ready in speech, and than Isseus dashing <lb/>
            More torrent-like, what think you is he ? say. <lb/>
            He with himself brings whomsoe'er you will, <lb/>
            Grammarian, Orator, Geometrician, <lb/>
            Painter, oiled Wrestler, Soothsayer, Ropedancer, <lb/>
            Physician, Conjurer. All things he knows.</p>
          <p>With regard to the matter of the dialogue, its object is to show <lb/>
            that the subtleties, on which the Sophists relied to prove and dis­ <lb/>
            prove the same propositions, were in their hands only a play upon <lb/>
            words; and that, like all such displays of misplaced ingenuity, they <lb/>
            could lead to no practical and useful results on questions relating to <note type="footnote"> E </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="50"/>
            intellectual wisdom or political well-being; on both of which con. <lb/>
            joined depends the happiness of man.</p>
          <p>With respect, however, to the manner in which the subject is <lb/>
            treated, Plato has here, as in the Ilippias Major, given up occasion­ <lb/>
            ally the character of the serious philosopher and assumed that of <lb/>
            the laughing one. For, as Horace says- <lb/>
            Ridiculum acri <lb/>
            Fortius ac melius plerumque secat res— <lb/>
            A knotty point oft ridicule assails <lb/>
            Strongest and best, where reason nought prevails­ <lb/>
            a doctrine derived, it would seem, from Socrates, who says in Plato <lb/>
            Legg. vii. p. 816, D., that without the aid of ridicule one cannot <lb/>
            even in serious matters arrive at the truth.</p>
          <p>Did, however, the ridiculous specimens of the subleties of the <lb/>
            Sophists rest upon the testimony of Plato alone, we might perhaps <lb/>
            have fancied, that to heighten the effect, he chose to draw rather a <lb/>
            caricature than a portrait of the persons, whose pursuits he believed <lb/>
            to be worse than useless, absolutely mischievous. But we have the <lb/>
            evidence of Aristotle to show that the picture is not overcharged. <lb/>
            For in his treatise " On the Disproofs of Sophists," he has alluded <lb/>
            to some of the instances produced by Plato; which he would <lb/>
            scarcely have done, had they not been known as facts rather than <lb/>
            as fictions. In truth, it may be said of the Sophists of Greece, in <lb/>
            whose schools the orators learnt the rudiments of their art, what <lb/>
            Gay has sung in his Fables respecting the barristers of more <lb/>
            recent times- <lb/>
            I know you lawyers can with ease <lb/>
            Twist words and meanings as you please; <lb/>
            And language, by your skill made pliant, <lb/>
            Can bend to favour every client.</p>
          <p>They, however, who wish to see even a greater abuse of the <lb/>
            Sophists of Greece than is to be found in the dialogues of Plato, <lb/>
            may turn to Mitchell's Preliminary Dissertation to his translation, <lb/>
            or transformation rather, of Aristophanes; where the writer's zeal <lb/>
            has, as is often the case, outstripped his discretion.</p><pb n="51"/>

            stood around you, that though I approached, desirous to hear, <lb/>

          <p>Cri. He whom I mean, sate the third from you on your <lb/>
            right hand; but in the midst of you was a youth,4 the son of <lb/>
            Axiochus, who appeared to me, Socrates, to have made a great <lb/>

          <p>Soc. By no means, Crito, as I have a sufficient argument <lb/>
            and consolation against fear. For these very men, so to say, 14 <lb/>
            have, though old, begun the study of this wisdom, which I am <lb/>
            longing for, in the art of contending. For last year, or the <lb/>
            year before last, they were not wise in the least. [4.] But <lb/>
            of one thing only I am afraid, lest I should bring disgrace <lb/>
            upon these strangers, as I do upon the harper Connus, the <lb/>
            son of Metrobius, who teaches me even now to play on the <lb/>
            harp. The boys, therefore, who are my school-fellows, on <lb/>
            seeing me, laugh, and call Connus the teacher of old men. <lb/>
            Lest therefore some one should reproach these strangers with <lb/>
            the very same thing, and they, dreading this, should be <lb/>
            unwilling to receive me, I have, Onto, persuaded other old <lb/>

            bring your sons to them ; for having a hankering after them, <lb/>
            they will, I know, instruct even us.</p>
          <p>. Cri. There is nothing to hinder us, Socrates, if it seems <lb/>
            good to you. But first tell me what is the wisdom of these <lb/>
            men, that I may know what it is we shall learn.</p>
          <p>Soc. You shall quickly hear, since I cannot say that I did <lb/>
            not attend to them; for I paid great attention, and very well <lb/>
            remember what they said; and I will endeavour to relate the <lb/>
            whole to you from the beginning. [5.] For, by some act of <lb/>
            .a god, I had seated myself alone in the Apodyterium16 where <lb/>
            you saw me: and I had it just in my mind to rise up; but as <lb/>
            I was rising up, there was the accustomed signal of my <lb/>
            Genius. I therefore sat down again ; and soon after those <lb/>
            two, Euthydemus and Dionysodorus, entered, and with them <lb/>
            many others, disciples, it seemed to me; and having entered, <lb/>
            they sauntered about in the covered course (of the gymnasium). <lb/>
            But they had not yet gone two or three rounds, when Clinias <lb/>
            entered, who you say, and say truly, has made a great pro­ <lb/>
            gress. Behind him there were many others his lovers, and <lb/>
            Ctesippus too, a youth of the district of Pæanea,17 very <lb/>
            beautiful and good naturally, except that he was saucy in <lb/>
            consequence of his youth. Clinias, therefore, seeing me from <lb/>
            the entrance sitting alone, came straight towards me, and sate <lb/>
            down on my right hand, as you say. [6.] And Dionysodorus <lb/>
            and Euthydemus perceiving him, at first stopped and con­ <lb/>
            versed with each other, looking at us on this side and on that <lb/>
            —for I beheld them very attentively-and then advancing, <lb/>
            they sate down, Euthydemus by the youth, and the other <lb/>
            (Dionysodorus) by me, on my left hand. The rest seated <lb/>
            themselves just as each happened to do. These therefore I <lb/>
            embraced, not having seen them for some time. After this, <lb/>
            I said to Clinias, These men, Euthydemus and Dionysodorus, <lb/>
            O Clinias, are wise not in small but in great things. For <lb/>
            they know every thing pertaining to war, (and) whatever he. <lb/>
            who would -be a good general, ought (to know , the arrange­ <lb/>
            ment and management of encampments,18 and whatever is to be <lb/>
            taught for engaging with weapons ;18 and they know too how <note type="footnote">16 That part of the gymnasium, in which those who bathed or exer­ <lb/>

            to render a person able to assist himself in courts of justice, <lb/>
            when any one injures him. [7.] For thus speaking, however, <lb/>
            I was held in contempt by them ; and both therefore laughed, <lb/>
            looking at each other. And Euthydemus said, We no longer <lb/>
            engage in these matters as being serious, Socrates, but as of <lb/>
            secondary moment. And I being astonished said, Your <lb/>
            (serious) studies must indeed be beautiful, if such great <lb/>
            affairs are of secondary moment with you. Now by the gods <lb/>
            inform me, what is this beautiful study (of yours).—We <lb/>
            think, Socrates, said he, that we are able of all men to teach <lb/>
            virtue in the best and quickest manner.—O Jupiter! I re­ <lb/>
            plied, what a mighty thing are you telling! From whence <lb/>
            did you get this windfall? ?19 I had hitherto conceived of you, <lb/>
            for the most part, as I just now said, that you were very skil­ <lb/>
            ful in this,20 to fight in arms ; and this I have said respecting <lb/>
            you. For when you first tarried here, I remember, you <lb/>
            publicly boasted of this. But now, if in reality you possess <lb/>
            this science, may you be propitious. For I invoke you, as if <lb/>
            you were gods, entreating you to pardon21 what I have before <lb/>
            said. But see, Euthydemus and Dionysodorus, if you have <lb/>
            boasted truly: for it is by no means wonderful, from the <lb/>
            magnitude of the boast, that a person should disbelieve.—[8.] <lb/>
            Rest assured, Socrates, that it is so, they replied.—I therefore <lb/>
            consider you (said I) much more blessed in this possession, <lb/>
            than is the great king22 in his empire. But tell me thus <lb/>
            much, whether you intend to exhibit this wisdom ? or how <lb/>
            have you determined ?—We are here, Socrates, for this very <lb/>
            purpose, as being about to exhibit and to teach, if any one is <lb/>
            willing to learn. But that all, who do not possess (wisdom), <lb/>
            will be willing to learn, I am a guarantee: first, I myself (am <lb/>
            willing), and next, Clinias here; and in addition to us, <lb/>
            Ctesippus and all the rest here-and I pointed out to him the <note type="footnote"> Ficinus, it is evident that Taylor made his English translation not from <lb/>

            lovers of Clinias, who happened to be standing round us: for <lb/>
            Ctesippus at that time was sitting at a distance from Clinias. <lb/>
            And as it seemed to me,23 Euthydemus, while he was discours­ <lb/>
            ing with me, did by his stooping forward darken Ctesippus's <lb/>
            view of Clinias, who was seated in the middle of us. [9.] <lb/>
            Ctesippus therefore wishing to see his boy-love, and at the <lb/>
            same time curious to hear, was the first to leap up, and stood <lb/>
            directly opposite to me. Thus too the rest, when they saw <lb/>
            him do so, stood around us, both the lovers of Clinias, and the <lb/>
            friends of Euthydemus and Dionysodorus. I therefore, point­ <lb/>
            ing them out to Euthydemus, informed him they were all <lb/>
            ready to learn. And Ctesippus and the rest very readily as­ <lb/>
            sented; and all of them in common exhorted him to exhibit <lb/>
            the power of his wisdom. I therefore said, Do, Euthydemus <lb/>
            and Dionysodorus, by all means gratify these persons, and ex­ <lb/>
            hibit your wisdom for my sake. Now to demonstrate the <lb/>
            most of the things pertaining to this subject will, it is evident, <lb/>
            be no small labour; but tell me this, whether you are able to <lb/>
            make him alone a good man, who is already persuaded that he <lb/>
            ought to be instructed by you, or him also, who is not yet <lb/>
            persuaded, through his not believing that virtue is a thing to <lb/>
            be learnt, or that you are the teachers of it. Come then, (say,) <lb/>
            is it the business of the same art, to persuade a man thus <lb/>
            affected, that virtue may be taught, and that you are the per­ <lb/>
            sons from whom one could learn it the best; or is it of <lb/>
            another?—[10.] It is (the business), Socrates, said Dionyso­ <lb/>
            dorus, of the very same (art).—You therefore, Dionysodorus, <lb/>
            said I, can, the best of all men now existing, exhort to philo­ <lb/>
            sophy and the study of virtue.—We think we can, Socrates. <lb/>
            -Of other things put off, I said, for another time the exhibi­ <lb/>
            tion, but show us this now. Persuade this youth that he <lb/>
            ought to philosophize, and study virtue; and gratify me, and <lb/>
            all these here. For this has happened to him, that both I, <lb/>
            and all these, are desirous for him to become the best (of <lb/>
            men). - Ho is the son of Axiochus, who is descended from <lb/>

            Alcibiades; and his name is Clinias. But he is still young, <lb/>
            and we have a fear about him, as is reasonable in the case of <lb/>
            a youth, lest some one should anticipate us, and by turning his <lb/>
            mind to some other pursuit, corrupt it. [11.] You are there­ <lb/>
            fore come most opportunely; and, if it makes no difference <lb/>
            to you, make a trial of the youth and converse with him be­ <lb/>
            fore us.—When I had thus spoken nearly these very words, <lb/>
            Euthydemus replied with courage, and even with confidence, <lb/>
            It makes no difference, Socrates, if the youth is but willing <lb/>
            to answer.—Nay, I replied, he is accustomed to do this. For <lb/>
            frequently do these coming ask many questions of, and discourse <lb/>
            much with him, so that he is sufficiently bold to answer.24</p>
          <p>But how, 0 Onto, shall I narrate to you correctly what <lb/>
            occurred after this ? For it is no trifling labour to be able to <lb/>
            take up and go through wisdom so boundless. So that I am <lb/>
            compelled, as poets are, in beginning the tale, to invoke the <lb/>
            Muses and Mnemosyne. Euthydemus, then, began, I think, <lb/>
            after some such manner.- Whether, 0 Clinias, are the men <lb/>
            who learn, the wise or the unwise? [12.] But the youth, <lb/>
            through the greatness of the question, blushed, and being at <lb/>
            a loss, looked at me. And I, perceiving he was flurried, <lb/>
            said, Cheer up, Clinias, and answer boldly whatever seems <lb/>
            good to you ; for perhaps you will be benefited 25 to the <lb/>
            greatest extent. Whereupon Dionysodorus, bending a little <lb/>
            towards my ear, and with a smile on his countenance, said, I <lb/>
            tell you beforehand, Socrates, that in whatever manner the <lb/>
            youth may answer, he will be confuted. While he was thus <lb/>
            speaking, Clinias happened to give an answer, so that it was <lb/>
            not possible for me to exhort the youth to be on his guard. <lb/>
            And he answered, that the wise are those who learn. Euthy­ <lb/>
            demus, therefore, said, Do you call certain persons teachers, <lb/>
            or not ?-He admitted he did.—[13.] Are not then teachers <lb/>
            the teachers of those that learn ? As, for instance, a harper <lb/>
            and a grammarian were the teachers of you and other boys, <lb/>

            this, the followers of Dionysodorus and Euthydemus, just like <lb/>
            a chorus on a signal given by the ballet-master, made a great <lb/>
            uproar and laughed. And before the youth could recover his <lb/>
            breath, Dionysodorus, taking him up, said well and cleverly 27 <lb/>
            -But, Clinias, when the grammarian says any thing by word <lb/>
            of mouth, are the boys who learn what he so gives out, the <lb/>
            wise or the unwise?—The wise, said Clinias.—[14.] The wise <lb/>
            therefore learn, and not the ignorant; and you did not rightly <lb/>
            just now answer Euthydemus.—On this, the admirers of these <lb/>
            men laughed very loudly and made an uproar, struck with <lb/>
            their wisdom ; but the rest of us were amazed and remained <lb/>
            silent. Euthydemus, therefore, perceiving our amazement, <lb/>
            that we might yet still more wonder at him, did not let the <lb/>
            lad go, but kept interrogating him ; and, like skilful dancers, <lb/>
            twisted his inquiries about the same thing in a double (maze),28 <lb/>
            and said, Whether do learners learn what they know, or what <lb/>
            they do not know ? And again Dionysodorus said to me in a <lb/>
            whisper, This also, Socrates, is just such another question as <lb/>
            the former.—O Jupiter, said I, even the former question ap­ <lb/>
            peared to be honourable to you.—We always ask, said he, Socra­ <lb/>
            tes, such-like questions, from which there is no escape.—[15.] <lb/>
            Hence you appear to me, said I, to be in high repute amongst <lb/>
            your disciples. In the mean time Clinias gave an answer to <lb/>
            Euthydemus, that learners learn what they do not know. And <lb/>
            Euthydemus interrogated him in the same manner as before. <lb/>
            -Do you not, said he, know your letters ?—I do.-Do you <note type="footnote">26 Bekk. ot <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμαθε</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ς</foreign> apa <foreign xml:lang="grc">μανθάνουσι</foreign>. But after apa two MSS. insert <lb/>

            not then know all ?-He acknowledged it.—When therefore <lb/>
            any one recites any thing, does he not recite letters ?-He <lb/>
            confessed it.—Hence he recites, said he, something of what <lb/>
            you know, if you know all (the letters).—This also he ac­ <lb/>
            knowledged.— What then, said he, do you not learn that, <lb/>
            which some one recites ?-He assented.29—But do you learn,30 <lb/>
            not knowing your letters ?—I do not, (said he,) but I learn, <lb/>
            having known them.31—Do you not therefore learn what you <lb/>
            know, if you know all the letters ?-He acknowledged it.- <lb/>
            Hence, said he, you have not answered rightly.—This had been <lb/>
            spoken not violently32 by Euthydemus, when Dionysodorus, <lb/>
            taking up the discourse, as if it had been a ball, again aimed <lb/>
            at the lad as at a mark, and said, Euthydemus is deceiving <lb/>
            you, Clinias. [16.] For tell me, is it not to learn, to receive <lb/>
            the science of that which any one learns ?—Clinias assented. <lb/>
            -But, to know, said he, is it any thing else than to possess <lb/>
            science ?-He acknowledged (it was nothing else).—To know <lb/>
            not, then, is to not possess science.-He assented to this.- <lb/>
            Whether then are the receivers of a thing, they who possess <lb/>
            it already, or they who do not possess it ?-They who do not <lb/>
            possess it.—Have you not then confessed that they who do <lb/>
            not know, are among those who do not possess ?-He nodded <lb/>
            assent.-They that learn, then, belong to those that receive, <lb/>
            and not to those that possess.-He granted it.-They there­ <lb/>
            fore, Clinias, he said, learn, who know not; and not they who <lb/>
            know. After this Euthydemus rushed to the third, as it were, <lb/>

            to console him, Do not wonder, Clinias, if these discourses ap­ <lb/>
            pear to you to be unusual.35 [17.] For perhaps you do not <lb/>
            perceive what the two strangers are doing about you. They <lb/>
            are doing the same, that persons do in the initiation of the <lb/>
            Corybantes, when they make an enthronement for him whom <lb/>
            they are about to initiate; for there takes place the leading <lb/>
            out to dance and sports, (as I think you would understand)36 <lb/>
            if you had been initiated in these mysteries. And now these do <lb/>
            nothing else but dance, and, as it were, sportively leap round, <lb/>
            as if after this they would initiate you. Now therefore think <lb/>
            that you have heard the first part of the sacred rites of so­ <lb/>
            phists. For, in the first place, as Prodicus says, it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary to learn the proper signification of words; which these <lb/>
            strangers exhibit to you, because you have not perceived that <lb/>
            men apply "to learn " to a thing of this kind, when any one, <lb/>
            having at first no knowledge respecting a thing, afterwards re­ <lb/>
            ceives the knowledge of it; and when any one, having this <lb/>
            knowledge, does by this very knowledge look into the very <lb/>
            same thing, either while being done or being said. But they <lb/>
            rather call this "to comprehend" than "to learn;" although <lb/>
            sometimes they call it " to learn." But this, as they show, <lb/>
            has lain hid from you, that the same word is applied to per­ <lb/>
            sons affected in a contrary manner, both to him who knows, <lb/>
            and to him who does not know. [18.] Similar to this is <lb/>
            that which was in the second question; in which they asked <lb/>
            you, whether men learn what they know, or what they do not. <lb/>
            These indeed are the playthings of learning. Hence I say <lb/>
            that these men are playing with you. But I call these a play­ <lb/>
            thing on this account; because, although some one may learn <lb/>
            many, or even all such particulars as these, yet he would not <lb/>
            in any respect know better how things exist. However, by <lb/>
            the difference of words he may play with men, tripping up <lb/>
            and overturning what they assert; just as they do, who, <lb/>
            drawing away the stools from under those, who are going to <note type="footnote"> 35 There is evidently something wrong here. For the reasonings of <lb/>
            the two sophists more than seemed to be unusual. They were really so. <lb/>

              sit down, are delighted and laugh, when they see him whom <lb/>

              what they promised me.. For they said they would .exhibit <lb/>
              their exhortatory wisdom: but now, it appears to me, they <lb/>
              have thought it was requisite first to play with you.</p>
          <p>[19.] Thus far therefore, Euthydemus and Dionysodorus, <lb/>
            let it have been made a sport by you; and there is perhaps <lb/>
            enough of it. But in the next place exhort the lad, and show <lb/>
            how he must pay attention to wisdom and virtue. But first <lb/>
            I will point out to you how I understand the matter, and what <lb/>
            I desire to hear concerning it: If, then, I shall appear to you <lb/>
            to do this in a simple and ridiculous manner, do not laugh at <lb/>
            me; for, through a desire of hearing your wisdom, I will <lb/>
            venture for a time to speak before you off-hand. Endure <lb/>
            therefore to hear me, both you and your disciples, without <lb/>
            laughing : but do you, 0 son of Axiochus, answer me.—Do <lb/>
            we not all then wish to do well ? Or is this question one of <lb/>
            the ridiculous, of which I was just now afraid? For surely <lb/>
            it is stupid to ask questions of this kind; for who is there <lb/>
            that does not wish to do well ?- There is no one that does not, <lb/>
            said Clinias.—[20.] Be it so, said I.—But in the next place, <lb/>
            since we wish to do well, in what manner shall we do well ? <lb/>
            Shall we say, if we have many good things ? Or is this an­ <lb/>
            swer still more stupid than the former ? for it is evident that <lb/>
            this also must be the case.-He assented.-But come, what <lb/>
            are the things, of those that exist, good for us ? Or does it ap­ <lb/>
            pear to be a thing neither difficult, nor belonging to a solemn <lb/>
            person,37 to be at no loss 38 in this ? For every one will tell <lb/>
            us that it is good to be rich; will they not ?-Certainly, said <lb/>
            he.-And is it not also (good) to be in health, to be beautiful, <lb/>
            and to be sufficiently furnished with other things pertaining to <lb/>
            the body ?-So it appeared to him.—But nobility also, power, <lb/>

            mitted it.-What then, said I, yet remains for us among things <lb/>
            good? Is it to be temperate, just, and brave? Whether, by <lb/>
            Jupiter, Clinias, do you think that we shall put down these <lb/>
            things properly, if we consider them as good ? or if we do <lb/>
            not ? for perhaps this may be disputed by some one. But <lb/>
            how does it appear to you ?-That they are good, said Clinias. <lb/>
            —[21.] Be it so, said I; but in what part of the chorus shall <lb/>
            we place wisdom ? among things good ? or how say you ?— <lb/>
            Among things good.-But consider lest among things good <lb/>
            we omit what is worthy of mention.-But, said Clinias, we ap­ <lb/>
            pear (to have omitted) nothing.-However, I recollecting said, <lb/>
            But, by Jupiter, we appear to have nearly omitted the greatest <lb/>
            of things good.-What is that ? said he.-Felicity, Clinias ; <lb/>
            which all men, and even the very bad, say is the greatest good. <lb/>
            —What you say is true, said he.-And I again, correcting my­ <lb/>
            self, said, We have nearly, both I and thou, son of Axiochus, <lb/>
            rendered ourselves ridiculous to these strangers.-How so ? <lb/>
            said he.-Because, having placed felicity in the things we be­ <lb/>
            fore enumerated, we now again speak of it.-But why is this <lb/>
            (improper) ?-It is surely ridiculous to adduce that again, <lb/>
            which was formerly proposed, and to say the same things <lb/>
            twice.—[22.] How do you mean ? said he. Wisdom, I re­ <lb/>
            plied, is certainly felicity: this even a boy knows.-And he <lb/>
            indeed was astonished, so young and simple is he. And I, <lb/>
            perceiving his astonishment, said, Do you not know, Clinias, <lb/>
            that as regards the felicity of flute-playing, flute-players are <lb/>
            the most happy?—He admitted it.-Are not then, said I, <lb/>
            grammarians also (most happy) as regards (the felicity of) <lb/>
            writing and reading ?-Certainly.-But what, as regards the <lb/>
            dangers of the sea, do you think that any one, so to say gener­ <lb/>
            ally, are more happy than wise pilots ?-Certainly not.-Again, <lb/>
            With whom would you, when in the army, more readily share <lb/>
            in danger and fortune ? with a clever, or ignorant general ? <lb/>
            -With a wise one.-And under whom would you, when <lb/>
            you are dangerously ill, more readily be ? under a clever or <lb/>
            ignorant physician ?-Under a clever one.-Is it not there­ <lb/>
            fore, said I, because you think that you would do better, by <lb/>
            acting with a wise person than an ignorant one ?-He granted <lb/>
            it.-Wisdom, then, every where renders men happy ; for <lb/>
            surely no one can ever err through wisdom ; but through this <lb/>
            he must act rightly, and obtain (his end): for otherwise it <lb/>
             <pb n="63"/>
            would not be wisdom.—[23.] At length, I know not how, we <lb/>
            summarily agreed that this was the case; that, to whom wis­ <lb/>
            dom is present, to him nothing of felicity is wanting.</p>
          <p>After we had agreed on this point, I again asked him, how <lb/>
            with regard to us would be what had been previously admit­ <lb/>
            ted ? For, said I, we admitted that if many good things were <lb/>
            present with us, we should be happy and do well.-He as­ <lb/>
            sented to this.- Should we then be happy through present <lb/>
            good, if it did not benefit us, or if it did ?-If it benefited us, <lb/>
            said he.-Would then any thing benefit us, if we only pos­ <lb/>
            sessed it, but did not use it ? As, for instance, if we pos­ <lb/>
            sessed much food, but did not eat it; or drink, but did not <lb/>
            drink it; could we be benefited at all ?-Certainly not, said <lb/>
            he.-But if all artificers had every thing requisite prepared <lb/>
            for them, each for his own work, but did not use them, when <lb/>
            thus procured, would they do well [through the possession]39 <lb/>
            merely, because they possessed every thing which an artificer <lb/>
            ought to possess ? Thus, if a carpenter had all kinds of in­ <lb/>
            struments and wood prepared for him in sufficiency, but yet <lb/>
            should fashion nothing, would he be benefited at all from the <lb/>
            possession ?-By no means, said he.—[24.] But what, should <lb/>
            any one possess wealth, and all such things as we now de­ <lb/>
            nominate good, and should not use them, would he be happy <lb/>
            through the possession of these goods ?-He certainly would <lb/>
            not, Socrates.—It is necessary then, said I, as it seems, that <lb/>
            he, who is to be happy, should not only possess good things <lb/>
            of this kind, but should likewise use them.—You speak truly. <lb/>
            -Is not then, Clinias, the possession and the use of good <lb/>
            sufficient to make any one happy ?-It appears so to me.— <lb/>
            Whether, said I, if any one uses good things properly, or if <lb/>
            he does not?—If he uses them properly.—You say correctly, <lb/>
            said I, for I think the evil is greater if a person uses any <lb/>
            thing whatever not correctly, than if he lets it alone. For <lb/>
            the former is wrong; but the latter is neither right nor wrong; <lb/>
            or do we not say so ?-He assented.—What then ? In the <lb/>
            workmanship and use of things pertaining to wood, is there <lb/>
            any thing else that produces a right use than the science of <note type="footnote"> 39 These words are evidently a needless repetition; or else we must <lb/>
            adopt what Ficinus found in his MS., and thus translated into Latin, <lb/>

            a carpenter ?-Certainly not, said he.-So too, in the work­ <lb/>

            a right (use).40—He admitted it--[25.] Whether then, said <lb/>

            directing properly action, which enables us to use every thing <lb/>
            of this kind properly, or is it any thing else ?- It is science, <lb/>
            said he.—Scienee, then, imparts to men in possession and <lb/>
            action, not only happiness, but, as it seems, likewise the well­ <lb/>
            doing.-He confessed it.</p>
          <p>Is there then, said I, by Jupiter, any advantage to be de­ <lb/>
            rived from other possessions, without prudence and wisdom ? <lb/>
            Will a man be benefited, who, without intellect, possesses <lb/>
            many things, and performs many actions ? or, with intellect, <lb/>
            possesses and performs a few ? Consider it thus. Will he <lb/>
            not, by doing less, err less ? and erring less, will he not act <lb/>
            less improperly ? And acting less improperly, will he not be <lb/>
            less miserable ?-Entirely so, said he.- Whether then will he <lb/>
            perform fewer things being poor, than being rieh ?-Being <lb/>
            poor, said he.-And whether being weak or strong ?-Being <lb/>
            weak. — Whether also, being honoured or dishonoured ?— <lb/>
            Being dishonoured.-And whether, being brave and temper­ <lb/>
            ate,41 will he do less, or being timid ?-Being timid ?—[26.] <lb/>
            (Will not then this happen) if he is indolent rather than ac­ <lb/>
            tive ?-He admitted it.-And if he is slow, rather than quick ? <lb/>
            and if he sees and hears dully, rather than quiekly ?-In every <lb/>
            thing of this kind we agreed with eaeh other.-And to erown <lb/>
            all, I said, it very nearly appears, Clinias, that, with respect <lb/>
            to all the things whieh we first asserted to be good, the con­ <lb/>
            clusion is not about this, that they are, taken by themselves, <lb/>
            good naturally, but, as it seems, that they exist in this man­ <lb/>
            ner ; that if ignorance guides them, they are greater evils <lb/>
            than their contraries, by how mueh the more capable they are <lb/>
            of ministering to that evil leader; but that if prudence and <lb/>
            wisdom lead them, they are greater goods; but that taken by <lb/>
            themselves, neither of them is of any worth.-It appears, <note type="footnote"> 40 In the Greek, after TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρθῶς</foreign>, Stalbaum thinks <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρη̃σθαι</foreign>, found just <lb/>

            said he, to be as you say.—What then, from what has been <lb/>
            said, takes place to us ? Is it any thing else than this, that <lb/>
            not one of the other things is either good or evil, but that <lb/>
            of these, being two, wisdom is a good but ignorance an ill ?— <lb/>
            He assented.</p>
          <p>Let us then, said I, consider further, what still remains. <lb/>
            Since we all of us are eager to be happy, and we appear to <lb/>
            become such from using things, and from using them rightly, <lb/>
            and science affords the correctness (of use)42 and felicity, it is <lb/>
            requisite, as it seems, that every man should by all possible <lb/>
            means endeavour to become most wise; or is it not so ?-It <lb/>
            is so, said he.—[27.] And he ought to think43 that he receives <lb/>
            this from his father, guardians, friends, and the rest, who pro­ <lb/>
            fess themselves to be his lovers, much more than wealth ; and <lb/>
            to beg and pray strangers and fellow-citizens to impart wis­ <lb/>
            dom, is in no respect base; nor is it reprehensible, Clinias, <lb/>
            for the sake of this, to act the minister and slave to a lover <lb/>
            and to every man, and to willingly serve him in any honour­ <lb/>
            able service whatever, through an ardent desire of becoming <lb/>
            wise. Or does it not appear so to you ? said I.—You appear, <lb/>
            said he, to me to speak very well.—If, said I, Clinias, wisdom <lb/>
            can indeed be taught, and does not exist of its own accord <lb/>
            among men. For this is yet to be considered by us, and has <lb/>
            not yet been assented to by me and you.—But to me, said he, <lb/>
            Socrates, it appears that it can be taught.-And I, being de­ <lb/>
            lighted, said, you speak beautifully, 0 best of men; and you <lb/>
            have done well in liberating me from a long inquiry about <lb/>
            this very thing, whether wisdom can, or cannot be taught.44 <lb/>
            [28.] Now therefore since it appears to you that it can be <lb/>
            taught, and that it is the only thing which can make a man <lb/>
            happy and prosperous, would you say that any thing else is <lb/>
            necessary than to philosophize ? And have you a mind to do <lb/>
            this ?-Entirely so, Socrates, said he, as much as possible.- <note type="footnote"> 42 The words " of use," have been inserted from Ficinus, " rectitu­ <lb/>

            And I, delighted to hear this, said, My pattern, 0 Dionyso­ <lb/>
            dorus and Euthydemus, of exhortatory discourses, such as I <lb/>
            desired them to be, is of this kind, like a common person's <lb/>
            perhaps, and stated at length with difficulty: but let which­ <lb/>
            ever of you is willing, do this very thing according to art, and <lb/>
            exhibit it to us. But if you are not willing to do this, show to <lb/>
            the lad in order, from the point where I left off, whether he <lb/>
            ought to get every science, or whether there is one, which, <lb/>
            when he gets it, he will necessarily be a happy and good man ; <lb/>
            and what that science is. For, as I said in the beginning, it is <lb/>
            of great consequence to us that this youth should become <lb/>
            wise and good.</p>
          <p>[29.] This then, Crito, did I say; and I paid. very great <lb/>
            attention to what followed, and considered after what manner <lb/>
            they would handle the discourse, and whence they would <lb/>
            begin, while they were exhorting the youth to study wisdom <lb/>
            and virtue. Dionysodorus then, who was the elder of them, first <lb/>
            began the conference; and all of us looked at him, as about <lb/>
            to hear immediately some wonderful reasons; which indeed <lb/>
            happened to us. For the man, Crito, commenced an admirable <lb/>
            discourse, which it is proper for you to hear, as being an ex­ <lb/>
            hortation to virtue.</p>
          <p>Tell me, Socrates, said he, and the rest of you, who express <lb/>
            a desire for this youth to become wise, whether you are jest­ <lb/>
            ing when you make this assertion, or truly and seriously <lb/>
            desire it ?-It was then I perceived, that they thought we <lb/>
            had been previously jesting, when we exhorted them to con­ <lb/>
            verse with the youth, and that on this account they too had <lb/>
            been jesting, and had not been acting seriously by him. Per­ <lb/>
            ceiving this, I said still more strongly, that we were serious <lb/>
            in a wonderful degree. And Dionysodorus said, See, Socrates <lb/>
            that you do not (hereafter) deny what you now assert.—I <lb/>
            have considered this, said I: for I shall never deny it.—[30.] <lb/>
            What is it then, said he ? Say you that you wish him to be­ <lb/>
            come wise ?-Certainly.-But, said he, is Clinias now wise or <lb/>
            not ?-He says, not yet at all, and he is no braggart.-But do <lb/>
            you, said he, wish him to become wise, and not be unlearned? <lb/>
            —We acknowledged it.-Do you not then wish him to be­ <lb/>
            come what he is not; and to be no longer what he now is ?— <lb/>
            And I, on hearing this, was confused. But he, on my being <lb/>
            confused, taking up the discourse, said, Since you wish him <lb/>
             <pb n="67"/>
            to be no longer what he now is, you wish, as "it seems, for <lb/>
            him to perish. And yet such friends and lovers would cer­ <lb/>
            tainly be of much worthy who should consider it a thing of <lb/>
            great moment for their boy-loves to perish. Ctesippus on <lb/>
            hearing this was indignant, on account of his love for the <lb/>
            youth ; and said, 0 Thurian stranger, if it were not rather <lb/>
            rude to say so, I would say, On your head be the evil ;4G for <lb/>
            knowing what do you falsely ascribe to me and the rest a <lb/>
            thing of this kind, which I think it is unholy to assert, that I <lb/>
            should be willing for this youth to perish.</p>
          <p>[31.] But, said Euthydemus, does it appear to you, <lb/>
            Ctesippus, that it is possible to speak falsely ?-By Jupiter, <lb/>
            said he, it does, unless I am mad.—Whether, when a person <lb/>
            is asserting a thing about which there is a discourse, or when <lb/>
            not asserting it.-When asserting it.-If then he asserts <lb/>
            it, he does not say any thing else of things existing than <lb/>
            what he asserts ?-For how should he do otherwise, said <lb/>
            Ctesippus ?-But of existing things that, of which he speaks, <lb/>
            is one apart from the rest.-Certainly.-Does he then, when <lb/>
            he speaks of that thing, not speak of that which has a being ? <lb/>
            —Yes.—But he who speaks of that which is, and of existing <lb/>
            beings, speaks the truth ; so that if Dionysodorus speaks of <lb/>
            beings, he speaks the truth, and utters nothing false against <lb/>
            you.—He does so, said he ; but he, who says this, added <lb/>
            Ctesippus, does not speak, Euthydemus, of beings.- To this <lb/>
            Euthydemus (replied), Are non-entities any thing else than <lb/>
            things which are not ?- They are not.- Therefore, non-entities <lb/>
            are beings no where.-No where.-Is it possible then for any <lb/>
            one to do any thing about non-entities, so as to make them to <lb/>
            exist no where ?47—It does not appear to me, said Ctesippus, <lb/>
            that he can.—[32.] What then ? When orators speak to <note type="footnote"> 45 Unless this is said ironically, the sense would require, as Taylor <lb/>

            He assented.-But no one, said he, speaks of non-entities: for <lb/>
            he would make something; but you have acknowledged that <lb/>
            no one can make non-entities: so that, according to your rea­ <lb/>
            soning, no one can assert things which are false; but if Diony­ <lb/>
            sodorus speaks, he speaks things which are true, and he speaks <lb/>
            of entities.—By Jupiter, said Ctesippus, (it is so,) Euthydemus. <lb/>
            Yet he speaks of entities after a certain manner, though not as <lb/>
            they subsist.-How say you, Ctesippus ? said Dionysodorus. <lb/>
            Are there some who speak of things as they are ?- There are <lb/>
            indeed, said he; and these are men worthy and good, and <lb/>
            who assert things which are true.-What then ? said he ; are <lb/>
            not good things, well, and things evil, ill-conditioned ?—[33.] <lb/>
            He conceded.-And do you not acknowledge that the worthy <lb/>
            and the good speak of things as they are ?—I do.-The good <lb/>
            therefore, Ctesippus, said he, speak ill of evil things, if they <lb/>
            speak of them as they are.-Truly, said he, by Jupiter, they <lb/>
            do very much so of bad men, for example ; among whom, if <lb/>
            you are persuaded by me, you will be careful not to be num­ <lb/>
            bered, lest the good should speak ill of you; because you well <lb/>
            know that the good speak ill of the bad.-Do they not also, <lb/>
            said Euthydemus, speak in high terms of great men, and in <lb/>
            warm terms of the fervent?—Very much so indeed, said Cte­ <lb/>
            sippus ; of cold men therefore they speak coldly, and assert <lb/>
            that they converse (frigidly).49—You are abusive, Ctesippus, <lb/>
            said Dionysodorus, you are abusive.-Not I, by Jupiter, said <lb/>

            Certainly, said he.—Whether, then, as each thing is, or as it <lb/>

            less ?- Whether then, said he, shall we contradict, if we both of <lb/>
            us pronounce 56 the word for the same thing, or shall we thus <lb/>
            assert the same thing ?-He admitted (we should).—But, said <lb/>
            lie, when neither of us gives the word for that thing, shall we <lb/>
            then contradict ? Or, (will it not follow,) that thus neither will <lb/>
            have made any mention at all of the thing ?-And this too he <lb/>
            granted.-But, said he, when I pronounce the word for that <lb/>
            thing, and you for some other thing, do we then contradict each <lb/>
            other ? Or do I then speak of that thing, but you do not speak <lb/>
            of it in any respect whatever ? And how can he, who does <lb/>
            not speak of a thing, contradict him who does ?</p>
          <p>And Ctesippus indeed was then silent. But I, wondering <lb/>
            at the reasoning, said, How say you, Dionysodorus? For, <lb/>
            though I have heard this reasoning often, and from many, yet <lb/>
            I have always wondered at it. For Protagoras and others <lb/>
            still more ancient have made much use of it. But to me it <lb/>
            always appears to be wonderful, through its subverting the <lb/>
            reasoning of others and itself too. I think, however, that I <note type="footnote"> 53—53 Such is the literal translation of this passage; out of which none <lb/>

            shall learn its truth the best from you. [37.]57 Is the reason­ <lb/>
            ing then other (than this), that it is not possible to assert <lb/>
            things which are false ? For this is the force of the argument. <lb/>
            Is it not? And that the speaker asserts things which are <lb/>
            true, or does not assert?57 He admitted it. Whether, then, <lb/>
            is it not possible to assert things which are false, but possible <lb/>
            to form a false opinion ?-It is not possible, said he, to form <lb/>
            even a false opinion.—There is then, said I, no such thing as <lb/>
            a false opinion at all.-There is not, said he.-Neither then <lb/>
            is there ignorance, nor are there ignorant persons. Or would <lb/>
            not this be ignorance, if there were the power to speak <lb/>
            falsely of things ?-Certainly, said he.-But, said I, this is <lb/>
            not possible.-It is not, said he.-Do you make this assertion, <lb/>
            Dionysodorus, for the sake of talking, that you may say what <lb/>
            is strange ? or do you really think that no man is ignorant ? <lb/>
            -Confute, said he, the assertion. Is it possible, according to <lb/>
            your assertion, to confute when no man speaks falsely ?-It is <lb/>
            not, said Euthydemus.—Neither did I, said Dionysodorus, <lb/>
            order you to confute.58 For how can any one order that, <lb/>
            which does not exist ?—0 Euthydemus, I said, I do not clearly <lb/>
            understand these clever and coherent assertions; but I have <lb/>
            somehow a muddled perception of them. Perhaps then I <lb/>
            shall ask something rather unpleasant; but do you pardon me. <lb/>
            See then. [38.] For if it is neither possible to speak falsely, <lb/>
            nor to entertain a false opinion, nor to be ignorant, neither is <lb/>
            it possible for any one to err, when he does any thing. For <note type="footnote"> 57—57 Here too is another passage, which Heusde was the first to confess <lb/>
            had become confused. Ficinus has, what is at least intelligible, " Num <lb/>

              emendation so simple has been rejected by Winckelmann, who fancies <lb/>

              very wisely, that no one will easily discover, by conjecture, what Plato <lb/>
              really wrote. He was then not aware, that there is a lacuna here, supplied <lb/>
              in part by three MSS.: .. And do you not order me now, Euthydemus, <lb/>

              the doer cannot err in what he does. Do you not say so ?— <lb/>
              Just so, said he.-This then, said I, is the unpleasant question. <lb/>
              For if we do not err, either acting, or speaking, or thinking, <lb/>
              if this be the case, of what, by Jupiter, are ye come as the <lb/>
              teachers ? Did you not just now say, that you could, the best <lb/>
              of all men, impart virtue to a person willing to learn ?- Then <lb/>
              said Dionysodorus, taking up the discourse, Are you such a <lb/>
              crone,59 Socrates, as to remember now what we first said, and <lb/>
              would even now remember any thing I said last year, yet do <lb/>
              not know how to use what has been said at present ?-For <lb/>
              (the words), said I, are difficult (to understand), and very <lb/>
              reasonably so; for they are spoken by wise men ; since it is <lb/>
              very difficult to make use of the last words you are saying. <lb/>
              For what do you mean, Dionysodorus, by the expression, " I <lb/>
              know not how to use"? Does it not mean this, that I do not <lb/>
              know how to confute it ? Since,60 tell me, what other con­ <lb/>
              ception do you form of these words, " I do not know how to <lb/>
              use the words.”—[39.] But what you say, said he, this is <lb/>
              very difficult to use. Since60 answer.—(What,) before you <lb/>
              have answered Dionysodorus ? said I.—Will you not answer ? <lb/>
              said he.-Is it just? (said I).—It is certainly just, said he.- <lb/>
              For what reason ? said I. Or is it plain that it is for this ; <lb/>
              because you, a very wise person in words, have now come to <lb/>
              us, and know when you ought to answer, and when not; and <lb/>
              now you will not answer a jot, as knowing that you ought <lb/>
              not.—You are a babbler, said he, and are careless in answer­ <lb/>
              ing. But, my good man, be obedient and answer; since you <lb/>
              acknowledge that I am a wise man.—I must yield then, said <lb/>
              I, and, as it seems, to necessity; for you are the ruler. Ask, <lb/>
              then.- Whether then do things that have a soul understand ? <lb/>
              or soul-less things also ?-Those that have a soul.-Do you <lb/>
              know then, said he, any word that has a soul ?-Not I, by <lb/>
              Jupiter.—[40.] Why then did you just now ask me, what <lb/>
              my word understood?61—For what else, said I, than because <note type="footnote"> 59 The English " crone " is evidently derived from the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">κρόνος</foreign>, <lb/>

              I have erred through my stupidity: or, did I not err, but <lb/>
              rightly said this too, when I asserted that my words under­ <lb/>
              stood ? Whether then will you say that I did err, or I did <lb/>
              not? For if I have not erred, neither will you confute, <lb/>
              although you are a wise man; nor have you the power to <lb/>
              make use of my assertion; but if I have erred, neither thus <lb/>
              do you speak rightly, in saying that it is not possible to err. <lb/>
              And I say this not in opposition to what you asserted last <lb/>
              year. But this discourse, said I, 0 Dionysodorus and Euthy­ <lb/>
              demus, seems to remain in the same state, and still, as of old, <lb/>
              having thrown down others, to fall itself; nor for this not to <lb/>
              happen has it been discovered even by your art, and this too <lb/>
              so wonderful for the accuracy of reasoning.—Ctesippus then <lb/>
              said, You certainly say wonderful things, 0 men of Thurii <lb/>
              or Chios, or from whatever place you are, and by whatever <lb/>
              name you delight to be called; as you care not to talk wildly. <lb/>
              —[41.] And I, fearing lest reviling should take place, again <lb/>
              softened down Ctesippus, and said, What I told Clinias just <lb/>
              now, I say also, Ctesippus, to you, that you do not know the <lb/>
              wisdom of these strangers how wonderful it is. They are, <lb/>
              however, unwilling to exhibit it to us seriously; but are imi­ <lb/>

              rate ourselves from the men, till they have thoroughly shown <lb/>
              us on what point they are serious ; for I think that something <lb/>
              of theirs very beautiful will appear, when they begin to be <lb/>
              serious; and let us beg and exhort and pray them to exhibit <lb/>
              themselves thoroughly.</p>
          <p>It seems then good to me to again point out in what man­ <lb/>

            think, we broke off some where there, when we acknowledged <lb/>

            so? said I.—Yes, said he.-By possessing then what know­ <lb/>
            ledge, shall we rightly possess it ? Is not this the simple fact, <lb/>
            that (it is by possessing) that (knowledge) which will benefit <lb/>
            us ?-Certainly, said he.- Would it then benefit us at all, if <lb/>
            we knew to know64 by going about in what part of the earth <lb/>
            the most gold had been dug?—Perhaps so, said he.---:But <lb/>
            formerly, I replied, this was our decision, that we should gain <lb/>
            nothing, even though, without labour, and without digging <lb/>
            the earth, all the gold (that exists) should be ours. So that <lb/>
            if we knew how to make the rocks of gold,65 even this know­ <lb/>
            ledge would be nothing worth: for if we knew not how to <lb/>
            use the gold, (its possession) would appear to be of no ad­ <lb/>
            vantage. Or do you not remember? said I.—I remember <lb/>
            very well, said he.-Nor, as it seems, will any advantage be <lb/>
            derived from any other science, either relating to money <lb/>
            matters or to medicine, or to any other, by which a person <lb/>
            knows how to make any thing, but does not (know) how to <lb/>
            use what he makes. Is it not so -?-He assented.-Nor even <lb/>
            if there were a science to make men immortal, without their <lb/>
            knowing how to make use of such immortality, would there <lb/>
            be, it seems, any advantage from it, if it is fair to infer any <lb/>

          <p>[43.] There is a need then, 0 handsome youth, of some sci­ <lb/>

            one makes.-It appears so, said he.—66We are far then, it <lb/>
            seems, from being skilful lyre-makers, or from possessing any <lb/>
            knowledge of that kind-; for there the art that makes is on <lb/>
            one side, and on the other the art that uses, (and there is a <lb/>
            division about the same thing).66 For the lyre-making and <lb/>
            the harp-making (arts) differ very much from each other. Is <lb/>
            it not so?—He assented.-Nor shall we, it is plain, require <lb/>
            the flute-making art: for this is another such-like art.67—He <lb/>
            was of that opinion.-But, by the gods, said I, if we should <lb/>
            learn the art of composing speeches, is this the art from the <lb/>
            possession of which we should be happy ?—I think not, said <lb/>
            Clinias, taking up the (discourse).68—Of what proof, said I, <lb/>
            do you make use ?—I see, said he, some speech-makers, who <lb/>
            do not know how to use their own speeches that they make <lb/>
            themselves, just as lyre-makers do with their lyres;69 but <lb/>
            here are others able to use the speeches which those have <lb/>
            made, although unable to make speeches themselves. It is <lb/>
            plain, then, that with respect to speeches, the art of making <lb/>
            is separate from the art of using them.—[44.] You appear to <lb/>
            me, said I, to give a sufficient proof that the art of speech- <lb/>
            makers is not that art, by the possession of which a person <lb/>
            would be happy; and yet I thought that here would appear <lb/>
            the science, of which for a long time we have been in search. <lb/>

            This, however, is by no means wonderful. For it is a por­ <lb/>
            tion of the art of charming, and is but a little inferior to it; <lb/>
            for the art of charming is that by which vipers,70 and pha­ <lb/>
            langia,71 and scorpions, and other wild animals, and even <lb/>
            diseases are charmed ; but this happens to be the charming <lb/>
            and soothing of judges, and of persons assembling at public <lb/>
            meetings, and of other mobs. Or are you of a different <lb/>
            opinion ?—I am not, said he; but it appears to me as you <lb/>
            say.—Where then, said I, shall we yet turn ourselves ? to <lb/>
            what art ?—I do not well see the way, said he.-But I think, <lb/>
            said I, that I have discovered (the art).—What is it ? said <lb/>
            Clinias.—The art of a general, said I, appears to me,' more <lb/>
            than any other, to be that, by possessing which a person would <lb/>
            be happy.-It does not appear so to me.—Why not ? said I.- <lb/>
            This is certainly a man-hunting art.-What then ? said I.- <lb/>
            [45.] No (part), said he, of the hunting art itself72 extends <lb/>
            beyond hunting and getting into the hand; but when persons <lb/>
            have got into their hands what they have hunted, they are <lb/>
            not able to use it; but hunters and fishermen assign it to <lb/>
            cooks. But on the contrary, geometricians, astronomers, and <lb/>
            those skilled in arithmetic-for these also are of the hunting <lb/>
            art—for each of these73 do not make diagrams, but find out <lb/>
            things existing. As then not knowing how to use them, but <lb/>
            only to hunt for them, they deliver up their inventions for <lb/>
            those to make a bad use74 of in dialectics-such at least of them <lb/>
            as are not very stupid.-Be it so, I said, 0 most beautiful and <lb/>
            most wise Clinias. But is such the case ?-Certainly. And <lb/>
            thus in the same manner, said he, generals, when they have <lb/>
            taken a city or camp, deliver it over to statesmen; for they <lb/>
            know not how to use the things they have taken; just as, I <note type="footnote"> 70 Routh quotes from Virgil, Æn. vii. 755, " Vipereo generi et graviter <lb/>

            it possesses, and is such an art as will render us happy, we <lb/>
            must, said he, instead of the general's seek out some other art.</p>
          <p>Cri. What say you, Socrates ? Did that lad talk thus ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Do you not think he did, Crito ?</p>
          <p>Cri. By Jupiter, I do not indeed. For I think if he had <lb/>
            spoken thus, he would not have wanted either Euthydemus <lb/>
            or any other man for his instruction.</p>
          <p>Soc. But, by Jupiter, was it not Ctesippus that spoke thus ? <lb/>
            for I do not remember.</p>
          <p>Cri. What, Ctesippus?</p>
          <p>Soc. This, however, I well know, that it was neither Eu­ <lb/>
            thydemus nor Dionysodorus who spoke thus. But, good <lb/>
            Crito, was it not some divinity, who being present said these <lb/>
            things ? For I well know that I heard them.</p>
          <p>Cri. It is so, by Jupiter, Socrates; and to me it appears <lb/>
            very much so indeed, to have been some divinity. But after <lb/>
            this, did you still search out any art?' And have you dis­ <lb/>
            covered or not that, for the sake of which you made the <lb/>
            search ? ,</p>
          <p>[47.] Soc. Whence, blessed man, did we discover it ? But <lb/>
            we were altogether a subject of laughter, like children that <lb/>
            run after larks; for we continually thought we should imme­ <lb/>
            diately catch each of the sciences, but they were always <lb/>
            flying secretly away. Why therefore should I speak to you <lb/>
            about the majority ? But when we came to the regal art, and <lb/>
            thoroughly considered whether it is that, which imparts and <lb/>
            works out happiness, here falling, as it were, into a labyrinth, <lb/>
            when we thought we were now at the end, we again turned <lb/>
            round in our course, and appeared to be at the beginning of <lb/>
            our inquiry, and we wanted just as much (of the mark), as <lb/>
            when we were first making the search.</p>
          <p>Cri. But how did this happen, Socrates, to you ?</p>
          <p>Soc. I will tell you.' For the art of the statesman and that <lb/>
            of the king it has been determined by us are the same.</p>
          <p>[48.] Cri. What then ?75</p>
          <p>Soc. To this art then, as alone knowing how to make a <lb/>
            proper use of things, have the general's art and the other arts <note type="footnote"> 75 This question is omitted by Ficinus. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="78"/>
            (determined)76 to give dominion over those works of which <lb/>
            they are the mere artisans. This then clearly appeared to us <lb/>
            to be the art we were seeking, and the cause of good conduct <lb/>
            in a city; and really, according to the Iambic verse of <lb/>
            Æschylus,77 that it alone is seated in the stern of the city, <lb/>
            directing, as by the rudder, all things, and commanding all <lb/>
            persons to do all things useful.</p>
          <p>Cri. Does not this then appear to you to be well said <lb/>
            respecting this art ?</p>
          <p>Soc. You shall judge, Crito, if you are willing to hear what <lb/>
            after this happened to us. For we were considering again <lb/>
            somehow thus. Does that regal art, which rules over all, <lb/>
            effect any thing for us or nothing? We said to each other <lb/>
            that it certainly will. For would not you too assert this, <lb/>
            Crito ?</p>
          <p>Cri. I would.</p>
          <p>Soc. What then would you say is its effect? Just as if I <lb/>
            should ask you, what effect does the physician's art produce <lb/>
            in all the things over which it rules ? Would you not say it <lb/>
            is health ?</p>
          <p>Cri. I should.</p>
          <p>[49.] Soc. And what does agriculture, your art, effect in <lb/>
            all the things over which it rules ? Would you not say that <lb/>
            it affords us food from the earth ?</p>
          <p>Cri. I would.</p>
          <p>Soc. And what does the regal art effect, while it commands <lb/>
            every tiling over which it rules ? Perhaps you do not very <lb/>
            well see your way.</p>
          <p>Cri. I do not, by Jupiter, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Soc. Nor do we, Onto. But thus much at least you know, <lb/>
            that if it is that art, which we are seeking, it ought to be useful.</p>
          <p>Cri. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. Ought it not, therefore, to impart to us a certain <lb/>
            good?</p>
          <p>Cri. Necessarily so, Socrates. <note type="footnote"> 76 Heindorf says that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ε̎δοξ</foreign>a<foreign xml:lang="grc">ν</foreign> may easily be supplied from the pre­ <lb/>

            Soc. But we have acknowledged to each other, I and Cli­ <lb/>
            nias, that good is nothing else than a certain science.</p>
          <p>Cri. Yes, you did say so.</p>
          <p>Soc. The other works then, which one may say belong to <lb/>
            the statesman's art-but these would be many-for example, to <lb/>
            make the citizens rich, free, and free from sedition-do not <lb/>
            they all appear to be neither evil nor good ? But it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary for this art to make men wise, and to impart knowledge, <lb/>
            if it is to be that, which benefits and renders men happy.</p>
          <p>[50.] Cri. It is so: and thus it was agreed upon by you, <lb/>
            as you have narrated the discourse.</p>
          <p>Soc. Does then the regal art make men wise and good ?</p>
          <p>Cri. What prevents it, Socrates ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Does it then make all men so, and good in all respects ? <lb/>
            And is it the art which furnishes every science, that of the <lb/>
            currier, of the carpenter, and all the other crafts ?</p>
          <p>Cri. I think not, Socrates.</p>
          <p>Soc. But what science (does it furnish) ? To what pur­ <lb/>
            pose do we employ it ? For of no works, either good or evil, <lb/>
            ought it to be the artificer, but to impart no other science than <lb/>
            itself. Let us then say what it is; to what purpose we should <lb/>
            use it. Are you willing, Crito, we should say it is that, by <lb/>
            which we make others good?</p>
          <p>Cri. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Soc. But in what will these be good, and to what purpose <lb/>
            will they be useful ? Or shall we still say that they will make <lb/>
            others good, and that those others will make others so ? How­ <lb/>
            ever, they no where appear to us in what way they are good; <lb/>
            because we have held in no honour the works, which are said <lb/>
            to belong to the statesman's science. But in reality, there. is, <lb/>
            according to the proverb,78 Corinthus the son of Jupiter ; and <lb/>
            as I have said, we are still equally, or even more, wanting to­ <lb/>
            wards knowing what the science is, which will make us <lb/>
            happy.</p>
          <p>Cri. By Jupiter, Socrates, you have come, it seems, to a <lb/>
            great difficulty.</p>
          <p>[51.] Soc. I myself then, Crito, since I had fallen into <lb/>

            to save us, both me and the lad, from the triple waves of the <lb/>

            us what that science is, by the possession of which we may <lb/>
            pass well through the remainder of life.</p>
          <p>Cri. And was then Euthydemus willing to show you any <lb/>
            thing ?</p>
          <p>Soc. How not ? And he began, my friend, the discourse <lb/>
            very magnificently thus. Whether, said he, Socrates, shall I <lb/>
            teach you this science about which you formerly were at a loss, <lb/>
            or show you that you possess it ?—0 blessed man, said I, are <lb/>

            Jupiter, said I, that I possess it; for this is much easier than <lb/>
            for a man so old to learn.—Come then, said he, answer me. <lb/>
            Is there any thing which you know ?-Certainly, said I; <lb/>
            many80 things, but trifling.—[52.] It is sufficient, said he. <lb/>
            Does it then appear to you to be possible, that any thing which <lb/>
            exists should not be what it is ?-It does not, by Jupiter. <lb/>
            -Did you not say that you knew something ?—I did.—Are <lb/>
            you not then knowing, if you know ?-Certainly, in that very <lb/>
            thing.—It makes no difference. But is it not necessary that <lb/>
            you, being knowing, should know all things ?-It is not, by <lb/>
            Jupiter, said I, since there are many other things which I do <lb/>
            not know.-If then you do not know a thing, you are not <lb/>
            knowing ?-Of that thing, friend, said I.—Are you not then, <lb/>
            said he, less knowing ? But you just now said, that you were <lb/>
            knowing; and thus you are the very same person that you are,81 <lb/>
            and again not the same person, according to the same things, <lb/>

            such things as these, the number of the stars and the sands ?86 <lb/>
            —[54.] Perfectly so, said he. Think you, we should not <lb/>
            confess that we do ?-And Ctesippus then, taking up (the dis­ <lb/>
            course), said, By Jupiter, Dionysodorus, show me some proof <lb/>
            of these things, that I may know that you are speaking the <lb/>
            truth.- What proof shall I show ? said he.-Do you know how <lb/>
            many teeth87 Euthydemus has, and does Euthydemus know <lb/>
            how many you have ?-Is it not enough, said he, for you, to <lb/>
            hear that we know all things ?-By no means, said he; but <lb/>
            only tell us this one thing more, and show that you speak the <lb/>
            truth. And if you tell how many teeth each of you have, <lb/>
            and you appear on our counting them to have known this, we <lb/>
            will then believe you in other things likewise. They then, <lb/>
            thinking they were mocked at, were unwilling (to comply), <lb/>
            but acknowledged they knew all things, while they were <lb/>
            questioned on each point singly by Ctesippus. For there was <lb/>
            nothing which Ctesippus did not ask them without conceal­ <lb/>
            ment, and at last even if they knew the most indecent <lb/>
            things. And they, confessing that they did know, advanced <lb/>
            most bravely against the questions, like wild boars pressing <lb/>
            on against the blow; [55.] so that I too, Crito, was at length <lb/>
            compelled myself through my incredulity to ask Euthydemus, <lb/>
            whether Dionysodorus knew also how to dance ? and he said, <lb/>
            Perfectly so.-However, said I, he surely does not know <lb/>
            how to act the tumbler upon swords,88 and to be whirled on a <lb/>
            wheel,88 being so old. (Or,)89 so far (towards) wisdom has he <lb/>
            come ?- There is nothing, said he, which he does not know. <lb/>
            -But whether, said I, do you only now know all things, or <lb/>
            have you always (known them)?—Always, said he.-And <lb/>
            when you were children, and as soon as you were born, did <lb/>
            you know ?—All things, said both of them together.- To us <note type="footnote">86 Here seems to be an allusion to a philosopher, like Archytas, whom <lb/>

            the thing appeared to be incredible. But said Euthydemus, <lb/>
            Do you disbelieve, Socrates ?-Except, I said, that it is likely <lb/>
            you are wise men.90—But, said he, if you are willing to give <lb/>
            me answers, I will also show you, giving your assent to these <lb/>
            wonderful things.-Indeed, I shall91 most gladly, said I, be <lb/>
            confuted on these points. For if I am wise, not knowing it, <lb/>
            and you demonstrate this that I know all things, and have al­ <lb/>
            ways (known), what greater wind-fall than this could I find <lb/>
            in all my life?-Answer then, said he.—[56.] Ask me, as <lb/>
            one that will answer.- Whether, then, Socrates, said he, do <lb/>
            you know any thing or not ?—I do.-Do you then know by that <lb/>
            thing, through which you are knowing, or by any thing else ? <lb/>
            -By that by which I am knowing: for I suppose you mean <lb/>
            the soul. Or do you not mean it ?-Are you not ashamed <lb/>
            of yourself, Socrates ? said he. You ask a question when you <lb/>
            are asked one.-Be it so, said I; but what shall I do ? For I <lb/>
            will do as you bid me. (But) when I know not what it is <lb/>
            you ask me, you nevertheless order me to answer and not to <lb/>
            ask a question.—You, doubtless, said he, understand what I <lb/>
            say.—I do, said I.—Now then answer to that which you do <lb/>
            understand.-What then, said I, if you ask a question, think­ <lb/>
            ing in one way, and I understand it in another, and then I <lb/>
            give an answer to it, is it enough for you, if I answer nothing <lb/>
            to the purpose ?-To me it would, said he, but not to you, I <lb/>
            think.—I will not, by Jupiter, answer, said I, before I hear.92 <lb/>
            —You will not answer, said he, to what you may happen to un­ <lb/>

            less attention to me, as one that was ignorant. [57.] But <lb/>
            since I had determined to go as a scholar to those men, I <lb/>
            thought I ought to yield, lest they should consider me a stupid <lb/>
            fellow, and not receive me as a scholar. Hence I said, If it <lb/>
            seems good for you to act thus, Euthydemus, let it be done: <lb/>
            for perhaps in every respect you, who possess the art, know <lb/>
            better how to converse than I do, who am an unskilled indi­ <lb/>
            vidual. Question me then again from the beginning.-Answer <lb/>
            then again, said he, whether you know what you know by <lb/>
            something or not.—I do, said I, by the souL-Again, said he, <lb/>
            this man in his answer adds to the questions he is asked. For <lb/>
            I did not ask by what you know, but if you know by any <lb/>
            thing.-Again I said, I have answered more than was neces­ <lb/>
            sary, through my want of instruction; but pardon me. For <lb/>
            I will now answer simply, that I know always by something, <lb/>
            what I know.-But, said he, whether do you always know by <lb/>
            the same thing ? Or is it at one time by this thing and at an­ <lb/>
            other time by another ?-Always by this, said I, when I know. <lb/>
            -Again, said he, will you not cease to speak beside (the ques­ <lb/>
            tion) ?-But (I fear, said I,) lest this " always " should trip us <lb/>
            up.—It will not us, said he; but, if at all, it will you. But <lb/>
            answer me, Do you always know by this ?-Always, I said; <lb/>
            since I must take away the "when."—[58.] You therefore <lb/>
            always know by this. And always knowing, whether do you <lb/>
            know some things by that, by which you know, and other <lb/>
            things by something else? or do you know all things by <lb/>
            that?—All things, said I, which I know, by that.-This has <lb/>
            come, said he, the same by-answer.—I take away then, said <lb/>
            I, the words " which I know."—Take not away, said he, even <lb/>
            one word; for I make you no request.94—But answer me, <lb/>
            Would you be able to know all things, unless you could know <lb/>
            all things ?-This would be a prodigy, said I.—Add now, said <lb/>

            things.—I appear to have done so, said I; since the expres­ <lb/>

            for you have confessed that you know always, and all things <lb/>
            at the same time. It is evident, therefore, that you knew <lb/>
            when you was a boy, and when you was begotten, and when <lb/>
            you was born; and even before you was born, and before hea­ <lb/>

            it, much-honoured Euthydemus, said I, if you speak the truth <lb/>

            But tell me, said I—for in other things I cannot contend against <lb/>
            you, men of such portentous wisdom, (nor say) that I do not <lb/>
            know all things, since you assert it-how, Euthydemus, shall I <lb/>
            say that I know that good men are unjust ? Come, tell me, <lb/>
            do I know this, or do I not know it ?—You certainly know it, <lb/>
            said he.- What, said I, (do I know) ?-That good men are not <lb/>
            unjust.-This, I said, I perfectly knew a long time ago. But <lb/>
            I am not asking this ; but where did I learn that good men <lb/>
            are unjust ?-No where, said Dionysodorus.—I do not there­ <lb/>
            fore, said I, know it.—Euthydemus then said to Dionysodorus, <lb/>
            You are destroying the reasoning; and this man will appear <lb/>
            to be not knowing, that he is at the same time both knowing <lb/>
            and not knowing. [60.] And Dionysodorus blushed. But, <lb/>
            Euthydemus, said I, how say you ? Does not your brother, <lb/>
            who knows all things, appear to you to speak correctly ?— <lb/>
            But am I the brother of Euthydemus ? said Dionysodorus, <lb/>
            hastily taking up the discourse.-And I said, Leave me alone, <lb/>

            —You are flying away, Socrates, said Dionysodorus, and are <lb/>
            unwilling to answer.-And reasonably so, said I: for I am <lb/>
            inferior even to either one 98 of you ; so that I have a great <lb/>
            need to fly from the two. For I am somehow far weaker than <lb/>

            appears to me, had come recently from the sea; and when it <lb/>
            was annoying Hercules on the left hand by speaking to and <lb/>
            biting him, he called upon Iolaus, the son of his brother, to <lb/>
            aid him ; and he gave him sufficient aid.. But if my Iolaus, <lb/>
            Patrocles,100 were to come, he would rather produce mis­ <lb/>

          <p>[61.] Answer then, said Dionysodorus, since this tale has <lb/>
            been sung by you, whether Iolaus was 'more the nephew of <lb/>
            Hercules than of you.—It is then best for me, Dionysodorus, <lb/>
            said I, to answer you. For you will not desist-of this I am <lb/>
            pretty well certain-from asking questions, and grudging me <lb/>
            (to learn), and hindering Euthydemus from teaching me that <lb/>
            wise thing.-Answer, however, said he.—I will answer then, <lb/>
            said I, that Iolaus was the nephew of Hercules, but, as it ap­ <lb/>
            pears to me, mine not at all. For my brother, Patrocles, was <lb/>
            not his father; but Iphicles, who nearly resembles him in name, <lb/>
            was the brother of Hercules.-But is Patrocles, said he, your <lb/>
            brother -Certainly, said I; for he had the same mother, though <lb/>
            not the same father with myself.—He is then your brother, <lb/>
            and not your brother.—I said, He was not from the same fa­ <lb/>

            Sophroniscus.—But, said he, Sophroniscus was a father, and <lb/>
            Chæredemus (likewise).—Certainly, said I; the former was <lb/>

            Was he then (said he) a father, different from a father ? Or <lb/>

            niscus, on the contrary, being different from a father, is not a fa­ <lb/>

            the very same predicament ? for he is different from my father. <lb/>
            -Very far from it, said Euthydemus.—Is he then the same ? he <lb/>
            replied.—Yes, the same.—I would not wish this. But whether, <lb/>
            Euthydemus, is he my father alone, or the father of other men <lb/>
            likewise ?-Of other men likewise, said he. Or do you think <lb/>
            that the same person, being a father, is not'a father ?-So I <lb/>
            thought indeed, said Ctesippus.—But what ? said he, (do you <lb/>

            the brother of gudgeons, and puppies, and little pigs.-And <lb/>
            so are you, said he.-And besides this, your father is a dog <lb/>
            too.-And so is yours, said he.-But. said Dionysodorus, if <lb/>
            you would answer me, you would forthwith acknowledge <lb/>
            these things. For tell me, have you a dog ?—Yes, a very bad <lb/>
            one, said Ctesippus.—Has he then puppies ?-He has indeed, <lb/>
            said he, others very much of the same kind (as himself).—Is <lb/>
            not the dog then their father ?-At least, I saw him having <lb/>
            connexion with a bitch.-What then ? Is he not your dog ?— <lb/>
            Certainly, said he.-Being a father then, is he not yours ? So <lb/>
            that the dog becomes your father, and you are the brother of <lb/>
            puppies.—[64.] And Dionysodorus again, quickly taking up <lb/>
            the discourse, that Ctesippus might not get a word in before <lb/>
            him, said, Answer me still in a small matter. Do you strike <lb/>
            this dog ?-And Ctesippus said, laughing, By the gods, I do ; <lb/>
            for I cannot (strike) you.—You strike your father then, said <lb/>
            he.-Much more justly, said he, should I strike your father, <lb/>
            who, having endured what, has begotten such wise sons. <lb/>
            But surely, Euthydemus, said Ctesippus, your father and the <lb/>
            father of the puppies has enjoyed many good things from this <lb/>
            your wisdom. But neither is he in want of many good things, <lb/>
            Ctesippus, nor are you.—Nor are you, Euthydemus, said he. <lb/>
            -Nor is any other man (said he) in want of them. For tell <lb/>
            me, Ctesippus, whether you think it good for a sick man to <lb/>
            drink a medicine, or does it appear to you to be not good, <lb/>
            when it is requisite; or when any one is going to a battle, <lb/>
            ought he rather to go armed, or unarmed ?-To me, said he, <lb/>
            (it appears);6 although I think that you are about to say <lb/>
            some of your beautiful things.—[65.] You shall know the <lb/>
            best, said he ; but answer me. For since you acknowledge <lb/>
            that it is good for a man to drink medicine when it is <lb/>
            requisite, is it not meet to drink as much as possible of this <lb/>
            good, and will it not in this case be well there,7 if some one, <lb/>
            bruising it, should mingle with it a cart-load of hellebore.- <lb/>
            And Ctesippus said, This would be very proper indeed, <note type="footnote">6 Here is evidently some omission. For to a double question there <lb/>

            Euthydemus, if he who drank it were as large as the statue <lb/>
            in Delphi.8—As therefore, said he, it is also good to have <lb/>
            arms in battle, is it not meet to have a great number of shields <lb/>
            and spears, since it is a good thing ?- Very much so, said <lb/>
            Ctesippus. But you are not of this opinion, Euthydemus; <lb/>
            for you think that one (shield)9 and one spear are sufficient. <lb/>
            Or do you not?—I do.-Would you, said he, arm Geryones <lb/>
            too and Briareus in this manner ? But I thought you were <lb/>
            more skilful (than to do so), as being one who fights with a <lb/>
            soldier's arms, and so too was this your friend.-And Euthy­ <lb/>
            demus indeed was silent. But Dionysodorus asked, in refer­ <lb/>
            ence to what had been before answered by Ctesippus, Does it <lb/>
            not then appear to you to be good likewise to possess gold ?— <lb/>
            Certainly, said Ctesippus, and this too in plenty.—[66.] What <lb/>
            then, does it not appear to you to be a good thing to possess <lb/>
            riches always, and every where?—Very much so, said he.- <lb/>
            Do you not then acknowledge gold likewise to be a good <lb/>
            thing ?—I have acknowledged it, said he.-Is it not then meet <lb/>
            to possess it always, and every where, and especially in one's <lb/>
            self? And would not a man be most happy, if he had three <lb/>
            talents of gold in his belly, a talent in his skull, and a stater <lb/>
            of gold in each of his eyes ?- They say indeed, Euthydemus, <lb/>
            said Ctesippus, that those amongst the Scythians are the most <lb/>
            happy and the best men, who have much gold in their own <lb/>
            skulls, just as you lately spoke of the dog being your own <lb/>
            father: and, what is still more wonderful, they say, that they <lb/>
            drink out of their own golden skulls, and look within them, <lb/>
            having their own head in their hands.—[67.] Whether, said <lb/>
            Euthydemus, do the Scythians and other men see things which <lb/>
            can be seen, or things which cannot be seen ?-Things, surely, <lb/>
            which can be seen.-Do you then (do so) likewise ? said he.- <lb/>
            I do.-Do you then see our garments?—Yes.—Can then <lb/>
            these things see ?-Beyond all measure, said Ctesippus.—But <lb/>
            what? said he.-Nothing. But perhaps you think you do <lb/>
            not see them, so facetious are you; but to me you appear, <lb/>
            Euthydemus, not sleeping to be asleep, and, if it were possi­ <lb/>
            ble for a man, when speaking, to say nothing, to do this like­ <lb/>
            wise.-Is it not then possible, said Dionysodorus, for him who <note type="footnote"> 8 Of the statue alluded to it appears that nothing is told elsewhere. </note><note type="footnote"> 9 The Greek word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὰσπίδα</foreign> is wanting in the text.

            . is silent to speak ?-By no means, said Ctesippus.—Is it also <lb/>
            impossible for him, who speaks, to be silent ?-Still less so, <lb/>
            said he.- When therefore you speak of stones, and woods, and <lb/>
            things of iron, do you not speak of things silent ?—I do not, <lb/>
            said he, if I run walking in braziers' shops ; but the pieces of <lb/>
            iron are speaking, and make the greatest noise, if any one <lb/>
            touches them. So that you know not that with (all) your <lb/>
            wisdom you have said nothing. But further still, explain to <lb/>
            me the other assertion, how it is possible for one who speaks <lb/>
            to be silent.10—And Ctesippus appeared to me to be in great <lb/>
            agony on account of his boy-love.—[68.] When you are <lb/>
            silent, said Euthydemus, are you not silent as to all things ?— <lb/>
            I am, said he.-Are you not therefore silent as to things <lb/>
            which speak, if things which speak11 are among the number <lb/>
            of all things ?-But what, said Ctesippus, are not all things <lb/>
            silent?—Certainly not, said Euthydemus.—Do then, thou <lb/>
            best of men, all things speak ?—The speaking things do.- <lb/>
            But, said he, I do not ask this; but whether all things <lb/>
            are silent, or speak ?-They do neither, and they do both, <lb/>
            said Dionysodorus, hastily taking up the discourse. For I <lb/>
            well knew, that you would not have any thing to say to this <lb/>
            answer.-And Ctesippus, as was usual with him, laughing <lb/>
            very loudly, said, Your brother, Euthydemus, has put his <lb/>
            argument on both sides, and he has perished and is van­ <lb/>
            quished.12 And Clinias was very much delighted and <lb/>
            laughed; so that Ctesippus became ten times as great (as he <lb/>
            was before). But Ctesippus, as being very crafty, appeared <lb/>
            to me to have heard these things on the sly from these very <lb/>
            men. For such kind of wisdom is not now possessed by any <lb/>
            other persons. [69. J And I said, Why do you laugh, Clinias, <lb/>

            you ever seen a beautiful thing ? said Dionysodorus.—I have, <lb/>
            said I, and many such, Dionysodorus.—Were they then, said <lb/>
            he, things different from the beautiful, or the same with the <lb/>
            beautiful ?-And I then became perfectly involved in doubt, <lb/>
            and thought I had suffered justly for having grunted out a <lb/>
            word. I said, however, they are. different from the beautiful; <lb/>
            but a certain beauty is present with each of them.13—If, then, <lb/>
            said he, an ox is present with you, are you an ox ? and be­ <lb/>
            cause I now am present with you, are you Dionysodorus ?— <lb/>
            Say words of good omen, said I.—But after what manner, <lb/>
            said he, if even one thing is present with another, will that <lb/>
            which is different be different ?-Are you then, said I, in a <lb/>
            difficulty respecting this ? For I have just now endeavoured <lb/>
            to imitate the wisdom of the men,14 as being desirous of it.- <lb/>
            How should I not doubt, said he, both I and all other men, of <lb/>
            that which is not ?-What do you say, said I, Dionysodorus ? <lb/>
            Is not the beautiful, beautiful, and the base, base ?-Provided, <lb/>
            said he, it appears so to me.—Does it then appear so to you? <lb/>
            -Entirely so, said he.-Is not likewise the same, same ? and <lb/>
            is not the different, different? For certainly the different is <lb/>
            not the same. And I thought that not even a boy would doubt <lb/>
            this, that the different is not different. [70.] But this, <lb/>
            Dionysodorus, you have willingly passed by ; 15 since in other <lb/>
            respects, like the artists, on whom it is incumbent to work out <lb/>
            each part in detail, you seem to me to work out a discourse in <lb/>
            a thoroughly beautiful manner.-Do you know then, said he, <lb/>
            what is proper for each artist? In the first place, do you <lb/>
            know to whom it belongs to work in copper ?—I know that <lb/>
            this belongs to copper-smiths.-And to whom does it belong <lb/>
            to fashion things in clay ?-To a potter.-And whose busi­ <lb/>
            ness is it to cut a throat, to flay, and, cutting off small pieces <lb/>

            as you say, that a cook should cut a throat and flay. Have <lb/>
            you assented to this or not ?—I have assented, I said ; but <lb/>
            pardon me.16—It is evident, then, said he, that should any one <lb/>
            cut the throat of the cook and chop him into small pieces, and <lb/>
            boil and roast him, he would do what is proper; and should <lb/>

            evident, if you wish it.-But what, said he, do you think you <lb/>
            know your own things ?-Unless you say something else. For <lb/>
            I must begin from you, and end with Euthydemus here.- <lb/>
            Do you then, said he, consider those things yours, over which <lb/>
            you have a power, and which you can use as you please, such <lb/>
            as oxen and sheep? do you think that those are yours which <lb/>
            it is lawful for you to sell, and to give away, and to sacrifice <lb/>
            to whatever god you please; but that those, which are not so <lb/>
            circumstanced, are not yours ?-And I, for I knew that from <lb/>
            the questions something beautiful would peep out, and at the <lb/>
            same time I was desirous to hear as quickly as possible, said, <lb/>
            It is perfectly so; things of this kind alone are mine.-But <lb/>
            what, said he, do you not call those things animals, which pos­ <lb/>
            sess a soul ?—Yes, I said.-Do you acknowledge then, that <lb/>
            those alone among animals are yours, to which you have the <lb/>
            liberty of doing what I have just now mentioned?—I ac­ <lb/>
            knowledge it.—[72.] And he, pausing a while, as if reflecting <lb/>

            ther paternal gods, nor sacred rites, nor any thing else beau­ <lb/>
            tiful and good.-Hold, said I, Dionysodorus; speak words of <lb/>
            good omen, and do not instruct me harshly. For there are <lb/>
            to me altars and sacred rites, both domestic and belonging to <lb/>
            my country, and the rest of the things of this kind as appertain to <lb/>
            the Athenians.—Then, said he, is there not a paternal Jupiter <lb/>
            to the rest of the Athenians ?- There is not, said I. This <lb/>
            appellation exists not to any one of the Ionians, nor to such <lb/>
            as are colonized from this city, nor to us. But Apollo is (our) <lb/>
            paternal (god),21 through the race of Ion ; and Jupiter is not <lb/>
            called by us Paternal, but Herceus 22 and Phratrius ; 23 and <lb/>
            Minerva too is called Phratria.—[73.] This is sufficient, said <lb/>
            Dionysodorus ; for you have, as it seems, Apollo, Jupiter, and <note type="footnote"> 19 This is the interpretation given by Heindorf to the words, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἅπορόν <lb/>

            most the pillars in the Lyceum made a clattering in favour of <lb/>
            the two men, and were delighted. I too felt disposed myself <lb/>
            to acknowledge that I had never at any time seen men so <lb/>
            wise; and being perfectly enslaved by their wisdom, I turned <lb/>
            myself to praising and passing encomiums on them; and I <lb/>
            said, 0 blessed ye for your wondrous genius, who have so <lb/>
            rapidly, and in a short time, accomplished a thing of such <lb/>
            magnitude ! [75.] Your arguments indeed, Euthydemus and <lb/>
            Dionysodorus, contain many other beautiful things; but this <lb/>
            is the most magnificent thing in them, that you care nothing for <lb/>
            the mass of mankind, nor for persons of solemn mien, and who <lb/>
            think themselves something, but only for those who are like <lb/>
            yourselves. For I know well, that very few men similar to <lb/>
            yourselves, would delight in these arguments; while the rest <lb/>
            are so ignorant of them, that, I am sure, they would be more <lb/>
            ashamed to confute others with such arguments, than to be <lb/>
            confuted themselves. This too again is another popular and <lb/>
            gentle character in your arguments, that when you say there <lb/>
            is nothing either beautiful, or good, or white, or any thing <lb/>
            else of this kind, and, in short, that one thing is not different <lb/>
            from another, you in reality sew up the mouths of men, as in­ <lb/>
            deed you assert you do; and not only the mouths of others, <lb/>
            but ye would appear (to sew up) your own. (Now) this is a <lb/>
            very gracious act, and removes whatever is oppressive in <lb/>
            your arguments. The greatest thing however is, that these <lb/>
            arguments subsist in such a manner, and have been discovered <lb/>
            by you with such skill, that any one may learn them in a very <lb/>
            short time. (For) I have perceived, by directing my atten­ <lb/>
            tion to Ctesippus, how rapidly on the instant he has been able <lb/>
            to imitate you. [76.] The (wisdom) then of your practice, <lb/>
            with respect to its being rapidly imparted to another, is <lb/>
            beautiful; but it is not adapted for discussion before men.26 <lb/>
            But, if you will be persuaded by me, be careful not to speak <lb/>
            before many, lest through their learning rapidly, they should <lb/>
            give you no thanks for your instruction. But especially con- <note type="footnote"> 26 This is a strange expression. Did Socrates then wish the Sophists <lb/>

            who gives you silver for what you say. The same advice, if <lb/>
            you are wise, you will give to your disciples likewise, never <lb/>
            to discourse with any man, except with you and themselves. <lb/>
            For that which is rare, Euthydemus, is valuable ; but water, <lb/>

            very cheap. But lead on, said I, and receive Clinias here <lb/>
            and myself (as your scholars) on the sly.</p>
          <p>Having, Crito, spoken these words and a few others, we <lb/>
            departed. Consider therefore now, how you will accompany <lb/>
            me to these men; for they say they are able to teach any one <lb/>
            who is willing to give them money; and that they do not ex­ <lb/>
            clude any natural disposition or age ; and, what is especially <lb/>
            proper for you to hear, they say that an attention to money- <lb/>
            making does not hinder any one from easily receiving their <lb/>
            wisdom.</p>
          <p>[77.] Cri. In good truth, Socrates, I am desirous of hear­ <lb/>
            ing them, and would willingly learn something from them; <lb/>
            although I almost appear to be one of those, not like to Eu­ <lb/>
            thydemus, but to those who, as you have just said, would <lb/>
            more willingly be confuted by such arguments, than confute <lb/>
            them. It seems however to me to be ridiculous to give you <lb/>
            advice; nevertheless, I wish to relate to you what I have <lb/>
            heard. Know27 then, that as I was taking a walk, a man came <lb/>
            to me from among those that had left you, and thinking him­ <lb/>
            self to be very wise, as being one of those who are skilled in <lb/>
            speeches suited for courts of justice, said to me—Crito, have <lb/>
            you heard28 nothing of these wise men?—By Jupiter, I have <lb/>
            not, said I. For, on account of the crowd, I was unable to <lb/>
            stand close and hear.—And yet, said he, it was worth while <lb/>
            to hear them.—Why ? said I.—Because you would have heard <lb/>
            men discoursing, who are the wisest of all those who at pre­ <lb/>
            sent engage in such-like arguments.-And I said, What then <note type="footnote"> 27 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἶσθα</foreign>, Heindorf suggests <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἴσθι</foreign>. Winckelmann and Stal­ <lb/>

            did they appear to you ?—What else, said he, than that they <lb/>
            are such as one will always hear from such-like triflers, who <lb/>
            bestow unworthy attention on things of no worth. For so <lb/>
            did he say in very words.—[78.] And I said, But certainly <lb/>
            philosophy is an elegant thing.-How, elegant, said he, 0 <lb/>
            blessed man ! It is indeed a thing of no worth. But if you <lb/>
            had been present just now, I think you would have been <lb/>
            ashamed of your associate. He was so absurd, as willingly <lb/>
            to put himself in the power of men, who pay no attention to <lb/>
            what they say, but lay hold of every word. And these men, <lb/>
            as I just now said, are among the best of those that exist at <lb/>
            present. But indeed, Crito, said he, both the thing itself, <lb/>
            and the men who are conversant with it, are worthless and <lb/>
            ridiculous.-But to me, Socrates, neither he appears to blame <lb/>
            the thing with justice, nor would any one else blame it.29 To <lb/>
            be willing, however, to discourse with these men in the pre­ <lb/>
            sence of many appears to me to be an act that may be justly <lb/>
            blamed.</p>
          <p>Soc. Wonderful, Crito, are the men of this kind. But I do <lb/>
            not yet know what I am about to say.30 Of what class of <lb/>
            men was he, who came to you, and blamed philosophy ? Was <lb/>
            he some pleader among those who are skilful in contending <lb/>
            in courts of justice; or was he one of those who introduce <lb/>
            men of this description, (and) a maker of the speeches with <lb/>
            which orators contend?</p>
          <p>[79.] Cri. The least of all was he, by Jupiter, an orator; <lb/>
            nor do I think that he ever ascended the platform in a court <lb/>
            of justice; but they say that he is knowing in the thing itself, <lb/>
            by Jupiter, and likewise that he is a person of power and <lb/>
            composes powerful speeches.</p>
          <p>Soc. I now understand; and I was myself just now about <lb/>
            to speak of those men. For they are those, Crito, whom <lb/>
            Prodicus says are on the confines of a philosopher and poli­ <lb/>
            tician ; and think themselves to be the wisest of all men ; and <lb/>

            For it is not easy to persuade them, that in the case of men <lb/>
            and all other things, which subsist between two certain things, <lb/>
            and partake of both, such as (are) from good and evil, become <lb/>
            better than the one, and worse than the other; but that such <lb/>
            things as (are) from two goods, not (tending)33 to the same <lb/>

          <p>Cri. And indeed, Socrates, I too, as I am always saying to <lb/>
            you, am in a difficulty respecting my children, how I ought <lb/>
            to treat them. The one indeed is still rather young, and <lb/>
            little; but Critobulus is already an adult, and requires <lb/>
            some one to be a benefit to him. When therefore I am <lb/>
            associating with you, I feel disposed to think that it is mad­ <lb/>
            ness to be, for the sake of children, so much concerned about <lb/>
            many other things, such as marriage, that they may be born <lb/>
            of a mother of high family, and about wealth, that they may <lb/>
            become very rich, and yet to neglect their education. But <lb/>
            when I look at any one of those, who profess to instruct men, <lb/>
            I am amazed; and, to tell you the truth, every one of them <lb/>
            appears to me, on reflection, to be unfit for the purpose; so <lb/>
            that I know not how to give the youth a turn for philosophy.</p>

            is good, and the other bad, they are better than the latter, worse than the <lb/>

            and that of the general, appear to you to be beautiful ?</p>
          <p>Cri. To me in every respect.</p>
          <p>Soc. What then, in each of these do you not see that the <lb/>
            many are to be ridiculed with respect to each of their doings ?</p>
          <p>Cri. Yes, by Jupiter ; and you speak with great truth.</p>

          <p>Cri. This surely, Socrates, would not be just.</p>
          <p>Soc. Do not then, Crito, do what you ought not; but <lb/>
            bidding farewell to those who study philosophy, whether they <lb/>
            are good or bad, examine the thing itself, well and properly ; <lb/>

            <title type="main">INTRODUCTION TO THE SOPHIST.</title>
          </head>
          <p>AFTER producing in the Euthydemus some specimens of the ap­ <lb/>
            parently clever but really absurd subtleties of which the Sophists <lb/>
            of Greece were wont to make a display, and to gain the admiration <lb/>
            of those, who could not detect a fallacy, and the contempt of those, <lb/>
            who could, Plato has in this dialogue pointed out in what class of <lb/>
            persons those must be placed, who professed to be on all questions <lb/>
            of philosophy, politics, and science, equally competent to raise a <lb/>
            doubt or to solve one.</p>
          <p>In pursuing this inquiry, Plato has, like a keen sportsman, fol­ <lb/>
            lowed the track of the animal, to which he compares the Sophist, <lb/>
            until he arrives at the long-sought-for lair; and he then discovers <lb/>
            that, instead of the Sophist being the purveyor of intellectual food, <lb/>
            he is occupied merely in the art of catching the many, and thus <lb/>
            gaining a credit for talents which are not only of no use to himself <lb/>
            and others, but are the bane of both.</p>
          <p>During the course of the dialogue, he is led to examine the theory <lb/>
            respecting the first element of all things, called <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ὂν</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>, which <lb/>
            I have rendered the existing" and "existence" respectively, and <lb/>
            not, as others have done, " the being ” and " essence." Of this ex­ <lb/>
            istence, identified by some philosophers with " the one," and by <lb/>
            others with " the whole," there were said to be an infinite number <lb/>
            of parts, or species, all differing from each other, and yet producing <lb/>
            what Horace calls " rerum concordia discors," through the proper­ <lb/>
            ties of existence, connected respectively with the ideas of identity <lb/>
            and difference, motion and rest.</p>
          <p>From the fact of finding the same speakers in the Theætetus <lb/>
            and Sophist, some have considered the latter dialogue to be only a <lb/>
            continuation of the former; while its similarity in the manner of <lb/>
            subdividing a genus into different species, proves its still greater <lb/>
             <pb n="102"/>
            affinity with the Statesman—for such is the best English translation <lb/>
            of the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πολιτικὸς</foreign>—and with the Cratylus, in its touching upon <lb/>
            the phenomena of language, and with the Parmenides, as regards <lb/>
            the doctrine of " the existing," and the forms it assumes in the <lb/>
            mind of " the one."</p>

            <title type="sub">THEODORUS, SOCRATES, A GUEST FROM ELEA, THEÆTETUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>[1.] ACCORDING to our agreement yesterday, both we our­ <lb/>
            selves are come, Socrates, in due order, and we bring this our <lb/>
            guest,1 an Elean by birth, and a friend of Parmenides and <lb/>
            Zeno, and a great philosopher.</p>
          <p>Soc. Are you not, Theodorus, unconsciously bringing not <lb/>
            a guest but some god, according to the language of Homer,2 <lb/>
            who says in behalf of such mortals, as have a portion of due <lb/>
            respect, both other gods, and especially the deity who presides <lb/>
            over guests, become a follower and survey the insolent <lb/>
            and the equitable conduct of men. So that perhaps he, <lb/>
            who now follows you, may be one of the better beings about <lb/>
            to survey and confute us, when ill-conducting ourselves in <lb/>
            a strife of words, through his being a kind of a disproving <lb/>
            god.</p>
          <p>Theo. Such is not the manner of this stranger, Socrates ; <lb/>
            but he is more moderate than those that are studious of con­ <lb/>
            tention ; and the man appears to me, not to be a deity, but <lb/>
            divine: for such I denominate all philosophers.</p>
          <p>[2.] Soc. And you do well, my friend. Although I fear <lb/>
            this race (of philosophers) is scarcely more easy to distinguish, <lb/>
            I may say, than that of the divinity. For they, who are <lb/>
            philosophers, not made up, but in reality, appear, through the <note type="footnote"> I This Theodorus was a geometrician of Cyrene, and Plato's pre­ <lb/>
            ceptor in that science. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Plato here brings together two different passages of Homer; one <lb/>

              ignorance of others, to be of a multiform kind, while they <lb/>
              wander about cities, and behold from on high the life of those <lb/>
              below them; and to some they seem to be worthy of no <lb/>
              honour, but to others of all; and now they appear to be <lb/>
              politicians; and now sophists; and sometimes there are <lb/>
              those, to whom they give the idea that they are altogether <lb/>
              mad. I would, however, gladly hear from this our guest, if it <lb/>
              is agreeable to him, what the people about the place there <lb/>
              think of these things, and how they denominate them.</p>
          <p>Theo. What things?</p>
          <p>Soc. The sophist, statesman, and philosopher.</p>
          <p>[3.] Theo. What, and of what kind, is the doubt about <lb/>
            them, respecting which you have it in your mind to make an <lb/>
            inquiry ?</p>
          <p>Soc. It is this. Whether they consider all these as one or <lb/>
            two ? Or as there are three names, whether they distribute <lb/>
            them into three kinds likewise, and attach to each singly a <lb/>
            name ?</p>
          <p>Theo. He will not, I think, grudge to go through them. <lb/>
            Or how shall we say, guest ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Thus, Theodorus. For I do not grudge, nor is it <lb/>
            difficult to say, that they think them three kinds. But to <lb/>
            define clearly what each of them is, is not a small nor an easy <lb/>
            task.</p>
          <p>Theo. You have by accident, Socrates, laid hold of questions <lb/>
            similar to those, which we were asking this our guest, before <lb/>
            we came hither. But he then made the same pretence to us, <lb/>
            as he just now did to you: since he says that he had sum­ <lb/>
            ciently heard, and did not forget.</p>
          <p>[4.] Soc. Do not then, stranger, deny us the first favour <lb/>
            we ask. But tell us thus much; whether you are wont more <lb/>
            readily to go through by yourself and to state in a long dis­ <lb/>
            course whatever you wish to show forth, or by interroga­ <lb/>
            tions? such as I once heard Parmenides employing, and at <lb/>
            the same time going through very beautiful arguments, when <lb/>
            I was a young man and he very old at that time.</p>
          <p>Guest. With him who converses by answers, Socrates, with­ <lb/>
            out pain, and (as it were) with a light rein, it is more easy <lb/>
            thus with another; but if not, by oneself.3 <note type="footnote"> 3 Such is the literal translation of the nonsensical Greek, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥᾳ̃ον οὕτω</foreign> <lb/>

             </p>
          <p>Soc. You are at liberty then to select whom you please of <lb/>
            those present here : for we shall all of us readily obey you. <lb/>
            You will however, if you take my advice, select some of the <lb/>
            young men, either Theætetus here, or any of the rest, if such <lb/>
            is your mind.</p>
          <p>[5.] Guest. A kind of shame has come upon me, Socrates, <lb/>
            in that, conversing with you now for the first time, I have not <lb/>
            carried on the intercourse in detail, word for word, but by <lb/>
            drawing out a discourse to a great extent, either by myself or <lb/>
            to another, I have as it were made a display. For in reality, <lb/>
            that which is now said is not (such) as a person would ex­ <lb/>
            pect it to be, when interrogated about it;4 for it requires a <lb/>
            very long discussion. But on the other hand, not to gratify <lb/>
            you and these, especially since you have spoken as you have <lb/>
            spoken,5 would, as it appears to me, be unlike a guest and <lb/>
            boorish; since, from what I have before said, and from what you <lb/>
            now urge me, I receive Theætetus here to be the respondent.</p>
          <p>[6.] Theæ. Will you then, stranger, as Socrates said, <lb/>
            gratify us all ?6</p>
          <p>Guest. It nearly appears then, Theætetus, that nothing <lb/>
            further must be said on this point. And as it seems, the dis­ <lb/>
            course must hereafter be addressed to you. But if, wearied <lb/>
            by the length of the discourse, you shall be somewhat annoyed, <lb/>
            blame not me, but these your companions, as the cause.</p>
          <p>Theæ. But I think I shall not faint in this way for the <lb/>
            present. If, however, such a thing should take place, then I <lb/>
            will take to myself as an ally Socrates, the namesake of <lb/>
            Socrates here, who is of the same age with me, and my <note type="footnote"> is at least intelligible, " facilius est cum alio interrogando disserere ; sin <lb/>
            contra, per se ipsum quisque facilius disputat," i. e. " it is more easy to <lb/>
            dispute with another by interrogations; otherwise, every one converses <lb/>
            more easily (by talking) himself." </note><note type="footnote"> 4 So Stalbaum would have us translate the words TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">νυ̃ν ῥηθὲν οὐχ <lb/>

            which it were not difficult perhaps for a conjectural critic to correct. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 On this formula see Blomf. on Agam. 66. Matth. Gr.

            that Plato wrote Apa <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοίνυν</foreign>, " Do so then, stranger, and you will gratify <lb/>

            associate in gymnastic exercises, and not unaccustomed to <lb/>
            labour in many things with me.7</p>
          <p>Guest. You say well. Deliberate then about these things by <lb/>
            yourself, as the discourse proceeds. But now you must con­ <lb/>
            sider in common with me, beginning in the first place, as it <lb/>
            appears to me, from the sophist; and searching out and show­ <lb/>
            in-, forth by a reason, what thing lie is. For now both you <lb/>
            and I have only the name in common respecting this thing; <lb/>
            but as regards the thing by what name we call it, perhaps each <lb/>
            of us have one peculiar to ourselves. But it is always requi­ <lb/>
            site respecting every thing, to agree rather through reasons as <lb/>
            to the thing itself, than to the name alone without a reason. <lb/>
            [7.] However, with respect to the tribe which we now have it <lb/>
            in our mind to investigate, it is not the easiest of all things to <lb/>
            comprehend what a sophist is. But whatever things of mo­ <lb/>
            ment ought to be well and thoroughly laboured at, respecting <lb/>
            these it has been decreed by all of old that we must practise <lb/>
            them first in small and more easy matters, previous to those in <lb/>
            the greatest. Now then, Theætetus, I too recommend, since we <lb/>
            conceive the genus of a sophist is difficult to hunt out, that we <lb/>
            should in like manner practise the method in something more <lb/>
            easy; unless you are able to show some other and easier road.</p>
          <p>Theæ. But I am not able.</p>
          <p>Guest. Are you willing then to go after something of little <lb/>
            value, and to endeavour to put it as the pattern of a greater?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Guest. What then if we propose a thing well known, and <lb/>
            of trifling value, but possessing a subject for discourse not <lb/>
            less than things greater? as, for instance, a fisherman. Is <lb/>
            not this thing known to every one, and worthy of not very <lb/>
            great and serious thought ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. It is so.</p>
          <p>Guest. And I suspect it has a method and reasoning not <lb/>
            unsuited for us.</p>
          <p>[8.] Theæ. It would then answer well.</p>
          <p>Guest. Come then, let us begin from it thus; and tell me, <lb/>
            whether we shall put down a fisherman as skilled in some <lb/>
            art, or unskilled in some art, but possessing another power.</p>
          <p>Theæ. By no means as unskilled in some art. <note type="footnote"> 7 As shown in the Politic, p. 257, C., where this same Socrates takes <lb/>
            up the discourse, after Theætetus had ceased speaking. </note> <pb n="107"/>
            </p>
          <p>Guest. But of all arts there are nearly two species.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. How so?</p>
          <p>Guest. Agriculture, and the care respecting every thing <lb/>
            mortal, and that relating to the putting together and moulding <lb/>
            what we call an utensil, and the imitative power, all these <lb/>
            may be justly called by one name.</p>
          <p>Theæ. How so ? and by what name ?</p>
          <p>Guest. When any one leads subsequently into existence <lb/>
            that which was previously not in existence, then we say that <lb/>
            he who leads, makes, and that the thing led, is made.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. Right.</p>
          <p>Guest. But all which we just now mentioned are wont to <lb/>
            possess their own power (suited) to this.</p>
          <p>Theæ. They do.</p>
          <p>Guest. This then let us summarily call the making power.</p>
          <p>Thece. Be it so.</p>
          <p>[9.] Guest. After this the whole species of discipline and <lb/>
            knowledge, and the species relating to money-making, and <lb/>
            contending, and hunting, may be said to be clearly a certain <lb/>
            acquiring power, through all their details; since not one of <lb/>
            these makes any thing, but gets hold of some things, which <lb/>
            are and have been, through words and deeds, and does not <lb/>
            give up to others who attempt to get hold 8 of them.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. Truly so; for it would be proper.</p>
          <p>Guest. Since then all arts consist either in acquiring or in <lb/>
            making, in which of these, Theætetus, shall we place the art <lb/>
            of fishing ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Doubtless in the art of acquiring.</p>
          <p>Guest. But are there not two species of the art of ac­ <lb/>
            quiring ? the one being an interchange between those that are <lb/>
            willing, through the medium of gifts, wages, and purchase ? <lb/>
            but the other would be a getting hold, effected entirely either <lb/>
            by deeds or words.</p>
          <p>Theæ. So it appears from what has been said.</p>
          <p>Guest. But must not the getting hold likewise receive a <lb/>
            two-fold division ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. In what way ?</p>
          <p>Guest. The one being openly done, and wholly from a <lb/>
            contest; but the other secretly, and consisting wholly in <lb/>
            hunting. <note type="footnote"> I So Stalbaum translates <foreign xml:lang="grc">χειρουμένοις</foreign>. </note> <pb n="108"/>
            </p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>[10.] Guest. It is likewise irrational not to give hunting <lb/>
            a two-fold division.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Say how.</p>
          <p>Guest. By making one relate to a race inanimate, and the <lb/>
            other to an animated one.</p>
          <p>Theæ. How not ? if there are both these.</p>
          <p>Guest. How should there not be ? But we may pass by <lb/>
            (the hunting of) inanimate things as being without a name, <lb/>
            except as regards some portions of the art of diving, and other <lb/>
            trifling things of this kind; but call the other part, relating <lb/>
            to the hunting of an animated race, animal-hunting.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Be it so.</p>
          <p>Guest. But is it not justly said, that of animal-hunting <lb/>
            there is a twofold kind ? one being the hunting of walking <lb/>
            animals, which is distinguished by many species and names, <lb/>
            but the other of swimming animals, and which is hunting in <lb/>
            a liquid.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. But of the swimming division, we see that one kind <lb/>
            is winged and the other aquatic.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Undoubtedly.</p>
          <p>Guest. But all the hunting of the winged tribe is called <lb/>
            bird-catching.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It is so called.</p>
          <p>Guest. But that of nearly all the aquatic, sea-fishing.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>[11.] Guest. But shall we not divide this hunting into <lb/>
            two chief parts ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. What are they ?</p>
          <p>Guest. According as the one makes for itself a catch with <lb/>
            nets, the other by a blow.</p>
          <p>Theæ. How say you ? And how do you divide each ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Whatever by enclosing on all sides restrains any <lb/>
            thing for the sake of an hinderance, it is reasonable to call <lb/>
            a net.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. But do you call a net of twigs, of twine, of reeds, <lb/>
            and a casting-net, any thing else than nets?9 <note type="footnote"> 9 On the different kind of nets Heindorf refers to Oppian iii. 81, and <lb/>
            Pollux v. 28. </note> <pb n="109"/>
            </p>
          <p>Theæ. Nothing else.</p>
          <p>Guest. We must therefore say that this hunting with nets <lb/>
            is a part of fishing, or something of this kind.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Guest. But that which takes place with hooks and three­ <lb/>
            forked harpoons, by a blow,10 and which is different from the <lb/>
            other kind, it will be requisite for us now to call by one <lb/>
            word, by-a-blow-hunting.11 Or what would any one, These­ <lb/>
            tetus, say better ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Let us disregard the name; for this is sufficient.</p>
          <p>[12.] Guest. Of by-a-blow-hunting then one kind is, I <lb/>
            think, at night effected by the light of fire; and it happens to <lb/>
            be called the fire-kind 12 by those engaged in the hunting.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. But the other kind is by day, and is effected with <lb/>
            rods13 and harpoons, having hooks at their extremities, and is <lb/>
            wholly hook-fishing.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It is so called.</p>
          <p>Guest. Of hook-fishing, and by a blow, that which takes <lb/>
            place (by darting) downwards the harpoons from on high, is <lb/>
            I think called harpoon-fishing, on account of persons using <lb/>
            the harpoons in that way.</p>
          <p>Theæ. So some persons say.</p>
          <p>Guest. There remains then only one kind, so to say.</p>
          <p>Theæ. What is that?</p>
          <p>Guest. That which is with a blow contrary to this, and <lb/>
            effected with a hook, but not striking, as it may happen, upon <lb/>
            any part of the body of fishes, as in the case of harpoons, but <lb/>
            about the head and mouth of the fish caught on each occasion, <lb/>
            and drawing it from below to the contrary up14 by rods and <note type="footnote"> 10 The Greek word <foreign xml:lang="grc">πληγῃ̃</foreign> is correctly omitted by Ficinus. </note><note type="footnote"> 11 I have been compelled to coin this uncouth compound in English, <lb/>

          <p>Thecæ. [That of hook-fishing with rods]; 15 and we now <lb/>
            appear to have arrived at the end of that, which we proposed <lb/>
            as being necessary to find out.</p>
          <p>[13.] Guest. Now then, you and I have not only agreed <lb/>
            about a name for the fishing art, but we have likewise suffi­ <lb/>
            ciently accepted the reason respecting the thing itself For <lb/>
            of the whole art, a half was in the acquiring; and of the <lb/>
            acquiring, a half was in the getting hold; and of the getting <lb/>
            hold, a half was in the hunting; and of the hunting, (a half) <lb/>
            was in the animal-bunting ; and of the animal-hunting, (a <lb/>
            half) was in the hunting in a liquid ; and of the hunting in a <lb/>
            liquid, the downward division was wholly sea-fishing; and of <lb/>
            the sea-fishing, (a half) was the fishing by a blow ; and of <lb/>
            the fishing by a blow, (a half) was by a hook; and of this (a <lb/>
            half) was about the blow drawing from below upwards ;16 <lb/>
            and that from the act itself (to which) the name has been <lb/>
            made to resemble the fisherman’s art, having been now dis­ <lb/>
            covered, is called by that appellation.</p>
          <p>Theæ. This, then, has been shown in every respect suffici­ <lb/>
            ently.</p>
          <p>Guest. Come then, let us endeavour according to this ex­ <lb/>
            ample to discover what a sophist is.</p>
          <p>Theæ. By all means.</p>
          <p>[14.] Guest. Now this was the first search in the pattern <lb/>
            just adduced, whether we must put down a fisherman as an <lb/>
            untaught individual, or as possessing some art.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. It was.</p>
          <p>Guest. And now, Theætetus, shall we put down this per­ <lb/>
            son as an untaught individual, or as truly a sophist in all <lb/>
            things ?17 <note type="footnote"> Is This answer, plainly required by the question, Taylor ventured to <lb/>

            derstand what you mean,18 that he who possesses the name, <lb/>
            ought to be such. But we must put him down as possessing <lb/>
            some art.</p>
          <p>Guest. What is then the art? By the gods, are we ig­ <lb/>
            norant that one of these men is a relation of the other ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Whom of whom ?</p>
          <p>Guest. The fisherman of the sophist.</p>
          <p>Them. In what way ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Both of them appear to me to be hunters.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. Of what prey is this (the hunter) ? for we have <lb/>
            spoken of the other,</p>
          <p>Guest. We divided the whole of hunting into the swimming <lb/>
            and the walking.</p>
          <p>• Theæ. We did.</p>
          <p>Guest. And we went through such a portion as related to <lb/>
            the swimming part of the aquatic kind ? but we left the walk­ <lb/>
            ing undivided, having said that it was multiform.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>[15.] Guest. Thus far then the sophist and the fisherman <lb/>
            equally proceed from the art of acquiring.</p>
          <p>Theæ. They appear so.</p>
          <p>Guest. But they turn themselves from the animal hunting, <lb/>
            one to the sea, and rivers, and lakes, and he catches animals <lb/>
            in these.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Undoubtedly.</p>
          <p>Guest. But another (turns himself) to the land, and <lb/>
            some other rivers, as if they were meadows of wealth and youth <lb/>
            without stint, with the view of getting hold of the animals <lb/>
            nourished in them.</p>
          <p>Theæ. How say you ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Of the hunting on foot, there are two chief parts.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Of what kind is each ?</p>
          <p>Guest. One is the hunting of tame animals, and the other <lb/>
            of wild. <note type="footnote"> to explain by saying that Plato is playing on the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">σοφιστὴν</foreign>, by which <lb/>
            he meant not a sophist, in a bad sense, but in a good one, as being <foreign xml:lang="grc">σοφόν</foreign>. <lb/>
            But such a play would in a serious inquiry be quite out of character. <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Thecæ. Is there any hunting then of tame animals ?</p>
          <p>Guest. If indeed man is a tame animal. But lay down in <lb/>
            whatsoever way you like, either that no animal is tame, or <lb/>
            that some other is tame, but that man is a wild one; or <lb/>
            you say 19 that man indeed is a tame animal, but you think 19 <lb/>
            that there is no hunting of men. Whichever of these suppo­ <lb/>
            sitions you deem it agreeable to you to be stated, this do you <lb/>
            define.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. I think, stranger, we are a tame animal, and I say <lb/>
            that there is a hunting of men.</p>
          <p>[16.] Guest. Let us say then that tame-animal hunting is <lb/>
            of two kinds.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Speaking according to what manner ?</p>
          <p>Guest. By defining the hunting by robbers, and that which <lb/>
            makes slaves, and that by tyrants, to be one and all a hunting <lb/>
            by force.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Very well.</p>
          <p>Guest. But by calling that which pertains to law-courts, <lb/>
            popular assemblies, and (private) discourse, one and all a cer­ <lb/>
            tain single persuasive art.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Right.</p>
          <p>Guest. Now of this persuasive art let us say there are two <lb/>
            kinds.</p>
          <p>Theæ. What are they?</p>
          <p>Guest. One is, private, and the other public.</p>
          <p>Theæ. There are then these two species.</p>
          <p>Guest. Again, with respect to private hunting, one kind is <lb/>
            (connected with) wages, and the other with gifts.</p>
          <p>Theæ. I do not understand.</p>
          <p>Guest. It seems you have never given your mind to the <lb/>
            hunting of lovers.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Why say you so ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Because persons bestow even gifts in addition upon <lb/>
            the caught.</p>
          <p>Theæ. You speak most truly. <note type="footnote"> 19 After <foreign xml:lang="grc">θὲς</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">τιθει̃ς</foreign>, by no process could <foreign xml:lang="grc">λέγεις</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ήγει̃</foreign> be introduced, <lb/>

            suspect that he omitted, as Ficinus does, both the verbs. Heindorf, whom <lb/>

          <p>Guest. Let this then he a kind of the amatory art.</p>
          <p>Theæ. By all means.</p>
          <p>[17.] Guest. But as regards that connected with wages, <lb/>
            that part of it which keeps up an intercourse through favour, <lb/>
            and has in every way made a bait through pleasure, and bar­ <lb/>
            gains for food for itself as its wages, this, I think, we should <lb/>
            all of us call adulation, or20 a certain pleasure-giving art.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Undoubtedly.</p>
          <p>Guest. But the other part of it, which professes to keep <lb/>
            up an intercourse for the sake of virtue, and bargains for <lb/>
            coin as its wages, is it not worthy to call by another name ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. But with what (name) ? Try to tell me.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It is evident. For we appear to me to have found <lb/>
            the sophist; and thus calling him, I think I should call him <lb/>
            by a fitting name.</p>
          <p>Guest. According to the present reasoning, it seems, <lb/>
            Theoetetus, the art of a sophist must be called 21 domestic <lb/>
            hold-getting, [acquiring,] hunting, animal-hunting, [land­ <lb/>
            hunting], on land, [tame-animal-hunting,] man-hunting, (by­ <lb/>
            persuasion-hunting,) individual-hunting, [wages-hunting,] <lb/>
            coin-selling, and insnaring rich and noble young men, through <lb/>
            a false reputation for erudition, as the present reasoning now <lb/>
            goes with us.21</p>
          <p>[18.] Theæ. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Let us consider further still in this way. For the <note type="footnote"> 20 Taylor had anticipated Heindorf in supplying <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἢ</foreign> before <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡδυντικὴν</foreign>. <lb/>
            21—21 In lieu of this mass of corruption, Ficinus has what is not indeed <lb/>
            unworthy of Plato, but what he probably made out, not so much from <lb/>
            the text found in his MS., as from his own good sense : " Ut ex hac dis­ <lb/>

            rejected, and the latter inserted, by Schleiermacher, whom Heindorf and <lb/>
            Stalbaum have followed. They failed, however, to perceive that in this <lb/>
            enumeration, which is intended to be a summary of the preceding sub­ <lb/>
            divisions, only such words would be introduced as had been mentioned <lb/>
            already; and that consequently we must reject all the rest, with the ex­ <lb/>
            ception of <foreign xml:lang="grc">νέων πλουσίων καὶ ἐνδόξων γιγνομενη θήρα</foreign>, which evidently <lb/>
            belong to another place ; for they could not occur here for the first time, <lb/>

            object of our present search does not participate in some con­ <lb/>
            temptible art, but in a very clever one. For from what has <lb/>
            been before stated, an idea presents itself that it is not that <lb/>
            kind of art, which we just now said, but some other kind.</p>
          <p>Theæ. How so ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Of the art of acquiring, there was a two-fold kind, <lb/>
            one. consisting in the catching, and the other in the ex­ <lb/>
            changing.</p>
          <p>Theæ. There was.</p>
          <p>Guest. Let us say then, that of the exchanging there are two <lb/>
            kinds, the one consisting in giving, and the other in selling.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. Let it be so said.</p>
          <p>Guest. And again, we will say that the selling must have <lb/>
            a two-fold division.</p>
          <p>Theæ. In what way ?</p>
          <p>Guest. 22 He who exposes his own works for sale is called <lb/>
            a seller of his own (property); but he who sells the works <lb/>
            of others, an exchanger.22</p>
          <p>Theæ. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>[19.] Guest. But is not the exchange, which takes place <lb/>
            in (the same) city, and which is nearly a half of the whole <lb/>
            of the trade, called capelic?23</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Guest. And is not that which effects an exchange from <lb/>
            one city to another, by buying and selling, (called) emporic ?23</p>
          <p>Theæ. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. And do we not perceive, in the case of the em­ <lb/>
            poric,23 that the sale of the articles by which the body and <lb/>
            soul are nourished, and which they use (respectively), becomes <lb/>
            barter by means of coin ? <note type="footnote"> 22—22 Such is Taylor's translation of the version of Ficinus, " Qui opera <lb/>
            sua venalia facit, propriorum venditor nominatur; qui aliena vendit, com­ <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Theœ. How say you this ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Of that part, which relates to the soul, we are <lb/>
            perhaps ignorant: but the other we understand.</p>
          <p>Theœ. We do.</p>
          <p>Guest. 24 Let us say then as regards music in general, <lb/>
            which is constantly purchased at one place, and, carried from <lb/>
            city to city, is sold at another; and as regards painting, <lb/>
            wonder-working, and other things pertaining to the soul, <lb/>
            which are imported and sold, some for the sake of amusement, <lb/>
            others for graver pursuits, that the person, who imports and <lb/>
            sells them, would give a handle to be called a merchant no <lb/>
            less than by the sale of meats and drinks.24 <lb/>
            [20.] Theœ. You speak most true.</p>
          <p>Guest. Will you not, then, call by the same name him who <lb/>
            goes about from city to city to buy learning for money ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Guest. But of this soul-trafficking, would not one part be <lb/>
            most justly called an exhibition; but the other part, although <lb/>
            no less ridiculous 25 than the former,26 still as being a selling <lb/>
            of learning, there is a necessity to call it by a name the brother <lb/>
            to the act.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Guest. But in this learning-selling, the trade which relates <lb/>
            to other arts must be called by one name, and that which re­ <lb/>
            lates to virtue by another.</p>
          <p>Theœ. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. For as regards the others, the name " art-seller" <lb/>
            would be fitting; but as regards this, do you consider what <lb/>
            name to call it.</p>
          <p>Theœ. And what other name, except that sought out <lb/>
            now for the sophistic. race, could one mention without an <lb/>
            error ?</p>
          <p>Guest. No other. Now then let us collect it together, by <lb/>
            saying that by a second (search), the sophistic art appeared <lb/>
            to consist in the acquiring, exchanging, buying, trafficking, <note type="footnote"> 24—24 The whole of this most corrupt passage is found in the version of <lb/>

            soul-trafficking respecting discourses, and the selling the <lb/>
            learning of virtue.</p>
          <p>[21.] Theœ. Just so.</p>
          <p>Guest. By a third (search), I think that you will call by no <lb/>
            other name, than (we have done) just now, the person who, <lb/>
            being settled in a city, partly buys and partly fabricates <lb/>
            himself learning respecting these very same subjects, and by <lb/>
            selling determines for himself to live by such a plan.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Why, indeed, should I not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. And that part too of the acquiring art, which <lb/>
            consists in exchanging, purchasing, and selling in both ways, <lb/>
            either ones own inventions, or those of others, you will ever <lb/>
            call, as you seem, a sophistic kind, whatever may be the <lb/>
            learning-selling respecting such things.27</p>
          <p>Theœ. Necessarily so. For it is necessary to be the fol­ <lb/>
            lower of reason.</p>
          <p>Guest. Let us still further consider, whether the kind, which <lb/>
            has been now pursued, is similar to some such thing as this.</p>
          <p>Theœ. To what?</p>
          <p>Guest. Of the art of acquiring a certain part consisted in <lb/>
            contesting.</p>
          <p>Theœ. It did.</p>
          <p>Guest. It will not then be from the purpose to divide it in­ <lb/>
            to two.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Say into what parts ?</p>
          <p>Guest. By laying down one part as a contest (of friends), <lb/>
            and the other as the fight of (foes).</p>
          <p>Theœ. It is so.</p>
          <p>[22.] Guest. Of the fighting part then, when a body comes <lb/>
            in conflict with a body, it is nearly reasonable and becoming <lb/>
            for persons, laying down28 a name, to pronounce it, as it were, <lb/>
            violent.</p>
          <p>Theœ. It may. <note type="footnote"> 27 This is the literal translation of the mass of nonsense in the text, which <lb/>
            Stalbaum vainly endeavours to conceal by a more elegant but less faithful <lb/>
            version. Ficinus has what is at least intelligible, by omitting the very <lb/>
            words in which the chief difficulty lies, and by rendering <foreign xml:lang="grc">καπηλικὸν εἴτε <lb/>
            αὐτοπωλικὸν</foreign>, “ sive sua inventa sive aliena—vendat,” a version which <lb/>
            Heindorf and Stalbaum have thought proper to adopt rather than confess, <lb/>
            as they should have done, their inability to understand fairly the passage. </note><note type="footnote"> 28 Instead of the circumlocution found in the Greek text, which it is <lb/>
            not easy to explain grammatically, Ficinus has merely, " Pugna utiquc <lb/>
            corporis ad corpus violentia congrue nuncupatur." </note> <pb n="117"/>
            </p>
          <p>Guest. But in the case of reasons (coming in conflict) with <lb/>
            reasons, what else, Theætetus, would any one call it but con­ <lb/>
            tention ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. Nothing else.</p>
          <p>Guest. But as to contentions, we must lay down a twofold <lb/>
            division.</p>
          <p>Theœ. In what way ?</p>
          <p>Guest. So far as (contention) takes place through prolix <lb/>
            arguments against prolix arguments and about things just and <lb/>
            unjust in a public matter it is judicial.</p>
          <p>Theœ. It is.</p>
          <p>Guest. But when it takes place in a private one, and is <lb/>
            broken to minute parts, by questions to answers,29 are we ac­ <lb/>
            customed to call it any thing else than contradiction.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Nothing else.</p>
          <p>Guest. But of contradiction, that part which respects (pri­ <lb/>
            vate) contracts is made the subject of dispute, and is carried <lb/>
            on carelessly and without art, we must place as a separate <lb/>
            (kind) ; since reason distinguishes it as being something dif­ <lb/>
            ferent ; but it has neither obtained an appellation from any <lb/>
            of those of a former period, nor does it deserve to obtain one <lb/>
            now from us.</p>
          <p>Theœ. True, for it is divided into parts extremely small <lb/>
            and very various.</p>
          <p>[23.] Guest. But that which is according to art, and dis­ <lb/>
            putes about things just and unjust, in the abstract, and uni­ <lb/>
            versally about other matters, we are accustomed to call con­ <lb/>
            tentious.</p>
          <p>Theœ. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. But of the contentious, one part destroys wealth, <lb/>
            and the other makes it.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Let us then endeavour to state by what name it is <lb/>
            needful to call each of these.</p>
          <p>Theœ. It is proper to do so.</p>
          <p>Guest. I think then that the neglect of private affairs, <lb/>
            which takes place through the delight in the practice of con­ <lb/>
            tention, and through the telling to the majority of listeners <note type="footnote"> 29 To avoid the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕστερον πρότερον</foreign> in the words " by questions to an­ <lb/>
            swers " Ficinus has " interrogando respondendoque," which makes at <lb/>
            least an intelligible sense. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="118"/>
            what is not heard with pleasure, may be called, according to <lb/>
            my notion, something not different from babbling.30</p>
          <p>Theœ. It is indeed called so.</p>
          <p>Guest. But do you now in your turn endeavour to tell the <lb/>
            contrary name of him, who makes money through private <lb/>
            quarrels.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. Would not any one err, in calling him by any other <lb/>
            name than that of the wonderful sophist, who, after being <lb/>
            pursued by us, has now come again for the fourth time (in <lb/>
            our view) ?</p>
          <p>Guest. The sophist then, as it seems, is nothing else but <lb/>
            that money-making genus, which is a part of the arts of quar­ <lb/>
            .relling, contradiction, controversy, (hostile) fighting, (friendly) <lb/>
            contest, and acquisition, as our reasoning has pointed out.</p>
          <p>Theœ. He is altogether so.</p>
          <p>[24.] Guest. You see, then, it is truly said, that this wild <lb/>
            beast is a various animal, and that, according to the pro­ <lb/>
            verb, he is not to be caught with the left hand.</p>
          <p>Theœ. It is necessary then (to use) both hands.</p>
          <p>Guest. It is necessary; and we must to the utmost of our <lb/>
            power do something of this kind, by running after its foot­ <lb/>
            marks. But tell me, have we not words relating to household <lb/>
            affairs ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. Yes, many. But about which of the many are you <lb/>
            inquiring ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Such as when we say to pass through a cullender, <lb/>
            to bolt through a bag, to pass through a sieve, [to separate.] 31</p>
          <p>Theœ. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. And besides these, we know the words, to card <lb/>
            (wool), to draw it down, to weave it, and ten thousand others <lb/>
            of a like kind existing in the arts. Do we not ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. What being desirous to point out respecting them, <lb/>
            and to bring forward as a pattern, have you made this inquiry <lb/>
            in general terms ? <note type="footnote"> 30 In his translation of this passage Ficinus has introduced the words <lb/>

            certain respect divisive.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. They are.</p>
          <p>Guest. According to my reasoning then we will think worthy <lb/>
            of one name the art, which as regards them is one in them all.</p>
          <p>[25.] Theœ. What name calling it ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Discriminative.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Be it so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Consider again, whether we are able to perceive <lb/>
            two kinds of it ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. You are imposing, for a person like me, a rapid <lb/>
            consideration.</p>
          <p>Guest. In the discriminations mentioned above it was our <lb/>
            business to separate the worse from the better, and the similar <lb/>
            from the similar.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. It appears that it was nearly so said.</p>
          <p>Guest. Of the latter (discrimination) I cannot tell the <lb/>
            name; but I can of that which leaves the better and rejects <lb/>
            the worse.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Inform me what it is.</p>
          <p>Guest. The whole of this discrimination, as I understand it, <lb/>
            is called by all men a certain purification.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. It is so called.</p>
          <p>Guest. Would not then every one see that the purification <lb/>
            is in kind twofold ?</p>
          <p>Thecæ. Yes, (looking at it) at leisure perhaps; but I do <lb/>
            not see it at present.</p>
          <p>[26.] Guest. It is proper then to comprehend in one name <lb/>
            the many kinds of purifications appertaining to the body.</p>
          <p>Theœ. What (are they) ? and by what name (do you call <lb/>
            them) ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Whatever within the bodies of living animals is, <lb/>
            after being properly separated by the arts of exercise and <lb/>
            of medicine, purified, and whatever the bath-art supplies, re­ <lb/>
            lating to things outside (the body) very vile to mention, and <lb/>
            the things relating to inanimate bodies, of which the fuller's <lb/>
            art, and the whole art of adorning the body, have the care in <lb/>
            trifling matters, possess many and seemingly ridiculous names.32 <note type="footnote"> 32 Such is the literal version of this perplexed passage, where some­ <lb/>
            thing is evidently wanting to complete the sense. Ficinus could, I sus­ <lb/>
            pect, do no more than guess at the meaning of the Greek text, which he </note> <pb n="120"/>
            </p>
          <p>Theœ. Very much so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Entirely so,33 Theætetus. But the method of rea­ <lb/>
            soning cares not either much or little about the art of wip­ <lb/>
            ing with a sponge or the drinking a medicine, whether the <lb/>
            one benefits us little and the other much, by a purifica­ <lb/>
            tion. Since for the sake of the mind possessing something <lb/>
            correctly,34 (science)35 endeavours to understand what is <lb/>
            allied and what is not allied to all arts, and it honours all <lb/>
            equally on this account; and does not consider that some <lb/>
            things are more ridiculous than others as regards their simili­ <lb/>
            tude ; nor has it held that he, who exhibits the hunting art <lb/>
            in the character of a general, is at all more respectable than <lb/>
            (he who does so) in that of a louse-catcher, but is for the <lb/>

            what you asked, by what name shall we speak of all the <lb/>
            powers together which are allotted for the purifying a body <lb/>
            either animate or inanimate? But it makes no difference <lb/>
            what name may appear to be more becoming. Let it be only <lb/>
            separate from the purgations of the soul, and include (in it­ <lb/>
            self) all such things as purify any thing else. For (the method <lb/>
            of reasoning) has just now endeavoured to separate the in­ <lb/>

            means. <note type="footnote"> has thus translated :—“ Purgatio animati corporis, intrinsecus operans per <lb/>

          <p>Theœ. But I do understand, and I grant that there are two <lb/>
            species of purification; one species respecting the soul, and <lb/>
            separate from that respecting the body.</p>
          <p>Guest. (You speak) in the most beautiful manner. Listen <lb/>
            then to me in what follows, and endeavour to give a two-fold <lb/>
            division to what has been said.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. Wherever you may lead, I will endeavour to make <lb/>
            a division with you.</p>
          <p>Guest. We say, then, that depravity in the soul is some­ <lb/>
            thing different from virtue.</p>
          <p>[28.] Thecæ. How not?</p>
          <p>Guest. And that to leave the one, and to cast out as far as <lb/>
            may be the bad, was a purification.</p>
          <p>Theœ. It was so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Of the soul then, as far as we can discover a taking <lb/>
            away of depravity, we shall, in calling it a purification, speak <lb/>
            harmoniously.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Yes, very much so.</p>
          <p>Guest. As regards the soul, then, we must speak of two <lb/>
            kinds of depravity.</p>
          <p>Thes. What are they?</p>
          <p>' Guest. The one is like a disease in the body, but the other <lb/>
            is like an inherent baseness.</p>
          <p>Theœ. I do not understand.</p>
          <p>Guest. Perhaps you have not thought that disease is the <lb/>
            same with sedition.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Nor, again, have I what I ought to answer to this.</p>
          <p>Guest. Whether do you think sedition is any thing else <lb/>
            than the difference from a natural alliance through a certain <lb/>
            corruption.</p>
          <p>Theœ. It is nothing else.</p>
          <p>Guest. And is baseness any thing else than that kind of <lb/>
            dissonance which exists37 every where disagreeable?</p>
          <p>Theœ. It is nothing else.</p>
          <p>[29.] Guest. What then, have we not perceived in the <lb/>
            soul of those who conduct themselves ill, opinions at variance <note type="footnote"> 37 Heindorf adopted correctly Schleiermacher's <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνὸν</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἒν ὂν</foreign>, which is <lb/>

            these with each other ?</p>
          <p>Thecæ. And very much so.</p>
          <p>Guest. And yet all (these) are necessarily allied to each <lb/>
            other.</p>
          <p>Theœ. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. In calling then depravity a sedition and disease of <lb/>
            the soul, we shall speak correctly.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Most correctly.</p>
          <p>Guest. But when such things as participate of motion, and <lb/>
            propose to themselves a certain end, are, in attempting to <lb/>
            reach it, carried according to each impulse beside it, and miss <lb/>
            it, shall we say that they are affected thus through a con­ <lb/>
            gruity towards each other, or, on the contrary, through an <lb/>
            incongruity ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. It is evident through an incongruity.</p>
          <p>Guest. But we know that every soul is involuntarily <lb/>
            ignorant of any thing.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Very much so.</p>
          <p>Guest. But ignorance is nothing else than a delirium of the <lb/>
            soul, which, while it is impelled to truth, is carried away <lb/>
            from a (correct) perception.38</p>
          <p>Theœ. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. We must consider, therefore, a soul without intelli­ <lb/>
            gence as base and incongruous.</p>
          <p>Theœ. So it appears.</p>
          <p>[30.] Guest. It seems then there are these two kinds of <lb/>
            evil in the soul ; one, which is called by the multitude de­ <lb/>
            pravity, and is most evidently its disease-</p>
          <p>Theœ. It is.</p>
          <p>Guest. But the other (the multitude) call ignorance; but they <lb/>
            are unwilling to confess that it alone39 is a vice in the soul.</p>
          <p>Theœ. It must be readily granted, what, when you just <lb/>
            now spoke of it, I doubted, that there are two kinds of vice in <note type="footnote"> 38 To obtain this sense, and to preserve the syntax, we must read <lb/>

            the soul; and that we ought to consider cowardice, intem­ <lb/>

            we must lay down the accident of ignorance great and of <lb/>
            various kinds as a baseness.</p>
          <p>Guest. In the body then are there not two arts relating to <lb/>
            these two accidents ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. What are they ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Relating to baseness, the gymnastic; but to disease, <lb/>
            the medical.</p>
          <p>Theœ. They seem so.</p>
          <p>Guest. As regards insolence, injustice, and cowardice, is <lb/>
            not the chastising [justice]40 naturally the most fitting of all <lb/>
            arts ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. It is likely, as I may say,41 according to human <lb/>
            opinion.</p>
          <p>Guest. But can any one say that there is a more proper <lb/>
            (remedy)42 for all ignorance than the teaching art.</p>
          <p>Theœ. There is none.</p>
          <p>[31.] Guest. Come then, must we say there is only one <lb/>
            kind of the teaching art, or more ? But take notice, that there <lb/>
            are two greatest kinds of it.43</p>
          <p>Theœ. I do take notice.</p>
          <p>Guest. And it appears to me that we shall very quickly <lb/>
            discover this.</p>
          <p>Theœ. In what way ?</p>
          <p>Guest. By perceiving whether ignorance has a division in <lb/>
            the middle of it. For being twofold, it is evident that it <note type="footnote"> 40 The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκη</foreign>, as remarked by Stalbaum, is evidently an interpret­ <lb/>

            not for a modest expression, but an hyperbolical one, as I have shown in <lb/>

          <p>Theœ. What then ? Has the thing sought become visible ?</p>
          <p>Guest. I seem to see set apart a great and difficult kind of <lb/>
            ignorance, which outweighs all its other parts.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Of what kind is it?</p>
          <p>Guest. When he, who does not know a thing, thinks he <lb/>
            knows it; through which it nearly happens that all those <lb/>
            things, in which we are deceived by the imagination, take their <lb/>
            rise in the case of all persons.</p>
          <p>Theœ. True.</p>
          <p>Guest. And I think that to this (division) of ignorance alone <lb/>
            the name of non-erudition should be given.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>[32.] Guest. By what name then is to be mentioned that part <lb/>
            of the teaching art which frees (a person) from this (ignorance) ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. I think, Guest, that the other part is called handi­ <lb/>
            craft teaching, but that this is called here through us dis­ <lb/>
            cipline.44</p>
          <p>Guest. It is so called, Theætetus, by nearly all the Greeks. <lb/>
            But this also must be considered by us, whether the whole of <lb/>
            this is indivisible, or possesses a certain division worthy a <lb/>
            name.</p>
          <p>Theœ. It is requisite to consider this.</p>
          <p>Guest. It appears then to me, that this may in some way <lb/>
            be still further divided.</p>
          <p>Theœ. In what?</p>
          <p>Guest. Of the teaching art relating to discourses, one way <lb/>
            appears to be more rough, but another part of it more smooth.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Of what kind shall we call each of these ?</p>
          <p>Guest. One, the old-fashioned, paternal, which persons for­ <lb/>

            even now, when children do wrong, partly by severely re- <note type="footnote"> 44 In this passage, easy as it seems to be, there are some difficulties <lb/>
            which none of the editors have noticed. In the first place, the words <lb/>
            " through us " are perfectly unintelligible, and are properly omitted by <lb/>
            Ficinus; although less dependence is to be placed on his testimony than <lb/>
            it would otherwise deserve, as he omits " here " likewise. Secondly, as <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">διδασκαλία</foreign> is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">δημιουργικὴ</foreign>, so ought the <foreign xml:lang="grc">παιδεία</foreign> to have its <lb/>
            distinguishing epithet; and lastly, to preserve the climax in “here”— <lb/>
            and, afterwards, " nearly all the Greeks”—the name of a place should be <lb/>
            given or alluded to. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="125"/>
            reproving, and partly by mildly admonishing them. Now the <lb/>
            whole of this one may call most correctly admonition.</p>
          <p>Theœ. It is so.</p>
          <p>[33.] Guest. But the other45—since some seem, after <lb/>
            giving themselves to reflection, to hold that all ignorance is <lb/>
            involuntary, and that no one, who thinks himself wise, is will­ <lb/>
            ing to learn those things in which he considers himself <lb/>
            skilled, and that the admonitory kind of instruction, even <lb/>
            with great labour, effects but little.</p>
          <p>Theœ. And they think right.</p>
          <p>Guest. They therefore direct their course to an outlet for <lb/>
            their opinion by another mode.</p>
          <p>Theœ. By what mode ?</p>
          <p>Guest. They inquire into those matters, about which a man <lb/>
            thinks he says something to the purpose, when he is saying <lb/>
            nothing. They then easily examine the opinions of persons <lb/>
            as if they were in error, and bringing them together by a <lb/>
            reasoning process to the same point, they place them by the <lb/>
            side of each other; and by so placing, they show that the <lb/>
            opinions are at one and the same time contrary to themselves, <lb/>
            about the same things, with reference to the same circum­ <lb/>
            stances, and according to the same premises. And they see­ <lb/>
            ing46 are indignant with themselves, and become milder towards <lb/>
            others; and in this way are liberated from strong and harsh <lb/>
            opinions ; a liberation of all others the most pleasant to hear, <lb/>
            and the most firm to the party suffering. [34.] For they, <lb/>
            my dear boy, who purify these, think as physicians do with <lb/>
            respect to the body-that the body cannot enjoy food, which is <lb/>
            brought to it, until some one casts out the impediments in it; <lb/>
            and in like manner the others think that the soul can derive <lb/>
            no advantage from the learning brought to it, until some one, <lb/>
            by confuting, places the party confuted in a state of shame, <lb/>
            and by taking away the opinions, which are the impediments <lb/>
            to learning, exhibits him purified, and thinking that he knows <lb/>
            those things alone which he does know, and nothing more.</p>
          <p>Theœ. This is the best and the most temperate of habits.</p>
          <p>Guest. For all these reasons then, Theætetus, we must say, <lb/>
            that confutation is the greatest and chiefest of purifications; <note type="footnote"> Is After " the other," there is an interruption in the definition. </note><note type="footnote"> 46 After " seeing," the editors understand " this,” answering to " hoc " <lb/>

             <pb n="126"/>
            and, we must think that he who is not confuted, even though <lb/>
            he should be the great king himself, would be unpurified to <lb/>
            the greatest degree, and become uninstructed and ugly with <lb/>
            respect to those things, in which it is fit that he should be <lb/>
            most pure and beautiful, who is to be in reality happy.</p>
          <p>[35.] Theœ. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. But whom shall we say employ this art ? For I <lb/>
            fear to say the sophists.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Why so?</p>
          <p>Guest. Lest we should place on them a greater honour than <lb/>
            is fitting.</p>
          <p>Theœ. But yet what has been just now said appears to be <lb/>
            suited to some such character.</p>
          <p>Guest. So does a wolf (resemble) a do- a most savage <lb/>
            animal one the most mild. But he who wishes to be most of <lb/>
            all free from stumbling, ought to keep ever a guard on simili­ <lb/>
            tudes ; for it is a most slippery race. Let them however stand, <lb/>
            for I think there will not be a dispute about trifling defini­ <lb/>
            tions, at a time when persons are watching them sufficiently.</p>
          <p>TheB. It is not likely at least.</p>
          <p>Guest. Let then there be of the separating art one portion, <lb/>
            the purifying; of the purifying, let the part relating to the <lb/>
            soul be divided off; and of this let (a part) be the teaching <lb/>
            art; and of the teaching art, let instruction (be a part) ; and <lb/>
            of instruction, let that confutation, which takes place respect­ <lb/>
            ing a vain opinion of wisdom, be called, through the reason <lb/>
            now exhibited, nothing else than the sophistic art of a noble <lb/>
            race.</p>
          <p>[36.] Theœ. Let it be so called. But in consequence of so <lb/>
            many things having just now presented themselves, I am <lb/>
            doubtful what, as speaking the truth and urging it strenu­ <lb/>
            ously, I ought to say the sophist really is.</p>
          <p>Guest. You are very properly in doubt. And indeed one <lb/>
            ought to think, that even a sophist himself will now very <lb/>
            much doubt by what means he shall slip through the argu­ <lb/>
            ment. For the proverb rightly says, It is not easy to avoid <lb/>
            all (traps). Now therefore let us attack him with all our <lb/>
            might.</p>
          <p>TheB. You speak well.</p>
          <p>Guest. But, in the first place, let us stand and as it were <lb/>
            take breath; and while stopping let us reason among ourselves. <lb/>
             <pb n="127"/>
            Come then, in how many forms has the sophist appeared ? For <lb/>
            I think, he was found at first a hunter for wages of the youth­ <lb/>
            ful and rich.</p>
          <p>Theœ. He was.</p>
          <p>Guest. Secondly, a certain trafficker in the learning of the <lb/>
            soul.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Thirdly, did he not appear as a chapman in the <lb/>
            very same articles ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. He did. And fourthly, he was the seller of his own <lb/>
            inventions.</p>
          <p>Guest. You have properly reminded me of this; and of <lb/>
            the fifth (form) I will endeavour to remind you. For he was <lb/>
            a combatant in the contests of words, having been (so) defined <lb/>
            from the art of contention.47</p>
          <p>[37.] Theœ. He was so.</p>
          <p>Guest. The sixth form is indeed ambiguous; but neverthe­ <lb/>
            less we laid it down and conceded to him,48 that a sophist is <lb/>
            a purifier, as regards the soul, of such opinions as are an im­ <lb/>
            pediment to learning.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Do you then perceive, that, when any one seems <lb/>
            to know many things, and is called by the name of one art, <lb/>
            this it is not a healthful seeming; but that he, who is <lb/>
            thus affected with respect to any art, evidently cannot see <lb/>
            that part of it to which all this learning tends ? and hence <lb/>
            he 49 calls the person possessing them by many names, instead <lb/>
            of one.</p>
          <p>Theœ. This almost appears to be very natural. <note type="footnote"> 47 In the Gteek words, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν ἐριστικὴν τέχνην ἀφωρισμένος</foreign>, Heindorf <lb/>
            not only gives to the perf. pass. an active syntax, but takes it in a middle <lb/>
            sense, by rendering <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφωρισμένος</foreign> " sibi seorsim assumpsit." So too does <lb/>
            Stalbaum. But neither of them have been able to produce a single <lb/>
            passage in support of their views. I have followed Taylor, conceiving <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατὰ</foreign>. to be understood. Ficinus has most loosely, " artificiosus nimium <lb/>
            litigator." </note><note type="footnote"> 48 So Stalbaum translates <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτῳ̃ συγχωρήσαντες</foreign>. But <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτῷ</foreign> has no <lb/>

            something else. There is an error here, which it would not be difficult, <lb/>
            perhaps, to correct. </note> <pb n="128"/>
            </p>
          <p>Guest. Let us not then suffer the same 50 thing in this <lb/>
            search through indolence; but let us in the first place take up <lb/>
            again one of the things stated of the sophist; for one of them <lb/>
            appeared to me especially to indicate him.</p>
          <p>Them. Which of them ?</p>
          <p>Guest. We said that he was in a certain respect a contra­ <lb/>
            dictor.</p>
          <p>Theœ. We did.</p>
          <p>Guest. And does he not also become a teacher of this to <lb/>
            others ?</p>
          <p>Thecæ. How not ?</p>
          <p>[38.] Guest. Let us then consider about what such per­ <lb/>
            sons say they make contradictions. And let our consideration <lb/>
            be from the beginning in this way. With respect to divine <lb/>
            things, which are non-apparent to the many, do sophists make <lb/>
            them able to do this, (viz. to contradict) ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. This is indeed asserted of them.</p>
          <p>Guest. But with respect to the apparent things of earth <lb/>
            and heaven, and what pertains to these ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. Why not?</p>
          <p>Guest. In private meetings at least, when any thing is <lb/>
            asserted of generation and existence in general, we are con­ <lb/>
            scious that the sophists are powerful in contradicting, and that <lb/>
            they make others as powerful as themselves.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. But with respect to laws, and all political matters, <lb/>
            do they not also promise to make men contentious in these ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. Not one, as I may say, would discourse with them <lb/>
            unless they promised this.</p>
          <p>Guest. But writings relating to all the arts, and to each art <lb/>
            singly, are made public and deposited by him, who wishes to <lb/>
            learn what he ought to say against each handicraftsman.</p>
          <p>Theœ. You appear to me to speak of the writings of Pro­ <lb/>
            tagoras about wrestling and the other arts.</p>
          <p>Guest. And to the writings of many others, 0 blessed man. <lb/>
            But does not the art of contradicting seem to be a power <lb/>
            sufficient for controversy about all things, (to speak) sum­ <lb/>
            marily ?</p>
          <p>Thecæ. It appears that scarcely not a thing would be wanting. <note type="footnote"> 50 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">γε αὐτὸ</foreign>, Ficinus found in his MS. <foreign xml:lang="grc">γε</foreign> Tauro, as is evident <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>[39.] Guest. But by the gods, 0 boy, do you think this is <lb/>
            possible? For perhaps you young men see more acutely, <lb/>
            but we more dully, this thing.</p>
          <p>Theœ. What thing? and at what are you particularly <lb/>
            talking ? For I do not understand at all the present ques­ <lb/>
            tion.</p>
          <p>Guest. (Consider,) if it be possible for any one man to know <lb/>
            all things.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. If it were possible our race, 0 guest, would indeed <lb/>
            be blessed.</p>
          <p>Guest. How then can any one without knowledge him­ <lb/>
            self be able to urge any thing sound against him who pos­ <lb/>
            sesses knowledge ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. Not at all.</p>
          <p>Guest. What then would be the wonder in the sophistic <lb/>
            power ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. About what ?</p>
          <p>Guest. The manner by which sophists are able to get up <lb/>
            an opinion amongst the young, that they are the wisest <lb/>
            of all men in all things. For it is evident that, if they nei­ <lb/>
            ther contradicted rightly, nor appeared to the young to do so, <lb/>
            and, when appearing to do so, unless they seemed to be more <lb/>
            wise through their contentions, no one would, as far as your <lb/>
            business is concerned, even at leisure,51 give them money, <lb/>
            or be willing to become their scholar.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. Not even at leisure indeed.</p>
          <p>Guest. But now persons are willing.</p>
          <p>Theœ. And very much so.</p>
          <p>Guest. For the sophists appear I think to have a knowledge <lb/>
            themselves of that against which they speak.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. How should they not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. But do they act so in all things ? Say we it ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Guest. They appear, then, to their disciples to be wise in <lb/>
            all things.</p>
          <p>Theœ. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. But not being so in reality; for this appeared to be <lb/>
            impossible.</p>
          <p>Theœ. For how is it not impossible ? <note type="footnote"> 51 On the use of the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">σχολῃ̃</foreign> see the commentators on Soph. <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Guest. The sophist, then, has been shown to us to possess <lb/>
            a certain kind of a reputation for knowledge about all things, <lb/>
            but not according to the truth.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Entirely so. And what has been now said respect­ <lb/>
            ing sophists seems very nearly to be most rightly said.</p>
          <p>[40.] Guest. Let us therefore take a clearer pattern re­ <lb/>
            specting them.</p>
          <p>Thece. What is that ?</p>
          <p>Guest. This. But endeavour to answer by giving your <lb/>
            mind very closely to what I am saying.</p>
          <p>Theœ. Of what kind is the pattern ?</p>
          <p>Guest. As if any one should say, that he knows not (the <lb/>
            art of) asserting and contradicting, but of making and causing <lb/>
            all things by one art.</p>
          <p>Theœ. How said you all ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Of the commencement of the discourse you are <lb/>
            straightway ignorant; for, as it seems, you do not understand <lb/>
            the "all."</p>
          <p>Theœ. I do not.</p>
          <p>Guest. I say then that you and I are in the number of all <lb/>
            things, and besides us, there are other animals and trees.</p>
          <p>Theœ. How say you ?</p>
          <p>Guest. If any one should assert that he would make you and <lb/>
            me, and all the rest of productions-</p>
          <p>Theœ. Of what making do you speak? For you are not <lb/>
            speaking of a husbandman; because you mentioned him as a <lb/>
            maker of animals.</p>
          <p>Guest. I say, moreover, that he is the maker of the sea, the <lb/>
            earth, the heavens, the gods, and all other things ; and rapidly <lb/>
            making each of these, he sells them for a small sum.</p>
          <p>Theœ. You are speaking in jest.</p>
          <p>Guest. What! must we not consider that as a jest, when a <lb/>
            man asserts that he knows all things, and can teach another <lb/>
            all things, for a small sum of money, and in a short time ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>[41.] Guest. But have you any kind of jesting more arti­ <lb/>
            ficial or agreeable than the imitative ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. I have not. For you have mentioned a very large <lb/>
            kind, and comprehended all things in one, and that one nearly <lb/>
            the most varied.</p>
          <p>Guest. Do we not then know that he who undertakes to <lb/>
             <pb n="131"/>
            be able to make all things by one art, will, by fabricating <lb/>
            imitations and homonyms82 of things, through the art of <lb/>
            painting, be able, by showing the pictures at a distance, to <lb/>
            lie concealed from the stupid amongst young men (and) boys, <lb/>
            as being a person most competent to do whatever lie pleased ?</p>
          <p>Thes. How not?</p>
          <p>Guest. 53 But as to discourses, do we not expect that there <lb/>
            is such another art ? or is it not possible to bewitch the young <lb/>
            men, and those still standing far off from the truth of things, <lb/>
            through words (spoken) in their ears, and by showing them <lb/>
            images, as they are called, of every thing, so as to cause them <lb/>
            to be said to seem true, and for the speaker to be the wisest <lb/>
            of all men in all things? 53</p>
          <p>[42.] Theœ. Why should there not be another such art ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Is it not then necessary, Theætetus, that the ma­ <lb/>
            jority of those, who were then hearing, should, after a suf­ <lb/>
            ficient time has passed and they have themselves arrived at <lb/>
            manhood, come near to things as they are, and be compelled <lb/>
            through accidental circumstances to handle realities clearly, <lb/>
            and to change their former opinions, so that things (once) <lb/>
            great appear small, those (once) difficult, easy, and all the <lb/>
            mere appearances produced by discourses, are entirely over­ <lb/>
            thrown through works which occur in practice ?</p>
          <p>TheB. It appears so to me, as far as my age is capable of <lb/>
            judging; for I think that I too am one of those who are far <lb/>
            distant (from the truth).</p>
          <p>Guest. All we then, who are present, will endeavour, and <lb/>

            to bring you as near as possible (to the truth). With respect <lb/>
            to a sophist then tell me this. Is it clear, that he is one of <lb/>

            doubt, whether in the matters, respecting which he appears able <lb/>
            to contradict, he possesses in reality the requisite science ?</p>
          <p>Theœ. But how, Guest, can we (doubt of this) ? For <lb/>
            it is nearly evident from what has been said, that he is one <lb/>
            of those who take a part in jesting.</p>
          <p>Guest. We must put him down then as some enchanter <lb/>
            and mimic.</p>
          <p>[43.J Theœ. How must we not so put him ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Come then, it is now our business not to let go the <lb/>
            wild beast, for we have now nearly enclosed the sophist in a cast­ <lb/>
            ing net, one of the instruments used in discourses about things <lb/>
            of this kind,55 so that he cannot any longer escape from this.</p>
          <p>Theœ. From what ?</p>
          <p>Guest. That he is one of the wonder-workers.</p>
          <p>Theœ. This also is my opinion respecting him.</p>
          <p>Guest. It is decreed then, that we divide as quickly as pos­ <lb/>
            sible the image-producing art, and, going down against it, <lb/>
            seize upon the sophist, should he forthwith86 wait for us, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the royal mandate, and, delivering him up, exhibit <lb/>
            our prey to him (the king). But if he creeps into the parts <lb/>
            of the imitative art, we are to follow him, always dividing <lb/>
            the part which receives him, until he is caught. For neither <lb/>
            will he, nor any other genus, ever boast to escape the method <lb/>
            of those, who are able to follow thus the points singly and <lb/>
            universally.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. You speak well. And in this manner, therefore, <lb/>
            we must act. <note type="footnote"> 55 All the edd. have, iv' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμφιβληστρικῷ τινι</foreign> rwv iv <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοι̃ς λόγοιςπερὶ <lb/>

            you are speaking.</p>
          <p>Guest. I see that one is the assimilative art. And this <lb/>
            especially takes place, when any one according to the propor­ <lb/>
            tions of the original, in length, breadth, and depth, and more­ <lb/>
            over by adding fitting colours, works out the production of an <lb/>
            imitation.</p>
          <p>Thece. What then, do not all imitators endeavour to do this ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Not such as mould or paint any great work. For, <lb/>
            if they would give the true proportion of beautiful things, you <lb/>
            know that the upper parts would appear smaller than is fit­ <lb/>
            ting, and the lower parts larger, through the former being <lb/>
            seen by us at a distance, and the latter close at hand.</p>
          <p>Thece. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>[45.] Guest. Do not then the artists, bidding farewell to <lb/>
            truth, now work out not real proportions, but such as will <lb/>
            seem to be beautiful in their representations?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>- Guest. Is it not then just, as being at least probable,57 to call <lb/>
            one an Image ?</p>
          <p>Thes. Yes.</p>
          <p>Guest. And we must call the part of the imitative art, sub­ <lb/>
            sequent to this, as we said above, assimilative.</p>
          <p>Theæ. We must so call it.</p>
          <p>Guest. But what shall we call that, which appears indeed <lb/>
            similar to the beautiful, 58 through the view taken from a fa­ <lb/>
            vourable point,58 but which, (when seen by him 59) who has <lb/>
            the power to look on such things sufficiently,60 is not like that <lb/>
            to which it professes to be like ? Must we not (call it) an <lb/>
            appearance, since it appears to be, but is not like ? <note type="footnote"> 57 I confess I do not understand the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ει̉κός γε</foreign> or. </note><note type="footnote"> 58 _ 58 These words were omitted by Taylor, because he did not know what <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Theæ. Undoubtedly.</p>
          <p>Guest. Is not this part to be found abundantly in painting, <lb/>
            and in the whole of the imitative art ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. But may we not most correctly call that art, which <lb/>
            produces an appearance, but not an image, phantastic ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Very much so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Now I have already said that these were the two <lb/>
            kinds of the image-producing art, the assimilative and phan­ <lb/>
            tastic.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Correctly so.</p>
          <p>[46.] Guest. But that of which I doubted then, viz. in which <lb/>
            of these kinds we must put the sophist, I am not at all able even <lb/>
            now to see clearly. For the man is truly wonderful; and it is <lb/>
            extremely difficult to get a view of him ; since even now, very <lb/>
            well and cleverly, he has fled into a species, where it is hard <lb/>
            to track him out.</p>
          <p>Theæ. So it seems.</p>
          <p>Guest. Do you then assent to this through understanding <lb/>
            it ? or has a certain rush of reasoning carried you away to <lb/>
            giving a rapid assent according to custom ?61</p>
          <p>Theæ. How and for what do you say this ?</p>
          <p>Guest. We are, 0 blessed man, truly engaged in a specula­ <lb/>
            tion thoroughly difficult. For that this thing should appear <lb/>
            both to seem to be, and yet not be; and that a man should <lb/>
            assert certain things, and yet not true,-all these things (were) <lb/>
            always full of difficulty formerly, and are now. For he, who <lb/>
            thus 62 speaks, must either say or think that false things truly <lb/>
            exist; and thus speaking, Theætetus, it is extremely difficult <lb/>
            for him not to be hampered by a self-contradiction.</p>
          <p>[47.] Theæ. Why so?</p>
          <p>Guest. (Because) such a mode of speaking dares to suggest <lb/>
            that a nonentity exists; for otherwise there would not be a <lb/>
            falsehood, which exists. And the great Parmenides, 0 boy, <lb/>
            while we were yet boys, did from the first to the last testify <lb/>
            to this. For, both in prose and verse, he on every occasion <note type="footnote"> 61 But so far was Theætetus from being accustomed to give a rapid <lb/>
            assent, that he previously complained of the Stranger being too fast for a <lb/>
            man so slow. Hence we must insert on between <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγου</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">συνειθισ­ <lb/>

            thus speaks, " You must not (think)," says he, " non-entities <lb/>
            exist; but keep thy thoughts when searching from this road." <lb/>
            This then is both testified by him, and this discourse will the <lb/>
            most of all point it out, if examined with moderation. Let <lb/>
            us then, if it makes no difference to you, consider this in the <lb/>
            first place.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Put my business where you like. But in what <lb/>
            way the discourse will best proceed, do you consider yourself, <lb/>
            and lead me along in that path.</p>
          <p>Guest. It will be proper so to do. Tell me, then. Dare <lb/>
            we pronounce that which in no respect is ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. How not ?</p>
          <p>[48.] Guest. If then, not for the sake of contention nor of <lb/>
            jesting, but in seriousness, it were necessary for any of the <lb/>
            hearers to join with us in considering and stating to what <lb/>
            point one ought to carry the word "non-entity," for what thing <lb/>
            and of what kind do we think he would be able 63 to use it <lb/>
            himself, and to show (its use) to a person inquiring?</p>
          <p>Theæ. You ask a difficult question, and to a person like my­ <lb/>
            self utterly insurmountable.</p>
          <p>Guest. This however is evident, that to any one of entities <lb/>
            the expression of non-entity cannot be referred.</p>
          <p>Theæ. For how could it ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Since then it cannot be referred to an entity, one <lb/>
            cannot rightly refer it to any thing.</p>
          <p>Theæ. How could he ?</p>
          <p>Guest. And this too is evident to us, that we pronounce on <lb/>
            each occasion this word "something" respecting an entity. <lb/>
            For it is impossible to pronounce it alone, as if it were naked <lb/>
            and placed in a desert from all entities.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It is impossible.</p>
          <p>Guest. Thus considering, do you then agree with me, that <lb/>
            he who pronounces the word "something," must necessarily <lb/>
            mean some one thing ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Guest. For you will say, that the word " something " is a <lb/>
            sign of one thing, and that " somethings " is a sign of many <lb/>
            things. <note type="footnote"> 63 Stalbaum omits <foreign xml:lang="grc">ε̃χειν</foreign> and admits <foreign xml:lang="grc">τι</foreign> with MSS. which he considers <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Thecæ. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. But it is most necessary, as it appears, that he who <lb/>
            speaks of that, which is not something, must speak entirely of <lb/>
            nothing.</p>
          <p>Theæ. This is most necessary.</p>
          <p>Guest. Is not then this to be granted, that such a person <lb/>
            speaks indeed, but speaks of nothing ? But neither must we <lb/>
            say that he speaks, who endeavours to enunciate non-entity?64</p>
          <p>Theæ. The discourse would have then an end of doubt.</p>
          <p>[49.] Guest. Do not as yet speak any big word. For, 0 <lb/>
            blessed man, the greatest and first of doubts still remain as re­ <lb/>
            gards these things: for it happens to be about the very com­ <lb/>
            mencement of it (the discourse).</p>
          <p>Theæ. How say you ? Speak, and do not hesitate.</p>
          <p>Guest. To that, which is, something else may be added of <lb/>
            things that are.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. But to that, which is not, shall we say that something <lb/>
            can be added of things that are ?</p>
          <p>Thecæ. How so ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Now we place number universally among things <lb/>
            that are.</p>
          <p>Theæ. If indeed any thing else is to be placed as a thing <lb/>
            that is.</p>
          <p>Guest. Let us then not attempt to attribute the many," <lb/>
            nor " the one," to a non-entity.</p>
          <p>Theæ. We cannot it seems65 with propriety attempt it, as <lb/>
            reason says.</p>
          <p>Guest. How then can any one enunciate by the mouth, or <lb/>
            comprehend at all by intellect, non-entities, or a non-entity, <lb/>
            apart from number ?</p>
          <p>Thecæ. Tell me why not.</p>
          <p>Guest. When we speak of non-entities, do we not endeavour <lb/>
            to add " the many " of number ? <note type="footnote"> 64 I confess my inability to see what the speaker is aiming at. Ficinus <lb/>
            too seems to have been equally in the dark. For he thus renders the whole <lb/>

            aliquid, sed non unum quid, id est nihil dicere. The. Atqui neque loqui <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Theæ. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. And (when we speak of) a non-entity, (do we) not <lb/>
            (endeavour to adjoin) " the one " (of number) ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes, most clearly.</p>
          <p>Guest. And yet we say, that it is neither just nor right to <lb/>
            endeavour to add an entity to a non-entity.</p>
          <p>Theæ. You speak most truly.</p>
          <p>Guest. You perceive then, that it is not possible correctly to <lb/>
            enunciate, or speak of, or think of, a non-entity itself by itself; <lb/>
            but that it is incomprehensible, unspeakable, unpronounceable, <lb/>
            and irrational?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Did I, then, just now speak falsely, when I said, that <lb/>
            I would tell of the greatest doubt respecting it ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. What then, can we mention any (doubt) greater than <lb/>
            this ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Do you not see, 0 wonderful youth, from what has <lb/>
            been said, that non-entity leads him, who confutes it, into such <lb/>
            a perplexity, that in the very attempt to confute it, he is com­ <lb/>
            pelled to contradict himself?</p>
          <p>Thecæ. How say you ? Speak yet clearer.</p>
          <p>Guest. For me there is no occasion to consider any thing <lb/>
            clearer. For, when I laid down the proposition, that non-en­ <lb/>
            tity ought to participate neither of "the one," nor of "the many," <lb/>
            both a little before and now, I said " the one " abstractedly. <lb/>
            For I was speaking of a non-entity; you perceived this ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Guest. And again, a little before, I said that a non-entity was <lb/>
            unspeakable, ineffable, and irrational. Do you follow me ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. I do follow in a certain way.</p>
          <p>Guest. When, therefore, I endeavoured to fit entity (to non­ <lb/>
            entity), did I not say what is contrary to former (assertions) ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. You appear so.</p>
          <p>Guest. What then, did I not, when attributing this to it, <lb/>
            speak to it 66 as to one thing ?</p>
          <p>Thes. Yes.</p>
          <p>Guest. And yet, while calling it irrational, ineffable, and <lb/>
            unspeakable, did I not make the assertion as pertaining to <lb/>
            one thing ? <note type="footnote"> 66 So Stalbaum from many MSS., which I cannot understand. Heindorf <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Theæ. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. For we say, that if any one correctly speaks of non­ <lb/>
            entity, he ought to define it neither as one, nor many, nor <lb/>
            give it any appellation whatever; for it would be called al­ <lb/>
            ready one thing, according to this appellation.67</p>
          <p>[51.] Theæ. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. What then will some one say of me ? For, both for­ <lb/>
            merly and now, he will find me overthrown respecting the <lb/>
            proof of a non-entity. So that, as I have already said, let us <lb/>
            not think, in my speaking at least, of logical precision respect­ <lb/>
            in- a non-entity. But come, let us now consider this affair <lb/>
            in your speaking.</p>
          <p>TheB. How say you ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Come, endeavour in a becoming and noble manner, <lb/>
            as being a young man, and exerting yourself with all your <lb/>
            might, pronounce something about non-entity, conformable to <lb/>
            right reason, without adding to it either existence, or the one <lb/>
            or the many of number.</p>
          <p>Theæ. The readiness of my attempt would be vastly absurd, <lb/>
            were I, after seeing you suffer thus, to make it.</p>
          <p>Guest. But, if it seems good, let us dismiss both you <lb/>
            and myself with a farewell; and until we meet with some one <lb/>
            who is able to do this, let us say that the sophist has, with a <lb/>
            knavery greater than all, let himself down into a place from <lb/>
            which there is no outlet.</p>
          <p>[52.] Theæ. So indeed it appears.</p>
          <p>Guest. If then we should say that he possessed a certain fan­ <lb/>
            cy-effecting art, he would, from his use of words, easily lay hold <lb/>
            of us, and turn the discourse to the very contrary point. For <lb/>
            when we call him a maker of images, he will immediately ask <lb/>
            us, What do we assert an image to be universally. It is meet <lb/>
            then, Theætetus, to consider what answer to this question <lb/>
            should one give to the young man.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It is evident that we shall say that things seen in <lb/>
            water and mirrors are images, and moreover such things as are <lb/>
            painted and fashioned and the rest of other things of this kind.</p>
          <p>Guest. It is evident, Theætetus, that you have never seen <lb/>
            a sophist.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Why so ? <note type="footnote"> 67 This is the translation of Stalbaum's text after a correction by Hein­ <lb/>

          <p>Thece. How so ?</p>
          <p>Guest. When you give him this answer,68 should you speak <lb/>
            of any thing (seen) in mirrors or mouldings, he will laugh at: <lb/>
            your reasons ; when you speak to him as being able to see, <lb/>
            he will pretend that he knows nothing of mirrors, or water, <lb/>
            or of sight at all, but will ask you of that, which depends on <lb/>
            reason alone.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. What is that ?</p>
          <p>Guest. That, which in all those things you have mentioned, <lb/>
            you, speaking of as many, think fit to call by one name, pro­ <lb/>
            nouncing the word image as being in them all one thing. Speak <lb/>
            then and defend yourself, and yield nothing to the man.</p>
          <p>[53.] Thece. What then, 0 guest, can we say an image is, <lb/>
            except that it is made to resemble -the truth, being another <lb/>
            thing the counterpart ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Do you say that such other thing is truly so, or to <lb/>
            what do you apply the expression, such other ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. It is by no means truly a such other, but only <lb/>
            seems to be.</p>
          <p>Guest. Do you then call a truth a real entity ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. I do.</p>
          <p>Guest. But is not that, which is not true, contrary to truth ?</p>
          <p>Thece. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. 69 You say then that the seeming is not an entity, if <lb/>
            you assert that it is not a truth. It is however an entity.</p>

          <p>Guest. That then which is not really a non-entity, is really <lb/>
            that which we call a likeness.69</p>
          <p>Theæ. It nearly appears that non-entity is entwined by a <lb/>
            certain connexion of this kind with entity; and it is very <lb/>
            strange.</p>
          <p>Guest. How is it possible it should not be strange? You <lb/>
            now therefore perceive that through this alternation, the <lb/>
            many-headed sophist compels us unwillingly to confess that <lb/>
            non-entity does somehow exist.</p>
          <p>Theæ. I see it, and very much so.</p>
          <p>[54.] Guest. How, then, shall we define his art, and yet <lb/>
            be able to be consistent with ourselves ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Why do you speak thus, and of what are you afraid ?</p>
          <p>Guest. When we say that he is a deceiver about an appear­ <lb/>
            ance, and that his is a certain deceptive art, whether shall we <lb/>
            say that our soul then has a false opinion, through his art ? <lb/>
            or what shall we say ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. This very thing. For what else can we say ?</p>
          <p>Guest. But will false opinion be fancying things contrary <lb/>
            to those that are ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Contrary.</p>
          <p>Guest. You say then that false opinion fancies things that <lb/>
            are not.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It does so of necessity.</p>
          <p>Guest. Whether does it fancy that non-entities do not exist, <lb/>
            or that non-entities do exist in a certain way ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. If any one is ever deceived even a little, he must <lb/>
            (fancy)70 that non-entities do exist in a certain way.</p>
          <p>Guest. And will not entities entirely be likewise fancied <lb/>
            not to exist at all ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Guest. And this too falsely ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes, this too.</p>
          <p>Guest. And false reasoning will, I think, be deemed, in the <lb/>
            same way, to assert that entities do not exist, and non-entities <lb/>
            do exist.</p>
          <p>[55]. Theæ. For how can it otherwise become such (viz. <lb/>
            false) ? <note type="footnote">70 Ficinus has, " Si quis unquam quoquomodo opinando mentitur, <lb/>

          <p>Guest. Nearly not at all. But the sophist will not say <lb/>
            so. Or what device. is there for any one of a sound mind to <lb/>
            concede; when 71 the things that have been granted before <lb/>
            these71 have been admitted to be unspeakable, ineffable, <lb/>
            irrational, and incomprehensible? Do we understand what <lb/>
            ( the sophist) says, Theætetus ?</p>
          <p>Thecæ. How is it possible we should not? For he will <lb/>
            assert that we are saying things contrary to the present, in <lb/>
            having dared to assert that falsehoods exist in opinions and <lb/>
            reasons ;72 for that having been often compelled to unite <lb/>
            entity to non-entity, we have just now acknowledged, that <lb/>
            this is somehow the most impossible of all things.</p>
          <p>Guest. You have rightly recalled (me to the argument . But <lb/>
            it is now time to consult about what we ought to do respecting <lb/>
            the sophist. For, if we should attempt to search him out, by <lb/>
            placing him in the art of falsehood-workers and enchanters, <lb/>
            you see that his counter-graspings will be easy and (our) <lb/>
            difficulties many.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. Very.</p>
          <p>Guest. We have then gone through only a small part of <lb/>
            them; since they are, as I may say, boundless.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. If such is the case, it would be impossible, it seems, <lb/>
            to catch the sophist.</p>
          <p>[56.] Guest. What then, shall we now stand cowardly <lb/>
            aloof ?</p>
          <p>Thecæ. I say we ought not, if we are able by ever so little <lb/>
            to lay hold in some way of the man.</p>
          <p>Guest. You will then grant me pardon, and, as you just <lb/>
            now said, be satisfied, if we can draw by some means even a <lb/>
            little for ourselves out of such powerful reasoning.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. How shall I not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. This too I beg of you still further.</p>

          <p>Guest. Because it will be necessary for us, in self-defence, <lb/>
            to put to the torture the reasoning of my father Parmenides, <lb/>
            and to compel a nonentity to exist in some way, and again an <lb/>
            entity in some way not to exist.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. It appears that we must battle in our reasonings <lb/>
            for a thing of this kind.</p>
          <p>Guest. For how should this not be evident, as it is said, <lb/>
            even to a blind man ? For, while these things are neither <lb/>
            confuted nor confessed, any one will be able to speak at lei­ <lb/>
            sure about false assertions, or opinions respecting resemblances, <lb/>
            or images, or imitations, or appearances, or of the arts con­ <lb/>
            versant with these, without being ridiculous through his <lb/>
            being compelled to contradict himself.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Most true.</p>
          <p>Guest. Hence we, mustdare to oppose my father's reason­ <lb/>
            ing, or we must dismiss it altogether, if any sluggishness <lb/>
            restrains us from doing so (viz. opposing it).</p>
          <p>Theæ. But let nothing by any means restrain us.</p>
          <p>Guest. I will now beg of you still a third and trifling <lb/>
            request.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. Only mention it.</p>
          <p>Guest. I just now stated that I was always faint-hearted <lb/>
            about the confutation of these points, and so I am now.</p>
          <p>Theæ. You did say so.</p>
          <p>Guest. I fear as regards what has been said, lest I seem to <lb/>
            you to be insane, through my changing myself on the instant, <lb/>
            up and down. For we will throw ourselves on the confutation of <lb/>
            the reasoning, for your sake, if indeed we happen to confute it.</p>
          <p>Theæ. As you will not then by any means appear to me <lb/>
            to act improperly by advancing to the confutation and de­ <lb/>
            monstration, on this account at least advance boldly.</p>
          <p>Guest. Come then, what beginning shall we make to this <lb/>
            very danger-bringing discourse? Now it appears, 0 boy, to <lb/>
            be most necessary for us to turn to this road.</p>
          <p>[58.] Theæ. What?</p>
          <p>Guest. 73 To consider first those things which now seem to <lb/>
            be clear, lest we become flurried about them; and that we <lb/>
            without difficulty assent to each other, as if we were in a <lb/>
            position to judge correctly.73 <note type="footnote"> 73_73 In the whole of this passage Taylor merely put into English the <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Theæ. State more clearly what you mean.</p>
          <p>Guest. Both Parmenides and whoever else has rushed for­ <lb/>
            ward to the trial respecting the defining the quantity and <lb/>
            quality of entities, seems to me to have discussed the ques­ <lb/>
            tion loosely.74</p>
          <p>Theæ. How so ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Each seem to me to have told a tale to us, as if we <lb/>
            were boys. One of them said that the entities are three;75 <lb/>
            but that some of them at one time are at war with each other <lb/>
            in some manner; and at another, becoming friends, are mar­ <lb/>
            ried, bring forth, and furnish food to their offspring. But <lb/>
            another 76 said that the entities are only two, the moist and the <lb/>
            dry, or the hot and the cold; and these he unites in one house <lb/>
            and gives them (in marriage) to each other. But the Ele­ <lb/>
            atic sect among us, which derives its origin from Xenophanes, <lb/>
            and from others still prior to him, details in fables that what <lb/>
            is called the all is really one. But the Ionian,77 and subse­ <lb/>
            quently some Sicilian 78 muses have thought it more safe to <lb/>
            connect these with each other, and to say that entity is both <lb/>
            many and one, but held together by enmity and friendship. <lb/>
            For that, which is separated, always comes together, say the <note type="footnote"> make one believe, that he supplied from his own head what was either <lb/>
            wanting entirely, or only partially legible, iu the MS. he had before him. </note><note type="footnote"> 74 So Heindorf understands <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐκόλως</foreign>, which is literally, " of easy tem­ <lb/>
            per." But no philosopher would reason loosely. He might argue in a <lb/>
            circle. Hence Plato wrote, perhaps, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγκυκλἱως</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 73 Of the ancient philosophers, some said that the first principles were <lb/>
            three in number, the hot and the cold as extremes, but the moist as the <lb/>
            medium ; which sometimes conciliated the extremes, and sometimes not; <lb/>
            but they did not place the dry in the rank of a principle at all, because <lb/>
            they thought it subsisted either from the absence or evaporation of mois­ <lb/>
            ture. On the other hand, the followers of Anaxagoras asserted that there <lb/>
            were four elements, heat and cold being the active powers, and dryness <lb/>
            and moisture the passive. Heraclitus and Empedoeles asserted that the <lb/>
            matter of the universe was one, but its qualities many; with which the <lb/>
            matter sometimes agreed, and at others disagreed. Heraelitus, however, <lb/>
            conceived that the particles of the world were, through some discordant <lb/>
            concord, always similar, though not the same; for all things were in a <lb/>
            continual flux. But Empedoeles asserted that the substance of the world <lb/>
            remained the same; and that at one time all things were separated into <lb/>
            chaos through discord, and in another were out of ehaos reunited through <lb/>
            concord. T. </note><note type="footnote"> 76 This was Archelaus, the pupil of Anaxagoras. See Heindorf. </note><note type="footnote">77 This alludes to Heraelitus of Ephesus. </note><note type="footnote"> 78 This refers to Empedoeles of Agrigentum. </note> <lb/>

            more energetic 79 of the Muses. But the more gentle 79 relax 79 <lb/>
            (the doctrine by saying )80 that this takes place always as regards <lb/>
            (the whole),80 but that the whole is in turn now one, and friendly <lb/>
            (to itself),80 through Venus; and now many, and hostile to <lb/>
            itself, through a certain strife. [59.] But whether any one <lb/>

            This, however, I may without envy show forth.</p>
          <p>Theæ. What?</p>
          <p>Guest. That they greatly looked down upon, and held in little <lb/>
            esteem, us the many. For each of them finish their own work, <lb/>
            without caring at all whether we follow them when speaking, <lb/>
            or desert them.</p>
          <p>Theæ. How say you ?</p>
          <p>Guest. When any one of them asserts in his speech that­ <lb/>
            many, or one or two, exist, or have been, or are in the course <lb/>
            of production, and that the hot is mingled with the cold, (and) <lb/>
            elsewhere lays down somehow discretions and concretions,— <lb/>
            by the gods, Theætetus, do you understand what they are on <lb/>
            each occasion asserting? Indeed, when I was younger, I <lb/>
            thought that when any one spoke of a non-entity I accurately <lb/>
            understood that, which is now doubtful; but now you see <lb/>
            where we are in a difficulty respecting it.</p>

            same feeling in our soul respecting an entity, we say we can <lb/>
            easily understand it, when it is enunciated by any one ; but <lb/>
            not so, as regards the other, though similarly affected with re­ <lb/>

          <p>Theæ. Perhaps so.</p>
          <p>Guest. And let this very same thing be said by us respect­ <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Theæ. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. We will speculate then, after this, about the many <lb/>
            things, if it seems good; but let us now speculate about the <lb/>
            greatest and first leading thing.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Of what are you speaking ? Or is it plain that you <lb/>
            assert that we ought in the first place to search after entity, <lb/>
            and (see) what they, who speak of it, think they show.</p>
          <p>Guest. You understand me, Theætetus, on the instant. <lb/>
            For I say that we ought to adopt the same method, as if we <lb/>
            were inquiring of them here present in this way. Come, ye <lb/>
            who assert that the hot and the cold, or any two such things, <lb/>
            are the whole, what is it you affirm to subsist in both of these, <lb/>
            when you say that both and each exist ? What are we to <lb/>
            understand by this term of yours " to exist" ? Is it a third <lb/>
            thing different from those two, and are we to lay down three <lb/>
            things as the whole, and no longer two things, according to <lb/>
            you ? For, while you call one of the two an entity, you can­ <lb/>
            not surely say that both are similarly an entity. For in both <lb/>
            ways there would nearly be one thing, and not two.</p>
          <p>Thea. You speak the truth.</p>
          <p>Guest. Are you then willing to call both of them an entity ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Perhaps so.</p>
          <p>Guest. But, 0 friends, we shall say, you would thus most <lb/>
            clearly call even the two things one.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. You speak most correctly.</p>
          <p>[61.] Guest. Since then we are thus in doubt, do you <lb/>
            sufficiently explain to us what you wish to signify, when you <lb/>
            pronounce (the word) entity ? For it is evident that you are <lb/>
            conversant with these things long ago ; and we formerly <lb/>
            thought (we knew them), but now we are in doubt. Instruct <lb/>
            us then, first in this very thing, that we may not fancy we un­ <lb/>
            derstand what is asserted by you, when what is entirely contrary <lb/>
            to this is taking place. In speaking in this manner, and <lb/>
            making this request, both to these, and to such others as assert <lb/>
            that the all is more than one thing, shall we, 0 boy, do <lb/>
            any wrong ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. By no means.</p>
          <p>Guest. But ought we not to inquire, to the utmost of our <lb/>
            power, of those who assert that the all is one, what they call <lb/>

            it. Will they not ?</p>
          <p>Thece. Yes.</p>
          <p>Guest. What then, do you call entity a thing ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Guest. Do you say, it is that which the one is, employing <lb/>
            two names respecting the same thing ? or how ?</p>
          <p>[62.] Thece. What answer will they have after this, 0 <lb/>
            stranger ?</p>
          <p>Guest. It is evident, Theæetetus, that to him who lays down <lb/>
            this hypothesis, it will not be the easiest thing of all to give <lb/>
            an answer respecting the present question, or any other <lb/>
            whatever.</p>
          <p>Theæ. How so ?</p>
          <p>Guest. To acknowledge that there are two names, while <lb/>
            laying down that there is not but one thing, is surely ri­ <lb/>
            diculous.</p>
          <p>Thece. How not?</p>

          <p>Thece. In what manner ?</p>
          <p>Guest. He who lays down a name as different from a thing, <lb/>
            speaks of two certain things.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. He does.</p>
          <p>Guest. And yet, if he lays down that the name is the <lb/>
            same with the thing, he will be compelled to say, it is <lb/>
            the name of nothing; or, if he says it is the name of some­ <lb/>
            thing, it will result that a name is only the name of a name, <lb/>
            but of nothing else.</p>
          <p>Thece. It is so.</p>
          <p>Guest. And the one must be one entity alone of one, and <lb/>
            not83 itself the entity of a name. <note type="footnote"> 82 To complete the sentence, Ficinus adds, " temerarium," i. e. it is <lb/>
            rash; who omits, however, the words, <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγον ου̉κἄν ἔχον</foreign>, in which all the <lb/>
            difficulty lies. Taylor translates, " of which no account can be given." <lb/>
            Stephens, "rationi consentaneum haud fuerit," and reads <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔχοι</foreign>. Hein­ <lb/>

          <p>Thecæ. It is necessary.</p>
          <p>Guest. But do they say that the whole is different from <lb/>
            the one entity, or the same with it ?</p>
          <p>[63.] Thecæ. How will they not say it, and do say it ?84</p>
          <p>Guest. If, then, a whole is, as Parmenides says, " Like the <lb/>
            bulk of a sphere that is a perfect circle on all sides, and pos­ <lb/>
            sessing equal powers on every part from the middle;85 for <lb/>
            there must needs be nothing greater or less on this side or on <lb/>
            that;" it is necessary for entity, being of such a kind, to have <lb/>
            a middle and extremities; and having these, there is every <lb/>
            necessity for it to have parts. Or how shall we say ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Just so.</p>
          <p>Guest. But nothing prevents the divided from having in <lb/>
            all its parts the accident of the one; and in this way every <lb/>
            entity and a whole would be one.</p>
          <p>Theæ. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. But is it not impossible that what suffers such acci­ <lb/>
            dents should itself be the very one ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. How so ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Surely according to right reason, that, which is truly <lb/>
            the one, must be said to be entirely without parts.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It must indeed.</p>
          <p>Guest. But such a thing as consists of many parts would <lb/>
            not harmonize with the one.86</p>
          <p>Theæ. I understand you.</p>
          <p>Guest. But whether will entity, having the accident of the <lb/>
            one, be thus one, and whole ? or must we by no means say that <lb/>
            entity is a whole ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. You have proposed a difficult choice. <note type="footnote"> 84 Here is some error. To a double question there could not be a single <lb/>
            answer. Ficinus has " Cur non dixerint ? Dicunt enim." </note><note type="footnote"> 85 Ficinus, perceiving doubtless that the definition given by Parmenides <lb/>
            of a sphere was geometrically incorrect, added, I suspect, out of his own <lb/>
            head, between " a medio," and "penitus æque distans," the words "ad <lb/>
            circumferentiam." Had he been still living, I would have told him what, <lb/>
            I suspect, the philosophic poet did really write. As it is, I will leave the <lb/>
            truth to be discovered by future geometers and Greek scholars united. </note><note type="footnote"> 86 So Taylor translated, it would seem, from finding that the Greek <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τψ̃ ὅλψ</foreign> (or <foreign xml:lang="grc">τψ̃ὅλψ λόγψ</foreign> in some MSS., or <foreign xml:lang="grc">τψ̃ λόγψ ὅλωι</foreign>n others) was <lb/>
            at variance with the chain of reasoning. Heindorf indeed asserts, that <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τψ̃ λόγψ</foreign> is to be referred to <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὀν ὀρθὀν λόγον</foreign>, mentioned just before. But <lb/>
            in that case <foreign xml:lang="grc">δρθψ̃</foreign> would not have been omitted here. Perhaps Plato <lb/>
            wrote <foreign xml:lang="grc">τψ̃ ἐνἱγε ὅλψ</foreign>.. </note> <note type="footnote"> L 2 </note> <pb n="148"/>
            </p>
          <p>Guest. You speak however most truly. For entity having <lb/>
            the accident to be in some way one, it does not appear to be <lb/>
            the same as the one; and the all will be more than one. Is <lb/>
            it not so ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>[64.] Guest. But yet if entity is not a whole, on account <lb/>
            of its being subject to the accident belonging87 to the whole, <lb/>
            and yet is the whole itself, it follows that entity is in want of <lb/>
            itself.88</p>
          <p>Theæ. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. And entity, according to this reasoning, being de­ <lb/>
            prived of itself, will be a non-entity.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Just so.</p>
          <p>Guest. And thus again the all becomes more than one; since <lb/>
            both entity and the whole have obtained each their proper na­ <lb/>
            ture, apart from the other.</p>
          <p>Theæ. True.</p>
          <p>Guest. And if the whole has not an existence at all, the <lb/>
            very same things will take place with respect to entity ; and <lb/>
            in addition to its not having an existence, it would at no time <lb/>
            have been produced.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Why so ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Whatever is produced is always produced as a <lb/>
            whole. So that he, who does not place amongst entities [the <lb/>
            one or] 89 the whole, ought to speak neither of existence or <lb/>
            production as an entity.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It appears that such is wholly the case.</p>
          <p>Guest. Moreover, that, which is not a whole, must not have <lb/>
            the accident of any quantity whatever. For, while it has the <lb/>
            accident of quantity, whatever that may be, it must necessarily <lb/>
            be a whole.</p>
          <p>[65.] Theæ. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Each (view) then will appear to have taken up ten <lb/>
            thousand other endless doubts for him, who says that entity <lb/>
            is either two or only one.</p>
          <p>Theæ. The light which is just now breaking almost shows <note type="footnote"> 87 This is the. only intelligible rendering I can give to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπ' ἐκεἱνου</foreign>. <lb/>

            (this). For one thing is linked with another and brings with <lb/>
            it a wandering (of the mind) greater and more dangerous <lb/>
            respecting what has been from time to time asserted before.</p>
          <p>Guest. But we have not yet gone through the whole 90 of <lb/>
            those, who have accurately discoursed about entity and non­ <lb/>
            entity. Let, however, (this) suffice. And let us consider <lb/>
            again those who speak. inaccurately on these subjects, that we <lb/>
            may perceive from all quarters, that it is in no respect more <lb/>
            easy to say what entity is, than what non-entity is.</p>
          <p>Theæ. We must therefore march against them.</p>
          <p>Guest. Now, in truth, there appears to be among them, <lb/>
            as it were, a kind of giants' war, through their conflicts with <lb/>
            each other respecting existence.</p>
          <p>Theæ. How so ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Some of them draw down to earth all things from <lb/>
            heaven and the unseen region, unskilfully91 laying hold for <lb/>
            this purpose of rocks and oaks. For through their touching <lb/>
            all such things as these, they strenuously contend that that <lb/>
            alone exists, which affords impact and touch; and they define <lb/>
            body and existence to be the same. But if any one says that <lb/>
            of other things some have not a body, they thoroughly despise <lb/>
            (the assertion), and are unwilling to hear another (word).</p>
          <p>Theæ. You have spoken of terrible men. For I also have <lb/>
            met with many such.</p>
          <p>[66.] Guest. Wherefore the opponents92 of these men very <lb/>
            carefully defend themselves from on high, from the invisible re­ <lb/>
            gion, and compel certain intelligible and incorporeal forms to be <lb/>
            the true existence; and breaking into small pieces the bodies of <lb/>
            the others, and that, which is called by them truth, they do in <lb/>
            their own discourses, instead of existence, talk of some produc­ <lb/>
            tion carried on. But between these, Theætetus, an immense <lb/>
            contest has always existed respecting these matters.</p>
          <p>Theæ. True.</p>
          <p>Guest. Let us now, therefore, receive from both these <note type="footnote"> 90 The reading of <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάντως</foreign>, preserved by Eusebius alone, has been <lb/>

            races 93 an account in detail of the existence which they lay <lb/>
            down.</p>
          <p>Theæ. But how shall we receive it ?</p>
          <p>Guest. From those that place existence in forms we may <lb/>
            easily receive it; for they are more mild ; but from those <lb/>
            who violently draw all things to body, with more difficulty. <lb/>
            And perhaps it will be nearly impossible. It appears to me, <lb/>
            however, that we ought to act with respect to them in this way.</p>
          <p>Theæ. In what ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Most of all to render them, if possible, better in deed; <lb/>
            but if we make no progress in this, let us render them so in <lb/>
            word, by supposing them to answer more equitably than at pre­ <lb/>
            sent they would be willing to do. For that, which is assented to <lb/>
            by better persons, possesses more authority than that (which is <lb/>
            assented to) by worse. However, we pay no attention to these <lb/>
            things, but are seeking out the truth.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Most right.</p>
          <p>[67.] Guest. Order therefore those that have become bet­ <lb/>
            ter to answer you, and to interpret what they assert.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Be it so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Let them say then whether they call a mortal ani­ <lb/>
            mal a thing ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. And do they not acknowledge that this is an ani­ <lb/>
            mated body ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Guest. Laying down that the soul is one of the things that <lb/>
            exist.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Guest. But do they not say that one soul is just, and an­ <lb/>
            other unjust; and one prudent, and another imprudent?</p>
          <p>Theæ. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. But does not each soul become such through the <lb/>
            habit and presence of justice, and the contrary (through the <lb/>
            habit and presence) of the contraries ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes; to this likewise they assent.</p>
          <p>Guest. But will they say that what is able to be present to, <lb/>
            and absent from, any thing, is' something ? <note type="footnote"> 93 I cannot believe that Plato wrote here roiv <foreign xml:lang="grc">γενοι̃ν</foreign>.One would pre­ <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Theæ. They say it.</p>
          <p>Guest. Since then justice and prudence, and the other vir­ <lb/>
            tues, and their contraries, together with the soul in which they <lb/>
            are implanted, exist, whether will they say that each of these <lb/>
            is invisible and tangible, or that all of them are invisible ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. They will assert that nearly not one of them is <lb/>
            visible.</p>
          <p>[68.] Guest. But what ? Do they say that any one of such <lb/>
            things has a body ?</p>
          <p>Thecæ. They do not give the same answer to the whole of <lb/>
            this question; but that the soul itself appears to them to pos­ <lb/>
            sess a certain body; but with respect to prudence, and each <lb/>
            of the other things about which you just now inquired, they <lb/>
            are ashamed to dare either to confess that they are not one of <lb/>
            existing things, or to strenuously assert that all of them are <lb/>
            bodies.</p>
          <p>Guest. The men, Theætetus, have clearly become better. <lb/>
            For such of them as are seed-sown,94 or earth-sprung,95 would <lb/>
            not be ashamed to assert one of these points, but would con­ <lb/>
            tend that whatever they cannot squeeze together with their <lb/>
            hands, is altogether nothing.</p>
          <p>Theæ. You state very nearly what they think.</p>
          <p>Guest. Let us then again ask them. For, if they are will­ <lb/>
            ing to grant that even any trifling thing is incorporeal, it is, <lb/>
            sufficient. For they must say, with respect to these (incorpo­ <lb/>
            real) and those (corporeal), which have a body born with them, <lb/>
            what it is they look to, when they assert that both exist.</p>
          <p>[69.] 96 Theæ. Perhaps, however, they would be in a dif­ <lb/>
            ficulty.</p>
          <p>96 Guest. But if they suffer any thing of this kind, consider <lb/>
            whether, on our proposing the question, they would be willing <lb/>
            to admit and confess that existence is a thing of this kind.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Of what kind ? Speak, and we shall quickly know.</p>
          <p>Guest. I say then, that what possesses any power soever, <lb/>
            whether of doing any thing naturally to another, or of suffering <note type="footnote"> 94 In the expression " seed-sown," there is an allusion to the Thebans, <lb/>
            who were said to be the descendants of the men, who sprung up from the <lb/>

            even the least thing from the vilest thing, although only once,­ <lb/>
            every thing of this kind does really exist. For I lay down a de­ <lb/>
            finition by defining that existences are nothing else but power.</p>
          <p>Theæ. But since they cannot at present say any thing better <lb/>
            than this, they receive it.</p>
          <p>Guest. It is well; for perhaps hereafter both to us and them <lb/>
            something different will appear. Let this then here remain <lb/>
            acknowledged by us on their account.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It shall remain.</p>
          <p>[70.] Guest. Let us now proceed to the others, the friends <lb/>
            of forms. And do you interpret to us what is said by them.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It shall be so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Do you then say that generation is one thing,97 and <lb/>
            existence another, separating them in some way ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. We do.</p>
          <p>Guest. And that by body we communicate with generation, <lb/>
            through sensation, but through reason by our soul with real <lb/>
            existence, which you say is found for ever under the same <lb/>
            circumstance in a similar manner, but that generation exists <lb/>
            differently at different times ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. We do.</p>
          <p>Guest. But, ye best of men, what shall we say you mean <lb/>
            by the communion between both ? Is it not that which we <lb/>
            just now mentioned?</p>
          <p>Theæ. What was that ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Passion or action arising from a certain power, <lb/>
            from the concurrence of things with each other. Perhaps, <lb/>
            Theætetus, you have not heard their answer to this question; <lb/>
            but I have, through my familiarity with them.</p>
          <p>Theæ. What answer then do they give ?</p>
          <p>[71.] Guest. They do not admit with us, what was just <lb/>
            now said against the earth-born 98 respecting existence.</p>
          <p>Theæ. What was that ?</p>
          <p>Guest. We laid down as a sufficient definition of existence, <lb/>
            (that it is) when the power is present to any thing, either of <lb/>
            suffering or doing in the smallest point. <note type="footnote"> 97 Ficinus has, “ Aliud essentiam, aliud generationem dicitis." He <lb/>

          <p>Theæ. Do they then not speak to the purpose ?</p>
          <p>Guest. To this we must say that we require to hear from <lb/>
            them still more clearly, whether they acknowledge that the <lb/>
            soul knows, and that existence is known.</p>
          <p>Theæ. They certainly say this.</p>
          <p>Guest. But do you say that to know, or to be krown, is <lb/>
            action, or passion, or both ? Or that passion is one thing, and <lb/>
            (action) 99 another? Or that neither of these has a share in <lb/>
            any respect with the other?</p>
          <p>Theæ. It is evident that neither (has a share) with the <lb/>
            other. For, (if they admitted this,)100 they would contradict <lb/>
            what they before asserted.</p>
          <p>Guest. I understand this at least, that if to know were to <lb/>
            do something, it would necessarily happen that what is <lb/>
            known would become passive. And according to this reason­ <lb/>
            ing, existence being known by knowledge, would, as far as it <lb/>
            is known, be, through becoming passive, moved; which we <lb/>
            say cannot take place about the act of resting.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Rightly so.</p>
          <p>[72.] Guest. What then, by Zeus, shall we be easily per­ <lb/>
            suaded that motion, life, soul, and prudence, are not truly <lb/>
            present to that which is existing in perfection, and that it <lb/>
            neither lives, nor thinks, but stands immovable, not possess­ <lb/>
            ing an intellect as an object of respect and holy?</p>
          <p>Theæ. It would be a dreadful thing, 0 guest, to admit this.</p>
          <p>Guest. Shall we say then that it possesses intellect, but <lb/>
            not life ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. And how ?</p>
          <p>Guest. But say we that both these reside in it, but shall <lb/>
            we say that it does not possess these in soul at least ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. But after what other manner can it possess ? <note type="footnote"> 99 Taylor found in his copy of Ficinus, as Fischer did in his, “aut <lb/>

          <p>Guest. That it (possesses) 1 then at least intellect, life, and <lb/>
            soul; but that, though animated, it abides perfectly im­ <lb/>
            movable ?</p>
          <p>Thece. All this appears to me at least to be irrational.</p>
          <p>Guest. We must therefore grant that both the moved and <lb/>
            motion are existences.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. How not?</p>
          <p>Guest. It follows then, Theætetus, that intellect is never on <lb/>
            any account in any way present to any one of things immovable.</p>
          <p>[73.] Theæ. It (follows) easily.</p>
          <p>Guest. And yet, if we grant that all things are borne along <lb/>
            and moved, we shall by such an assertion take away this <lb/>
            sameness from existences.</p>
          <p>Theæ. How so ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Does it appear to you that what exists according to <lb/>
            the same, and in a similar manner, and about the same, can <lb/>
            ever exist without a standing ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. By no means.</p>
          <p>Guest. But do you perceive that intellect ever is or would <lb/>
            be without these ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Least (of all).</p>
          <p>Guest. And truly we should contend with every argu­ <lb/>
            ment against him, who, causing science, or prudence, or intel­ <lb/>
            lect to disappear, strenuously insists in behalf of any thing <lb/>
            in any way whatever.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. And very much so.</p>
          <p>Guest. But there is every necessity, as it appears, for the <lb/>
            philosopher, and him who honours these things the most on <lb/>
            this account, not to listen at all to those, who, asserting that <lb/>
            there is either one or many forms, admit that the whole <lb/>
            stands still; nor on the other hand, to those who are putting <lb/>
            existence into motion by every means; but to say, according <lb/>
            to the prayer of boys, 2whatever are immovable, and have <lb/>
            been moved, are both the being and the all.2 <note type="footnote"> 1 Heindorf says that, " although <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔχειν</foreign> might have dropt out easily <lb/>

          <p>[74.] Guest. Do we not then appear to have now reason­ <lb/>
            ably in our discourse comprehended existence ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Ho ! ho! Theætetus, how do we now seem about <lb/>
            to know the difficulty of the inquiry about it.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. How so ? and why do you assert this ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Do you not perceive, 0 blessed man, that we are <lb/>
            at present in the greatest ignorance respecting it ? And yet we. <lb/>
            appear to ourselves to say something about it.</p>
          <p>Theæ. To myself at least. But I do not very well under­ <lb/>
            stand how we are unconsciously in this state.</p>
          <p>Guest. Consider more clearly, whether, by assenting to <lb/>
            this, we should not be justly asked, as we have asked them, <lb/>
            who said that the whole consisted of the hot and the cold.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Remind me what these questions were.</p>
          <p>Guest. By all means: and I will endeavour to do this by <lb/>
            asking you this, as I then asked them, that we may make <lb/>
            some progress together.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Rightly so.</p>
          <p>[75.] Guest. Be it so. Do you not say then, that motion <lb/>
            and standing are contrary to each other ?</p>
          <p>Thecæ. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. And you surely say that both and each of them <lb/>
            exist equally.</p>
          <p>Theæ. I do.</p>
          <p>Guest. Do you then say that both and each are moved, <lb/>
            when you admit that they exist ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. By no means.</p>
          <p>Guest. But do you mean that they stand, when you say <lb/>
            that both exist?</p>
          <p>Thecæ. How can I? <note type="footnote"> that case the past participle <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεκινημένα</foreign> would not have been used instead of <lb/>
            the present participle, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κινούμενα</foreign>. The allusion I suspect is to a top or tee­ <lb/>
            totum, which the faster it is made to revolve on its axis, the more it seems <lb/>
            to stand still, or, as boys say, to sleep; and thus gives the best idea of the <lb/>
            universe being in motion and standing still at one and the same time. <lb/>
            Hence Plato perhaps wrote <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατὰ τἠν τω̃ν</foreign> 7rEpi <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίνων τἐχνην, οὶ̃ς ἀκίνητα</foreign> <lb/>
            TO. <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ κεκινημένα, τὸ ἓν τε καὶ</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">πα̃ν δίνην ξυναμφότερα λέγειν</foreign>: where <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίνην</foreign> still lies hid in <foreign xml:lang="grc">η̑̆δη</foreign>, found in a single MS. The sense would then <lb/>
            be, " To call both the one and the whole a whirl, according to the skill <lb/>
            of those engaged in playing with tops, by whom even things which have <lb/>
            been put into motion become unmoved." </note> <pb n="156"/>
            </p>
          <p>Guest. Placing then existence, as a third thing, alongside <lb/>
            these in your soul, and considering it as comprehending under <lb/>
            itself standing and motion, and looking to their communion <lb/>
            with existence, you have asserted that both of them exist.</p>
          <p>Theæ. We seem nearly to prophesy very truly that exist­ <lb/>
            ence is a certain third thing, when we say that motion and <lb/>
            standing exist.</p>
          <p>Guest. Existence then is not both motion and standing, <lb/>
            but something different from them.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Hence existence, according to its own nature, <lb/>
            neither stands nor is moved.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It is nearly so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Whither then ought he to turn his thoughts, who <lb/>
            wishes to fix in himself any clear conceptions respecting ex­ <lb/>
            istence ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Whither?</p>
          <p>Guest. To no point do I think it is yet easy for him (to <lb/>
            turn). For, if existence is not moved, why has it not stood <lb/>
            still ? Or on the other hand, why is that, which in no <lb/>
            respect stands still, not moved? But existence has just now <lb/>
            appeared to us to be apart from both of these. Is this, how­ <lb/>
            ever, possible ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. It is the most impossible of all things.</p>
          <p>[76.] Guest. In the next place, then, it will be just to call <lb/>
            to mind this.</p>
          <p>Theæ. What?</p>
          <p>Guest. That being asked what name non-entity ought to <lb/>
            bear, we were hampered by the greatest difficulty. Do you <lb/>
            remember ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Are we then in a less difficulty now respecting entity ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. We appear to be, 0 guest, if it be impossible to <lb/>
            say so, in a greater.</p>
          <p>Guest. Let then this question of difficulty lie here. But <lb/>
            since both entity and non-entity have equally a share of diffi­ <lb/>
            culty, there is now a hope that, if one of them shall appear <lb/>
            more obscure, or more clear, the other will appear such <lb/>
            likewise; and on the other hand, if we should not be able to <lb/>
            see either of them, (the other also will be in a similar state.)3 <note type="footnote"> 3 This clause, evidently required to balance the sentences, is omitted </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="157"/>
            And thus we shall pursue,4 in the most becoming manner we <lb/>
            can, the discourse respecting both of them together.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Very well.</p>
          <p>[77.] Guest. Let us state then after what manner we call <lb/>
            on each occasion this same thing by many names.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Such as what ? Give an example.</p>
          <p>Guest. In speaking of man we give him various appella­ <lb/>
            tions, and attribute to him colour, figure, magnitude, vices, <lb/>
            and virtues; in all which, and ten thousand other particulars, <lb/>
            we not only say that he is a man, but that he is good, and an <lb/>
            infinity of other things: and in the same manner we lay down <lb/>
            other things, each as one, and we again call it many things, <lb/>
            and by many names.</p>
          <p>Theæ. True.</p>
          <p>Guest. Whence, I think, we have prepared a feast to young <lb/>
            men, and to those old men who learn late in life.5 For it is <lb/>
            easy for every one immediately to lay hold (of the doctrine), <lb/>
            that it is impossible for the many to be one, and the one many. <lb/>
            Hence they exult forsooth, not suffering us to say that a man is <lb/>
            good, but that the good is a good, and the man a man. For I <lb/>
            think, Theætetus, you have often met with those, who serious­ <lb/>
            ly apply themselves to things of this kind, (and) sometimes <lb/>
            (even)6 with rather elderly persons, who, through the poverty <lb/>
            of their possessions with respect to wisdom, admire such <lb/>
            things as these, and think they have discovered the very-wise <lb/>
            thing itself.</p>
          <p>[78.] Theæ. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. That our discourse then may extend to all who <lb/>
            have ever conversed at all respecting existence, let what will <lb/>
            be now said in the way of interrogation, be for those and for <lb/>
            the rest with whom we have before conversed.</p>
          <p>Theæ. What is this?</p>
          <p>Guest. Whether we should neither join existence to motion <note type="footnote"> in all the Greek MSS., and preserved only in the version of Ficinus— <lb/>
            " alterum quoque similiter fore." </note><note type="footnote"> 4 All the MSS. have <foreign xml:lang="grc">διωσόμεθα</foreign>, contrary to the sense. Heind. suggested <lb/>

            things were unmixed, and impossible to take a part with <lb/>
            each other, we should place them thus (separate) in our dis­ <lb/>
            course ? Or whether we should bring all things to the same, <lb/>
            as if they were able to take a part with each other ? Or <lb/>
            (only) some, and some not? Which of these, Theætetus, <lb/>
            shall we say they would prefer ?</p>
          <p>Thece. I indeed have nothing to answer to this on their <lb/>
            behalf. Why do you not, by answering each question, con­ <lb/>
            sider what follows from each ?</p>
          <p>[79.] Guest. You say well; and let us suppose them, if <lb/>
            you please, to say, in the first place, that nothing has any <lb/>
            power of communion with any thing for any thing. Will <lb/>
            not then motion and standing in no respect take a part of ex­ <lb/>
            istence ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. They will not.</p>
          <p>Guest. But will either of them exist, not having a com­ <lb/>
            munion with existence ?</p>
          <p>Thece. It will not.</p>
          <p>Guest. By this admission, all the doctrines, it seems, have <lb/>
            become rapidly subverted, as well of those, who put all things <lb/>
            in motion, as of those, who make (all things) stand like one, <lb/>
            and of those, who assert that entities, according to forms, <lb/>
            subsist ever under the same circumstances and in a similar <lb/>
            manner. For all these join existence at least (with their <lb/>
            doctrines), some asserting that things are really moved, and <lb/>
            others that they really stand.</p>
          <p>Thece. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Moreover, such as at one time unite all things, and <lb/>
            at another separate them, whether 7 dividing them into one and <lb/>
            from one into infinite, or into finite elements, and composing <lb/>
            from these,7 and whether they consider this as partially, <lb/>
            or as always taking place,-in all these cases they will say <lb/>
            nothing to the purpose, if there is in no respect a commin­ <lb/>
            gling.</p>
          <p>[80.] Thece. Right.</p>
          <p>Guest. Further still, they will have gone through their dis­ <lb/>

            thing to the communion of the accident of " different," (have <lb/>
            thought proper) to use the appellation, " the other." 8</p>
          <p>Theæ. How so ?</p>
          <p>Guest. They are compelled somehow to employ about all <lb/>
            things, "to be," and "apart," and "others," and by itself," <lb/>
            and ten thousand other (expressions), from which being unable <lb/>
            to abstain, and9 not to insert them in their discourses, they do <lb/>
            not require others to confute them, but walk about, having, <lb/>
            as the saying is, an enemy and an adversary at home, vocifer­ <lb/>
            ating within, and always carrying, as it were, the absurd <lb/>
            Eurycles 10 with them.</p>
          <p>Theæ. You really say what is similar and true.11</p>
          <p>Guest. But what if we permit all things to have the power <lb/>
            of alternate communion with each other ?</p>
          <p>12 Thecæ. This I myself am able to refute.</p>
          <p>Guest. How?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Because motion itself would entirely stand (still), <lb/>
            and on the other hand, standing itself would be moved, if <lb/>
            they were alternately mingled13 with each other.</p>
          <p>Theæ. But this indeed is impossible from the greatest <lb/>
            necessity, for motion to stand still, and standing to be moved.</p>
          <p>Theæ. How not ?</p>
          <p>12 Guest. The third thing therefore alone remains.</p>

          <p>Theæ. How not?</p>
          <p>Guest. Now it has been found that two cannot (be com­ <lb/>
            mingled).</p>
          <p>Theæ. Just so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Every one therefore who wishes to answer rightly, <lb/>
            will adopt that which remains of the three.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Very much so.</p>
          <p>Guest. But since some things are willing to do so, (be <lb/>
            mingled,) and others not, they will be affected nearly in the <lb/>
            same manner as letters. For some of these do not fit with <lb/>
            each other, but others do fit.</p>
          <p>Theæ. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. For vowels being pre-eminently the bond, as it <lb/>
            were, of the other (letters), it has come to pass, that without <lb/>
            some one of them, it is impossible for any of the rest to fit <lb/>
            one with the other.</p>
          <p>Theæ. And very much so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Does then every one know what letters will unite <lb/>
            with what ? or is there a need of art to him, who is about to <lb/>
            do this sufficiently ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Of art.</p>
          <p>Guest. What kind of art ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. The grammatic.</p>
          <p>[82.] Guest. What then, with respect to sharp and flat <lb/>
            sounds, is not he, who has the art to know the sounds that are <lb/>
            combined or not, a musician, but he who does not know, not <lb/>
            a musician ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. It is so.</p>
          <p>Guest. And in other things of skill, and want of skill, we <lb/>
            shall find other circumstances of such a kind.</p>
          <p>Theæ. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Since then we have acknowledged, that the genera <lb/>
            (of things) have a mingling with each other, after the same <lb/>
            manner, is it not necessary for him to proceed in his discourse <lb/>
            with some science, who is about to show what kind of genera <lb/>
            accord with what kind, and what do not receive each other ? <lb/>
            Likewise, whether these genera so hold together through all <lb/>
            things as to be capable of being mutually mingled ? And again <lb/>
             <pb n="161"/>
            in their divisions, whether there are other causes of division <lb/>
            through wholes ?</p>
          <p>Thecæ. How is there not a need of science, and, perhaps, of <lb/>
            nearly the greatest ?</p>
          <p>Guest. What then, Theætetus, shall we call this science ? <lb/>
            Or, by Jupiter, have we ignorantly fallen upon the science of <lb/>
            freemen ? And do we nearly appear, while searching after a <lb/>
            sophist, to have found previously a philosopher ?</p>
          <p>[83.] Thecæ. How say you ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Shall we not say, that to divide according to genera, <lb/>
            and neither to think the same species different, nor a different <lb/>
            species the same, is the business of the dialectic science ?</p>
          <p>Thecæ. Yes, we will say so.</p>
          <p>Guest. He then who is able to do this, perceives sufficiently <lb/>
            one idea every way extended through many things, of which <lb/>
            each one lies apart, and many different from one another, ex­ <lb/>
            ternally comprehended under one; and on the other hand, one <lb/>
            idea through many wholes conjoined in one, and. many ideas, <lb/>
            every way separated (from each other). This is to know how <lb/>
            to distinguish according to genus, in what point each can <lb/>
            have a communion, and where they cannot.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. But you will not, I think, assign the dialectic art to <lb/>
            any other than one, who philosophizes purely and justly.</p>
          <p>[84.] Theæ. For how should any one assign it to any <lb/>
            other ?</p>
          <p>Guest. If we seek indeed, we shall find, both now and here­ <lb/>
            after, a philosopher in a place of this kind, though difficult to <lb/>
            see him clearly ; but the difficulty in the.case of a sophist and <lb/>
            that of a philosopher is of a different kind.</p>
          <p>Thece. How so ?</p>
          <p>Guest. The one flying into the darkness of non-entity, and <lb/>
            by rubbing touching it,12 is through the obscurity of the place <lb/>
            hard to be perceived. Is it not so ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. So it seems. <note type="footnote"> 12 This is the literal translation of the nonsensical <foreign xml:lang="grc">τριβη̃ προσαπ­ <lb/>
            τόμεος αὐτη̃ς</foreign>, with which some will perhaps compare Milton's " dark­ <lb/>
            ness palpable," derived from the Scriptural-“ a darkness that could be <lb/>
            felt." But such an idea is not what the train of thought requires. <lb/>
            Ficinus has " et diuturna consuetudine tenebris illis offunditur," which <lb/>
            Taylor translated " and by use becoming adapted to it." </note> <note type="footnote"> M </note> <pb n="162"/>
            </p>
          <p>Guest. But the philosopher, always lying, through reasoning, <lb/>
            near the idea of entity, is, through the splendour of the region, <lb/>
            by no means easily discerned. For the eyes of the soul of the <lb/>
            many are unable to endure the looking upon what is divine.</p>
          <p>Theæ. And this too it is likely is the case, no less than <lb/>
            that.</p>
          <p>Guest. On this point, therefore, we shall shortly reflect <lb/>
            more clearly, if it be permitted to us wishing it. But with <lb/>
            respect to the sophist, it is evident that we must not dismiss <lb/>
            him, before we have sufficiently surveyed him.</p>
          <p>Theo. You speak well.</p>
          <p>[85.] Guest. Since then it is acknowledged by us, that some <lb/>
            genera have a communion with each other, and some have not, <lb/>
            and that nothing prevents some from having a communion <lb/>
            with a few, others with many, and others through all and <lb/>
            with all,-let us, in the next place, follow the reasoning, and <lb/>
            in this way speculate, not about all species, lest we be con­ <lb/>
            founded by their multitude,-but, selecting some of those called <lb/>
            the greatest, let us first consider the qualities of each, and then <lb/>
            what power of communion they possess with each other, in <lb/>
            order that, although we may not be able to comprehend entity <lb/>
            and non-entity with all clearness, we may at least not want <lb/>
            for reasons respecting them, as far as the manner of the pre­ <lb/>
            sent speculation admits, if perchance it be permitted us, when <lb/>
            we assert that non-entity is in reality a non-entity, to escape <lb/>
            unscathed.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. So must we do.</p>
          <p>[86.] Guest. Now the greatest of all the genera, which we <lb/>
            have now mentioned, are, entity itself, standing, and motion.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Very much so.</p>
          <p>Guest. And we have said that the two (latter) are unmixed <lb/>
            with each other.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Very much so.</p>
          <p>Guest. But entity is mixed with both; for both do some­ <lb/>
            how exist.</p>
          <p>Theæ. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. These things then become three.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Guest. Is not then each of these different from the other <lb/>
            two, but the same with itself?</p>
          <p>Theæ. It is.</p><pb n="163"/>
            
          <p>. Guest. What then have we now said of sameness and <lb/>
            difference? (Must we say that), as there are two genera <lb/>
            different from the other three, but yet always mingled with <lb/>
            them from necessity, we have to consider about five, and not <lb/>
            three genera only ? Or have we unconsciously denominated <lb/>
            the same and the different, as something belonging to them ?13</p>
          <p>[87.] Theæ. Perhaps so.</p>
          <p>Guest. But surely motion and standing are neither the <lb/>
            different nor the same ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. How so ?</p>
          <p>Guest. That which we in common call motion and stand­ <lb/>
            ing can be neither of these.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Why?</p>
          <p>Guest. Because motion would be standing, and standing <lb/>
            be motion. For, with respect to both, either one becoming <lb/>
            the other, would compel that other to change into the con­ <lb/>
            trary to its nature, as participating in the contrary.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Very much so.</p>
          <p>Guest. But yet both participate of the same and the <lb/>
            different.</p>
          <p>Theæ. They do.</p>
          <p>Guest. Let us then not assert that motion is either the <lb/>
            same or the different, nor on the other hand (assert this), of <lb/>
            standing.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Let us not.</p>
          <p>Guest. But must entity and the same be considered by us <lb/>
            as one?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Perhaps so.</p>
          <p>Guest. But if entity and the same signify that which is in <lb/>
            no respect different, when we again say that motion and <lb/>
            standing both exist, we shall thus assert that they are the <lb/>
            same, as things existing.</p>
          <p>Theæ. But this is surely impossible.</p>
          <p>Guest. It is impossible then for the same and entity to <lb/>
            be one.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Nearly so. <note type="footnote"> 13 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκείνων τι</foreign>, Ast has happily restored <foreign xml:lang="grc">ε̃ ἐκείνων τι</foreign>, " some­ <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Guest. We must place then the same as a fourth species, <lb/>
            in addition to the former three.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Entirely so. <lb/>
            [8</p>
          <p>8.] Guest. But must we say that the different is a fifth species ? Or must we conceive that this and entity are some <lb/>
            two names belonging to one genus ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Perhaps so.</p>
          <p>Guest. But I think you will grant, that of existences, <lb/>
            some always subsist themselves by themselves, but others in <lb/>
            relation to each other.14</p>
          <p>Theæ. Why not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. But the different is always referred to the differ­ <lb/>
            ent. Is it not ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. It is.</p>
          <p>Guest. But this would not be, unless entity and the differ­ <lb/>
            ent widely differed from each other. But if the different <lb/>
            participated of both species, as entity does, there would be <lb/>
            something even of the different not different with reference <lb/>
            to the different. But now it happens from necessity that, <lb/>
            whatever is really different, is so from its relation to that <lb/>
            which is different. IS</p>
          <p>Theæ. You say, as the fact is.</p>
          <p>Guest. We must say then, that the nature of the different <lb/>
            must be added as a fifth to the species, of which we have al­ <lb/>
            ready spoken.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Guest. And we will say that it pervades through all these. <lb/>
            For each one is different from the others, not through its own <lb/>
            nature, but through participating in the idea of the different.</p>
          <p>Theæ. And very much so.</p>
          <p>[89.] Guest. Let us say thus of the five genera, taking <lb/>
            each singly.</p>
          <p>Theæ. How? <note type="footnote"> 14 The antithesis in " themselves by themselves," requires here <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Guest. In the first place, that motion is entirely different <lb/>
            from standing. Or how shall we say ?</p>
          <p>Thes. Thus.</p>
          <p>Guest. It is not then standing.</p>
          <p>Theæ. By no means.</p>
          <p>Guest. But it exists through its participating in entity.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It does.</p>
          <p>Guest. Again, motion is different from the same.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Nearly so.</p>
          <p>Guest. It is not therefore the same.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It is not.</p>
          <p>Guest. And yet it was the same, through its participating <lb/>
            on the other hand in the same.16</p>
          <p>Theæ. And very much so.</p>
          <p>Guest. It must be confessed then that motion is both the <lb/>
            same and not the same ; nor must we be indignant at this. <lb/>
            For, when we say that it is both the same, and not the same, <lb/>
            we do not speak of it in a similar manner; but when (we <lb/>
            say) 17 it is the same, we call it so, through the participation of <lb/>
            the same with respect to itself; but when (we say) it is not <lb/>
            the same, (we call it so) through its communion with the <lb/>
            different; through which, being separated from the same, it <lb/>
            becomes not the same, but the different; so that it is again <lb/>
            rightly said to be not the same.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. If, then, motion itself18 has in any respect par­ <lb/>
            ticipated in standing, there would be no absurdity in calling <lb/>
            it stable.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Most truly, if we should acknowledge that some of <lb/>
            the genera are willing to be mixed with each other, but <lb/>
            others not.</p>
          <p>Guest. And yet we arrived at the proof of this prior to the <lb/>
            present (remarks), by showing that it exists in this manner <lb/>
            naturally. <note type="footnote"> 16 I have adopted with Stephens the correction of Cornarius, who <lb/>

          <p>Theæ. How not ? <lb/>
            [9</p>
          <p>0.] Guest. Let us then say again (that) motion is a thing different from the different, just as it was from the <lb/>
            same and standing.</p>
          <p>Thece. It must be so.</p>
          <p>Guest. It is then, in a certain respect, not different and <lb/>
            different, according to the present reasoning.</p>
          <p>Thece. True.</p>
          <p>Guest. What then follows ? Shall we say it is different <lb/>
            from the three (genera), but not from the fourth ? acknow­ <lb/>
            ledging that there are five, about which, and in which, we <lb/>
            propose to speculate ?</p>
          <p>Thece. And how so ? for it is impossible to grant that the <lb/>
            number is less than it now appears.</p>
          <p>Guest. We may, therefore, fearlessly contend that motion <lb/>
            is different from entity.</p>
          <p>Theæ. We may most fearlessly.</p>
          <p>Guest. Clearly then motion is really a non-entity and an <lb/>
            entity, since it participates of entity.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Most clearly.</p>
          <p>Guest. It is then of necessity that non-entity exists with <lb/>
            respect to motion, and as regards all the genera. For as <lb/>
            regards all, the nature of the different, rendering them different <lb/>
            from entity, makes each to be a non-entity. Hence we rightly <lb/>
            say, that all of them are, as regards the same, non-entities; and <lb/>
            again, because they participate in entity, that they exist and <lb/>
            are entities.19</p>
          <p>Thece. It appears so.</p>
          <p>[91.] Guest. About each of the species then, the entity is <lb/>
            many, but the non-entity is in multitude endless.20</p>
          <p>Thece. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Must not then entity itself be said to be different <lb/>
            from the others ? <note type="footnote"> 19 If we wish to avoid the tautology in <foreign xml:lang="grc">ει̃ναί</foreign> rE <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ ο̑̆ντα</foreign>, we must <lb/>

            many may be varied infinitely, in this respect it is infinite." But as this <lb/>
            explanation takes no notice of the non-entity, it may fairly be considered <lb/>
            a non-entity itself. </note> <pb n="167"/>
            </p>
          <p>Theæ. Of necessity.</p>
          <p>Guest. 21 Entity then does not exist according to so many <lb/>
            in number as the others; for entity, being one itself, is <lb/>
            not them ; but the others, being infinite in number, are <lb/>
            not entity. 21</p>
          <p>Theæ. This is nearly the case.</p>
          <p>Guest. We ought not, then to be indignant at this, since <lb/>
            the nature of the genera have a communion with each other. <lb/>
            But if some one does not admit this, let him, having per­ <lb/>
            suaded 22 our former reasoning, in like manner persuade 22 the <lb/>
            subsequent assertions.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. You speak most justly.</p>
          <p>Guest. Let us look at this likewise.</p>
          <p>Theæ. What ?</p>
          <p>Guest. When we say non-entity, we do not, as it appears, <lb/>
            speak of any thing contrary to entity, but only as something <lb/>
            different from it.</p>
          <p>Theæ. How so ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Just as when. we say a thing is not great, do we <lb/>
            then appear to you to point out by this word what is small <lb/>
            rather than what is equal ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. How could you ?</p>
          <p>Guest. We must therefore admit that the contrary to a <lb/>
            thing is not signified, when negation is spoken of; but thus <lb/>
            much only, that the (prohibitive) " not," and the (negative) <lb/>
            " no," when prefixed, signify something relating to the words <lb/>
            that follow, or rather to the things, respecting which are <lb/>
            placed the words of the negation afterwards enunciated.23</p>
          <p>Thecæ. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>[92.] Guest. This also let us consider, if it seems good to <lb/>
            you. <note type="footnote"> 21—21 Such is the literal translation of the Greek; where, however, I <lb/>

            But of the first clause I confess my inability to understand the sense. <lb/>
            Taylor's version is-“ Being, therefore, is not so many in number as the <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Theæ. What is that ?</p>
          <p>Guest. The nature of the different appears to me to have <lb/>
            been cut into fractional parts, in the same manner as science.</p>
          <p>Theæ. How?</p>
          <p>Guest. The (nature) is one; but the portion of it that is <lb/>
            attached to any thing does, when separated, possess individu­ <lb/>
            ally its peculiar appellation; on which account arts and <lb/>
            sciences are said to be many.</p>
          <p>Them. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Have not then the parts of the nature of the different, <lb/>
            which is itself one thing, been affected in the very same way ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Perhaps so. But let us tell how this takes place.</p>
          <p>Guest. Is there any part of the different opposed to the <lb/>
            beautiful ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. There is.</p>
          <p>Guest. Shall we say it is nameless, or that it has some <lb/>
            appellation ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. That it has. For that which we call on each occa­ <lb/>
            sion not-beautiful, is not different from any thing else but <lb/>
            the nature of the beautiful.</p>
          <p>Guest. Come, then, tell me this.</p>
          <p>[93.] Theæ. What?</p>
          <p>Guest. When any thing is separated from some kind of ex­ <lb/>
            istences, and is again opposed to some kind of existences, does <lb/>
            it happen that thus it is not beautiful ?24</p>
          <p>Theæ. It does.</p>
          <p>Guest. But the opposition of entity to entity happens, as it <lb/>
            seems, to be not-beautiful.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Most right.</p>
          <p>Guest. What then, according to this reasoning does the <lb/>
            beautiful belong more to entities, and the non-beautiful, less ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Not at all. <note type="footnote"> 24 In the place of this mass of rubbish Ficinus has what is at least <lb/>
            intelligible in part; for his MS. was fuller than any, which have <lb/>
            been collated subsequently. "Cum aliquid in parte quadam entium <lb/>
            determinatum sit, rursusque alicui entium opponatur, contingatque ita <lb/>
            non pulchrum dici, sequitur non pulchrum esse aliquid, quandoquidem <lb/>
            est illud cui opponatur." There is however something evidently wanting <lb/>
            after " determinatum sit," to this effect, " id dici pulchrum debere, cui <lb/>
            nihil opponatur." So too there is wanting in Ficinus the close of this <lb/>
            speech of the Stranger and the whole of the next one, together with the <lb/>
            intermediate answer of Thesetetus. </note> <pb n="169"/>
            </p>
          <p>Guest. We must say then, that the not-great and the great <lb/>
            exist similarly.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Similarly.</p>
          <p>Guest. Hence too we must lay down respecting the just, in <lb/>
            the same manner as of the not-just, that the one in no respect <lb/>
            exists more than the other.</p>
          <p>Theæ. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. And we will speak of other things in this way ; <lb/>
            since the nature of the different appears to be one of entities; <lb/>
            and as it exists, it is necessary for us to lay down the parts of <lb/>
            it, as no less existing.</p>
          <p>Theæ. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. The opposition then, it seems, of a part of the na­ <lb/>
            ture of the different, and of entity25 opposed to each other,25 <lb/>
            are no less existence, if it be lawful to say so, than existence <lb/>
            itself; nor do they signify what is contrary to existence, but <lb/>
            only so much, what is different from it.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It is most clear.</p>
          <p>[94.] Guest. What then, shall we call it the (antithesis) ? <lb/>
            Theæ. It is evident that non-entity, which we have been <lb/>
            seeking on account of the sophist, is this very thing.</p>
          <p>Guest. Whether then, as you have said, is it no more de­ <lb/>
            ficient of existence than the others ? And ought we now <lb/>
            boldly to say, that non-entity possesses its own nature firmly, <lb/>
            in the same manner as the great was found to be great, and <lb/>
            the beautiful beautiful, and the not-great to be (not-great),26 <lb/>
            and the not-beautiful (not-beautiful) ?26 and that thus too non­ <lb/>
            entity was and is non-entity, as being one species numbered <lb/>
            amongst the many existing ? Or must we still, Theætetus, <lb/>
            have with regard to this some want of faith ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. None at all.</p>
          <p>Guest. Do you perceive then, how we have been with some <lb/>
            prolixity disobedient to the prohibition of Parmenides ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. In what respect ?</p>
          <p>Guest. We have farther than he ordained 27 us to inquire, <lb/>
            exhibited ourselves, still exploring onwards. <note type="footnote"> 25-25 The words " opposed to each other " are omitted by Ficinus cor­ <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Them. How?</p>
          <p>Guest. Because he says somewhere,—“ Non-beings never, <lb/>
            and by no means are. And from this path thy searching <lb/>
            thought restrain."</p>
          <p>. Thece. And so he does say.</p>
          <p>Guest. But we have not only shown that non-entities exist, <lb/>
            but we have demonstrated what kind of thing a non-entity is. <lb/>
            For, having proved that the nature of the different has an ex­ <lb/>
            istence, and that it is cut up into fractions, (distributed) <lb/>
            mutually through all things, we then dared to say, that each <lb/>
            part of it, which is opposed to entity, is itself truly a non­ <lb/>
            entity.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. And to me, 0 guest, we appear to have spoken <lb/>
            with the greatest truth.</p>
          <p>[95.] Guest. Let no one then say, that we, having proved <lb/>
            that non-entity is contrary to entity, dare to assert that it <lb/>
            exists. For we some time since did to something, contrary to <lb/>
            it, bid a farewell, whether it exists or not, and possesses a <lb/>
            certain reason, or is entirely irrational. But, with respect to <lb/>
            that which we now call non-entity, either let some one per­ <lb/>
            suade (us) by showing that we speak not well; or, as long as <lb/>
            he is unable (to do this), he must also say, as we say, that the <lb/>
            genera are mixed with each other, and that entity and the <lb/>
            different pervading through all things, and through each <lb/>
            other, the different, partaking of entity, does through this <lb/>
            participation exist, not being that of which it participates, but <lb/>
            something else; and being different from entity, it clearly <lb/>
            follows that it is necessarily non-entity. And on the other <lb/>
            hand entity, having partaken of the different, will be different <lb/>
            from the other genera; but being different from all of them, <lb/>
            it is not any one of them, nor all the others, nor any thing <lb/>
            besides itself. So that incontestably entity is not ten thou­ <lb/>
            sand things in ten thousand things: and thus the rest taken <lb/>
            singly and together exist in many forms, but do not exist in <lb/>
            many forms.28</p>
          <p>[96.] Thecæ. True. <note type="footnote"> statuerit," which Taylor translated " beyond the limits he appointed," <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Guest. Now if any one either does not believe in these <lb/>
            contrarieties, let him reflect and produce something better <lb/>
            than has been stated now;29 or if, perceiving this to be a <lb/>
            difficult speculation, he is pleased at drawing out his argu­ <lb/>
            ments now on this side and now on that, he is engaged, as our <lb/>
            present reasoning shows, in a pursuit not deserving very <lb/>
            serious attention. For this is neither a clever thing nor <lb/>
            difficult to discover; but that is at one and the same time <lb/>
            difficult and honourable.30</p>
          <p>Thecæ. What?</p>
          <p>Guest. That which has been stated before ; so that, omit­ <lb/>
            ting these as possible, we may be able, by following up what <lb/>
            has been said, each by itself, to confute a person, when he says <lb/>
            that what is different is same, and what is the same different, <lb/>
            31 in the way and according to the circumstance by which <lb/>
            he says either is affected.31 For, to show that the same is <lb/>
            different, and the different same, and the great small, and the <lb/>
            similar dissimilar, and to be pleased in thus introducing con­ <lb/>
            trarieties in discourse, is not a true confutation, but one <lb/>
            evidently newly born of some one, who has recently laid hold <lb/>
            of entities.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. Very much so.</p>
          <p>[97.] Guest. For, my good (friend), to endeavour to <lb/>
            separate every thing from every thing, is inelegant in other <lb/>
            respects, and the part too of one untaught and unphilosophical.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Why so ?</p>
          <p>Guest. To loosen each thing from all things, is the most <lb/>
            perfect abolition of all discourse. For discourse subsists <lb/>
            through the conjunction of species with each other.</p>
          <p>TheE. True.</p>
          <p>Guest. Consider then, how opportunely we have now con­ <lb/>
            tended with men of this kind, and compelled them to permit <lb/>
            one thing to be mixed with another.</p>
          <p>Theæ. With a view to what ?</p>
          <p>Guest. To this, that discourse may be one certain thing <note type="footnote"> 29 Compare Horace, " si quid novisti rectius istis, Candidus imperti; <lb/>
            si non, his utere mecum." </note><note type="footnote"> 30 Here is an allusion to the saying, " Difficult things are honourable." <lb/>
            See Hipp. Maj. § 56. </note><note type="footnote"> 31—31 The whole of this passage Taylor tacitly omitted, at the sugges­ <lb/>
            tion of Cornarius, who considered it an interpolation. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="172"/>
            belonging to the genera of existences. For, if we are de­ <lb/>
            prived of this, we shall, for the most part, be deprived of <lb/>
            philosophy. And further still, it is requisite at present that <lb/>
            we agree about discourse what it is. But if we take it away <lb/>
            entirely from us, so as not to exist at all, we can no longer <lb/>
            speak about any thing. And we should take it away, if we <lb/>
            admit that there is no mixing of any thing for any thing.</p>
          <p>[98.] Theæ. This is (said) quite rightly. But I do not <lb/>
            understand why we should agree about discourse.</p>
          <p>Guest. But, perhaps, you will most easily understand by <lb/>
            following me in this way.</p>
          <p>Theæ. In what way ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Non-entity has appeared to us to be one of the rest <lb/>
            of genera, and to be dispersed through all existences.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It has so.</p>
          <p>Guest. After this, therefore, we must consider whether it <lb/>
            is mixed with opinion and discourse.</p>
          <p>Theæ. On what account ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Because, if it is not mixed with these, it must <lb/>
            necessarily follow that all things are true; but, if it is mixed <lb/>
            with these, false opinion and (false)32 discourse is produced. <lb/>
            For to fancy or speak of non-entities, is a falsehood existing <lb/>
            in the mind and in discourse.</p>
          <p>TheB. It is so.</p>
          <p>Guest. But, being falsehood, it is deception.</p>
          <p>TheB. It is.</p>
          <p>Guest. And deception existing, all things must necessarily <lb/>
            be full of resemblances, images, and fancies.</p>
          <p>Theæ. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. But we have said that the sophist flew to (and <lb/>
            stayed) in this place, while he denies that there is any such <lb/>
            thing as falsehood ; for (he says) that no one can either think <lb/>
            or speak of a non-entity ; because it in no respect partakes of <lb/>
            existence.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It was (so) said.</p>
          <p>[99.] Guest. But now it has appeared to partake of entity; <lb/>
            so that in this respect perhaps he will no longer oppose us. <lb/>
            Perhaps, however, he will say, that of species some partake of <lb/>
            non-entity, and others not; and that discourse and opinion <note type="footnote"> 32 This idea, wanting in the Greek, has been preserved in the " oratio­ <lb/>
            que falsa " of Ficinus alone. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="173"/>
            are amongst those things that do not partake of it. So that <lb/>
            he will again contend with us, that the image-making and <lb/>
            fancy-producing art, in which we have said he is concealed, <lb/>
            exists not at all; since opinion and discourse have no com­ <lb/>
            munion with non-entity ; for that falsehood does not exist at all, <lb/>
            if this communion of things takes place no where. Hence we <lb/>
            must search out discourse, opinion, and fancy, what they are, <lb/>
            in order that we may perceive after their appearance their <lb/>
            communion with non-entity; and having perceived this, we <lb/>
            may prove that falsehood exists ; and having proved this, we <lb/>
            may put the sophist into bonds, if he is guilty ; or, setting him <lb/>
            free, search for him in some other genus.</p>
          <p>[100.] Theæ. What was said, 0 guest, at first about the <lb/>
            sophist, appears to be very true-that he is a genus difficult <lb/>
            to hunt out. For he appears to be full of fences ;33 of which <lb/>
            when he throws up one, it is necessary to take it by storm, <lb/>
            before you can reach him himself. And even now we have <lb/>
            scarcely passed over the obstacle he had raised, that a non­ <lb/>
            entity does not exist, when he immediately throws up <lb/>
            another. Hence it is requisite to show that falsehood does <lb/>
            exist, both in discourse and opinion; and after this perhaps <lb/>
            something else, and another thing after that; and, as it seems, <lb/>
            no end will e'er appear.34</p>
          <p>Guest. He, Theætetus, should be bold, who is able to pro­ <lb/>
            ceed, though only a little, continually onwards. For what <lb/>
            will he be able to do in other things who is faint-hearted <lb/>
            in these, and is either effecting nothing in these, or is <lb/>
            driven back again ? Such a person will scarcely, according to <lb/>
            the proverb, ever take a city. But now, 0 good man, since <lb/>
            this, as you say, has been passed through, the greatest wall <lb/>
            will have been taken by us, and the rest will be more easy <lb/>
            and of small account.</p>
          <p>Theæ. You say well.</p>
          <p>Guest. Let us then now in the first place take up, as we <lb/>
            said, discourse and opinion, that we may more clearly cal- <note type="footnote"> 33 In the Greek word <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρ</foreign>ó<foreign xml:lang="grc">βλημα</foreign> there is a double sense ; one applica­ <lb/>

            culate,35 whether non-being touches upon these, or whether <lb/>
            both these are in every respect true, and neither of them at <lb/>
            any time false.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Right.</p>
          <p>Guest. Come then, let us again speculate about nouns, in <lb/>
            the same manner as we did about species and letters. For <lb/>
            the present inquiry appears36 somehow to lie in this road.</p>
          <p>Theæ. What then is to be heard forsooth about nouns ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Whether all of them fit together, or not; or some <lb/>
            are wont to do so, but others not.</p>
          <p>Theæ. This is evident, that some are wont and others not.</p>
          <p>Guest. Perhaps you mean some such thing as this; that <lb/>
            some being spoken in order and signifying something, do fit <lb/>
            together ; but that such as in continuity signify nothing, do <lb/>
            not fit together.</p>
          <p>[102.] Theæ. Why, and how say you this ?</p>
          <p>Guest. What. I thought you would understand and acknow­ <lb/>
            ledge. For there is a twofold kind of significations by the <lb/>
            voice respecting existence.</p>
          <p>Theæ. How ?</p>
          <p>Guest. One called nouns, and the other verbs.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Speak of each.</p>
          <p>Guest. That which has a signification in the case of <lb/>
            actions, is called a verb.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It is.</p>
          <p>Guest. But a sign of the voice, applied to the doers them­ <lb/>
            selves of those actions, we call a noun.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Guest. From nouns then alone, spoken in succession, there <lb/>
            is not a discourse; nor, on the other hand, from verbs spoken <lb/>
            without nouns.</p>
          <p>Theæ. I have not learned this.</p>
          <p>Guest. Yet it is plain that you just now acknowledged <lb/>
            " this, when looking to something else. For this very thing I <lb/>
            meant to say, that when these are spoken in succession, there <lb/>
            is not a discourse. <note type="footnote"> as Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπολογησώμεθα</foreign>, Heindorf conjectured <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπολογησώμεθα</foreign>. <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Theæ. How so ?</p>
          <p>Guest. As for instance, should any one say in succession <lb/>
            "walks," "run?," "sleeps," and such other words as signify <lb/>
            actions, he would not form a discourse at all.</p>
          <p>Theæ. For how could he ?</p>
          <p>[103.] Guest. Again then, when any one says, "lion," <lb/>
            "stag," "horse," and such other nouns, as are named after <lb/>
            those doing acts, no discourse is composed by such a con­ <lb/>
            tinuity. For the words spoken do not, 37 either in this way <lb/>
            or that,37 signify action, or non-action, or the existence of a <lb/>
            thing which is or is not, until one mixes verbs with nouns; <lb/>
            and then they fit (with each other), and a discourse is pro­ <lb/>
            duced immediately, and their first connexion is nearly the <lb/>
            first and shortest discourse.</p>
          <p>Theæ. How say you this ?</p>
          <p>Guest. When any one says, " Man learns," would you not <lb/>
            say that this is the shortest and first discourse ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. I should.</p>
          <p>Guest. For he then points out something respecting things <lb/>
            which exist, or are in the course of existing, or have been, or <lb/>
            will be; nor does he name a thing merely, but completes <lb/>
            something by connecting verbs with nouns. Hence we say <lb/>
            that he speaks, and does not merely name a thing ; and <lb/>
            through this connexion we pronounce the noun "discourse."</p>
          <p>[104.] Theæ. Right.</p>
          <p>Guest. Thus too in the case of things, some did fit with <lb/>
            each other, and others did not; so likewise with respect to <lb/>
            the signs of the voice, some do not fit, but others of them <lb/>
            by fitting produce discourse.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. There is still this trifling thing.</p>
          <p>Theæ. What?</p>
          <p>Guest. It is necessary for a discourse, when it takes place, <lb/>
            to be a discourse about something; for it is impossible to be <lb/>
            about nothing.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It must.</p>
          <p>Guest. Ought it not then to be of some particular kind ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Let us then pay attention to ourselves. <note type="footnote"> 37—37 These words are omitted by Ficinus. They are perfectly un­ <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Thea. For it is requisite.</p>
          <p>Guest. I will then pronounce you a discourse, having <lb/>
            united a thing with an action, through a noun and a verb ; <lb/>
            and do you tell me of what it is the discourse.</p>
          <p>Thea. This shall be as far as I am able.</p>
          <p>Guest. Theætetus sits.- This is not a long discourse.</p>
          <p>Theæ. No; a moderate one.</p>
          <p>Guest. It is now your business to say about whom is the <lb/>
            discourse, and whose it is.</p>
          <p>Thea. It is evident that it is about me and mine.38</p>
          <p>Guest. But what again is this ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. What?</p>
          <p>Guest. Theætetus, with whom I am now conversing, flies.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Respecting this also, no one can say but that it is <lb/>
            mine,33 and of me.</p>
          <p>[105.] Guest. But we said it was necessary that every <lb/>
            sentence should be of some particular kind.</p>
          <p>Thea. Yes.</p>
          <p>Guest. But of what kind must each of the sentences just <lb/>
            now mentioned be ?</p>
          <p>Thea. One must be false and the other true.</p>
          <p>Guest. But of them the one which is true asserts things <lb/>
            respecting you, as they are.</p>
          <p>Thea. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. But the one which is false (asserts) things respect­ <lb/>
            in- you, different from what they are.</p>
          <p>Thea. It does.</p>
          <p>Guest. It speaks then of things which are not, as if they were.</p>
          <p>Thea. Nearly so.</p>
          <p>Guest. And it speaks of things about you different from the <lb/>
            existing. For we said that about each thing there are many <lb/>
            things which exist, and many which do not. <note type="footnote"> 38—38 This is a remarkable instance of the carelessness of even the most <lb/>
            attentive editors. For not one has remarked that, as the Guest, and not <lb/>
            Theætetus, had pronounced the words " Theætetus sits," the discourse <lb/>
            belonged to the former, although it was about the latter. Plato must <lb/>
            therefore have written not <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμὸς</foreign> but o <foreign xml:lang="grc">σός</foreign> : while instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ οὗ</foreign> T' <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐστὶ καὶ ὅτου</foreign> we must read <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ οὗ</foreign> r' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐστὶ καὶ οὗ</foreign>—“about whom and <lb/>
            whose," as shown by the version of Ficinus, "de quo et cujus;” although <lb/>
            he shortly afterwards supports <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλὴν ἐμὸν</foreign> by his " nisi de me meaque <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Theæ. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Guest. The discourse then which I last spoke about you, <lb/>
            should, from what we have defined a discourse to be, of ne­ <lb/>
            cessity be, in the first place, one of the shortest.</p>
          <p>Theæ. This we have just now acknowledged.</p>
          <p>Guest. In the next place, it is a discourse of some one.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It is so.</p>
          <p>Guest. But if it is not yours, it is not of any one else.</p>
          <p>Theæ. For how should it ?</p>
          <p>Guest. And if it is not about some thing, it cannot be a dis­ <lb/>
            course at all. For we have shown that it is (one) of things <lb/>
            impossible, for a discourse to exist about nothing.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Most correctly.</p>
          <p>Guest. When therefore the different is asserted of you as <lb/>
            if it were the same, and things not existing as if existing, <lb/>
            such an arrangement of verbs and nouns altogether becomes, <lb/>
            as it appears, a really and truly false discourse.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Most true.</p>
          <p>[106.] Guest. But what, is it not now evident, that all <lb/>
            these genera, both false and true, such as thought, opinion, <lb/>
            and fancy, are produced in our souls ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. How ?</p>
          <p>Guest. You will more easily understand it thus, if you first <lb/>
            take,39 what each of them is, and in what they differ each <lb/>
            from the other.</p>
          <p>Thece. Only give.</p>
          <p>Guest. Are not' then thought and discourse the same, ex­ <lb/>
            cept that the former being within the soul a voiceless dialogue <lb/>
            with itself, is called by us by the name of thought ?40</p>
          <p>Theæ. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. But the stream of thought passing through the <lb/>
            mouth with a sound is called discourse.</p>
          <p>Theæ. True.</p>
          <p>Guest. We know of this too in discourse.</p>
          <p>Theæ. What?</p>
          <p>Guest. Affirmation and negation. <note type="footnote"> 39 The verb " take " is used in English as <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαμβάνειν</foreign> is in Greek, in <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Theæ. We do.</p>
          <p>Guest. When therefore this is generated in the soul accord­ <lb/>
            ing to thought, accompanied with silence, can you call it any <lb/>
            thing else than opinion ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. How can I ?</p>
          <p>Guest. But when, again, some circumstance of this kind is <lb/>
            present to any one, not according to itself,41 but through sens­ <lb/>
            ation, is it possible to call it correctly any thing else than fancy ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Nothing else.</p>
          <p>[107.] Guest. Since then discourse is both true and false, <lb/>
            and it appears that thought is a dialogue of the soul with it­ <lb/>
            self, but opinion the termination of thought, and what we <lb/>
            mean by " it appears " is the mixture of sensation and opinion, <lb/>
            it is necessary, that of these, being allied to discourse, some <lb/>
            should be false and sometimes.42</p>
          <p>Theæ. How not?</p>
          <p>Guest. Do you perceive then, that opinion and discourse <lb/>
            have been previously found to be false more easily, than <lb/>
            according to our expectation ? For 43 just now we were afraid, <lb/>
            lest by searching into this matter we should throw ourselves <lb/>
            upon a work perfectly impracticable.</p>
          <p>Theæ. I do perceive.</p>
          <p>Guest. Let us not then be faint-hearted as to what remains. <lb/>
            For since these have been made to appear, let us recall to our <lb/>
            memory the previous divisions according to species.</p>
          <p>Thece. Of what kind were they ?</p>
          <p>Guest. We divided image-making into two species; the <lb/>
            one assimilative, and the other fanciful.</p>
          <p>Theæ. We did.</p>
          <p>Guest. And we said we were dubious in which of these we <lb/>

          <p>Thes. It was so (said).</p>
          <p>Guest. And while we were doubting of this, a still greater <lb/>
            dizziness was shed around us, through the assertion appearing <lb/>
            a matter of doubt to all men, that there cannot be at all either <lb/>
            a resemblance, or an image, or fancy; because no falsehood <lb/>
            exists by any means at any time or in any place.</p>
          <p>Theæ. You speak the truth.</p>
          <p>[108.] Guest. But now since discourse has made its ap­ <lb/>
            pearance, and false opinion likewise, it is conceded that there <lb/>
            are imitations of things existing; and that from this disposi­ <lb/>
            tion of things the art of deceiving is produced.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It is agreed.</p>
          <p>Guest. And yet was it not also acknowledged by us above, <lb/>
            that the sophist is one of these ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. It was.</p>
          <p>Guest. Let us then again endeavour, by always bisecting <lb/>
            the proposed genus, to proceed along the right hand44 of the <lb/>
            section, and attend to its communion with the sophist, until, <lb/>
            having cut off all his common properties, we leave the nature <lb/>
            peculiar to himself, and exhibit it to ourselves especially, and <lb/>
            afterwards to those also, who are naturally the nearest of kin <lb/>
            to this method.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Right.</p>
          <p>[109.] Guest. Did we not then begin by dividing the <lb/>
            making art and the acquiring art ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>Guest. And the acquiring art presented itself to us in <lb/>
            hunting, contests, traffic, and in some such-like species.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. But now, since the imitative art comprehends the <lb/>
            sophist, it is evident that the making art must first receive a <lb/>
            twofold division. For imitation is a certain kind of making. <lb/>
            We said, indeed, it was the making of images, and not of each <lb/>
            themselves.45 Did we not ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Entirely so. <note type="footnote"> 44 This seems to have been a phrase in Greece, something like the one <lb/>

          <p>Guest. But, in the first place, let there be two parts of the <lb/>
            making art.</p>
          <p>Theæ. What are they ?</p>
          <p>Guest. One divine, the other human.</p>
          <p>Theæ. I do not understand you.</p>
          <p>Guest. The making art, if we remember what was said at' <lb/>
            first, we asserted to be every power, which might be the cause <lb/>
            of things being produced subsequently, that did not previously <lb/>
            exist.</p>
          <p>Theæ. We do remember.</p>
          <p>[110.] Guest. But, with respect to all living animals, and <lb/>
            plants, which are produced in the earth from seeds and roots, <lb/>
            together with such inanimate bodies as subsist on the earth, <lb/>
            able to be liquefied or not, can we say that not existing pre­ <lb/>
            viously they were subsequently produced by any other than <lb/>
            some fabricating god? Or making use of the opinion and <lb/>
            assertion of the many—46</p>
          <p>Theæ. What is that ?</p>
          <p>Guest. That nature generates these from some self-acting <lb/>
            fortuitous cause, and without a generating intellect; or (is <lb/>
            it) with reason and divine science, originating from a god ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. I, perhaps, through my age, am often changing my <lb/>
            opinions to both sides. But at present looking to you, and <lb/>
            apprehending that you think these things are produced accord­ <lb/>
            ing to (the will of) a deity, I think so too.</p>
          <p>Guest. It is well, Theætetus. And if we thought that you <lb/>
            would be one of those, who at a future time would think dif­ <lb/>
            ferently, we should now endeavour to make you acknowledge <lb/>
            this by the force of reason, in conjunction with the persuasion <lb/>
            of necessity. But since I know your nature to be such, that, <lb/>
            without any arguments from us, it will of itself arrive at that <lb/>
            conclusion to which you say you are now drawn, I will leave <lb/>
            the subject; for the time47 would be superfluous. But I will <note type="footnote"> 46 After <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρώμενοι</foreign> Fischer would supply <foreign xml:lang="grc">φήσομεν</foreign>. Heind. and Stalb. <lb/>

            lay this down, that the things, which are said to be made by <lb/>
            nature, are (made) by divine art; but that the things, which <lb/>
            are composed from these by men, are produced by human <lb/>
            (art): and that, according to this assertion, there are two <lb/>
            kinds of the making art, one human, and the other divine.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. Right.</p>
          <p>[111.] Guest. But, since there are two kinds, bisect each <lb/>
            of them.</p>
          <p>Theæ. How?</p>
          <p>Guest. Just as the whole of the making art was then <lb/>
            divided, according to breadth, so now divide it according to <lb/>
            length.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Let it be so divided.</p>
          <p>Guest. And thus all its parts will become four; two of <lb/>
            which, with reference to us, will be human ; and two again, <lb/>
            with reference to the gods, divine.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. They will.</p>
          <p>Guest. But with respect to these, as being again divided in <lb/>
            a different manner, one part of each division is self-making, <lb/>
            but the remaining parts may be nearly called image-making; <lb/>
            and in this way again, the making art is divided into two <lb/>
            parts.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Tell me again how each is (to be divided).</p>
          <p>Guest. With respect to ourselves and other animals, and <lb/>
            the things from which they naturally consist, fire and water, <lb/>
            and the sisters of these, we know that all these productions <lb/>
            are individually the offspring of a deity. Or how ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Thus.</p>
          <p>Guest. And that the images of each of these, and not the <lb/>
            things themselves, follow, and these too produced by the <lb/>
            artifice of some dæmon-like power.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Of what kind are these ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Fancies, which occur in dreams, and such as ap­ <lb/>
            pear in the day, are called self-produced; (as, for instance,) a <lb/>
            shadow, 48when darkness is generated in fire: 48 but this is <note type="footnote"> 48—48 This I cannot understand. Ficinus has, cum tenebræ igni mis­ <lb/>
            centur," which shows that he found in his MS. <foreign xml:lang="grc">σὺν τω̃ πυρὶ σκότος συμ­ <lb/>
            μιγνύηται</foreign>, iu lieu of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν τω̃ πυρὶ σκότος ἐγγίγνηται</foreign>. But perhaps Plato <lb/>
            alluded to those fantastic forms, which are seen in a fire, when it is gradu­ <lb/>
            ally dying away. But in that case he would have written, I think, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐντὸς <lb/>
            πυρὸς</foreign>, (as in the Timæus, p. 46, A., <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκ γὰρ τη̃ς ἐκτὸς ἐντός τε του̃</foreign> 7rV­ <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ρὸς</foreign>—,) and <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκότος σὺν αὐγῃ̃ γεννᾳ̃ τινα</foreign>, " when darkness with light <lb/>
            produces one," i. e. a shadow. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="182"/>
            49 twofold, when its own and foreign light meeting in one <lb/>
            about shining and smooth bodies, effects by these means a <lb/>
            species,49 producing a sensation of seeing contrary to accus­ <lb/>
            tomed vision.</p>
          <p>Theæ. These works then of divine making are two, the <lb/>
            things themselves, and the image which follows each.</p>
          <p>[112.]. Guest. But what of our art? Shall we not say <lb/>
            that it does, by the art of house-building, make a dwelling, <lb/>
            and has made by painting another (dwelling), which is, as it <lb/>
            were, a dream made by man to persons awake ?</p>
          <p>Thecæ. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. 50 In this way then are the rest. (Divided) into two <lb/>
            parts are the works of our making power; that which relates <lb/>
            to the thing itself we call thing-itself-making, but that which <lb/>
            relates to the image, image-making.50</p>
          <p>Theæ. I now understand you better; and I lay down in <lb/>
            two parts two kinds of the making art, the divine and human, <lb/>
            according to one section; and, according to the other, 51 one <lb/>
            (a production) from themselves, and the other of certain re­ <lb/>
            semblances.51 <note type="footnote"> 49—49 On these unintelligible words, all that the editors have hitherto been <lb/>
            able to do, is to quote a still more obscure passage of Plato's Timæus, and <lb/>
            his Latin commentator, Chalcidius. I suspect the author wrote—<foreign xml:lang="grc">διόπτρου</foreign> </note> <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BOHN_23_fig9.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> Eto, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπεργάζηται</foreign>, i. e. " When two lights, its own and foreign, coming <lb/>
              to one point along the shining and smooth part of a reflector, work out <lb/>
              a form, that- produces a sensation of seeing, opposite to the previously <lb/>
              accustomed one." For the allusion is to a sheet of water, on the surface <lb/>
              of which two lights were supposed to meet, one from within the water, <lb/>
              and the other from without, and thus forming a dioptron, or transparent <lb/>
              mirror, that reflected an image directly contrary to what the object ap­ <lb/>

          <p>Guest. Let us then recollect, that of the image-pro­ <lb/>

          <p>Thece. It was so.</p>
          <p>Guest. There have then appeared, and we shall on this <lb/>
            account enumerate ourselves,52 incontestably two species.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. Yes.</p>
          <p>[113.] Guest. Let us then again divide into two the <lb/>
            fancy-producing species.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. In what way?;</p>
          <p>Guest. One produced through instruments, but 53the other, <lb/>
            when he, who causes the fancied appearance, exhibits himself <lb/>
            as the instrument of the thing.53</p>
          <p>Thecæ. How say you ?</p>
          <p>Guest. I think, when any one employing his own body, <lb/>
            causes your figure to appear similar to (his own),54 or voice <lb/>
            to voice, this is especially called an imitation belonging to <lb/>
            the fancy-producing species.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. It is.</p>
          <p>Guest. Calling this then imitative, we will divide it; but <lb/>
            let us, now reduced to a jelly,55 dismiss all the rest, and we <lb/>
            will permit some other person to collect (the facts) into one, <lb/>
            and to give them a proper appellation. <note type="footnote"> 52 Ficinus has " ipsi—enumerabimus,” which leads to <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὼ</foreign>, found in <lb/>

          <p>Theæ. Say on.</p>
          <p>Guest. Of those who imitate, some knowing what they <lb/>
            imitate, do this, but others not knowing. And yet what di­ <lb/>

          <p>[114.] Guest. But what shall we say respecting the figure <lb/>

            was unknown 57 to our ancestors, so that none of them at­ <lb/>

            same time, although it may be rather bold to be asserted, for <lb/>
            the sake of distinction, let us call the imitation which subsists <lb/>
            with opinion, the “opinion-mimicking," but that which sub­ <lb/>
            sists in conjunction with science, a certain scientific58 imi­ <lb/>
            tation.</p>
          <p>Theæ. Be it so.</p>
          <p>[115.] Guest. We must therefore make use of the other: <lb/>
            for a sophist was not among the scientific but the imitators.</p>
          <p>Theæ. And very much so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Let us then look into this opinion-mimic, as if he <lb/>
            were a piece of iron, and (see) whether he is sound and <lb/>
            whole, or contains in himself some layer doubled over.</p>
          <p>Thecæ. Let us consider.</p>
          <p>Guest. He has it indeed very thick. For, of sophists, one <lb/>
            is a simpleton, and thinks he knows what he (merely) fancies. <lb/>
            But the figure of another, through his tossing about in his <lb/>
            discourse, carries with it much of suspicion and fear, that he <lb/>
            is ignorant of what before others he pretends to know.</p>
          <p>Theæ. There are both these kinds of sophists, of whom you <lb/>
            have spoken.</p>
          <p>Guest. We will therefore place one as a simple imitator, <lb/>
            but the other as an ironical one.</p>
          <p>Theæ. It is proper (to do so).</p>
          <p>Guest. And again, shall we say that the genus of this is <lb/>
            one or two ?</p>
          <p>Theæ. Do you look to it.</p>
          <p>Guest. I do consider; and some two imitators appear before <lb/>
            me. One I behold able to employ irony in public, and in <lb/>
            lengthened speeches before the masses; but the other in <lb/>
            private, and in short discourses, compelling the person who <lb/>
            converses with him to contradict himself.</p>
          <p>Theæ. You speak most correctly.</p>
          <p>[116.] Guest. What then may we show the imitator to be, <lb/>
            who employs lengthened discourses ? A statesman, or a mob- <lb/>
            orator ? <note type="footnote"> 58 Ficinus, uncertain how to translate <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱστορικὴν</foreign>, has—“historicam <lb/>
            quandam scientemque ? I suspect the word conceals some corruption; <lb/>
            which I confess I am unable to correct satisfactorily. </note> <pb n="186"/>
            </p>
          <p>Theœ. A mob-orator.</p>
          <p>Guest. But what shall we call the other ? a wise man, or <lb/>
            wiseman-like?</p>
          <p>Theœ. To (call)59 him a wise man is impossible, since we ' <lb/>
            have placed him as one who is ignorant; but as he is an <lb/>
            imitator of a wise man, it is plain lie must receive some similar <lb/>
            appellation; and I now nearly understand, that we ought <lb/>
            truly to call this person the perfectly real sophist.</p>
          <p>Guest. Shall we not then bind together his name, as we <lb/>
            did before, connecting (every thing)60 from the end to the be­ <lb/>
            ginning?</p>
          <p>Theœ. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. 61 He, then, who is a portion of the art that makes <lb/>
            a discourse to contradict itself, (and) a part of the ironic <lb/>
            species, and of the opinion-mimicking, (and) of the fancy-pro­ <lb/>
            ducing, (and) of that (proceeding) from the image-making, <lb/>
            (and) separated from the making, not as a god but man, (and) <lb/>
            in discourses is the wonder-working portion,61 whoever shall <lb/>
            say that he is "of this race and blood"62 a real sophist, such <lb/>
            a person will, as it appears, speak with the greatest truth.</p>

            <title type="main">INTRODUCTION TO THE STATESMAN.</title>
          </head>
          <p>OF this dialogue, which is feigned to have taken place on the <lb/>
            same day as the Sophist, and may be considered both in manner and <lb/>
            matter a continuation of it, although directed to a different subject, <lb/>
            the argument may be comprised in a very few words. Its object, <lb/>
            as stated towards the close of it, is to show that the head of the <lb/>
            state, who should be a king, ought to combine not only in his own <lb/>
            person, but in that of the people over whom he rules, the two con­ <lb/>
            flicting characters of manliness and moderation. For by such an <lb/>
            union alone is it possible to correct the mischiefs arising equally <lb/>
            from the excess and deficiency of energy in all matters relating to <lb/>
            the well-being of the state.</p>
          <p>To arrive at this conclusion Plato has thought proper to give the <lb/>
            rein to his imagination instead of curbing it; and he has been com­ <lb/>
            pelled in consequence to apologize for the prolixity of his discourse ; <lb/>
            where he was evidently carried away with the same desire to draw <lb/>
            subtle distinctions in things apparently similar, as he has done in <lb/>
            the Sophist. For he was anxious, perhaps, to show his acquaintance <lb/>
            with the minutiæ of some handicraft trades, instead of keeping <lb/>
            rather the attention of the reader fixed to a few leading points, <lb/>
            and putting down only <lb/>
            Quod bene proposito conducat et hæreat apte. <lb/>
            What to the subject's fitted and sticks close.</p>
          <p>In the midst, however, of this discursive matter, we meet with a <lb/>
            curious digression, where Plato has in part anticipated the theory of <lb/>
            the Geologists of the present day, respecting the changes which the <lb/>
            earth has undergone at different periods, together with an allusion <lb/>
            to a primæval state, not very unlike that recorded in Holy Writ; <lb/>
            although in neither case did he probably do more than put into his <lb/>
            own words, what lie found in the writings of preceding philosophers.</p><pb n="188"/>
            
          <p>This dialogue is remarkable, moreover, for the development of the <lb/>
            notion, so contrary to that of modern times, that laws should be <lb/>
            made not so much to chime in with the feelings of the people, as to <lb/>
            oppose their prejudices, provided the object of such legislation be <lb/>
            to improve their moral and physical condition. But as this end <lb/>
            could not be accomplished, where the ruling power rests with the <lb/>
            masses, who, as Plato had seen at Athens, were alternately ferocious <lb/>
            despots or fawning slaves, he suggested the propriety 0f establish­ <lb/>
            ing in conjunction with a king, an aristocracy, composed of persons, <lb/>
            not superior to their countrymen in wealth, but in virtue, and pos­ <lb/>
            sessing, like the king, the qualities necessary for a real statesman; <lb/>
            who should be at once a shepherd, to look to the rearing of his <lb/>
            charge, and a physician, to watch over their health, and a philoso­ <lb/>
            pher, to superintend their mental and moral culture.</p>
          <p>As this dialogue has been edited separately only by Stalbaum— <lb/>
            for Fischer's publication is, like the rest of that scholars works, be­ <lb/>
            neath even a passing notice-it presents not a few passages to <lb/>
            exercise, and, as I have found, to baffle the ingenuity of emendatorv <lb/>
            criticism; to which Stalbaum should have resorted rather than have <lb/>
            sought to support the nonsense of a corrupt text. As regards, how­ <lb/>
            ever, the matter of the dialogue, he has left little to desire in his <lb/>
            Prolegomena of 132 8vo pages; to which the reader is referred, <lb/>
            who wishes to know something of what has been written by the <lb/>
            more recent scholars of Germany on questions, that will, it is to be <lb/>
            feared, remain for ever in their present obscurity.</p><pb n="189"/>

          <p>[1.] I OWE you, Theodorus, surely many thanks for my <lb/>
            acquaintance with Theætetus and this guest to boot.</p>
          <p>The. Perhaps, Socrates, you will owe me thrice as many, <lb/>
            when they shall have worked out for you a statesman and a <lb/>
            philosopher.</p>
          <p>Soc. Be it so. But shall we say we have thus heard this <lb/>
            from you, the most powerful in calculations and geometry ?</p>
          <p>The. How, Socrates?</p>
          <p>Soc. As having put down each of these men of equal <lb/>
            worth, who are in value more removed from each other than" <lb/>
            accords with the analogy of your art.</p>
          <p>The. By our god Ammon,' Socrates, you have well and <lb/>
            justly, and very rememberingly2 reproved me for my error in <lb/>
            calculation. But I will follow you up about this at a future <lb/>
            time. But do not you, 0 guest, in any respect be faint- <lb/>
            hearted in gratifying us; but select for us either first a <note type="footnote"> 1 Theodorus, who was a mathematician of Cyrene, is feigned to swear <lb/>

            statesman, or a philosopher; and having selected go through <lb/>
            (the discussion).</p>
          <p>Guest. This must be done, Theodorus ; for since we have <lb/>
            put our hand to this discussion, we must not stand aloof, till <lb/>
            we arrive at the end of it. But what must I do with Theæte­ <lb/>
            tus here?</p>
          <p>The. As regards what ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Shall we suffer him to rest, and take in his stead <lb/>
            Socrates here, his fellow-combatant ? Or how do you advise?</p>
          <p>The. Take him, as you say, in his stead. For, both being <lb/>
            young men, they will after resting easily endure every labour.</p>
          <p>Soc. And indeed, 0 guest, both of them appear almost to <lb/>
            have an affinity with me from some quarter. For you say <lb/>
            that one of them (Theætetus) seems to resemble me in the <lb/>
            natural form of his face;4 and the appellation of the other, <lb/>
            being of the same name as myself, and his address5 furnish a <lb/>
            kind of family connexion. It is meet then for us to recognise <lb/>
            always with readiness in conversation those of the same kin. <lb/>
            Now yesterday I mingled in a conversation with Theætetus,6 <lb/>
            and I have now heard him answering ; but neither (case <lb/>
            applies) to Socrates (here). It is meet, however, for us to con­ <lb/>
            sider him likewise. Let him then at some other time answer <lb/>
            me, but at present you.</p>
          <p>Guest. Be it so. Do you, Socrates (junior), hear this So­ <lb/>
            crates ? '</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. I do.</p>
          <p>Guest. Do you then agree to what he says ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Entirely.</p>
          <p>Guest. It appears then, that your affairs will not be an <lb/>
            hinderance ; and perhaps it is requisite for me to be much less <lb/>
            .an hinderance. But after the sophist7 it is necessary, as it <lb/>
            appears to me, for us to seek out the statesman. [2.] Tell <lb/>
            me then, whether must we place this (character) too among <lb/>
            the possessors of knowledge, or how ? <note type="footnote">3 Respecting this Socrates junior see Sophist, § 6, and Theætet. § 13. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 See Theætet. § 5. </note><note type="footnote"> 5 As <foreign xml:lang="grc">κλῆσις</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόσρησις</foreign> have the same meaning, it is evident that <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Soc. jun. In this way.8</p>
          <p>Guest. We must then divide the sciences, as (we did) when <lb/>
            we were inquiring into the former (character).</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Perhaps so.</p>
          <p>Guest. But yet the division appears to me, Socrates, to be <lb/>
            not after the same manner.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Why not?</p>
          <p>Guest. But after another.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. It would seem so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Where then can one find the statesman's path ? For <lb/>
            find it we must; and separating it from the rest, put on it the <lb/>
            seal of one (general) form, and on the other deflections the <lb/>
            mark of another species; and thus cause our soul to conceive <lb/>
            that all the sciences do in reality belong to two species.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. I think, 0 guest, that this is your business, and <lb/>
            not mine.</p>
          <p>Guest. But indeed, Socrates, it must needs be yours too, <lb/>
            when it becomes apparent to us.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. You speak well.</p>
          <p>Guest. Are not then arithmetic, and certain other sciences <lb/>
            allied to this, divested of action; and do they not afford a <lb/>
            subject of thought alone ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. It is so.</p>
          <p>Guest. But those which pertain to carpenter's work, and <lb/>
            the whole of handicraft trades, possess a science, as it were, <lb/>
            innate in their operations, and at the same time complete the <lb/>
            bodies produced by them, which had not an existence previ­ <lb/>
            ously.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. In this manner then divide sciences in general, <lb/>
            calling one practical and the other merely intellectual.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Let there be then of one whole science two <lb/>
            species.</p>
          <p>Guest. Whether then shall we lay down the statesman, the <lb/>
            king, the despot, and the head of a household, and call them <lb/>
            all by one name ? Or shall we say there are as many sciences <lb/>
            as have been their mentioned names ? Or rather follow me <lb/>
            hither. <note type="footnote"> 8 To a bipartite question there could not be a single answer. Ficinus <lb/>
            has correctly, " Utrum hunc in eorum, qui scientes dicuntur, numerum <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Whither ?</p>
          <p>Guest. On this road. If a private person is able to give <lb/>
            advice sufficiently well to any of the public physicians,9 is it <lb/>
            not necessary for him to be called by the name of the art, the <lb/>
            same as he is, to whom he gives advice.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Yes.</p>
          <p>Guest. What then, whatever private person is skilled in <lb/>
            giving advice to the king of a country, shall we not say that <lb/>
            he. possesses the science, which the ruler himself ought to <lb/>
            possess ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. We shall.</p>
          <p>Guest. But surely the science of a true king is a kingly <lb/>
            (science).</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Yes.</p>
          <p>Guest. And may not he, who possesses this science, <lb/>
            whether he is a private man, or a king, be in every respect <lb/>
            rightly called, according to this art, king-like.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. Justly so.</p>
          <p>Guest. And are not the head of a household and a despot <lb/>
            the same ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How not?</p>
          <p>Guest. But what, will the size of an extensive household <lb/>
            or the swollen form10 of a small state make any difference as <lb/>
            regards the government ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Not at all.</p>
          <p>Guest. It is evident then, what is indeed the thing we <lb/>
            were just now inquiring, that there is one science respecting <lb/>
            all these. But whether any one calls it the science of a king, <lb/>
            a statesman, or a family-man, let us not differ about it.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Why should we?</p>

            science ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. We will then put together in the same (class) <lb/>
            statesmanship and a statesman, kingship and a king, as being <lb/>
            all one thing.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. It is evident.</p>
          <p>Guest. Shall we not proceed then in an orderly manner, if <lb/>
            after this we divide the intellectual science ?</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Attend, then, and inform me whether we can per­ <lb/>
            ceive any point of union ?12</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Tell me of what kind.</p>
          <p>Guest. Of this kind. We have a certain calculating art.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Yes.</p>
          <p>Guest. And this I think entirely belongs to the intellectual <lb/>
            arts.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. How not?</p>
          <p>Guest. Shall we concede to the calculating art, that knows <lb/>
            the difference in numbers, any thing more than that it dis­ <lb/>
            tinguishes things, the subjects of intellect.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How should we ?</p>
          <p>Guest. For every architect is not a workman himself, but <lb/>
            is the ruler over workmen.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Yes.</p>
          <p>Guest. And he imparts indeed intellect, but not the work <lb/>
            by hand.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. Just so.</p>
          <p>Guest. He may justly then be said to have a share in in­ <lb/>
            tellectual science.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. Entirely.</p>
          <p>Guest. And for him I think it is fitting, after he has <note type="footnote"> 12 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαφυγὴν</foreign>, Heindorf, on Phædon. p. 98, C., suggested, <lb/>

            passed a judgment, not to have an end, nor to be freed, as the <lb/>
            calculator was freed (from doing more), but to command every <lb/>
            workman (to do) that which is suited to him, until they shall <lb/>
            have worked out what has been commanded.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Right.</p>
          <p>Guest. Are not then all such as these, and such as are con­ <lb/>
            sequent upon the calculating art, intellectual? And do not <lb/>
            these two genera differ from each other in judgment and com­ <lb/>
            mandment ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. They appear to do so.</p>
          <p>Guest. If then we should divide the whole of the intel­ <lb/>
            lectual science into two parts, and call the one mandatory, and <lb/>
            the other judicial, should we not say that we have made a <lb/>
            careful division ?</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. Yes, according to my mind.</p>
          <p>Guest. But for those, who do any thing in common, it is <lb/>
            delightful to be of one mind.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. As far then as we participate 13 on this point, we <lb/>
            must bid farewell to the opinions of others.</p>
          <p>[4.] Soc. jun. Why not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Come, then, inform me in which of these arts we <lb/>
            must place the kingly character. Must we place him in the <lb/>
            judicial art, as some spectator? Or rather, shall we place <lb/>
            him in the commanding art, as being a despot ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How not rather in this ?</p>
          <p>Guest. We may consider again the commanding art, <lb/>
            whether it stands in any way apart. For it appears to me, <lb/>
            that as the art of a huckster is separated from his, who sells <lb/>
            his own goods,14 so is the genus of a king from the genus of <lb/>
            public criers.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How so ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Hucksters, having received the previously sold <lb/>
            works of others, afterwards sell them again themselves.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. The tribe of criers too, after receiving the thoughts <lb/>
            of strangers, enjoins them again to others. <note type="footnote"> 13 I suspect there is some error in <foreign xml:lang="grc">κοινωνϖμεν</foreign>, which it were easy to <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Most true.</p>
          <p>Guest. What then, shall we mix in the same (class) the <lb/>
            king-art, and that of the interpreting, ordering, prophesying, <lb/>
            and public-crying, and many other arts allied to these, all <lb/>
            which have this in common that they command ? Or are you <lb/>
            willing that, as we just now instituted a resemblance (in <lb/>
            things), we should make a resemblance in the name likewise ? <lb/>
            since the genus of those, who rule their own concerns, is <lb/>
            nearly without a name; and shall we so divide these, by <lb/>
            placing the kingly genus among those, who command their <lb/>
            own concerns, and by neglecting every thing else, leave any <lb/>
            one to put another name on them? For our method was <lb/>
            (adopted) for the sake of a ruler, and not for its contrary.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>[5.] Guest. Since then this stands at a moderate distance <lb/>
            apart from those, and is separated from that, which is foreign, <lb/>
            into that which is domestic, it is necessary to divide this <lb/>
            again, if we have yet any yielding15 section in this.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. And, indeed, it appears that we have. But follow <lb/>
            me and divide.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Whither?</p>
          <p>Guest. Shall we not find that all such as we conceive to be <lb/>
            rulers, do, by making use of a command, give a command for <lb/>
            the sake of producing something ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. And indeed it is not at all difficult for all things <lb/>
            that are produced, to receive a twofold division.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. In what way?</p>
          <p>Guest. Some among all of them are animated, and others <lb/>
            are inanimate.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. They are so.</p>
          <p>Guest. If we wish to cut the portion of intelligence, that <lb/>
            has a commanding power over these very things, we will <lb/>
            cut it. <note type="footnote"> 15 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπείκουσαν</foreign>, some one, says Stalbaum, wished to read <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Soc. jun. According to what?</p>
          <p>Guest. By assigning one part over the generation of inani­ <lb/>
            mate things, and the other over the generation of animated. <lb/>
            And thus the whole will be divided into two parts.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. One part then let us put aside, and take up again <lb/>
            the other; and after taking it up, divide the whole into two <lb/>
            parts.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. But which of these do you say is to be resumed ?</p>
          <p>Guest. By all means, that which has a command over ani­ <lb/>
            mals. For it is not the province of the kingly science to have <lb/>
            a command over things inanimate, like the science of archi­ <lb/>
            tecture ; but, being of a more noble nature, over animals; <lb/>
            and it ever possesses a power relating to such very things.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Right.</p>
          <p>Guest. (With respect to) the generation and nurture of <lb/>
            animals, a person may see the former as single-feeding, but <lb/>
            the latter as the common-feeding of the nurslings in herds.17</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Right.</p>
          <p>Guest. But we shall find that the statesman is not a breeder <lb/>
            of his own property, like an ox-driver, or some horse-currier;18 <lb/>
            but is rather like the person who rears horses and oxen.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. What has been just said seems to be the fact.</p>
          <p>Guest. Whether then (with respect to) the nurture of ani­ <lb/>
            mals, shall we call the common-rearing of all together a herd- <lb/>
            rearing, or a certain general-rearing.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Whichever may happen in the discourse.</p>
          <p>[6.] Guest. You (have said) well, Socrates. And if you <lb/>
            avoid paying too serious an attention to names, you will ap­ <lb/>
            pear in old age to be more rich in prudence. But now we <lb/>
            must do as you recommended. But do you understand how <lb/>
            some one will, having divided the herd-rearing art into two, <note type="footnote"> 17 On this mass of nonsense Stalbaum says, as usual, not a word; nor <lb/>
            does he notice even the remarkable version of Ficinus, " Circa genera­ <lb/>

            dam una; gregis totius altera." By uniting the Gr ek and the Latin, one <lb/>

            cause, what is now sought for in a double, to be sought for <lb/>
            then in halves? 19</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. I shall be eager (to do so): and it appears to me <lb/>
            that there is one rearing of men, and another of beasts.</p>
          <p>Guest. You have divided in every respect most readily <lb/>
            and courageously. However, (we must be careful) to the <lb/>
            utmost of our power not to suffer hereafter this.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. What?</p>
          <p>Guest. That we do not take away one small part as appli­ <lb/>
            cable to many and great parts, nor yet without a species; but <lb/>
            let it always have at the same time a species. For it is very <lb/>
            well to separate immediately the thing sought for from all the <lb/>
            rest, if the separation be rightly made; just as you did a little <lb/>
            before, through conceiving the division to be rightly made, <lb/>
            hasten on, seeing that the discourse was tending to man. <lb/>
            But, my friend, it is not safe to divide with subtlety;20 but <lb/>
            it is more safe to proceed in the middle21 by dividing (con­ <lb/>
            tinually) ; for thus will one more (readily)22 meet with forms <lb/>
            (of existence). But the whole of this relates23 to our in­ <lb/>
            quiries.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How say you this, 0 guest?</p>
          <p>Guest. I must endeavour to speak yet more clearly, through <lb/>
            a kind feeling towards your disposition,24 Socrates. But it <lb/>
            is impossible in the subject at hand to show what is now <note type="footnote"> 19 Such is Stalbaum's version of the Greek text. Both are equally <lb/>
            beyond my comprehension; and so is the Latin of Ficinus: " Sed nun­ <lb/>
            quid vides, quo pacto quis, gregis nutritionem geminam ostendens, efficiat <lb/>
            ut, quod in duplis ad id, quod nunc propositum est, investigabitur, in <lb/>
            dimidiis iterum perquiratur." By following however the train of <lb/>
            thought, and adopting the alterations to which it leads, one might perhaps <lb/>
            recover what Plato wrote. </note><note type="footnote"> 20 Ficinus has, " ad extremum quiddam et tenue protinus adventare." </note><note type="footnote"> 21 So Ovid, " medio tutissimus ibis." </note><note type="footnote"> 22 Ficinus has "facilius meliusque," as if he had found in his MS. <lb/>

            said in a manner wanting in nothing; still we must endea­ <lb/>
            vour, for the sake of perspicuity, to carry on the inquiry a <lb/>
            little further.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. In what respect then do you say we have, by <lb/>
            dividing, just now not rightly done ?</p>
          <p>Guest. In this respect; that, should any one attempt to <lb/>
            give a twofold division to the human genus, he would divide, <lb/>
            in the way that the majority here divide. For by separating <lb/>
            the Grecian genus, as one apart from all, they give to all <lb/>
            the rest, who are innumerable, unmixt, and not speaking <lb/>
            the same language with each other, one name, that of a Bar­ <lb/>
            barian race; and through this one name they fancy the race <lb/>
            itself to be one; or as if some one, thinking that number <lb/>
            should be divided into two species, should, after cutting off <lb/>
            ten thousand from all numbers, put it aside as one species, <lb/>
            and, giving one name to all the rest, should think that, through <lb/>
            that appellation, this genus will become separate and different <lb/>
            from the other. He however would make in a more beautiful <lb/>
            manner, and more according to species, and a two-fold <lb/>
            division, who should divide number into even and odd, and <lb/>
            the human species into male and female; and, after arranging <lb/>
            the Lydians or Phrygians, or some other nations, should then <lb/>
            separate them into wholes, when he is incapable of finding <lb/>
            the genus, and at the same time the species of each of the <lb/>
            divided portions.</p>
          <p>[7.] Soc.jun. Most right. But (explain),26 0 guest, this <lb/>
            very thing-How can any one rather clearly know that genus <lb/>
            and species are not the same, but different from each other ?</p>
          <p>Guest. 0 Socrates, thou best of men, thou commandest no <lb/>
            trifling thing. Already have we wandered further from our <lb/>
            proposed discourse than is fitting; and yet you order us to <lb/>
            wander still further. Now then let us, as is reasonable, turn <lb/>
            back again; and hereafter we will at leisure pursue this point, <lb/>
            as having come upon the track. Do not, however, by any <lb/>
            means guard against this,27 that you have heard from me <lb/>

          <p>Soc. jun. What?</p>
          <p>Guest. That species and part are different from each other.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Why (say you) so ?</p>
          <p>Guest. When any thing is a species of some thing, it is <lb/>
            necessary for it to be a part of the thing of which it is said <lb/>
            to be the species: but there is no necessity for a part to be a <lb/>
            species. Always consider me, therefore, Socrates, as assert­ <lb/>
            ing this rather than that.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Be it so.</p>
          <p>Guest. But tell me that, which is after this.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. What ?</p>
          <p>Guest. The point of the digression which has brought us <lb/>
            hither. For I think it was especially at that point, when, on <lb/>
            your being asked how we must divide herd-rearing, you an­ <lb/>
            swered very readily, that there were two kinds of animals, <lb/>
            the one of man, and the other of brutes taken all together.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. True.</p>
          <p>Guest. And you then appeared to me, after taking away <lb/>
            a part, to think that you ought to leave28 the remainder as <lb/>
            one genus of all (brutes), because you could give to them all <lb/>
            the same name, by calling them brutes.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. Such was the case.</p>
          <p>Guest. But this, 0 most courageous of men, is just as if <lb/>
            some other prudent29 animal, such as seems to be the crane, <lb/>
            or some other animal of a similar kind, should, in the same <lb/>
            manner as you do, oppose the cranes, as one race, to all other <lb/>
            animals, and make itself an object of respect; and, putting all <lb/>
            the rest together with men into one race, call them perhaps <lb/>
            nothing else but brutes. Let us then endeavour to avoid <lb/>
            every thing whatsoever of this kind.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How?</p>
          <p>Guest. By not dividing every genus of animals, that we <lb/>
            may suffer the less.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. For there is no necessity. <note type="footnote"> never united to an imperative; nor does <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλὰ</foreign>, as far as I remember, ever <lb/>
            follow <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ μήν</foreign>. To avoid the difficulty, Ficinus omits <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ μὴν</foreign> ata, and <lb/>
            makes Plato write something like sense. </note><note type="footnote"> 28 Ficinus has, " putavisse ponendum," as if he had found in his MS. <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Guest. For we then erred in this way.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. In what?</p>
          <p>Guest. Such part of intellectual science as related to com­ <lb/>
            manding was (said) by us to be of the animal-rearing kind, <lb/>
            as regards gregarious animals. Was it not ?</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. It was.</p>
          <p>Guest. The whole animal genus, therefore, was even then <lb/>
            divided into the tame and wild. For those animals that have <lb/>
            a nature to become gentle, are called tame; but those that <lb/>
            have not, are (called) wild.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Correctly.</p>
          <p>Guest. But the science, of which we are in the hunt, was <lb/>
            and is in the case of tame animals, and is to be sought for <lb/>
            among the gregarious rearlings.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. Yes.</p>
          <p>Guest. Let us then not divide, as formerly, looking to all <lb/>
            animals, nor with haste, so that we may quickly arrive at <lb/>
            state-science. For this has caused us to suffer even now <lb/>
            according to the proverb—30</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. What?</p>
          <p>Guest. By not well dividing31 quietly, to complete (the <lb/>
            task) more slowly.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. And it has, 0 guest, properly caused (us to suffer).</p>
          <p>[8.] Guest. Be it so then. But let us again from the <lb/>
            beginning endeavour to divide the common-rearing (of ani­ <lb/>
            mals). For perhaps the discourse itself, being brought to a <lb/>
            conclusion, will more clearly unfold what you desire. But <lb/>
            tell me-</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. What?</p>
          <p>Guest. This; if indeed you have frequently32 heard it from <note type="footnote"> 30 The proverb was, perhaps, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Οὐχ ἥσυχοι βραδύτερον άνύτουσιν</foreign>, simi­ <lb/>

            Thessalian plains.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How not?</p>
          <p>Guest. On this account I have asked you all these ques­ <lb/>
            tions, because the rearing of herds of animals is partly of <lb/>
            those moving33 in the water, and partly on dry land.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. It is so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Does it not then. appear to you likewise, that we <lb/>
            ought to cut in two. the common-rearing science, [distributing <lb/>
            to each of them its own part,34] and call the one a rearing-in­ <lb/>
            moisture, and the other a rearing-on-dry-land.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. (It does so appear) to me.</p>
          <p>Guest. But we will not in the same manner inquire to <lb/>
            which of these arts king-science belongs. For it is evident <lb/>
            to every one.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. And every one can separate the dry-rearing portion <lb/>
            of the herd-rearing.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How?</p>
          <p>Guest. Into the flying and walking-on-foot.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Most true.</p>
          <p>Guest. But what of state-science, must it be inquired whe­ <lb/>
            ther it relates to the walking-on-foot ? Or do you not think, <lb/>
            that the most stupid person, so to say, would imagine so ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. I do.</p>
          <p>Guest. But it is requisite to show that the art of rearing <lb/>
            foot-walking (animals) is, as number was just now, cut into <lb/>
            two parts. <note type="footnote"> that <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολλάκις</foreign> means " perchance." But how <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολλάκις</foreign> " frequently," <lb/>
            could have such a meaning, it is difficult to understand. Plato wrote <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅ δη</foreign>, to which <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδὲ</foreign> for a, in one MS., plainly leads. </note><note type="footnote"> 33 In lieu of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔνυδρον</foreign>, Athenæus, in iii. p. 99, B., gives another read­ <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Soc.jun. This is evident.</p>
          <p>Guest. And yet to the part, to which our discourse has led <lb/>
            us on, there seem to be some two paths extending themselves ; <lb/>
            the one quicker, by being divided, a small part as compared <lb/>
            with a large one ; but the other longer, from preserving <lb/>
            rather the precept, which we mentioned before, that we <lb/>
            ought to cut as much as possible through the middle. It is <lb/>
            in our power then to proceed by either of the paths we may <lb/>
            wish.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Is it then impossible to proceed by both ?</p>
          <p>Guest. What by both at once, 0 wonderful youth ? Al­ <lb/>
            ternately, however, it is plain the thing is possible.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. I choose then both alternately.</p>
          <p>Guest. The thing is easy; since short is the remainder (of <lb/>
            the road). In the beginning indeed and middle of our journey <lb/>
            the command35 would have been difficult. But now, since <lb/>
            this seems good, let us first proceed by the longer road. For, <lb/>
            as we are fresh, we shall more easily journey through it. But <lb/>
            do you look to the division.</p>
          <p>[9.] Soc.jun. Speak it.</p>
          <p>Guest. Of such tame animals as are gregarious, the foot- <lb/>
            walking have been divided by us according to nature.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. What (nature)?</p>
          <p>Guest. By some of their race being hornless and others <lb/>
            homed.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. So it appears.</p>
          <p>Guest. Divide then the art of rearing foot-walking animals, <lb/>
            and assign to each part,36 making use of reason. For should <lb/>
            you wish to name them, the thing will become complicated <lb/>
            more than is fitting.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How then must one speak (of them) ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Thus. Of the science of rearing foot-walking <lb/>
            animals, divided into two parts, let one portion be as­ <lb/>
            signed to the horned part of the herd, but the other to the <lb/>
            hornless. <note type="footnote"> 36 As no command had been given, C. Badham, in The Surplice, quoted <lb/>

            ciently shown to be so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Now then the king is evidently the shepherd over <lb/>
            a flock of animals deprived of horns.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. For how is he not evident?</p>
          <p>Guest. Breaking then this (herd) into portions, let pis en­ <lb/>
            deavour to assign the result37 to him (the king).</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Whether then are you willing for us to divide it <lb/>
            (the herd) by the cloven, or, what is called, the solid hoof? Or <lb/>
            by a common or individual generation ? For you understand.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. What?</p>
          <p>Guest. That the race of horses and asses naturally pro­ <lb/>
            create with each other.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. It does.</p>
          <p>Guest. But the other still remaining portion of the <lb/>
            smooths 38-haired herd of tame animals, is unmixed in their <lb/>
            generation with each other.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. But whether does the Statesman appear to take care <lb/>
            of animals having a common, or individual generation ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. It is evident of the unmixed (generation).</p>
          <p>Guest. We must then, as it seems, divide this, as those be­ <lb/>
            fore, into two parts.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Yes; we must.</p>
          <p>Guest. But we have cut into minute portions nearly every <lb/>
            tame and gregarious animal, except two genera. For it is <lb/>
            not fit to rank the genus of dogs39 among gregarious cattle. <note type="footnote"> 31 Stalbaum explains TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">γιγνόμενον</foreign>, the emendation of Cornarius, by <lb/>

          <p>Soc. jun. In what manner ?</p>

          <p>Guest. Is the nature, which the race of us men possesses, <lb/>
            adapted to locomotion in any other way than as a diameter, <lb/>
            which is two feet in power?40</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. In no other way.</p>
          <p>Guest. Moreover the nature of the remaining genus is <lb/>
            again according to the power of our power, a diameter, if it <lb/>
            naturally consists of twice two feet.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Undoubtedly. And now I nearly understand <lb/>

            No. 33, by quoting Hipp. Maj. p. 289, A., where Plato compares man to <lb/>
            a monkey, as Heracleitus had done before him; who said that the most <lb/>
            beautiful monkey would appear an ugly creature, when compared with a <lb/>

            monkey, when compared with the Creator. And it was in allusion to this <lb/>
            doctrine of Heracleitus, that Ennius said, as we learn from Cicero, " Simia <lb/>
            quam similis, turpissima bestia nobis." It will however be objected, per­ <lb/>
            haps, that monkeys do not herd together, nor converse with their keepers. <lb/>
            But the monkey is known in its natural state to be a gregarious animal; <lb/>
            and though their talk is not intelligible to man, their chatter, no doubt, is <lb/>
            to each other. Besides, in this allusion to a monkey in a dialogue relat­ <lb/>
            ing to Statesmanship, Plato had in mind, I suspect, an Æsopo-Socratic <lb/>
            fable preserved in the prose of the Progymnasmata of Hermogenes to the <lb/>
            following effect—The monkeys came together to consult about the neces­ <lb/>
            sity of fixing their dwelling in a city. After they had so decreed, and <lb/>
            were about to put their hands to the work, an old monkey stopped them <lb/>
            by saying that they would be caught still easier, should they shut them­ <lb/>
            selves up within enclosures.—To the same fable there is an allusion in <lb/>
            the Gorgias, p. 484, F., <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπειδὰν</foreign> ovv <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔλθωσιν εἴς τινα ἰδίαν ἢ πολιτικὴν <lb/>

            handy animal," and called by that name, from the Latin man-us, " hand," <lb/>
            the same epithet may be fairly applied to the monkey, whose hand, both <lb/>
            in form and power, is very similar to that of man; and whose very name, <lb/>
            “monkey," is only a corruption of " mannikin," the diminutive of <lb/>

          <p>Guest. For now, Socrates, that is more apparent, which <lb/>
            was said by us in our search for a sophist.46</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. What is that?</p>
          <p>Guest. That in such a method of discourse there is no <lb/>
            greater care for what is venerable, than what is not, nor does <lb/>
            it prefer the small to the great, but always accomplishes that <lb/>
            which according to itself is most true.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Guest. After this, that you may not anticipate me by ask­ <lb/>

          <p>Soc. jun. By all means.</p>

            the foot-walking genus into the biped and quadruped; and, <lb/>
            seeing that the human race shared the same lot with the <lb/>
            flying genus alone, we ought to have again divided the two- <lb/>
            footed into the wingless and winged; and this division having <lb/>
            been made, and the art shown, which is the rearer of men, <lb/>
            we ought to have brought forward and placed over it the <lb/>
            statesman and kingly character, like a charioteer, and given <lb/>
            him the reins of the city,47 in consequence of this science <lb/>
            being peculiarly his own.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. You have (spoken) beautifully, and given me an <lb/>
            account, as it were, of a debt,48 and added a digression, by <lb/>
            way of interest, and completed (the transaction).</p>

            beginning the commanding; and the part assimilated to this <lb/>
            was called the self-commanding. Again, of the self-command­ <lb/>

            part of the genera; and of the rearing of animals, the rear­ <lb/>

            of foot-walking animals, the science of rearing the hornless <lb/>

            is desirous of bringing it under one name, by calling it the <lb/>
            science of tending an unmixed genius. But a section from <lb/>
            this, which alone remains, and which rears men, as being a <lb/>
            biped flock, is the part which has been just now explored, <lb/>
            and is called, at one and the same time, the kingly and states- <lb/>
            manly kind.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Do you then, Socrates, think that this has been, as <lb/>
            you say, really done well ?</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. What?</p>
          <p>Guest. That the thing proposed has been in every respect <lb/>
            sufficiently discussed. Or has our investigation been parti­ <lb/>
            cularly deficient in this very thing, that the account has been <lb/>
            given in words, but not in all respects worked out to the end ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How say you ?</p>
          <p>Guest. I will endeavour to explain to ourselves more clearly <lb/>
            what I am thinking of.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. Say it.</p>
          <p>Guest. There is then of many herdsmen’s arts, that have <lb/>
            appeared to us, one, the statesman's, and the guardianship of <lb/>
            some one herd.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. There is.</p>
          <p>Guest. This our discourse has defined to be neither the <lb/>
            rearer of horses, nor of other animals, but to be the science <lb/>
            of rearing men in common.</p>
          <p>[11.] Soc. jun. It did so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Now let us see what is the difference between all <lb/>
            herdsmen and kings.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. What is it ?</p>
          <p>Guest. If any one of the rest,49 possessing the name of <lb/>

            of the herd, (what should we say)?50</p>

            whom we have called statesmen, and assert that it is their <lb/>
            care to rear men, and not only men herded together, but even <lb/>
            the rulers themselves-</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Would they not rightly say?</p>
          <p>Guest. Perhaps so. And we will consider this too. We <lb/>
            know that no one will contend with a herdsman about things <lb/>
            of this kind ; since he is himself the rearer, himself the <lb/>
            physician, and himself, as it were, the bridesman (of the <lb/>
            herd), and is alone skilled in the midwife's art respecting <lb/>
            the birth and delivery of the produce.52 No one, besides, <lb/>
            is better able, by such sport and music as cattle can, by their <lb/>
            nature, share in, to console and soothe, and render gentle, <lb/>
            both with instruments and the naked mouth, handling in <lb/>
            the best way the music of his flock.53 And the same may <lb/>
            be said of other herdsmen. Or may it not ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Most right.</p>
          <p>Guest. How then will our discourse respecting a king ap­ <lb/>
            pear to be right and entire, when we place him alone, as <lb/>
            the herdsman and rearer of the human herd, selecting him <lb/>
            alone out of ten thousand others contending with him ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. By no means.</p>
          <p>Guest. Did we not then a little before very properly fear, <lb/>
            when we suspected, lest we should only speak of a certain <lb/>
            figure of a king, and not perfectly work out the statesman, <lb/>
            until by taking away those, who were diffused around him, <lb/>
            and laid claim to a fellow-rearing, and, by separating him <lb/>
            from them, we should exhibit him alone and pure ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Most rightly (did we fear).</p>
          <p>Guest. This then, Socrates, must be done by us, unless we <lb/>

            requisite to make use of the prolix portion of a long story, <lb/>
            and, as regards what still remains, to take away, as we did <lb/>

            of the inquiry. Must we not do so ?</p>

          <p>Soc.jun. This too is one of the things said of old.</p>

            more wonderful. But, through the length of time, some of <lb/>
            them have become extinct, and others are told in a dispersed <lb/>
            manner, separate from each other. But that which is the <lb/>
            cause of this to all these, no person has told as yet; and it <lb/>
            must be now told; for being told it will be something con­ <lb/>

          <p>[13.] Soc.jun. You have spoken most beautifully. Say <lb/>
            on then, and omit nothing.</p>
          <p>Guest. Hear, then. This universe the deity does at one <lb/>
            time conduct himself, as it proceeds, and with it rolls on ; but <lb/>
            at another leaves it, when its revolutions shall have received <lb/>
            the measure of the fitting time; and it is then brought back <lb/>
            again of its own accord to a contrary state, being a thing <lb/>
            of life, and having a share of intelligence from him, who put it <lb/>
            together at its outset. Now this movement backwards has <lb/>
            been of necessity implanted in it through this.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Through what ?</p>
          <p>Guest. To subsist always according to the same, and in a <lb/>
            similar manner, and to be the same, belongs to the most divine <lb/>
            of all things alone. But the nature of body is not of this order. <lb/>
            But that, which we have called heaven and the world, has a <lb/>
            share in many and blessed (gifts) from the producing (cause) ; <lb/>
            moreover,59 it has had a share of body; from whence it cannot <lb/>
            be entirely without a share of change; nevertheless, according <lb/>
            to its power it is moved as much as possible in the same, and <lb/>
            according to the same, by one impetus. Hence it is allotted a <lb/>
            revolving movement, as being the smallest change in its mo­ <lb/>
            tion. But scarcely any thing is able to turn itself by itself, ex­ <lb/>
            cept that which is the leader of all things that are moved. And <lb/>
            it is not lawful for this to move at one time in one way, and at <lb/>
            another in a contrary way. From all this then we must say, <note type="footnote"> M This is a strange expression; as if both children were begotten by their <lb/>
            parents, and parents by their children. Plato wrote, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξ ἐπαλλήλων</foreign>— <lb/>

            that the world does not always cause itself to revolve, nor that <lb/>
            the whole is always made by the deity to revolve in two and <lb/>
            contrary revolutions: nor, again, that some two deities, whose <lb/>
            thoughts are contrary to each other, cause it to revolve; but <lb/>
            what has been said just now, and remains alone, that at one <lb/>
            time it is conducted by another divine cause, possessing the <lb/>
            power to live again, and receiving an immortality prepared by <lb/>
            the demiurgus; but that at another time, when it is let loose, <lb/>
            it proceeds itself by itself; and, after being thus let loose <lb/>
            for such60 a time as to perform back again many myriads of <lb/>
            revolutions, it proceeds by its being of the greatest size, and <lb/>
            most equally balanced, to move at the smallest foot.61</p>

          <p>[14.] Guest. Reasoning then from what has been said <lb/>
            already, let us think together on the circumstance, which we <lb/>
            stated was the cause of all these wonderful doings. For it <lb/>
            is this very thing.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. What?</p>
          <p>Guest. That the movement of the universe is at one time <lb/>
            carried on, as it is at present, in a circle, and at another time <lb/>
            in the contrary direction.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How is this ?</p>
          <p>Guest. We must consider this change of motion to be the <lb/>
            greatest and most perfect of all the revolutions, relating to <lb/>
            the heavenly bodies.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. It is likely.</p>
          <p>Guest. It is proper then to think that the greatest changes <lb/>
            happen at that time to us, who are living within the universe.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. And this too is likely. <note type="footnote"> 60 I have with Sauppe united <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοσου̃τον</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="grc">καιρὸν</foreign>, despite the opposition <lb/>

          <p>Guest. But do we not know that the nature of animals sus­ <lb/>
            tains with difficulty changes great, numerous, and of all <lb/>
            kinds ?</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. How not?</p>
          <p>Guest. Hence the greatest destruction of other animals <lb/>
            necessarily takes place at that time, and that of the human <lb/>
            race only some small portion remains. And to these many <lb/>
            other wonderful and novel circumstances happen at the same <lb/>
            time; but this is the greatest, and follows that revolution of <lb/>
            the universe at that period, when a turn occurs contrary to <lb/>
            the present state of things.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. What?</p>
          <p>Guest. The period of life, which each animal then had, this <lb/>
            was first arrested in all; and all that was mortal ceased to be <lb/>
            seen advancing to old age, but changing back to the contrary, <lb/>
            grew, as it were, younger and more delicate. The white <lb/>
            hairs too of older people became black, and the cheeks of those <lb/>
            that had beards becoming smooth, brought back each person <lb/>
            to the past blooming period of life. The bodies likewise of <lb/>
            such as were in manhood's prime, becoming smoother and <lb/>
            smaller each day and night, returned again to the nature of a <lb/>
            newly-born child, and were assimilated to this nature, both in <lb/>
            soul and body; and thenceforth wasting away, disappeared in <lb/>
            reality entirely ;62 and the corpses of those, who died at that <lb/>
            time through violence, did, through undergoing the self­ <lb/>
            same fate, become in a manner unseen, and in a few days, <lb/>
            quite putrid.62</p>
          <p>[15.] Soc.jun. But what was then, 0 guest, the gener­ <lb/>
            ation of animals, and in what manner were they produced <lb/>
            from each other?</p>
          <p>Guest. It is evident, Socrates, that at that time there was <lb/>
            no generation of one thing from another; but, it is said, there <lb/>
            was once an earth-born race; this was at that period restored <lb/>
            back again from out the earth; and the tradition of it was <lb/>
            remembered by our first progenitors, who were close upon the <lb/>
            revolution (that reached to) the period next in order, and were <note type="footnote"> 62—62 Ficinus offers a remarkable variation here. " Cadavera præterea <lb/>
            illorum, qui cœlestis mutatione vertiginis subito corruerunt, idem pati­ <lb/>
            untur, et simili retrogressione clam ac brevi putrescunt," and such in fact <lb/>
            is what the context requires; where the mention of violence in the pre­ <lb/>
            sent Greek text is scarcely intelligible. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="213"/>
            born at the beginning of the present state of things. For they <lb/>
            became the heralds to us of those accounts, which are at pre­ <lb/>
            sent disbelieved improperly by the multitude. For I think <lb/>
            we ought to reflect together on the consequence. For from <lb/>
            the fact of old men coming to the nature of boys, it follows,63 <lb/>
            64that of such as were dead, but (not) laid in the earth, the <lb/>
            corpses would be put together and made to revive 64 by the turn <lb/>
            of production revolving in a contrary direction ; and that the <lb/>
            earth-born race would, according to this method 65 being neces­ <lb/>
            sarily produced, have their name and speech, except such as a <lb/>
            deity conveyed (elsewhere), or invested with another fate.66</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. This really follows from what has been said above. <lb/>
            But with respect to the life, which you say was under the rule <lb/>
            of Kronos (Saturn), did it subsist in those revolutions, or in <lb/>
            these ? For it is evident that the change in the position of the <lb/>
            stars and the sun coincides with both these revolutions.</p>
          <p>Guest. You have followed well the discourse. But, in <lb/>
            answer to your question respecting all things being produced <lb/>
            spontaneously for mankind, this by no means is the case in <lb/>
            the present revolution; but it occurred in the former. For <lb/>
            then the deity was at first the ruler and guardian of the whole <lb/>
            revolving circle; just as now the parts of the world are lo­ <lb/>
            cally distributed by gods ruling in the very same way. Divine <lb/>
            dæmons, too, had a share, after the manner of shepherds, in <lb/>
            animals according to genera and herds, each being sufficient <lb/>
            for all things pertaining to the several particulars over which <note type="footnote"> 63 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐχόμενον</foreign>, Stalbaum suggests <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπόμενον</foreign>, to which he was <lb/>

              he presided; so that there was nothing of a wild nature, no <lb/>
              eating of each other, no war, nor sedition of any kind; and <lb/>
              ten thousand other things might be stated, which follow upon <lb/>
              such an arrangement. But what is said respecting the spon­ <lb/>
              taneous life of these men, has been stated on this account. <lb/>
              The deity himself tended them, and was their protector; just <lb/>
              as men now, being an animal more divine than others,67 tend <lb/>
              other races meaner than themselves; and as he tended them, <lb/>
              there were no forms of state or polity, nor a property in <lb/>
              women and children; for all these were restored to life from <lb/>
              the earth, and had no recollection of former events.68 But <lb/>
              all such things were absent; they had however fruit in <lb/>
              abundance from oaks, and many other trees, not grown by <lb/>
              land tilling, but given spontaneously by the earth. They <lb/>
              lived, too, for the most part naked, upon no strewed couch, and <lb/>
              in the open air; for the temperament of the seasons was not <lb/>
              painful to them; theirs were soft beds of grass, springing up <lb/>
              without grudging from the earth. And thus, Socrates, you <lb/>
              hear what was the life of men under Kronos (Saturn) : but <lb/>
              you, being present yourself, perceive what is life now, which <lb/>
              is said to be under Zeus (Jupiter). But are you able and <lb/>
              willing likewise to judge which of these is the happier ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. By no means.</p>
          <p>Guest. Do you wish then that I should, after a fashion, <lb/>
            judge for you ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>[16.] Guest. If then those nurtured by Kronos (Saturn), when <lb/>
            they had so much leisure and the power to converse not only <lb/>
            with men, but with brutes likewise, had used all these means for <lb/>
            the purposes of philosophy, associating with brutes and with <lb/>
            each other, and inquiring of every nature which had a per­ <lb/>
            ceptive power of its own, in what respect it differed from the <lb/>
            rest for the collecting together of prudence, it is easy to judge <lb/>
            that the men of that time were ten thousand-fold happier than <lb/>
            those of the present. But if, being filled to satiety with meats <note type="footnote"> 67 I have adopted <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑτέρων</foreign>, found in one MS., in preference to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕτερον</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 68 On the other hand Plato, in the Meno and Phædo, says that man's <lb/>

            and drinks, they discoursed with each other, and with brutes, <lb/>
            in fables69 such as are now told of them, it is easy, according to <lb/>
            my opinion, to prove the very same70 thing. Let us, however, <lb/>
            dismiss this question, until some one shall appear sufficient to <lb/>

            what reason we have raised up the fable, in order that we <lb/>
            may after this proceed onwards.71 For when the time of all <lb/>
            these was completed, and it was necessary for a change to take <lb/>
            place, and moreover when the whole race on earth was already <lb/>
            consumed, 72and every soul had given up its generations, and <lb/>
            as many seeds as were ordained for each soul, it having fallen <lb/>

              his own place of a look-out; and then Fate and implanted De­ <lb/>
              sire again caused the world to revolve. All the gods then, who <lb/>
              govern locally, in conjunction with the greatest divinity, know­ <lb/>
              ing what was now taking place, again deprived the parts of <lb/>
              the world of their providential care. But the world having un­ <lb/>
              dergone a change in its revolution, conflicting73 and rushing <lb/>
              with the contrary impulse of a beginning and end, and pro­ <lb/>
              ducing in itself a mighty concussion, worked out again another <lb/>
              destruction of all kinds of animals. After this, when a suf­ <lb/>
              ficient time had gone on, the world ceasing from tumult, con­ <lb/>
              fusion, and concussions, did, taking advantage of a calm, <lb/>
              proceed, arranged most beautifully74 in its usual course, pos­ <lb/>
              sessing a guardianship and dominion itself over the things in <lb/>
              itself and belonging to itself; (and) remembering, to the <lb/>
              utmost of its power, the instructions of the demiurgus and <lb/>
              father. Now at the commencement it performed this duty <lb/>
              more carefully, but at the end more obtusely. But the cause <lb/>
              of this is in the corporeal form of the temperature, which <lb/>
              had grown up75 with its former nature; since it partook of <lb/>
              much disorder,76 before it arrived at its present orderly ar­ <lb/>
              rangement. For from him, who put it together, it obtained <lb/>
              every good; but from its previous habit, whatever harshness <lb/>
              and injustice exist in heaven, these it does both possess <lb/>
              itself from that former habit, and introduce likewise into <lb/>
              animals. In conjunction then with the ruler, the world, when <lb/>
              nourishing the animals within it, brings forth evil of a small <lb/>

              departure; but as time goes on, and oblivion comes on it, the <lb/>
              circumstance of its former unfitness domineers with greater <lb/>
              force; and at the concluding period of time it bursts out into <lb/>

              the world, perceiving it in difficulties, and anxious lest, being <lb/>
              thus tempest-tost, it should be thoroughly loosened by the <lb/>
              hurly-burly, and be plunged into the infinite sea78 of dissimili­ <lb/>
              tude, again seats himself at the helm ; and whatever is labour­ <lb/>
              ing and loosened 79 in its own former period, he having turned <lb/>
              arranges, and by putting straight, renders the world free from <lb/>
              death and old age. This then is (one) end of the whole story. <lb/>
              But this is sufficient to show, from what has been said, the na­ <lb/>
              ture of a king to such, as lay hold of the discourse. For the <lb/>
              world having been again turned to the present path of genera­ <lb/>
              tion, its age was again stopped, and it imparted novel things, the <lb/>
              contrary to what it had done formerly. For animals, wanting but <lb/>
              little to be through their small size annihilated, are increased; <lb/>
              and hoary bodies recently born from the earth, dying again, <lb/>
              descend into the earth ; and all other things are changed, <lb/>
              imitating and following the condition of the universe. The <lb/>
              imitation, likewise, of conception, generation, and nourishing, <lb/>
              followed all things from necessity. For it was no longer <lb/>
              possible for an animal to be produced in the earth, through the <lb/>
              different things, which compose it; but, as the world was or­ <lb/>
              dained to be the absolute ruler of its own progress, so after the <note type="footnote"> evil that bursts out into full strength; and aptly compares Æsch. Pers. <lb/>

              have been corrupted antecedent to the time of Eusebius, who in Præpar. <lb/>
              Evang. xi. 34, quotes it nearly as it is found here. </note> <lb/>

              same manner its parts also were destined by a similar guid­ <lb/>
              ance to spring forth,80 generate, and nourish, as far as they <lb/>
              were able. But we have now arrived at the very question for <lb/>
              the sake of which the whole of our discourse has proceeded. <lb/>
              For, with respect to other beasts, many circumstances, and of <lb/>
              a prolix nature, might be gone through; such as, from what <lb/>
              each is, and through what cause they have been changed; <lb/>
              but those relating to man are shorter, and more to our <lb/>
              purpose. For mankind having become destitute of the <lb/>
              guardian care of the daemon, who possesses and tends us, <lb/>
              while the majority of animals, that were naturally cruel, have <lb/>
              on the other hand become savage, men, now weak, and with­ <lb/>
              out a guard, were torn in pieces by such animals; and, in <lb/>
              those earliest times, they were without inventions and arts; <lb/>
              for after the earth had failed in its spontaneous food, they did <lb/>
              not know how to procure it, through no want having previ­ <lb/>
              ously compelled them (to get it). From all these causes they <lb/>
              were in the greatest difficulties. Hence, the old-mentioned gifts <lb/>
              were given us by gods, together with the necessary instruc­ <lb/>
              tion and erudition ;81 fire from Prometheus, and arts from He­ <lb/>
              phæstus (Vulcan), and his fellow-artist (Pallas) ; on the other <lb/>
              hand, seeds and plants were given by others, and all such things <lb/>
              as furnish a support for human life, were produced from these ; <lb/>
              since, as was stated just now, the guardian care of the gods <lb/>
              had deserted mankind; and it became requisite for men to <lb/>
              have the conduct and care of themselves, in the same manner <lb/>
              as the whole world; in the imitating and following which, <lb/>
              through all the revolutions of time, we live and are born, <lb/>
              now in this way, and now in that. Let this then be the end <lb/>
              of the story. But we will make it useful for discovering how <lb/>
              far we have erred in defining the characters of a king and <lb/>
              statesman in our previous discourse.</p>
          <p>[17.] Soc.jun. In what respect then, and how far, do you <lb/>

          <p>Guest. 82Partly less, and partly in a very generous man­ <lb/>
            ner, and in a greater degree, and more than before.82</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. How?</p>
          <p>Guest. Because, when we were asked respecting a king <lb/>
            and a statesman belonging to the present revolution and ge­ <lb/>
            neration, we spoke of a person tending a human herd of the <lb/>
            contrary period, and this too a god, and not a man. In this <lb/>
            then we transgressed very much. But when we exhibited him <lb/>
            as the ruler of the whole state, we did not say in what man­ <lb/>
            ner (he was so); and in this respect the truth was told, but <lb/>
            not the whole (truth), nor was it clearly enunciated; hence <lb/>
            we erred less in this case than in that.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. True.</p>
          <p>Guest. We ought then, it seems, to expect that the states­ <lb/>
            man will have been completely described by us, when we shall <lb/>
            have defined the manner of governing a state.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. Very well.</p>
          <p>Guest. On this account we have brought forward the story, <lb/>
            in order that (one)83 might show, with respect to the herd- <lb/>
            tending, not only that all contend about it with the person now <lb/>
            sought for; but that we might more clearly perceive him, whom <lb/>
            alone it is fitting, according to the pattern of shepherds and <lb/>
            neat-herds, to have the tending of the human herd, and alone <lb/>
            worthy to be called by that name.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Right.</p>
          <p>Guest. But I think, Socrates, that this figure of a divine <lb/>
            shepherd is still greater than becomes a king; and that the <lb/>
            statesmen now existing here are much more like subjects in <lb/>
            their nature, and take more nearly a share in discipline and <lb/>
            nurture.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. But they will have to be investigated neither more <lb/>
            nor less, whether they are naturally in this position or in <lb/>
            that.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Let us then turn back again. For we said, that <note type="footnote"> 82—82 Ficinus has, " Partim minus, partim generosius magisque, et <lb/>
            plus quam tunc erratum," which is a far more elegant collocation of <lb/>
            words than the Greek is at present. </note><note type="footnote"> 83 I have inserted " one " answering to <foreign xml:lang="grc">τις</foreign>, which has evidently dropt <lb/>
            out after <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνδείξαιτο</foreign>: that would otherwise want its nominative. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="220"/>
            there was a self-commanding art respecting animals, which <lb/>
            took care of them, not privately, but in common; and this art <lb/>
            we then straightway called the herd-tending art. Do you <lb/>
            recollect ?</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. Yes.</p>
          <p>Guest. In this then we erred. For we have not by any <lb/>
            means laid hold of the statesman, nor given him a name; but <lb/>
            as regards the appellation, it has lain hid from and escaped us.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How so ?</p>
          <p>Guest. To tend the several kinds of herds belongs to all <lb/>
            other herdsmen; but we have not given a fitting name to the <lb/>
            statesman, it being requisite for him to bear one of those <lb/>
            common to all.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. You speak the truth, if indeed there happens to be <lb/>
            (a common one).84</p>
          <p>Guest. But how is it not possible to apply the word healing, <lb/>
            as something common to all, neither tending nor any other <lb/>
            occupation being stated ? and if 85it is lawful for persons giv­ <lb/>
            in- a name (to an art) to wrap it up (in words like) herd-tend­ <lb/>
            ing, or healing in any way, as being applicable generally, (it <lb/>
            is lawful to wrap up) the word statesman likewise85 together <lb/>
            with others, especially since reason shows that this should <lb/>
            (be done) ?</p>
          <p>[18.] Soc. jun. Right. But after this in what manner <lb/>
            would the division be made ?</p>
          <p>Guest. In the same manner, as we before divided the <lb/>
            herd-tending art for the walking and wingless86 tribes, and for <lb/>
            the unmixed and hornless, in the very same manner by divid­ <lb/>
            ing the herd-tending, we shall have comprehended both the <lb/>
            present kingly rule and that in the time of Kronos (Saturn) <lb/>
            similarly in our discourse. <note type="footnote"> 84 Heusde was the first to see that something was wanting after <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴπερ <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Soc.jun. It appears so. But I am seeking what (will be) <lb/>
            after this.87</p>
          <p>Guest. It is plain that if the word herd-tending had been <lb/>
            thus spoken, no one would have contended with us that there <lb/>
            is no idea whatever of attention in it; as it was then justly <lb/>
            contended, that there is no art amongst us which deserves the <lb/>
            appellation of tending; and that if there were, it belongs to <lb/>
            many things prior and preferable to any thing pertaining to <lb/>
            kings.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Right.</p>
          <p>Guest. 88 But no other art would be willing to say that it is <lb/>
            more and before kingly rule, as a careful tending of the whole <lb/>
            of human fellowship, and of men taken generally.88</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. You say rightly.</p>
          <p>Guest. But after this, Socrates, do you perceive that an error <lb/>
            has been made frequently towards the very end ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Of what kind ?</p>
          <p>Guest. In this, that though we have conceived that there <lb/>
            is a certain rearing art of a biped herd, we ought not any <lb/>
            more to have straightway called it, as if entirely complete, the <lb/>
            art of the king and statesman.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. Why not?</p>
          <p>Guest. In the first place, as we said, we (ought) to have <lb/>
            suited the name more to guardianship than to nutriment: and <lb/>
            in the next place, to make a division in this (guardianship). <lb/>
            For it will have no small divisions.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Of what kind ?</p>
          <p>Guest. In that we can surely place apart the divine <lb/>
            shepherd, and the human guardian.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Right. <note type="footnote"> 87 Ficinus has merely " Videtur; sed quid turn ? " </note><note type="footnote"> 88—88 Such according to Stalbaum is the version of the Greek, where <lb/>
            he would adopt <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρτέρα</foreign>, found in Stobæus, ed. Trincavell., in lieu of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρᾳοτέρα</foreign>, and support <foreign xml:lang="grc">μα̃λλον</foreign> Kai <foreign xml:lang="grc">πο̧οτέρα</foreign> by <foreign xml:lang="grc">μα̃ καὶ τίς σφρο­ <lb/>
            δροτέο̦</foreign> in Phileb. p. 41, C. But the syntax and the sense appear to me <lb/>
            equally objectionable. Instead, then, of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐθελήσειεν έτέρα μα̃λλον καὶ</foreign> <lb/>
            7rpaoTspa I should prefer—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐθελήσειεν εὐνουστέο̧α μα̃λλον καὶ πρᾳοτέρα</foreign>, <lb/>
            i. e. " more kindly disposed and more mild." Ficinus has—“ Nulla vero <lb/>
            ars alia de hoc contendit, quasi sit totius humanæ communionis curatio <lb/>
            major mitiorque regia," thus omitting entirely the concluding words of <lb/>
            the speech, either because they were not in his MS., or because, like <lb/>
            myself, he could not understand them. </note> <pb n="222"/>
            </p>
          <p>Guest. And again it is necessary to cut into two the dis­ <lb/>
            tributed89 guardianship.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Into what?</p>
          <p>Guest. Into the violent and the voluntary.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. What then ?</p>
          <p>Guest. By erring before in this more stupidly than was <lb/>
            fitting, we put down together a king and a tyrant as the same; <lb/>
            although they are most dissimilar both in themselves and in <lb/>
            their form of government respectively.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. True.</p>
          <p>Guest. Now therefore, again correcting ourselves, let us, <lb/>
            as I have already said, divide human guardianship into the <lb/>
            violent and the voluntary.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. And calling the guardianship by the violent tyran­ <lb/>
            nic, but the voluntary, 90[and the herd-tending of voluntary <lb/>
            biped animals,]90 statesmanship, let us show, that he who pos­ <lb/>
            sesses this [art and]91 guardianship is truly a king and a <lb/>
            statesman.</p>
          <p>[19.] Soc.jun. And thus the demonstration, 0 guest, re­ <lb/>
            specting the statesman, is very like to appear to us as being <lb/>
            perfect.</p>
          <p rend="script">Guest. This would be well for us, Socrates. But it is <lb/>
            requisite that this should appear not only to you, but likewise <lb/>

            pelled to use a greater portion of it than was proper. On this <lb/>
            account, we have made a rather prolix demonstration, and <lb/>
            have not entirely finished the fable. But our discourse really <lb/>
            appears somewhat like an animal, to have its outline defined <lb/>
            sufficiently, but to have not received the distinctness given by <lb/>
            pigments, and the mixture of colours. But it is more becom­ <lb/>
            ing to exhibit every animal by a description, to such as are <lb/>
            able to follow the account,92 than by painting, and all the <lb/>
            work of hand; but to other persons through works of the <lb/>
            hand.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. This indeed (is said rightly) : but show me why <lb/>
            you say you have not yet spoken sufficiently.</p>
          <p>Guest. It is difficult, 0 divine youth, to exhibit great <lb/>
            things sufficiently, without using patterns. For each of us <lb/>
            appear to know all things as in a night-dream, and again to <lb/>
            be ignorant of all things according to a day-dream.93</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How said you this?</p>
          <p>Guest. We appear in the present case to have mooted very <lb/>
            absurdly the circumstance relating to the knowledge (which <lb/>
            is) in us.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How so ?</p>
          <p>Guest. The pattern, 0 blessed one, has required itself <lb/>
            again a pattern.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. What ? Tell me, and do not, on my account at <lb/>
            least, hesitate.</p>
          <p>[20.] Guest. I must speak, since you are ready to follow. <lb/>
            For we know, that children know their letters.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. What?</p>
          <p>Guest. That they understand sufficiently each of the <lb/>
            letters in the shortest and easiest syllables, and are able to <lb/>
            speak the truth concerning them. <note type="footnote"> 92 I have translated this passage as if <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ</foreign> (or rather <foreign xml:lang="grc">γε</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγῳ</foreign> were <lb/>

          <p>Guest. But, being on the other hand doubtful about those <lb/>
            in other syllables, they say what is false in idea and word.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Is it not then the easiest and the best thing to lead <lb/>
            them thus to what is not yet known ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How ?</p>
          <p>Guest. By first leading them back to those things, in which <lb/>
            they had correct ideas respecting those very same matters; <lb/>
            and after leading them, to place before them things not yet <lb/>
            known; and by comparing them together, to show that there <lb/>
            is the same likeness 94 and nature in both the combinations, till <lb/>
            the things conceived, having been compared with all the <lb/>
            unknown, are shown correctly; and, after being shown and <lb/>
            becoming thus patterns, cause each one of all the letters in <lb/>
            all the syllables to be called one different, and another the <lb/>
            same, as being always under the same circumstances, differ­ <lb/>
            ent and the same (respectively).</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. This then we sufficiently comprehend, that the pro­ <lb/>
            duction of a pattern then takes place, when that, which is the <lb/>
            same, is, in the case of another thing placed apart, rightly con­ <lb/>
            ceived by opinion, and being brought together to it, produces <lb/>
            one true opinion respecting either, as it did about both.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Shall we then wonder, if our soul, suffering naturally <lb/>
            the same thing respecting the elements of all things, does at <lb/>
            one time stand firm in certain points under the influence of <lb/>
            truth respecting each individual thing, and at another time <lb/>
            fluctuates in other points respecting all things ? and that when, <lb/>
            (as regards) some (elements) of comminglings, it thinks <lb/>
            rightly, it should somehow or another again be ignorant of <lb/>
            these very same things, when they are transferred to long and <lb/>

          <p>Guest. But 96 how, my friend, can any one, beginning from <lb/>
            false opinion, arrive at even a small portion of truth, and thus <lb/>
            acquire wisdom ?</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. Nearly not at all.</p>
          <p>Guest. If then these things are naturally in this way, you <lb/>
            and I shall not in any respect overdo it, if, by first endeavour­ <lb/>
            ing to perceive the nature of the whole pattern in some other <lb/>
            small and partial one, and after this,97 by transferring to the <lb/>
            nature of a king, which is the greatest of all patterns, the <lb/>
            same species, from lesser things from some quarter, we shall <lb/>
            be about to endeavour again, through a pattern, to know by <lb/>
            art the care of state affairs,97 so that there may be a day-dream <lb/>
            instead of a night one.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Perfectly right.</p>
          <p>Guest. Again then let us take up the preceding reasoning, <lb/>
            that since ten thousand persons contend with the kingly genus, <lb/>
            respecting the guardianship of a state, it is requisite to separ­ <lb/>
            ate all these, and to leave it by itself. And for this purpose <lb/>
            we said we have need of some pattern.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. And very much so.</p>
          <p>[21.] Guest. By producing then what pattern, which em­ <lb/>
            braces an occupation similar to statesmanship, 98 and is the <lb/>
            smallest possible,98 could one sufficiently find the thing sought <lb/>

              may happen, that even this portion being chosen will witness <lb/>

            ting the parts, each of them separate, done the very same <lb/>
            thing now in the case of the weaving art? and why, after <lb/>
            passing over all things to the best of our power in the short­ <lb/>
            est manner possible, have we not come to what is useful at <lb/>
            present ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How say you?</p>
          <p>Guest. I will make the digression itself an answer.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. You speak most excellently.</p>
          <p>Guest. Of all the things which we fabricate and possess, <lb/>
            some are for the sake of our doing something, and others are <lb/>
            defences against our not suffering. And of these defences some <lb/>
            are medicinal, both divine and human; others are protective. <lb/>
            And of the protective, some are warlike implements, others <lb/>
            (peaceful) defences. And of the (peaceful) defences, some <lb/>
            are veils, others are to ward off heat and cold. And of those <lb/>
            that ward off, some cover at a distance, others near. And of <lb/>
            the near, some are extended under, others around. And of <lb/>
            those extended around, some are cut as a whole piece, others <lb/>
            put together. And of those put together, soma are perfor­ <lb/>
            ated, others are bound together, not perforated. And of those <lb/>
            that are not perforated, some are composed of the fibres of the <lb/>
            plants of the earth, others are hairy. And of the hairy, some <lb/>
            are conglutinated by water and earth, others are connected <lb/>
            themselves with themselves. Now to these defences and cover­ <lb/>
            ings, which are wrought from the things bound together, them­ <lb/>
            selves with themselves, we give the name of dress. And let <lb/>
            us call the art, which is especially conversant with dresses, <lb/>
            dress-making, from the thing itself; in the same manner as we <lb/>
            called above the art respecting a state, statesmanship. And <lb/>
            let us say too, that the weaving art, so far as it weaves for <lb/>
            the most part garments, differs in nothing but the name from <lb/>
            the dress-making art; just as (we said) there, that the king-art <lb/>
            (differed only nominally) from statesmanship.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Most correctly.</p>
          <p>Guest. After this let us reason (thus), that some one may <lb/>
             <pb n="227"/>
            perhaps think that the weaving art relating to dresses has been <lb/>
            thus defined sufficiently, he being unable to perceive that it <lb/>
            is not yet distinguished from its proximate co-operators, but <lb/>
            is separated from many other things of a kindred nature.</p>
          <p>[22.] Soc. jun. Tell me what things of a kindred nature.</p>
          <p>Guest. You have not followed what has been said, as it <lb/>
            seems.99 It appears, therefore, that we must return from <lb/>
            the end to the beginning. For, if you understand affinity, <lb/>
            we have now separated this from that, by separating the com­ <lb/>
            position of coverings into things put under, and around.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. I understand you.</p>
          <p>Guest. We have likewise separated every kind of manufac­ <lb/>
            ture from flax and hemp, and all such things as we just now <lb/>
            described in the list of the fibres of plants. We also defined the <lb/>
            art of making a felt-like substance, and the putting together <lb/>
            by means of perforation and sewing, which for the most part <lb/>
            pertains to the cobler's art.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. We have also separated the care 100 bestowed on the <lb/>
            coblcr's art relating to coverings cut in the whole piece, and <lb/>
            of such as are employed in building, and in the whole of the <lb/>
            carpenter's art, and in all others that are employed in stop­ <lb/>
            ping the flowing of water, and such arts too of (peaceful) <lb/>
            defences as furnish works to be an impediment to thieving <lb/>
            and to acts of violence, and which are employed about the <lb/>
            production of obstacles and the fixing of doors, and are dis­ <lb/>
            tributed as parts of the bolt-making art. We have likewise <lb/>
            divided the armour-making art, which is a section of the great <lb/>
            and varied power of defence-making. We also defined, in <lb/>
            the very beginning, the whole art of quackery, which is con­ <lb/>
            versant with medicines ; and we left, so that we might seem <lb/>
            (to be),' the very art defensive against storms, of which we <note type="footnote"> 99 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς φαίνει</foreign>, one would prefer, as Taylor translated, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς <lb/>

            are in search, and which produces woollen vestments, and is <lb/>
            called the art of weaving.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. It seems so.</p>
          <p>Guest. But this matter, 0 boy, has not been perfectly <lb/>
            detailed. For he, who first engaged in the making of <lb/>
            garments, appeared to act in a manner directly contrary to <lb/>
            weaving.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. How so?</p>
          <p>Guest. For the work of weaving is a certain knitting to­ <lb/>
            gether.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. It is.</p>
          <p>Guest. But the work (of the garment-maker) consists in <lb/>
            loosening things put together, and felted together.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. What kind of work is this ?</p>
          <p>Guest. The work of the art of the wool-carder. Or shall <lb/>
            we dare to call the art of wool-carding the weaving art, and <lb/>
            a wool-carder a weaver ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. By no means.</p>
          <p>Guest. But if any one should call the art of making the <lb/>
            warp and woof the weaving art, would he not assert a para­ <lb/>
            dox, and give it a false name ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. But whether shall we say that the whole of the fuller's <lb/>
            and the mender's art contribute nothing to the attention to and <lb/>
            care of garments ? Or shall we call all these weaving arts ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. By no means.</p>
          <p>Guest. But all these contend with the power of the weaving <lb/>
            art, respecting the care and the production of garments; at­ <lb/>
            tributing, indeed, to it the greatest part, but likewise assign­ <lb/>
            in- to themselves great portions of the same art.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Besides these, it further appears requisite, that the <lb/>
            handicraft arts, relating to the instruments through which the <lb/>
            works of the weaver are performed, should lay claim to be <lb/>
            co-causes of all weaving.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. Most right.</p>
          <p>Guest. Whether then will our discourse about the weaving <lb/>
            art, a part of which we have chosen, be sufficiently defined, if <lb/>
            we lay it down that it is the most beautiful and the greatest <lb/>
            of all the arts, which are employed about woollen garments ? <lb/>
            Or shall we thus, indeed, speak something of the truth, but <lb/>
             <pb n="229"/>
            yet neither clcarly nor perfectly, till we have separated all <lb/>
            these arts from it ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Correctly.</p>
          <p>[23.] Guest. Must we not then after this so act, that, what <lb/>
            we say, may proceed in an orderly series ?</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. In the first place then let us consider two arts, which <lb/>
            exist about all things.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. What are they ?</p>
          <p>Guest. One is the co-cause of generation, and the other is <lb/>
            the cause itself.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How?</p>
          <p>Guest. Such arts, as do not fabricate the thing itself, but <lb/>
            prepare instruments for the fabricating (arts), without the pre­ <lb/>
            sence of which the proposed work could not be effected 2 by <lb/>
            each of the arts,2 these are co-causes: but those, which fabri­ <lb/>
            cate the thing itself, are causes.3</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. This is reasonable.</p>
          <p>Guest. In the next place, those arts which produce the dis­ <lb/>

            to the making of garments, all these are co-causes : 4 but <lb/>
            those which pay attention to and fabricate garments, causes.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. Most right.</p>
          <p>Guest. But of causes, it is reasonable to comprehend that <lb/>
            portion of itS especially, which pertains to washing and mend­ <lb/>
            ing, and all the caring about these, since the adorning art is <lb/>
            abundant, and to denominate the whole the fuller's art.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. It will so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Moreover, the carding and spinning, and all that re­ <lb/>
            lates to the making of the garment, of which we are detailing <lb/>
            the parts, is one art, called by all persons the wool-working.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. How not ? <note type="footnote"> 2—2 These words are omitted by Ficinus. They are evidently unne­ <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Guest. Of the wool-working there are two sections, and <lb/>
            each of these are together naturally parts of two arts.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. How ?</p>
          <p>Guest. The carding, and the half of that which uses the <lb/>
            shuttle, and separates from each other whatever are placed <lb/>
            together, all this in short is a part of the wool-working art; <lb/>
            and there were two great parts as regards the whole, one com­ <lb/>
            mingling, and the other separating.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. Yes.</p>
          <p>Guest. Of the separating then, both the carding and all those <lb/>
            just now mentioned are a part. For that, which in the case of <lb/>
            the wool and thread is the separating art, takes place, after one <lb/>
            manner with the shuttle, and after another with the hands, has <lb/>
            the names which we have just now mentioned.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Again, let us take a part of the commingling, and of <lb/>
            the wool-working contained in it; but let us pass by all that <lb/>
            was there relating to the separating, and let us bisect the <lb/>
            wool-working (art) together into the commingling and se­ <lb/>
            parating section.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. Let it be so divided.</p>
          <p>Guest. We must then, Socrates, divide the commingling. <lb/>
            and at the same time the wool-working, if we are about <lb/>
            to comprehend sufficiently the proposed weaving art.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. It will be requisite.</p>
          <p>Guest. It will indeed ; and let us say, that one part of it is <lb/>
            twisting, and the other complicating.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Do I then understand you ? For you appear to <lb/>
            me to say that the working of the thread is twisting.</p>
          <p>Guest. Not the working of this only, but likewise of the <lb/>
            woof.6 Or shall we find any production of it which is not <lb/>
            twisting ?</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. By no means.</p>
          <p>Guest. Define also each of these : for perhaps the definition <lb/>
            will be suitable.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. In what way ?</p>
          <p>Guest. In this. We say that of the operations of wool- <note type="footnote"> 6 As I am not a learned weaver, and do not know the words in English <lb/>
            corresponding to the Greek, I must refer the reader, who wishes for the full­ <lb/>

            carding, that which has been drawn out into length and pos­ <lb/>
            sesses breadth, is a certain filament.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. We do.</p>
          <p>Guest. And of this, when it is turned by the spindle, and <lb/>
            becomes a solid thread, do thou call a stamen; but the art, <lb/>
            which regulates it, let us say that this is stamen-weaving.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Right.</p>
          <p>Guest. But such fabrics as receive a loose twisting, and, by <lb/>
            the infolding of the stamen through the dragging of the knap­ <lb/>
            ping process, acquire a moderate softness, of these we call <lb/>
            what is spun the woof, but the art itself which presides over <lb/>
            these, woof-spinning.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Most right.</p>
          <p>Guest. And now that part of the weaving art, which we <lb/>
            have brought forward, is obvious to every one. For, with <lb/>
            respect to a part of the commingling art in wool-working, <lb/>
            when it accomplishes that, which is woven by a straight- <lb/>
            knitting together of the woof and the thread, then the whole <lb/>
            of the thing woven we call a woollen garment, but the art <lb/>
            (presiding) over it, weaving.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Most right.</p>
          <p>[24.] Guest. Be it so. But why then did we not immedi­ <lb/>
            ately answer, that the weaving (art) is that which infolds the <lb/>
            woof and the thread, instead of proceeding in a round-about <lb/>
            way, and defining many things in vain ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. It does not appear to me, 0 guest, that of what <lb/>
            has been said a single thing has been said in vain.</p>
          <p>Guest. This is not at all wonderful. But perhaps, 0 <lb/>
            blessed youth, it will appear so. But against such a disorder, <lb/>
            should it hereafter by chance7 come upon you—8 for nothing <lb/>
            is wonderful8—hear a certain discourse, proper to be spoken <lb/>
            about all such things as these.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Only relate it.</p>
          <p>Guest. Let us then in the first place look into the whole of <lb/>
            excess and deficiency, in order that we may praise and blame <note type="footnote"> 7 Here, as in § 8, n. 32, Stalbaum translates <foreign xml:lang="grc">πολλάκις</foreign> " by chance." <lb/>

            according to reason whatever is said on each occasion at <lb/>
            greater length, or the contrary, than is becoming in disputa­ <lb/>
            tions of this kind.</p>
          <p>• Soc. jun. It will be proper so to do.</p>
          <p>Guest. Our discourse taking place on these points, would, <lb/>
            I think, take place rightly.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. About what things?</p>
          <p>Guest. About length and shortness, and the whole of ex­ <lb/>
            cess and deficiency. For the art of measuring is conversant <lb/>
            with all these.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. It is.</p>
          <p>Guest. Let us divide it then into two parts. For it is <lb/>
            necessary for that, to which we are hastening.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Inform me how this division (is to be made).</p>
          <p>Guest. Thus. One part according to the ideas relating in <lb/>
            common to great and little, but the other part according to <lb/>
            the necessary existence of production.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. How say you ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Does it not appear to you to be according to nature, <lb/>
            that we ought to speak of the greater as being greater than <lb/>
            nothing else but the lesser ? and on the other hand of the <lb/>
            lesser, as being lesser than the greater, but nothing else ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. To me it does.</p>
          <p>Guest. But what, must we not say that, what surpasses <lb/>
            the nature of moderation, and is surpassed by it, whether in <lb/>
            words or actions, is, when produced in reality, that by which <lb/>
            the good and bad of us differ the most from each other ?</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Guest. These twofold existences then and judgments re­ <lb/>
            specting the great and the small we must lay down ; but not, <lb/>
            as we just now said, with reference to each other only; but, <lb/>
            as is just now said, we must speak of one as being referable9 <lb/>
            to each other, but of the other (as referable) to moderation. <lb/>
            Are we however willing to learn on what account this is <lb/>
            requisite ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. If any one admits the nature of the greater (to <note type="footnote"> 9 After <foreign xml:lang="grc">δει̃ν</foreign> Heindorf wished to insert <foreign xml:lang="grc">εί̃ναι</foreign> ; and so does Stalbaum. <lb/>

            be referable)10 to nothing but the lesser, it will not be (refer­ <lb/>
            able) to moderation. Will it?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. (It will be) thus.</p>
          <p>Guest. Shall' we not then destroy the arts themselves, and <lb/>
            all their works, according to this reasoning ? And shall we <lb/>
            not cause to disappear entirely the statesman's science, which <lb/>
            we are now investigating, and that which is called the weav­ <lb/>
            ing art? For all such things as these guard against that, <lb/>
            which is more or less than moderation, not as if it had no <lb/>
            existence, but as a thing of a difficult nature in practice; and <lb/>
            after this manner preserving moderation, they effect every <lb/>
            thing beautiful and good.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. If then we cause to disappear the statesman's sci­ <lb/>
            ence, will not our subsequent search of king-science be with­ <lb/>
            out a road ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Very much so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Whether then, as in the Sophist, we compelled non­ <lb/>
            entity to exist, 11 after the discourse about it had fled from us <lb/>
            in that direction, so now we shall compel the more and the <lb/>
            less to become measured, not only with reference to each other, <lb/>
            but likewise to the production of moderation ? For no one <lb/>
            can become indisputably a statesman, or be any person else, <lb/>
            possessing a knowledge relating to actions, if this be not ac­ <lb/>
            knowledged.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. We ought then to do this even now as much as <lb/>
            possible.</p>
          <p>[25.] Guest. This, Socrates, is a still greater work than <lb/>
            that; although we remember how great was its prolixity. <lb/>
            But it is very just to put hypothetically something of this <lb/>
            kind respecting them..</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Of what kind ?</p>
          <p>Guest. That there will be a need of what has been just <lb/>
            stated, for the demonstration of what is accurate respecting <lb/>
            it.12 But as regards the present question, this reasoning is <note type="footnote"> 10 For the sake of perspicuity, Plato must, I think, have written, <foreign xml:lang="grc">έάσει <lb/>

            shown, well and sufficiently, it appears to me, to assist us in <lb/>
            a conspicuous manner, so that' we must think all arts are to <lb/>
            be measured according to something more and at the same <lb/>
            time less, not only with reference to one another, but to the <lb/>
            production likewise of moderation. For when this exists, <lb/>
            they exist also; and when they exist, this exists also; but <lb/>
            when either of these does not exist, neither of those will <lb/>
            exist.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. This indeed is right. But what is there after this ? <lb/>
            Guest. It is evident that we should divide the art of mea­ <lb/>
            suring, as has been said, into two parts; placing as one of <lb/>
            its parts all those arts, which measure number, and length, <lb/>
            and depth, and breadth, and thickness, with reference to the <lb/>
            contrary; but placing as its other part, such arts as regard <lb/>
            the moderate and the becoming, the seasonable and the fit, <lb/>
            and all such as are separated from the extremes towards the <lb/>
            middle (point).</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Each of these sections is great, and they differ <lb/>
            much from each other.</p>
          <p>Guest. That, Socrates, which many clever men, who think <lb/>
            they are saying something wise, sometimes assert, when they <lb/>
            say that the art of measuring is conversant with all generated <lb/>
            natures, that very thing happens to be now asserted by us. <lb/>
            For all things of art do after a certain manner partake of <lb/>
            measure; but, in consequence of not being accustomed to divide <lb/>
            according to species, these men immediately bring together <lb/>
            to the same point things widely differing from each other, and <lb/>
            consider them as similar; and, on the other hand, they do the <lb/>
            very contrary to this, by not dividing according to their parts <lb/>
            things that are different; although it is requisite that when <lb/>
            any one first perceives the communion of many things, he <lb/>
            should not desist till he perceives all the differences in it, <lb/>
            which are placed in species; and again, when the all-various <lb/>
            dissimilitudes in multitudes are perceived, he should not be <lb/>
            able, through a feeling of disgust, to desist *(from this un­ <note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ αύτὸ τοὺ ἀκριβου̃ς ἐπίδειξιν</foreign>, " the demonstration of accuracy re­ <lb/>

          <p>Soc. jun. What is it?</p>
          <p>Guest. If any one should ask us respecting the assembling <lb/>
            together14 of those that learn their letters, when one is asked <lb/>
            of what letters does any word (consist), shall we say that the <lb/>
            inquiry is then made for the sake of the one word proposed, <lb/>
            rather than that of the party becoming more skilful as a gram­ <lb/>
            marian, with respect to every thing placed before him.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Evidently as regards every thing (of grammar). <lb/>
            Guest. Has the inquiry respecting a statesman been pro­ <lb/>
            posed by us more for the sake of the statesman himself, than for <lb/>
            ourselves to become more skilful dialecticians on every point?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. This too is evident, that (it is for ourselves to <lb/>
            become such) on every point.</p>
          <p>Guest. No one indeed endued with intellect would be will­ <lb/>
            ing to hunt out the rationale of the art of weaving, for its own <lb/>
            sake alone. 15 But I think it has lain hid from most men, that <lb/>
            to some things, which are naturally easy to learn, there are <lb/>
            certain similitudes to be perceived by the senses, which it is <lb/>
            not difficult to make manifest, when any one wishes to point <lb/>

            every thing. For incorporeal natures, being the most beauti­ <lb/>
            ful and the greatest, are exhibited by reason alone, and by <lb/>
            nothing else; and it is for this that all has been said now. <lb/>
            But the consideration of every particular occurs more easily <lb/>
            in small things than in great.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. You speak most beautifully.</p>
          <p>Guest. Let us then remember that all these things have <lb/>
            been said by us on this account.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. On what?</p>
          <p>Guest. Not the least on account of the disgust, which we <lb/>
            have felt disgustingly 16 through the prolix discourse about <lb/>
            the weaving art, and about the revolution of the universe, and <lb/>
            that of the sophist about the existence of a non-entity, con­ <lb/>
            ceiving it to have a rather (considerable) length. And on all <lb/>
            these accounts we reproached ourselves, fearing lest we should <lb/>
            speak superfluously in conjunction with prolixity.16 That we <lb/>
            may not then suffer any thing of this kind again, think that on <lb/>
            account of all these things our former remarks have been made.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Be it so. Only say what is in order.17</p>
          <p>Guest. I say then, it is requisite that both you and I <lb/>
            should be mindful of what we have now said, 18 and to give on <lb/>
            each occasion blame and praise of brevity as well as prolixity 18 <note type="footnote"> been less perhaps to object to, as being opposed to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥᾳδίως</foreign>. But even thus <lb/>

          <p>Soc. jun. Right.</p>
          <p>Guest. But yet all things are not (to be referred) to this. <lb/>
            19 For we shall not be in need of prolixity, which, as regards <lb/>
            pleasure, is not all fitting, unless as something of no import­ <lb/>

            been proposed, in order that we may find it most easily, and <lb/>
            quickly, reason bids us regard it as a secondary, not primary ob­ <lb/>
            ject; but to honour the most and in the first place, the method of <lb/>
            being able20 to divide according to species; and to pay a serious <lb/>
            regard to a discourse, if when spoken at great length it renders <lb/>
            the hearer more inventive; and not to take it ill; and in like <lb/>
            manner, if it be shorter. And still, in addition to this, (reason <lb/>
            says) 21 that he who blames long discourses in meetings such as <lb/>
            these, and who does not admit round-about periods, must not <lb/>
            dismiss them altogether, rapidly, and immediately, by abusing <lb/>
            merely what has been spoken at great length, but he must <lb/>
            show moreover that he 22thinks that (words) being shorter22 <lb/>
            would render persons coming together more fitted for dialectics, <lb/>

          <p>Soc.jun. You speak well;' and let us do as you say.</p>
          <p>Guest. Has not then the king been separated from the <lb/>
            majority (of arts), as are fellow-tending, or rather from all <lb/>
            that relate to herds ? But the remaining, we say, (are those) <lb/>
            that (belong to) the co-causes, and causes relating to the state <lb/>
            itself, which we must separate from each other.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Right.</p>
          <p>Guest. You know then that it is difficult to bisect these; <lb/>
            and the reason will, I think, as we advance, be not the less <lb/>
            apparent.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. It will be then meet to do so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Let us then separate them like a victim piecemeal; <lb/>
            since we cannot do so by a bisection: for it is always requisite <lb/>
            to cut into the nearest number possible.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. How then shall we do so at present ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Just as before; for we laid down as co-causes what­ <lb/>
            ever (arts) furnished instruments for weaving.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Yes.</p>
          <p>Guest. The same thing therefore we must do now, and still <lb/>
            more than then. For such arts as fabricate, with regard to a <lb/>
            state instrument, either small or large, we must lay down all <lb/>
            of them as co-causes; since without these a state could not <lb/>
            exist, nor yet statesmanship. But on the other hand we will <lb/>
            not lay down any one of these as the work23 of kingship.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. We will not.</p>
          <p>Guest. And yet we are attempting to do a difficult thing, in <lb/>
            separating this genus from the rest. 24 For if it appears that <lb/>
            he, who says that whatever exists is an instrument of some <lb/>
            one thing, says what is credible, 25 still on the other hand let <lb/>
            us say that there is this thing different from the possessions <lb/>
            in a state.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun.

            duction, but for the safety of that which is fabricated.27</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. What kind of thing ?</p>
          <p>Guest. That thing, which being worked up from materials <lb/>
            dry and moist, 28and exposed to fire, and without fire,28 is a <lb/>
            species of varied kind, which we call by one appellation, a <lb/>
            vessel; and though it is a numerous29 species, it does not I <lb/>
            think belong30 at all to the science we are seeking.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How not?</p>
          <p>Guest. Of these possessions, there is another and third <lb/>
            species very numerous to be looked into, being on land and <lb/>
            in the water, and much-wandering and not-wandering, and <lb/>
            honourable and dishonourable; but possessing one name, be­ <lb/>
            cause the whole of it exists for the sake of a certain sitting, <lb/>
            as becoming always a seat for something.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. What kind of thing is it ?</p>
          <p>Guest. We call it a vehicle, a thing not at all the work <lb/>
            of the statesman's science, but rather more of the carpenter, <lb/>
            potter, and brass-founder.</p>
          <p>[28.] Soc. jun. I understand.</p>
          <p>Guest. What of the fourth (species) ? Must we speak of <lb/>
            one different from these, in which the most of the things for­ <lb/>
            merly mentioned are contained; every kind of dress, the greater <lb/>
            part of arms, and all walls, such as are thrown round, of <lb/>
            earth or stone, and ten thousand other things. And since all <lb/>
            these are constructed for the sake of a protection, the whole <lb/>
            may most justly be called a defence; and may, for the most <lb/>
            part, be considered much more the work of the architect, and <lb/>
            more rightly31 of the weaver, than of the statesman. <note type="footnote"> 26 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ώς</foreign> the train of ideas leads to "0 <foreign xml:lang="grc">γ</foreign>', " Which is—” For <lb/>

            adorning and painting, and such as making use of it (painting) <lb/>
            and music, finish as imitations, fabricated for our pleasure, <lb/>
            and which may be justly comprehended in one name ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. In what name?</p>
          <p>Guest. They may be surely denominated amusement.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How not ? "</p>
          <p>Guest. This one name then will suit, when pronounced, <lb/>
            with all these: for not one of these things is done through <lb/>
            seriousness, but all for the sake of amusement.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. This too I nearly understand.</p>
          <p>Guest. But that, which prepares for all these materials <lb/>
            bodies, out of which and in which, whatever arts have now <lb/>
            been mentioned, manufacture (something),32 shall we not place <lb/>
            as a sixth all-various species, the offspring of many other arts.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. Of what (art) are you speaking ?</p>
          <p>Guest. 33 That (which furnishes) gold and silver, and other <lb/>
            substances found as metals, and whatever the art of felling <lb/>
            trees, and the whole of the clipping art, furnishes to the car­ <lb/>
            penter, and the knitting art, and still further that which barks <lb/>
            trees, and takes off the skins of living animals, [the currier's <lb/>
            art,]34 and all such (arts) as are conversant with things of <lb/>
            this kind, and such as working on corks, and papyrus-reeds, <lb/>
            and withies, furnish the means of manufacturing from genera, <lb/>
            not put together, species that are put together. The whole of <lb/>
            this let us call the first-born possession of man, without any <lb/>

          <p>[29.] Soc. jun. How not?</p>
          <p>Guest. Nearly then all, whatsoever is connected with posses­ <lb/>
            sion, with the exception of tame animals, has I think been men­ <lb/>
            tioned in these seven genera. But consider. For it was most <lb/>
            just that the species (called) first-born should be placed first; <lb/>
            and after this, instrument, vessel, vehicle, protection, amuse­ <lb/>
            ment, and cattle.35 But if any thing of no great consequence <lb/>
            has escaped us, which it is possible to suit only (with diffi­ <lb/>
            culty)36 to some one of these, we omit it; such as the idea of <lb/>
            coin, of seals, and of every thing bearing a mark. For these <lb/>
            things have not in themselves a genus much in common; but <lb/>
            some will agree as regards ornament, others as regards instru­ <lb/>
            ments, drawn (into the discussion) indeed with violence, but <lb/>
            nevertheless completely. But the tending of herds, as pre­ <lb/>
            viously divided, will appear to have comprehended the whole <lb/>
            possession of tame animals with the exception of slaves.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. The genus of slaves and of all servants remains; <lb/>
            amongst whom I conjecture will become apparent those, who <lb/>
            engaged in the very thing woven,37 contend with the king in <lb/>
            the same manner as those above, that are engaged in knitting, <lb/>
            and in wool-combing, and in such other arts as we then men­ <lb/>
            tioned, did with the weavers. But all the rest, spoken of as <lb/>
            co-causes, have, together with the works just now mentioned, <note type="footnote"> 35 So Taylor translates <foreign xml:lang="grc">θρέμμα</foreign>, which is literally " a nursling." Stal­ <lb/>

          <p>Soc.jun. Who are they?</p>
          <p>Guest. They who are purchased, and in this manner be­ <lb/>

          <p>Guest. But what shall we say of those free-born persons, who <lb/>
            willingly put themselves to ministering to the parties39 men­ <lb/>
            tioned just now, and by conveying the produce of agriculture, <lb/>

            these contend for any part of the statesman's science ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Perhaps some of the foreign merchants will.</p>

          <p>Guest. I speak of the tribe of heralds,41 and of those who <lb/>
            become accomplished in the art of writing,42 and often act as <lb/>
            ministers, and certain other persons, who have very great <lb/>
            talents for some other and many kinds of business connected <lb/>
            with public offices. What shall we say of these ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. What you have said just now, that they are min­ <lb/>
            isters, but no rulers in states.</p>
          <p>Guest. But surely 43 I was not, I think, seeing a vision,43 <lb/>
            when I said that in this way, perchance, would be seen those <lb/>
            strenuously contending for the science of a statesman. And <lb/>
            yet it would seem to be very absurd to seek after these in any <lb/>
            ministering portion.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. Very much so, indeed.</p>
          <p>Guest. Let us then approach still nearer to those who have <lb/>
            not been as yet examined. Now these are such as possess a <lb/>
            certain portion of ministering science relating to divination. <lb/>
            For they are held to be the interpreters of gods to men.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. They are.</p>
          <p>Guest. The genus too of priests, as the law says, knows how <lb/>
            gifts should be offered by us through sacrifices to the gods, <lb/>
            agreeably to them; and how we should request of them by <lb/>
            prayer the possession of good things. Now both these are <lb/>
            parts of the ministering art.</p>
          <p>[30.] Soc.jun. So it appears.</p>
          <p>Guest. Now then we seem to me to touch, as it were, upon <lb/>
            some foot-print of the object to which we are on the road. <lb/>
            For the figure of priests and prophets is replete with pru- <note type="footnote"> 41 The persons alluded to would be now called "diplomatists," as is <lb/>
            evident from the Hippias Major; where the Pantologist of his day is said <lb/>
            to have been frequently employed in that character. </note><note type="footnote"> 42 As the art of writing was in ancient times known only to a few, such <lb/>
            persons became of necessity the men of office and consideration in the <lb/>
            state; just as no man will ever become the prime minister of England, <lb/>
            unless he can figure as a debater. For though nearly every body can <lb/>
            read and write, yet few can open a debate with a long speech, and fewer <lb/>
            still close it with a reply to the different arguments urged on the opposite <lb/>

            ness of the matters in their hands; so that in Egypt it is not <lb/>
            permitted for a king to govern without the sacerdotal science; <lb/>
            and should any one previously of another genus of men be­ <lb/>
            come by violence (the king), he is afterwards compelled to be <lb/>
            initiated in the mysteries of this genus.45 Further still among <lb/>
            the Greeks, one may find in many places that the greatest <lb/>
            sacrifices relating to matters of this kind are imposed upon <lb/>
            the greatest offices; and what I assert is shown particularly <lb/>
            among you. For to him who is chosen by lot the king here,46 <lb/>
            they say that of all the ancient sacrifices, those held in the <lb/>
            highest veneration and most peculiar to the country are <lb/>
            assigned.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. We must then consider these kings chosen by lot, <lb/>
            together with the priests, and their ministers, and a certain <lb/>
            other very numerous crowd, which has just now become <lb/>
            manifest to us, apart from those previously mentioned.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Of whom are you speaking ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Of certain very strange persons.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Why so ?</p>
          <p>Guest. As I was just now speculating, their genus appeared <lb/>
            to me to be all kinds. 47For many men resemble lions and <lb/>
            centaurs, and other things of this kind; and very many are <lb/>
            similar to satyrs, and to weak and versatile wild beasts. They <lb/>
            likewise rapidly change their forms and their power into each <lb/>
            other.47 And indeed, Socrates, I appear to myself to have <lb/>
            just now perceived these men for the first time.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Speak; for you seem to see something strange.</p>

          <p>Soc. jun. Of what kind?</p>
          <p>Guest. The greatest wizard of all the wise, 50 and the most <lb/>
            skilled in this art; who must be separated from the really ex­ <lb/>

            search.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. We must not give up this, at least.</p>
          <p>Guest. Not, indeed, according to my opinion: but tell me <lb/>
            this.</p>
          <p>[31.] Soc.jun. What?</p>
          <p>Guest. Is not a monarchy one of the forms of state-rule ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. It is.</p>
          <p>Guest. And after a monarchy one would, I think, speak of <lb/>
            an oligarchy.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. But is not the rule of the many called by the name <lb/>
            of a democracy, a third form of state-polity ?</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. Entirely so.</p>

            tion to their own ?</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. What ?</p>
          <p>Guest. They who look to the violent and the voluntary, to <lb/>
            poverty and wealth, to law and lawlessness, which take place <lb/>
            in them, give a twofold division to each one of the two, and <lb/>
            call monarchy, as exhibiting two species, by two names, one <lb/>
            tyranny, the other royalty.</p>

          <p>Soc. jun. True.</p>
          <p>Guest. What then ? Do we think that any one of these <lb/>
            state-polities is right, thus bounded by these definitions, such <lb/>
            as by one, and a few, and a many, and by wealth and poverty, <lb/>

            road.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. What road?</p>
          <p>Guest. Shall we abide by what was asserted at first, or <lb/>
            shall we dissent from it ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. To what assertion are you alluding ?</p>
          <p>Guest. I think we said that a regal government was one <lb/>
            of the sciences.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Yes.</p>
          <p>Guest. Yet not of those taken together as a whole; but <lb/>
            we selected it from the other sciences, as something judicial <lb/>
            and presiding.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Yes.</p>
          <p>Guest. And from the presiding science (we selected) one <lb/>
            part, as belonging to inanimate acts, and the other as belong­ <lb/>
            ing to animals. And dividing after this fashion, we have <lb/>
            arrived thus far, not forgetful of science, but unable to de­ <lb/>
            termine with sufficient accuracy what science is.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. You say rightly.</p>
          <p>Guest. Do we then understand this very thing, that the <lb/>

            nor the many, nor the voluntary or involuntary, nor poverty <lb/>
            or wealth, but (as regards) a certain science, if we follow <lb/>
            what has been formerly detailed ?</p>
          <p>[32.] Soc.jun. It is impossible, indeed, not to do this.</p>
          <p>Guest. We must of necessity then consider now this; in <lb/>
            which of these does the science respecting the government <lb/>
            of men happen to exist, being nearly 53the greatest and most <lb/>
            difficult53 to obtain. For it is requisite to inspect it, that we <lb/>
            may perceive who are the parties we must take away from a <lb/>
            prudent king, who lay claim to be statesmen, and persuade <lb/>
            the multitude (of it), and yet are so not at all.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. We must do so, as the reasoning has previously <lb/>
            told us.</p>
          <p>Guest. Does it then appear to you that the mass in a city <lb/>
            is able to acquire this science ?</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. How can they?</p>
          <p>Guest. But in a city of a thousand men, is it possible for a <lb/>
            hundred, or even fifty, to acquire it sufficiently ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. It would be then the most easy of all arts. For <lb/>
            we know that among a thousand men there could not be <lb/>
            found so many tip-top draught-players as compared with <lb/>
            those in the rest of Greece, much less kings. For, according <lb/>
            to our former reasoning, we must call him, who possesses <lb/>
            the science of a king, whether he governs or not, a regal <lb/>
            character.</p>
          <p>Guest. You have very properly reminded me. And I think <lb/>
            it follows from this, that a right government, when it exists <lb/>
            rightly, ought to be investigated as about one person,54 or two, <lb/>
            or54 altogether about a few.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. And we must hold, as we think now, that these <lb/>
            exercise rule according to a certain art, whether they govern <lb/>
            the willing or the unwilling, whether according to statutes or <lb/>
            without statutes, and whether they are rich or poor. For we <note type="footnote"> 53—53 This, which is the natural order of ideas, is properly found in <lb/>

            (it) to increase, and so long as, for the good of the body <lb/>
            alone, they bring it from a worse to a better state, and by at­ <lb/>
            tending preserve each57 (body) attended to. After this man­ <lb/>
            ner, and in no other, as I think, we will lay down that the <lb/>
            definition of the medicinal or any other rule is rightly made.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. And very much so.</p>
          <p>[33.] Guest. It is necessary then, as it seems, that of poli­ <lb/>
            ties that must be pre-eminently correct, and the only polity, <lb/>
            in which the governors are found to possess science truly, and <lb/>
            not in appearance merely; whether they rule according to laws <lb/>
            or without laws, over the willing or the unwilling, and are <lb/>
            themselves poor or rich. For not one of these things must <lb/>
            we consider at all, as regards any rectitude (of government).</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. Beautifully (said). I</p>
          <p>Guest. And whether they purge the state to its good, by <lb/>
            putting to death or banishing certain persons; or by sending <lb/>
            out colonies some where, like a swarm of bees, they reduce it to <lb/>
            a less size; or whether by introducing some others from abroad <lb/>
            they make citizens of them, and thus increase its size, so long as <lb/>
            by making use of science and justice, they preserve it, and cause <lb/>
            it to the utmost of their power to pass from a worse condition <lb/>
            to a better one, then, and according to such limits, must we <lb/>
            speak of a polity as alone rightly existing. But we must say that <lb/>
            such others, as we have mentioned, are not genuine, nor do <lb/>
            they in reality exist; 58but that those, which we call well- <lb/>
            regulated, imitate this for the better, the others for the worse.58 <note type="footnote"> 55 This word is graphically applied here to a physician standing over <lb/>

          <p>Soc. jun. The other points, 0 guest, appear to have been <lb/>
            stated with moderation: but that it is requisite59 to govern <lb/>
            without laws, has been stated as a thing rather harsh to hear.</p>
          <p>Guest. You have anticipated me a little, Socrates, by your <lb/>
            question. For I was about to ask you, whether you admit all <lb/>
            these points, or whether you find any difficulty in any matter <lb/>
            that has been stated. It is however evident, that we now <lb/>
            wish to discuss the point respecting the rectitude of those, <lb/>
            who govern without laws.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. After a certain manner it is evident that legislation <lb/>
            is a part of the science of a king: but it is best, not for the <lb/>
            laws to prevail,60 but for a man, who has with prudence the <lb/>
            power of a king. Do you know in what way ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. In what way do you mean?</p>
          <p>Guest. Because the law cannot, by comprehending that <lb/>
            which is the best and most accurately just in all cases, at the <lb/>
            same time ordain what is the best. For the inequalities of <lb/>
            men and their actions, and the fact that not a single atom, so <lb/>
            to say, of human affairs, enjoys a state of rest, do not permit <lb/>
            any art whatever to exhibit in any case any thing simple <lb/>
            (without exception) respecting all matters and through all <lb/>
            time. Shall we admit this ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. And yet we see the law tending nearly to this very <lb/>
            point; and, like a certain self-willed and ignorant man, it <lb/>
            does not suffer any person to do anything contrary to its own <lb/>
            orders, nor to put a question, not even should something new <lb/>
            happen to be in some case 61 better as compared with the de­ <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Soc. jun. True. For the law does really so, as you have just <lb/>
            now said, to each of us.</p>
          <p>Guest. Is it not then impossible for that, which is under all <lb/>
            cases simple, to do well in cases which are never at any time <lb/>
            simple ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. It appears so nearly.</p>
          <p>[34.] Guest. Why then is it necessary to lay down laws ? <lb/>
            since law is not a thing of the greatest rectitude. Of this we <lb/>
            must inquire the cause.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Are there not then amongst us, as in other cities <lb/>
            likewise, certain exercises of men collected together for the <lb/>
            sake of competition relating to running, or something else ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Yes. There are very many.</p>
          <p>Guest. Come then, let us again recall to our memory the <lb/>
            orders of those, who practise scientifically exercises in meet­ <lb/>
            ings 62 of this kind.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. What is this ? 63</p>
          <p>Guest. They do not conceive it is requisite to be very fine <lb/>
            in ordering, according to each individual, what is suited to the <lb/>
            body of each; but think more stupidly,64 that they ought to <lb/>
            make their arrangements of what benefits the body, suited to <lb/>
            the majority of circumstances and persons.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Excellent.</p>
          <p>Guest. On which account assigning now65 equal labours to <lb/>
            persons collected together, they urge them on together, and <lb/>
            stop them together in the race, and wrestling, and all the <lb/>
            labours of the body.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Such is the fact.</p>
          <p>Guest. Let us hold then, that the legislator who would pre­ <lb/>
            side over his herds66 in matters of justice, and their contracts <note type="footnote"> 62 I have translated as if the Greek were <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγοϱα</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ς</foreign>, not <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀϱχα</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ς</foreign>, which is <lb/>

          <p>Soc. jun. This is likely.</p>
          <p>Guest. But I think he will establish laws suited to the <lb/>
            majority of persons and circumstances, and somehow thus in <lb/>
            a more stupid way for each, delivering them in writings, and <lb/>

            customs of the country.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Right.</p>
          <p>Guest. Right indeed. For how, Socrates, can any one be <lb/>
            so all-sufficient as, by sitting near 68 through the whole of life, <lb/>
            to enjoin accurately what is adapted to each ? Since, although <lb/>
            any one soever of those who possess the science of a king' <lb/>
            could, I think, do this, he would scarcely impose on himself <lb/>
            impediments, by writing down the so-called laws.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. (So it appears,) 0 guest, from what has been <lb/>

          <p>Guest. And still more, 0 thou best one, from what will be said.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. What is that?</p>
          <p>Guest. Of this kind. For let us thus say to ourselves. <note type="footnote"> no where stated that the legislator has, like a king, a herd of his own. <lb/>

          <p>Soc. jun. You speak most true.</p>
          <p>Guest. But if he who forces is rich, will the acts done <lb/>
            forcibly by him be just, but, if he is poor, unjust? Or, <lb/>
            whether a person persuades or does not persuade, (whether) <lb/>
            rich or poor, and (whether) according or contrary to written <lb/>
            statutes, he does what is useful, must this be the definition <lb/>
            the most true on all sides of the correct administration of a <lb/>
            state, by which74 a wise and good man will (well) administer <lb/>
            the interests of those under his charge; just as a pilot watches <lb/>
            over whatever happens to conduce to the welfare of the vessel <lb/>
            and crew; and not by laying down written orders, but by <lb/>
            making his skill a law, he preserves his fellow-sailors. And <lb/>
            thus, 75[after this very same manner,]75 will an upright polity <lb/>
            be produced by those who are able to govern thus, by ex­ <lb/>
            hibiting a strength of skill superior to the laws. And indeed <lb/>
            in the case of prudent rulers there will be no error, let them <lb/>
            do every thing; as long as they observe this one great maxim, <lb/>
            to distribute ever with intellect and art to those in the state <lb/>
            what is the most j ust, to keep them such as they are, and to <lb/>
            finish by rendering them, as far as possible, better instead of <lb/>

          <p>[36.] Soc. jun. Of what are you speaking ?</p>
          <p>Guest. That no mob of any persons whatever can receive <lb/>
            this kind of science, and be able to administer with intellect <lb/>
            a state, but that we must seek for a correct polity amongst <lb/>
            a small number, and a few, and one person ;76 and that we <lb/>
            must lay down other polities as imitations, as we observed a <lb/>
            little before, some for the better, and some for the worse. <figure type="illustration">

          <p>Guest. It is meet to search into a thing of such a kind <lb/>
            as 79 is not very usual, nor easy to perceive; but at the same <lb/>
            time we must endeavour to apprehend it. For, come, since <lb/>
            the polity of which we have spoken is the only correct one, <lb/>
            you know that other polities ought to be thus80 preserved, <lb/>
            while they use the institutions of this, and do what was just <lb/>
            now praised, though it is not most right ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. What is that ?</p>
          <p>Guest. That no one of those in the city dare to do any <lb/>
            thing contrary to the laws ; and that he who dares, shall pay the <lb/>
            forfeit by death, and all the extreme of punishments.81 This <lb/>
            too is most right and beautiful, as a second thing; 82 after <lb/>
            that some one shall have first changed the just now said.82 <lb/>

          <p>Soc. jun. Of what kind ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Such a one, as if we all conceived that we are suf­ <lb/>
            fering the most dreadful things from them. For such of us <lb/>
            as either of them wish to save, they do equally save;84 and <lb/>
            such as they wish to injure, they injure by cutting and burn­ <lb/>
            ing, at the same time ordering us to bring to them the means <lb/>
            of expense, as a tribute, of which they spend on the sick <lb/>
            little or even nothing,85 but they and their domestics make use <lb/>
            of the rest. And lastly, receiving money (as) wages,86 from <lb/>
            either the kindred or some enemies of the sick man, they <lb/>
            cause him to die. They too who have the command of a ves­ <lb/>
            sel, do ten thousand other things of this kind. 87 For after <lb/>
            some plotting, when out at sea, they leave persons deserted, <lb/>
            and, committing errors at sea, hurl them into the sea, and <lb/>
            do them other mischief.87 If then, reflecting on these matters, <note type="footnote"> 83—83 Plato here alludes to the Homeric,—’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ιητρὸς γ</foreign>à<foreign xml:lang="grc">ρ ἀνὴρ <lb/>

            against whom some sailors laid a plot and threw him into the sea ; and <lb/>

            him on a desert island, he would have written perhaps to this effect. <lb/>
            " For after some plotting, they do, when out at sea, throw persons into the <lb/>
            water, or, alleging some fault against them, leave them deserted in shal­ <lb/>
            low places, and do them, beyond common ills, a wrong." For in the <lb/>
            concluding words there is an allusion perhaps to the anecdote told by Plu­ <lb/>
            tarch in Dion. § 5, respecting the tyrant of Syracuse bribing one Pollis <lb/>
            to murder Plato during his voyage home ; or, if that were not practicable, <lb/>
            to sell him into slavery; which would be considered by a person like <lb/>
            Plato, the very height of wrong. To arrive however at this sense, greater <lb/>
            alterations would be requisite than an ordinary scholar would admit; who <lb/>

            would at that time become utterly unable to be endured.</p>
          <p>[39.] Guest. But what (will you say) to this ? If we should <lb/>
            compel each of the above-mentioned to take place according to <lb/>
            written regulations, and should appoint as the guardian of these <lb/>
            statutes a man either chosen by suffrage, or chance, but who, <lb/>
            giving no thought to them, either for the sake of a certain <lb/>
            gain, or private pleasure, should endeavour, although knowing <lb/>
            nothing, to act contrary to these statutes, would not this be a <lb/>
            still greater evil than the former ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Most truly so.</p>
          <p>Guest. For he, who should dare to act contrary to those <lb/>
            laws, which have been laid down after much experience, (or) <lb/>
            through certain advisers recommending each in a pleasant <lb/>
            manner, and persuading the people to pass them, will commit <lb/>
            an error many-fold greater than an error,2 and subvert every <lb/>
            process much more than written statutes.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How is he not about (to do so) ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Hence there is a second sailing, as is said, for those <lb/>
            that establish laws and statutes respecting any thing what­ <lb/>
            ever, that is, not to suffer any one person, or the multitude, <lb/>
            to do any thing of any kind at any time contrary to them.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Right.</p>
          <p>Guest. Will not these statutes then, written by men intel­ <lb/>
            ligent as far as their power permits, be imitations of the truth <lb/>
            of each of these ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. And yet, if we remember, we said that the man, <lb/>
            who is in reality a statesman, would, being intelligent, do many <lb/>
            things from art, in reference to his own course of action, <lb/>
            without giving a thought to statutes, when other things seem <lb/>
            to him better than what had been written by himself and <lb/>
            enjoined upon some persons absent.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. We did say so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Would not then any single man whatever, or any <note type="footnote"> has shown that his MS. omitted words that have been interpolated, and <lb/>
            transposed those which have been misplaced. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Ficinus has " scelus committit superiori peccato longe deterius," <lb/>
            which is far more intelligible than the Greek. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="261"/>
            people whatever, by whom laws happen to be laid down, act <lb/>
            in the same way as that true (statesman), should they endea­ <lb/>
            vour to do to the utmost of their power contrary to them3 <lb/>
            ( the laws) what is something different and better ?</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. If then they should without knowledge act in this <lb/>
            manner, would they not attempt to imitate what is true ? and <lb/>
            yet they would imitate all badly; but if with art, this is no <lb/>
            longer an imitation, but is the very truth itself.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Altogether so.</p>
          <p>. Guest. And yet it was before laid down as a thing acknow­ <lb/>
            ledged by us, that the mob is incapable of receiving any art <lb/>
            whatever.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. It was so laid down.</p>
          <p>Guest. If then there is a certain kingly art, the mob of the <lb/>
            rich, and the whole of the people, could never receive this <lb/>
            science of the statesman.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. For how can they ?</p>
          <p>Guest. It is requisite then, as it seems, that such-like <lb/>
            polities, if they are about to imitate correctly, to the best of <lb/>
            their power, the true polity under a single person ruling with <lb/>
            art, must never, 4 the laws having been laid down by them,4 <lb/>
            do any thing contrary to the written statutes and customs of <lb/>
            the country.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. You speak most beautifully.</p>
          <p>Guest. When therefore the rich imitate this polity, we <lb/>
            then denominate such a polity an aristocracy; but when they <lb/>
            give no thought to the laws, an oligarchy.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. So it nearly seems.</p>
          <p>Guest. And again, when one man rules according to the <lb/>
            laws, imitating the person endued with science, we call him a <lb/>
            king, not distinguishing by name the person ruling alone with <lb/>
            science, or with opinion according to the laws. <note type="footnote"> 3 Stalbaum says that ravra is to be referred to <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμους</foreign> (the laws). <lb/>
            But how a neuter noun could thus be made to agree with a masculine <lb/>
            one, was known only, I suspect, to himself and Matthiæ, whom he quotes. <lb/>
            To my mind the noun to be understood is <foreign xml:lang="grc">συγγράμματα</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 4—4 Of these words, perfectly useless here, Ficinus has taken not the <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Soc.jun. We nearly appear to do so.</p>
          <p>Guest. If then a person possessing in reality science rules <lb/>
            alone, he is called altogether by the same name, a king, and no <lb/>
            other will be mentioned in addition: through which 5 the five <lb/>
            names of the polities just now mentioned become only one.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. So it appears.</p>
          <p>Guest. But when one man rules neither according to the <lb/>
            laws nor the customs of the country, but pretends, as the <lb/>
            person possessing science, that the best is to be done, contrary <lb/>
            to the written statutes, and there exist a certain desire and <lb/>
            ignorance as the leaders of this imitation, must we not call <lb/>
            each man of this kind a tyrant ?</p>
          <p>[40.] Soc. jun. How not ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Thus then we say has been produced a tyrant, a king, <lb/>
            an oligarchy, an aristocracy, and a democracy, from mankind <lb/>
            indignantly bearing with such a single monarch, and not be­ <lb/>
            lieving that any one would ever be worthy of such an office, <lb/>
            so as to be both willing and able to rule with virtue and <lb/>
            science, and to distribute properly to all persons things just <lb/>
            and holy;6 but (disposed) to maim, and kill, and maltreat 7 <lb/>
            whomsoever he might wish: yet, if such a person should <lb/>
            arise, as we have mentioned, he would be beloved and live at <lb/>
            home happily,8 guiding throughout, like a pilot, alone a polity <lb/>
            accurately correct.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. How not?</p>
          <p>Guest. But now, as we truly say, since there is no such <lb/>
            -king produced in states, as is produced by nature in a swarm <lb/>

            as it seems, come together and write down statutes, treading <lb/>
            in the footsteps of a polity the most true.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. It nearly appears so.</p>
          <p>Guest. And do we wonder then, Socrates, that in such- <lb/>
            like polities evils, such as do happen, and will happen, are pro­ <lb/>
            duced, when the foundation placed under them (exists) by <lb/>
            statutes and customs, 9 and not with the foundation of science, <lb/>
            which performs its actions in a different way than what a <lb/>
            polity does, which, making use of imprudence, will be evident <lb/>
            to every one, that it will destroy every thing produced by that <lb/>
            (imprudence).9 Or ought we not to wonder rather at this, how <lb/>
            strong a thing a city naturally is ? For, though cities have for <lb/>
            time without end been suffering thus, yet some of them are <lb/>
            still remaining, and are not overturned. Many however <lb/>
            sometimes, like sinking10 vessels, are perishing, have perished, <lb/>
            and will perish,11 through the incorrect conduct of the pilots <lb/>
            and sailors,12 who, having obtained the greatest ignorance re­ <lb/>
            specting the greatest concerns, do still, although they know <lb/>
            nothing about state affairs, think they have obtained this <lb/>
            knowledge the most clearly of all.</p>
          <p>[41.] Soc.jun. Most true.</p>
          <p>Guest. Which then of these incorrect polities, where all <lb/>
            are full of difficulties, is the least difficult to live in, and <lb/>
            which the most oppressive, it is meet for us to look into a <lb/>

          <p>Guest. Of three things then, say that the same is remark­ <lb/>
            ably difficult, and at the same time most easy.</p>
          <p>- Soc. jun. How say you ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Not otherwise than, as I said before, that a mon­ <lb/>
            archy, the government of a few, and of many, are those three <lb/>
            polities mentioned by us at the commencement of the dis­ <lb/>
            course, which has now flowed upon us.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. They were.</p>
          <p>Guest. Bisecting then each of these, we shall produce six, <lb/>
            separating from these the correct polity, as a seventh.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How so?</p>
          <p>Guest. Out of monarchy, there came, we said, the regal <lb/>
            and the tyrannic; and out of that (composed) not of the <lb/>
            many, the well-omened aristocracy and oligarchy. But out <lb/>
            of that (composed) of the many, we then laid it down under <lb/>
            the name of a simple democracy; but we must now lay it <lb/>
            down as two-fold.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How so ? And after what manner do we make <lb/>
            this division ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Not at all different from the others; even although <lb/>
            the name of this is now two-fold. But to govern according to <lb/>
            the laws, and contrary to them, is common both to this and <lb/>
            the rest.15</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. It is so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Then indeed, when we were seeking a correct <lb/>
            polity, this bisection was of no use, as we have shown above; <lb/>
            but since we have separated it from the others, and have con­ <lb/>
            sidered the others as necessary, the being contrary or accord­ <lb/>
            in- to law causes a bisection in each of these.16</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. So it appears from what has now been said.</p>
          <p>Guest. A monarchy then, yoked to correct writings, which <lb/>
            we call laws, is the best of all the six polities; but when it <lb/>
            is without law, it is grievous, and most burthensome to live <lb/>

          <p>Soc. jun. It nearly appears so.</p>
          <p>Guest. But the polity of the not-many we have considered <lb/>
            as a medium between both, as a few is a medium between <lb/>
            one and many; but on the other hand, the polity of the many, <lb/>
            as being weak in all things, and unable, as compared with the <lb/>
            others, to do any thing great, either for good or evil, through <lb/>
            the offices in this polity being divided into small parts amongst <lb/>
            many. Hence, of all the polities acting according to law, <lb/>
            this is the worst, but the best of all such as act contrary to <lb/>
            law. And where all are intemperate, it is the best to live in a <lb/>
            democracy; but where all are temperate, this polity is the <lb/>
            worst to live in. In the first polity is the first and best con­ <lb/>
            dition (of life), with the exception of the seventh; for we <lb/>
            must separate this from all the other polities, as a god from <lb/>

            these polities, with the exception of the scientific one, as being <lb/>

            over the greatest resemblances, and being such themselves; <lb/>

            correctly on those called statesmen.</p>
          <p>Guest. Be it so. This indeed is, as it were, a drama for us; <lb/>
            just as it was lately said, that we saw a certain dancing-troop <lb/>
            of Centaurs and Satyrs, which was to be separated from the <lb/>
            statesman's art; and now this separation has been with so <lb/>
            much difficulty effected.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. So it appears.</p>
          <p>Guest. But another thing remains, still more difficult than <lb/>
            this, through its being more allied to the kingly genus, and <lb/>
            at the same time more difficult to understand. And we ap- <note type="footnote"> 17—17 The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">γίγνεσθαί τε καὶ</foreign> are omitted in the three oldest but <lb/>

            wash gold.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. How so?</p>
          <p>Guest. Those workmen first of all separate earth, stones, <lb/>
            and many other things; but after this there are left sub­ <lb/>
            stances, allied to gold, mixed together and of value, and to <lb/>
            be separated only by fire, such as brass and silver, and some­ <lb/>
            times a diamond; which19 being with difficulty separated by <lb/>
            the experiments of fusion (in the crucible), suffer us to see <lb/>
            itself by itself that which is called pure gold.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. It is said that such things are so done.</p>
          <p>[42.] Guest. After the same manner then it seems that <lb/>
            things different from, and such as are foreign and not friendly <lb/>
            to, the statesman's science, have been separated by us; but <lb/>
            there have been left such as are of value and allied to it. <lb/>
            Now of these are the military and judicial arts, and that <lb/>
            oratory, which has a share of the kingly science, and does, by <lb/>
            persuading men to do justice, conjointly regulate affairs in <lb/>
            states; by separating (all) of which in a certain manner, most <lb/>

            let us endeavour to show it by means of music. Tell me, <lb/>
            then-</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. What?</p>

            power of the statesman.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. You have spoken most beautifully.</p>
          <p>Guest. Thus then the science of the orator appears to have <lb/>
            been very rapidly separated from that of the statesman, as <lb/>
            being another species, but subservient to this.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Yes.</p>
          <p>[43.] Guest. But what on the other hand must we con­ <lb/>
            ceive respecting this power ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. What power?</p>
          <p>Guest. (Respecting) that, by which we are to war with <lb/>
            each of those against whom we may have chosen to war. <lb/>
            Whether shall we say that this power is without art or with <lb/>
            art ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. And how can we conceive that power to be with­ <lb/>
            out art, which the general's art and all warlike operations put <lb/>
            into practice ?</p>
          <p>Guest. But must we consider that power, which is able and <lb/>
            skilful in deliberating, whether we ought to engage in war, or <lb/>
            separate peaceably, as different from this, or the same with it ?</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. To those following26 the preceding (reasoning) it <lb/>
            is of necessity different.</p>
          <p>Guest. Shall we not, then, assert that this (the art of de­ <lb/>
            liberation) rules over that (which carries on war), if we <lb/>
            understand in a manner similar to what has been advanced <lb/>
            before ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. So I say.</p>
          <p>Guest. What power then shall we endeavour to show as <lb/>
            the mistress of the whole art of war, so terrible and mighty, <lb/>
            except the truly kingly science ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. None other.</p>
          <p>Guest. We must not then lay down the science of general­ <lb/>

          <p>Soc. jun. It is not reasonable.</p>

            who judge rightly.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. By all means.</p>
          <p>Guest. Is it then capable of doing any thing more than merely <lb/>
            judging respecting compacts, when, having received from a <lb/>
            king the lawgiver, whatever has been laid down as legal, and <lb/>
            looking both to those, and to what has been ordained to be just <lb/>
            and unjust, it exhibits its own peculiar virtue, of never being <lb/>
            overcome by certain bribes, or fear, or pity, or any other27 <lb/>
            hatred, or love, so as to be willing to settle mutual accusa­ <lb/>
            tions contrary to the ordonnance of the legislator.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. The employment of this power is nearly nothing <lb/>
            else,28 than what you have mentioned.</p>
          <p>Guest. We find then, that the strength of judges is not <lb/>
            kingly, but the guardianship of the laws, and ministering to <lb/>
            the kingly science.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Guest. This also must be understood by him, who looks <lb/>
            into all the aforesaid sciences, that the statesman's science has <lb/>
            not appeared to be one of them. For it is not meet for the <lb/>
            truly kingly science to act itself, but to rule over those able <lb/>
            to act; since it knows that the commencement and progress 29 <lb/>
            of things of the greatest consequence in states depends on <lb/>
            opportunity 29 and the want of it; but it is the province of the <lb/>
            other sciences to do as they are ordered.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Right ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Hence, since the sciences which we have just now <note type="footnote"> 21 On the pleonastic use of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄλλος</foreign>, which Stalbaum renders " moreover," <lb/>

          <p>Guest. But we having, rightly comprehended its power <lb/>
            under an appellation in common, should, it seems, most justly <lb/>
            call that the science of the statesman, which rules over all <lb/>
            these and takes care of the laws, and of every thing relating <lb/>
            to the state, and weaves all things together most correctly.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>[44.] Guest. Are we then willing to go through this science <lb/>
            at present, according to the pattern of the weaving art, since <lb/>
            all the genera pertaining to a state have become manifest <lb/>
            to us ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. And very much so.</p>

          <p>Soc. jun. It must however be told by all means.</p>
          <p>Guest. For that a part of virtue differs in a certain man­ <lb/>

            titude, but that this is also a part of what that is likewise.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Yes.</p>

          <p>Guest. Shall I then be able to point out to you through <lb/>
            words, as I have it in my mind ?</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. Why not?</p>
          <p>Guest. You seem to think a thing of this kind easy. Let <lb/>
            us consider it then in genera somewhat contrary. For in <lb/>
            many actions, and oftentimes on each occasion,38 when we <lb/>
            admire the swiftness, vehemence, and acuteness of thought, <lb/>
            body, or voice, we praise them, and at the same time employ <lb/>
            one of the appellations of manliness.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. How so?</p>
          <p>Guest. We say it is acute and manly, swift and manly, and <lb/>
            in a similar manner vehement:39 and, universally, by applying <lb/>
            the name which I say is common to all these natural qualities, <lb/>
            we praise them.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Yes.</p>
          <p>Guest. But what, have we not often praised in many ac­ <lb/>
            tions 40the species of quiet production?40</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. And very much so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Do we not then, in saying the contrary to what <lb/>
            (we did) about them, say this?41</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. How so?</p>
          <p>Guest. As42 we speak on each occasion of things done <lb/>

            of the moderate, and not of the manly ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Most assuredly.</p>
          <p>Guest. But when, on the other hand, both these take place <lb/>
            unseasonably,43 we then in turn blame each of them by their <lb/>
            names, distributing (them) back to their opposites.44</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How so ?</p>
          <p>Guest. By calling things that are and seem (to be) more <lb/>
            acute, and quick, and harsh than is seasonable, by the names <lb/>
            of insolent and mad; but those that are more slow and soft, <lb/>
            (by the names of) timid and slothful. And for the most part <lb/>
            nearly we find that these, and the moderate and manly natures, <lb/>
            having like hostile species obtained by lot their respective <lb/>
            stations45 opposite to each other, never mingle together in <lb/>
            actions about things of this kind; and still further we shall <lb/>
            see, if we pursue (the inquiry) diligently,46 that they, who <lb/>
            possess these in their souls, are at variance with each other.</p>
          <p>[45.] Soc. jun. Where do you say?</p>
          <p>Guest. In all the points which we have just now mentioned, <lb/>
            and, it is likely, in many others. For I think that, on ac­ <lb/>
            count of their alliance with each,47 by praising some things <lb/>
            as their own property, but blaming the things of those who <lb/>
            differ, as being foreign, they stand in great enmity with each <lb/>
            other and on account of many things.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. They nearly appear to do so.</p>

          <p>Soc. jun. About what things are you speaking ?</p>
          <p>Guest. About the whole form of living, as it is reasonable <lb/>
            I should. For they who are pre-eminently well-ordered are <lb/>
            always prepared to live a quiet life, themselves by themselves, <lb/>
            managing only48 their own concerns, and so associating with <lb/>
            all at home, and being ready, in like manner, to be at peace, <lb/>
            after a certain fashion, with foreign states; and through this <lb/>
            desire, more unseasonable than is fitting, when they are doing <lb/>
            that which they wish, they become unconsciously unwar­ <lb/>
            like, and affect the young men in a similar manner, and <lb/>
            become ever the prey of parties attacking ; of whom in <lb/>
            not many years themselves, their children, and the whole <lb/>
            city, often unconsciously, instead of being free, become the <lb/>
            slaves.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. You speak of a severe and terrible suffering.</p>
          <p>Guest. But what are they, who incline more to manliness ? <lb/>
            Do they not incite their own cities ever to some warfare, <lb/>
            through a desire more vehement than is becoming of such a <lb/>
            kind of life; and thus standing in hostile array against many <lb/>
            and powerful (nations), either entirely destroy their own <lb/>
            country, or place it in slavery under the power of their foes ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. This too is the case.</p>
          <p>Guest. How then shall we not say, that in these cases both <lb/>
            these genera have ever against each other the greatest enmity <lb/>
            and array ?49</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. It can never be that we should say no.</p>

            sidering at the beginning, that certain parts of virtue differ <lb/>
            not a little from each other naturally, and that they likewise <lb/>
            cause those, who possess them, to do the same ?</p>

          <p>Soc.jun. How not?</p>
          <p>Guest. The statesman's science, when it really exists ac­ <lb/>
            cording to nature, will never willingly form a state composed <lb/>
            of good and bad men; but it is very evident, that it will first <lb/>
            examine by means of play;51 and, after the examination, it <lb/>
            will hand over to such as are able to instruct and to minister <lb/>
            to this very purpose, itself commanding and presiding, just as <lb/>
            the weaving art presides over the wool-combers, 52and those <lb/>
            who prepare the rest of the materials for weaving, and fol­ <lb/>

          <p>Soc. jun. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. In the very same way the kingly science appears to <lb/>
            me to keep to itself the power of the presiding art, and not to <lb/>
            permit all, who instruct and rear up according to law, to practise <lb/>

            not partaken of the things we are speaking of, does it not ob­ <lb/>
            tain most justly some disgraceful reputation for stupidity?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Guest. Must we not say that this entwining and binding <lb/>
            together of the evil with themselves, and of the good with the <lb/>
            evil, can never become stable, and that no science will ever <lb/>
            employ it with any serious care on such as these ?</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. For how can it?</p>
          <p>Guest. But that in those alone, who have been born with <lb/>
            noble manners from the first, and educated according to <lb/>
            nature, this (bond) is naturally implanted through the laws ? <lb/>
            and for these too there is a remedy through art; and, as we <lb/>
            said before, that this is the more divine bond of the parts of <lb/>
            virtue which are naturally58 dissimilar, and tending to con­ <lb/>
            traries ?</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. Most true.</p>
          <p>Guest. Since then this divine bond exists, there is scarcely <note type="footnote"> could induce him to put down words not necessarily conveying such a <lb/>
            meaning ? </note><note type="footnote"> 58 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">φύσεως</foreign> Stalbaum would read <foreign xml:lang="grc">φυσει</foreign>, with Stephens, who <lb/>

             <pb n="278"/>
            any difficulty in either understanding the other bonds which <lb/>
            are human, or for a person understanding to bring them to a <lb/>
            completion.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How so? And what are these bonds ?</p>
          <p>Guest. Those of intermarriages and of a communion of <lb/>
            children, and those relating to private59 betrothals and <lb/>
            espousals. For the majority are in these matters not properly <lb/>
            bound together for the purpose of begetting children.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. Why?</p>
          <p>Guest. The pursuit of wealth and power on such occasions <lb/>
            who would seriously blame, as being worthy of notice ? 60</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. It is not.</p>
          <p>[48.] Guest. But it will be more just to speak of those, <lb/>
            who make the genera61 the object of their care, should they <lb/>
            do any thing not according to propriety.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. It is at least reasonable.</p>
          <p>Guest. They do not indeed at all act from right reason, but <lb/>
            pursue a life easy for the present; and through their hugging <lb/>
            those similar to themselves, and of not loving those that are <lb/>
            dissimilar, they give up themselves for the greatest part to <lb/>
            an unpleasant feeling.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. How so?</p>
          <p>Guest. They that are well-ordered seek after manners like <lb/>
            their own, and as far as they can marry from amongst such; <lb/>
            and on the other hand send away to them their own daughters <lb/>
            to be married. In the same manner acts the genus that de­ <lb/>
            lights in manliness, while going in the pursuit of its own <lb/>
            nature ; whereas it is requisite for both the genera to do en­ <lb/>
            tirely the contrary.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. How, and on what account?</p>
          <p>Guest. Because manliness, having been propagated, un­ <lb/>
            mixed for many generations with a temperate nature, is <note type="footnote"> 59 I cannot understand here <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰδίας</foreign>, " private," as if there were ever public <lb/>
            betrothals. Ficinus exhibits a remarkable variation, " Conjugia inquam <lb/>
            marls et fœminæ ad filiorum procreationem. Plurimi enim circa hæc turn <lb/>
            accipiendo turn dando aberrant." </note><note type="footnote"> 68 Such is the version of the Greek, with the exception of the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί <lb/>

            has omitted them. One MS. has <foreign xml:lang="grc">τινα</foreign>—another omits <foreign xml:lang="grc">τι</foreign>. There is some <lb/>

            naturally at the beginning blooming with strength, but in the <lb/>
            end bursts out altogether into madness.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. It is likely.</p>
          <p>Guest. On the other hand, a soul very full of modesty, and <lb/>
            unmixed with manly boldness, when it has been propagated <lb/>
            in this manner for many generations, naturally becomes un­ <lb/>
            seasonably sluggish, and at last perfectly mutilated.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. And this also is likely to happen.</p>
          <p>Guest. I have said that it is not difficult to bind together <lb/>
            these bonds,62 the fact being that both genera have one opinion <lb/>
            respecting things beautiful and good. For this is the one <lb/>
            and entire work of kingly weaving, never to suffer moderate <lb/>
            manners to subsist apart from such as are manly ; but, placing <lb/>
            both in the same shuttle, to bring out from them a web <lb/>
            smooth, and, as it is said, well-woven, by means of similar <lb/>
            opinions, and honours, and dishonours, and glories,63 and the <lb/>
            interchange of pledges,64 and to commit over to these in com­ <lb/>
            mon the offices in the state.</p>
          <p>Soc. jun. How?</p>
          <p>Guest. Wherever there happens to be a need of one <lb/>
            governor, by choosing a president who possesses both these <lb/>
            (manners); but where (there is need) of more than one, by <lb/>
            mingling a portion of both of them. For the manners of <lb/>
            temperate governors are very cautious, just, and conserva­ <lb/>
            tive ; but they are in want of a certain sourness, and a sharp <lb/>
            and practical daring.</p>
          <p>Soc.jun. These things also appear so to me.</p>
          <p>Guest. On the other hand, manliness is with respect to <note type="footnote"> 62 Ficinus has " His, ut diximus, ligamentis vincire utraque hominum <lb/>
            genera facile possumus," which is, what the Greek is not, intelligible. <lb/>

            we get rid of the strange use of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπάρξαντος</foreign>, thus found absolutely in the <lb/>

            other hand, the oldest MS. omit <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀτιμίαις</foreign>, which Ficinus renders " vitu­ <lb/>

            <title type="main">INTRODUCTION TO, THE CRATYLUS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>PLATO having on various occasions, and especially in the Sophist <lb/>
            and Statesman, applied some of the phenomena of language to the <lb/>
            illustration of his argument on questions relating to Dialectics, and <lb/>
            Moral and Political Philosophy, has in this Dialogue entered more <lb/>
            at length on so much of the same subject, as is connected with the <lb/>
            origin of words in the case of persons, acts, and things.</p>
          <p>To this step he was probably led by finding that the Sophists, <lb/>
            whom he every where opposes with reason and ridicule united, and <lb/>
            whom he hunted down with all the ardour of a philosophical Nim­ <lb/>
            rod, were generally the followers of the school of Parmenides or <lb/>
            Heracleitus. Of these, the former asserted that all the phenomena <lb/>
            of existence could be explained on the principle, that all things are <lb/>
            ever at rest; the latter on the contrary principle, that every thing <lb/>
            is in motion. To prove then that both were equally wrong, Plato <lb/>
            had recourse to the phenomena of language. For as they formed <lb/>
            a part of things in existence, the supporters of those theories ought <lb/>
            to be able to explain, why certain names were given to certain per­ <lb/>
            sons, acts, and things. And so, it would seem, Protagoras did in <lb/>
            reality attempt to do in that part of his work under the title of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀλήθεια</foreign> (Truth), which was <foreign xml:lang="grc">Περὶ τη̃ς τω̃ν ὀνομάτων ὀρθότητος</foreign> (On <lb/>
            the propriety of names), as Stalbaum has suggested; and so too, I <lb/>
            suspect, did Euthyphron, in his philosophical poem called <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μου̃σα <lb/>
            φιλόσοφος</foreign>, where the doctrines attributed to Orpheus were developed; <lb/>
            and from whence Proclus probably obtained the quotations from <lb/>
            the Orphic poems, to be found in his Commentaries on the Cratylus <lb/>
            and Parmenides. For such was the elasticity of the Greek language, <lb/>
            that subjects, apparently the least suited to verse, were treated in a <lb/>
            metrical form; as is shown by the fragments of Empedocles, Par­ <lb/>
            menides, and of Epicharmus the philosopher.</p><pb n="282"/>
            
          <p>But as the reasons, by which the Philosophical Etymologists <lb/>
            arrived at their conclusions, were little satisfactory to Plato, he <lb/>
            probably thought, that to prove the absurdity of their theories, it <lb/>
            was only requisite to carry out their principles to the fullest extent. <lb/>
            He therefore amused himself with bringing forward some proper <lb/>
            names, and nouns appellative, and a few verbs, which he pretends <lb/>
            to explain on their own principles. But this is done in a manner <lb/>
            so utterly ridiculous, as to exhibit its own refutation on its very <lb/>
            face; but with an air so grave, that Payne Knight said it was difficult <lb/>
            to decide whether Plato was in jest or in earnest. So successfully <lb/>
            indeed has the mystification been carried on, that, as stated by Stal­ <lb/>
            baum, while Menage and Tiedemann believed Plato to be speaking <lb/>
            seriously his real sentiments, Garnier and Tennemann perceived <lb/>
            that he was playing his usual part of an ironical philosopher. For <lb/>
            the etymologies are not only at variance with all the well-ascer­ <lb/>
            tained principles of the Greek language, but they are supported by <lb/>
            arguments one can hardly believe to be other than, as in the case <lb/>
            of the Hippias Major, the broadest caricature of those brought for­ <lb/>
            ward by the persons, whom it was Plato's intention to ridicule.</p>
          <p>To preserve however his assumed character the better, Plato pre­ <lb/>
            tends to account for his ignorance of the origin of some words <lb/>
            by saying, as probably did some of the Pseudo-philosophical Ety­ <lb/>
            mologists of his day, and as their counterparts of the present time do <lb/>
            certainly, that to the East we must look for the solution of many <lb/>
            difficulties connected with this inquiry; as if any person, acquainted <lb/>
            with all the dead and living languages of the whole world, could <lb/>
            arrive at the origin of words, unless he could tell-what, I suspect, <lb/>
            Prodicus or some other of the philosophers, whom Plato had in <lb/>
            mind, attempted to do-what was the origin of each letter, and <lb/>
            why they had a certain form, and how that form was connected <lb/>
            with the sound of each, and how they came to follow each other in <lb/>
            a certain order. It was not then without reason that Plato con­ <lb/>
            cluded the Dialogue by saying, that the question was one of so <lb/>
            intricate a nature, as to require much further consideration; as <lb/>
            it was impossible to prove in all cases that the names of persons, <lb/>
            things, and acts were originally given with reference to the in­ <lb/>
            herent nature of the objects represented by them, or from the <lb/>
            caprice of one person, or the agreement of many.</p><pb n="283"/>

          <p>Crat. If it seems good to you.</p>
          <p>Herm. Cratylus here, 0 Socrates, says that there is a pro­ <lb/>
            priety of appellation naturally subsisting for every thing that <lb/>
            exists ; and that this name is not, what certain persons conven­ <lb/>
            tionally call it, while they articulate with a part of their speech ; <lb/>
            but that there is a certain propriety of names, naturally the same <lb/>
            both among the Greeks and all Barbarians. I ask him then <lb/>
            whether Cratylus is his true name, or not. He confesses it is. <lb/>
            What then is the (true name) of Socrates ? He replies, So­ <lb/>
            crates. In the case of all other persons then, said I, is not <lb/>
            that the name of each, by which we call him ? Your name, <lb/>
            says he, is not Hermogenes, although all men call you so.1 <lb/>
            And upon my putting a question, and being very desirous <lb/>
            to know what he means, he does not state any thing dis­ <lb/>
            tinctly, but uses dissimulation towards me, and a feint, as <lb/>
            if he had some thoughts in his own mind, which, should he, <lb/>
            as being conversant with the subject, be willing to state <lb/>
            clearly, he would cause me to agree with him, and to say <note type="footnote"> 1 " Cratylus," says Stalbaum, " denies that Hermogenes was correctly <lb/>

            what he does himself. [2.] If then you can by any means <lb/>
            unfold by guessing this oracular language of Cratylus, I shall <lb/>
            very gladly hear you; or rather, if it is agreeable to you, I <lb/>
            would much more gladly hear about the propriety of names, <lb/>
            in what way the matter seems to stand to you.</p>
          <p>Soc. 0 Hermogenes, son of Hipponicus,2 there is an old <lb/>
            proverb, that beautiful things are somehow difficult to learn.3 <lb/>
            Now the learning relating to names happens to be no small <lb/>
            affair. If however I had heard that exhibition of Prodicus <lb/>
            valued at fifty drachms,4 by which he who heard might have <lb/>
            been instructed, as he himself says, on this very point, no­ <lb/>
            thin- would have prevented you from knowing immediately <lb/>
            the truth respecting the propriety of names. But I never <lb/>
            heard except the one for a single drachma Hence I know <lb/>
            not where the truth is on such-like points; but am neverthe­ <lb/>
            less prepared to seek it along with you and Cratylus. [3.] <lb/>
            But as to his telling you, that your name is not in reality <lb/>
            Hermogenes, I suspect that in this he is, as it were,6 scoffing <lb/>
            at you; for he thinks, perhaps, that though covetous of wealth, <lb/>
            you have failed on each occasion in acquiring it. But, as I <lb/>
            just now said, it is hard to know such-like matters ; by <lb/>
            placing however (the arguments) in common, it is meet to <lb/>
            consider whether the fact is as you say, or as Cratylus.</p>
          <p>Herm. In good truth, Socrates, although I have frequently <lb/>
            disputed with this person and many others, I cannot be per­ <lb/>
            suaded that there is any other propriety of appellation, than <lb/>
            through convention and common consent. For to me it ap­ <lb/>
            pears, that the name, which any one assigns to a thing, is the <lb/>
            proper one; and that, if he should even change it to another, <note type="footnote"> 2 Respecting this Hipponicus, Heindorf refers to Thucyd. in. 91; <lb/>

            be no less right than the former ; just as we are accustomed <lb/>
            to change the names of our servants, 7 land the name so <lb/>

            from any other person whatever.</p>
          <p>[4.] Soc. Perhaps, Hermogenes, you say something (to the <lb/>
            purpose). Let us then consider, Is that the name of a thing, <lb/>
            which any one puts on each thing as its appellation?</p>

          <p>Soc. And this, whether a private person so calls it, or <lb/>
            a state ?</p>
          <p>Herm. So I say.</p>
          <p>Soc. What then, if I should give a name to whatever that <lb/>
            exists, in such a manner, as to denominate that a horse, <lb/>
            which we now call a man, and that a man, which we now <lb/>

            name of horse ? Do you say so ?</p>
          <p>Herm. It appears so to me.</p>
          <p>Soc. Tell me then, do you say it is a thing, to speak true <lb/>
            and false?</p>
          <p>Herm. I do.</p>
          <p>Soc. There will then be a discourse, one true but another <lb/>
            false.</p>
          <p>Herm. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Will not that discourse then, which speaks of things <lb/>

          <p>Soc. It is then permitted to call a name true and false, <lb/>
            since (we can call) a discourse so.</p>
          <p>Herm. How not ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Is that, which each person says is the name of a <lb/>
            thing, the name of each thing ?</p>
          <p>Herm. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Will there be as many names to a thing, as any per­ <lb/>

          <p>[6.] Herm. I have no other propriety of appellation, So­ <lb/>

            which I assign to it, and you by another, which you (assign) <lb/>
            to it. And after this manner, I see that by each state, names <lb/>
            are assigned individually, sometimes9 to the same things, both <lb/>

          <p>Soc. Come, let us see, Hermogenes, whether things that <lb/>
            are, appear to you to exist in such a manner, 11 with respect <lb/>
            to the peculiar essence of each," as Protagoras said, when he <lb/>
            asserted that-man was the measure of all things; 12 (and) 13 <lb/>
            that things are to me, such as they appear to me; and that, on <lb/>
            the other hand, they are to you such, as (they appear) to you ; <lb/>
            or do some of these seem to you to possess a certain stability <lb/>
            of existence ?</p>
          <p>Herm. Already, Socrates, I have, through doubting, been <lb/>
            led to this, which Protagoras asserts ;14 but yet this does not <lb/>
            perfectly appear to me to be the case.</p>
          <p>[7.] Soc. But what, have you ever been led to this, so that <lb/>
            it never seemed to you that a man existed perfectly evil ?</p>
          <p>Herm. Never, by Zeus! But I have often had this feel­ <lb/>
            ing, so as to think, that there are some men, and very many <lb/>
            too, profoundly wicked.</p>
          <p>Soc. But what, have there never seemed to you to be men <lb/>
            very good ?</p>
          <p>Herm. Very few, indeed.</p>
          <p>Soc. Yet they have seemed to be?</p>
          <p>Herm. Yes, to me.</p>
          <p>Soc. How, then, do you establish this? Is it.thus? That <lb/>
            the very good are very prudent, and the very bad are very <lb/>
            imprudent ?</p>
          <p>Herm. It appears so to me.</p>
          <p>Soc. Is it possible then, if Protagoras speaks the truth, and <lb/>
            this is the truth itself that each16 thing is such, as it ap­ <lb/>

          <p>[8.] Herm. By no means.</p>
          <p>Soc. And this, as I think, appears perfectly evident to you, <lb/>
            that, since prudence and imprudence exist, it is not possible <lb/>
            for Protagoras to speak the truth entirely; for one person will <lb/>
            not in truth be more prudent than another, if that, which <lb/>
            seems to each one, is to each one true.</p>
          <p>Herm. It is so.</p>
          <p>Soc. I think however you will not, according to the theory <lb/>
            of Euthydemus,17 imagine that all things exist to all persons <lb/>
            in a similar manner, and at the same time,18 and always; for <lb/>
            thus some persons would not be good, and others bad, if virtue <lb/>
            and vice existed to all persons, and in a similar manner, and <lb/>
            always inherent in all things.</p>
          <p>Herm. You speak the truth.</p>
          <p>Soc. If then neither all things exist similarly and at the <lb/>
            same time, and always to all persons, 'nor each thing is what <lb/>
            it seems to each person,19 it is evident that there are things, <lb/>
            which possess themselves a certain firm existence of their <lb/>
            own; and this not as regards us, nor by being drawn up­ <lb/>

          <p>Herm. This appears to me, Socrates, to be the case.</p>

          <p>Herm. They are perfectly so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Actions too are performed then according to their own <lb/>
            nature, (and) not according to our opinion. As, for instance, <lb/>
            if we should attempt to cut any of things existing, whether <lb/>
            must each (particular) be cut as we please, and with what we <lb/>
            please ? or if we should desire to cut any thing, 21 according <lb/>
            to its nature of being cut, and with the (instrument) of which <lb/>
            it is the nature to cut,21 22 shall we both cut and will some­ <lb/>
            thing more take place, and shall we do this rightly?22 But if <lb/>
            (we wish to act) contrary to nature, shall we (not) err, and <lb/>
            effect nothing ?</p>
          <p>Herm. To me it appears so.</p>
          <p>Soc. If then we should attempt to burn any thing, we <lb/>
            ought not to burn it, according to every opinion, but according <lb/>
            to that which is the right one; 23and this is in the way, in <lb/>
            which each thing is by nature to be burnt and burn, and <lb/>
            with what it is by nature.23</p>

          <p>Herm. Entirely so.</p>

          <p>Herm. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Soc. And (to make) a name (it is the business) of the <lb/>

          <p>Herm. Such is the case.</p>
          <p>[17.] Soc. It nearly appears then, Hermogenes, that the <lb/>
            imposition of names is not, as you'think it, an affair of no mo­ <lb/>
            ment, nor for men of no mark, nor of such as may be met <lb/>
            with any where. And Cratylus speaks truly, when he says <lb/>
            that names belong to things from nature; and that every one <lb/>
            is not the artificer of names, but he alone, who looks to that <lb/>
            name, which is naturally suited to each thing, and who is able <lb/>
            to mould its form into letters and syllables.</p>
          <p>Herm. I know not, Socrates, how I ought to oppose myself <lb/>
            to what you are saying. It is not however easy perhaps to <lb/>
            be thus suddenly persuaded. But I think I should be more <lb/>
            easily persuaded by you, if you could show me what is that <lb/>
            which you call a natural propriety of appellation.</p>
          <p>Soc. I myself, 0 blessed Hermogenes, say there is none. <lb/>
            But you have forgotten, what I said a short time previously, <lb/>
            that I knew nothing, but would consider the matter together <lb/>
            with you. But now, to myself and you considering well the <lb/>
            question together,45 thus much appears contrary to our former <lb/>
            opinion, that the name possesses some natural propriety, and <note type="footnote"> 15 Ficinus has " mihi et tibi simul investigantibus." From whence it <lb/>

            that it is not for every man to know how to give a name to <lb/>
            any thing whatever correctly. Or is it not so ?</p>
          <p>Herm. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>[18.] Soc. It is necessary then to inquire, if you desire to <lb/>
            know it, after this, in what does the propriety of a name <lb/>
            consist.46</p>
          <p>Herm. But I do desire to know it.</p>
          <p>Soc. Consider then.</p>
          <p>Herm. How must I consider ?</p>
          <p>Soc. The most correct inquiry, my friend, (will be) with <lb/>
            those, who know through your telling out money to them, and <lb/>
            giving them thanks. These are the sophists, to whom your <lb/>
            brother Callias told out a mint of money, and (now) appears <lb/>
            to be a wise man. But, since you are not the master of your <lb/>
            patrimony,48 you must earnestly entreat your brother, and <lb/>
            be- of him to show you the. propriety respecting things of this <lb/>
            kind, which he has learned from Protagoras.</p>
          <p>Herm. But this request of mine would be absurd, Socrates, <lb/>
            if, when I reject entirely The Truth "49 of Protagoras, I <lb/>
            should embrace what is stated in such a truth,50 as things of <lb/>
            any value.</p>
          <p>[19.] Soc. But if this does not please you, we must learn <lb/>
            from Homer, and the other poets.</p>
          <p>Herm. And what says Homer, Socrates, about names; and <lb/>
            where ?</p>
          <p>Soc. In many places. But those are the chief and most <lb/>
            beautiful (passages), in which he distinguishes between the <lb/>
            names, which men and gods assign to the same things. Or <lb/>

            in those passages relating to the propriety of names ? For it <lb/>
            is evident surely that the gods call things according to the <lb/>
            propriety which names naturally possess. Or do you not <lb/>
            think so ?</p>
          <p>Herm. I well know, that if (the gods) call any thing by a <lb/>
            name, they call it so correctly. But of what passages are you <lb/>
            speaking ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Do you not know, that when speaking of the river at <lb/>
            Troy, which fought in a single combat with Hephæstos, (Vul­ <lb/>
            can,) he says, (11. xx. 74,) <lb/>
            Whom gods call Xanthus, but Scamander, men.</p>
          <p>Herm. I do. What then?51</p>
          <p>Soc.. Do you not think that this is something of high im­ <lb/>
            port, to know in what way it is right to call that river <lb/>
            Xanthus, rather than Scamander ? [20.] Or, if you prefer it, <lb/>
            in the case of the bird, which he says, (II. xx. 291,) <lb/>
            Chalcis the gods, but men Kymindis call. <lb/>
            Do you think this is a trifling piece of learning, (to know) <lb/>
            how much more proper it is to call the same bird Chalcis than <lb/>
            Cymindis, or Myrine than Batiea;52 and there are many <lb/>
            other (passages), both in this poet and in others. But these <lb/>
            things are perhaps too great for me and you to discover. But <lb/>
            the names Scamandrius and Astyanax are, as it appears to <lb/>
            me, more for a (common) man to investigate and more easy <lb/>
            (to see), what is the propriety of the names, which, he says, <lb/>
            were given to the son of Hector. For you doubtless know <lb/>
            the verses, in which are the names I am speaking of.</p>
          <p>Herm. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Which then of these names do you think Homer con­ <lb/>
            sidered as more correctly given to the boy, Astyanax or <lb/>
            Scamandrius ?</p>
          <p>Herm. I cannot tell.</p>
          <p>Soc. But reflect in this way. If any one should ask you, <lb/>
            whether you thought the more wise or the less wise would <lb/>
            call things in the more correct manner ? <note type="footnote"> 51 I have adopted with the Zurich editors Heindorfs suggestion in as­ <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Herm. It is manifest I should answer, the more wise.</p>
          <p>[21.] Soc. Whether then do women, or men, to speak of <lb/>
            the whole (human) race, appear to you to be the wiser in <lb/>
            cities ?53</p>
          <p>Herm. The men.</p>
          <p>Soc. Do you not then know, that Homer says that the son <lb/>
            of Hector was called by the men of Troy,54 Astyanax, but <lb/>
            Scamandrius, 55it is plain,55 by the women ; since the men' <lb/>
            were wont to call him Astyanax.</p>
          <p>Herm. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Do you not then conceive that Homer considered the <lb/>
            men of Troy wiser than the women ?</p>
          <p>Herm. I think so.</p>
          <p>Soc. He therefore thought that the name Astyanax was <lb/>
            more correctly given to the boy than Scamandrius.</p>
          <p>Herm. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Soc. But let us consider why he did so. Or does he not <lb/>
            himself give the best explanation for the reason? For he <lb/>
            says, <lb/>
            To throw a bulwark he alone was found, <lb/>
            The city's gates57 and the long walls around.</p>
          <p>On this account then, as it seems, it is proper to call the son <lb/>
            of the saviour, Astyanax; of that58 which, as Homer says, <lb/>
            his father preserved.</p>
          <p>[22.] Herm. So it appears to me. <note type="footnote"> 53 i. e. in a civilized state. </note><note type="footnote"> 54 In II. xxii. 506. </note><note type="footnote"> 55—55 The words <foreign xml:lang="grc">δῆλον</foreign> on are omitted in MS. Gud. and the version <lb/>

          <p>Herm. By Zeus, I do not.</p>
          <p>Soc. But, my good (friend), Homer has himself given to <lb/>
            Hector his name.</p>
          <p>Herm. Why so ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Because it appears to me that this name (of Hector)59 <lb/>
            is something similar to Astyanax, 60and these names appear <lb/>
            to be Greek; for king and Hector signify nearly the same <lb/>
            thing; both the names to be royal.60 For over whatsoever <lb/>
            one is a king, he is also doubtless a Hector over it; since he <lb/>
            evidently rules over it, 61 possesses and has it.61 Or do I ap­ <lb/>
            pear to you to say nothing to the purpose, but unconsciously <lb/>
            (err), in thinking I have hit upon, as it were, the track of <lb/>
            Homer's thoughts respecting the propriety of names ?</p>
          <p>Herm. By Zeus, not you indeed, as it seems to me; but <lb/>
            perhaps you have hit upon something.</p>
          <p>Soc. For it is just, as it appears to me, to call the offspring <lb/>
            of a lion, a lion, and the offspring of a horse, a horse. I do <lb/>
            not mean, should something else than a horse be produced, <lb/>
            like a monster, from a horse, but I speak of that which should <lb/>

            of the rumour 86 contributed to some such appellation. But it <lb/>
            appears that the name of him, who was called his father, was <lb/>
            made in. an all-beautiful manner. It is however by no means <lb/>
            easy to understand it. For in reality the name of Zeus is, as it <lb/>
            were, a sentence; and persons dividing it into two parts, <lb/>
            some of us make use of one part, and some of another; for <lb/>
            some call him <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ζὴν</foreign>, and some <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δίς</foreign>. But these parts collected <lb/>
            into one, exhibit the nature of the god; which, as we have <lb/>
            said, a name ought and should be able to do. For there is no <lb/>
            one, who is more the cause of living, both to us and every <lb/>
            thing else, than he who is the ruler and king of all.87 [29.] It <lb/>
            follows therefore that this god is rightly named, through <lb/>
            whom life is present to all living beings; but the name, <lb/>
            though one, is distributed, as I have said, into two parts, Dis <lb/>
            and Zen. Now he, who hears on a sudden that this god is <lb/>
            the Son of Kronos, may perhaps think it an insulting asser­ <lb/>
            tion. But it is according to reason for Zeus to be the off­ <lb/>
            spring of some great intellect. Now Koros88 does not signify <lb/>
            a boy, but the pure and unmixed nature of intellect. Now he <lb/>
            (Kronos) is the son of Ouranus (Heaven): and the sight <lb/>
            directed to things above has fairly a right to be called by <lb/>
            this name, Ourania (heavenly), from beholding things on <lb/>
            high. From whence too, Hermogenes, they who discourse <lb/>
            on sublime affairs, say that a pure intellect is present with <note type="footnote"> 86 I cannot understand <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ τύχη τῆς φήμης</foreign>. I could however <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ τῆς τύχης <lb/>

              him, and that the name of Ouranus90 is very properly given <lb/>
              to him. Indeed, if I had remembered Hesiod's genealogy of <lb/>
              the gods, (and)91 whom he mentions as their still preceding <lb/>
              progenitors, I should not have desisted from showing you <lb/>
              how correctly their names have been laid down, until I had <lb/>
              made trial of this wisdom, what it will effect, whether it faints <lb/>
              or not, which has now recently come upon me so suddenly, I <lb/>
              know not from whence.</p>
          <p>[30.] Herm. Indeed, Socrates, you really appear to me to <lb/>
            speak oracles on a sudden, like those inspired by a god.</p>
          <p>Soc. And the reason I assign,92 Hermogenes, is, that <lb/>
            this wisdom has come upon me through Euthyphron of the <lb/>
            ward of Prospaltius:93 for I was much with him in the <lb/>
            morning, and I gave him my ears.94 It nearly appears then, <lb/>
            that, being divinely inspired, he has not only filled my ears <lb/>
            with divine wisdom, but laid hold also of my very soul. It <lb/>
            appears therefore to me, that we ought to act in this way; to <lb/>
            make use of this wisdom to-day, and to contemplate what yet <lb/>
            remains concerning the propriety of names; but to-morrow, <lb/>
            if it seems good to you, we will send it away (as a pollution), <lb/>
            and purify ourselves from it, after finding out a person who is <lb/>

            the priests, or the sophists.</p>

            selves will testify in our favour, that they were not entirely <lb/>
            fabricated from chance, but possess a certain propriety? [31.] <lb/>
            Now the names that are mentioned of heroes and men would <lb/>
            perhaps deceive us; for many of these exist according to the <lb/>
            appellations of their ancestors, and do not suit some persons,96 <lb/>
            as we stated at the commencement. But many assume them, <lb/>
            as matters of boasting,97 such as Eutychides (the son of the <lb/>
            fortunate), Sosias (the son of the saved), and Theophilus <lb/>
            (the god beloved), and many others. Such then as these, it <lb/>
            appears to me, we ought to dismiss. But it is most probable <lb/>
            that we shall find names properly imposed, respecting things <lb/>
            existing for ever, and naturally produced; for in these it is <lb/>
            especially fitting for the imposition of names to be a careful <lb/>
            study. But perhaps some of these have been given by a <lb/>
            power more divine than that of man.</p>
          <p>Herm. You appear to me, Socrates, to speak well.</p>
          <p>Soc. Will it not then be just, to begin from the gods, when <lb/>
            we are considering that very thing, why the gods are properly <lb/>
            called by that name ?</p>
          <p>Herm. It will be reasonable.</p>
          <p>Soc. I suspect then it is of this kind. It appears to me <lb/>
            that the first men of those connected with Greece, considered <lb/>
            those only as gods, whom many at present of the Barbarians <lb/>
            do; the sun, and the moon, and the earth, and the stars, and <lb/>
            the heavens. Now as they perceived all these moving and <lb/>
            running round in a perpetual course, from this nature of run­ <lb/>
            ning they called them gods;98 but afterwards, perceiving that <lb/>
            there were others, they called all of them by the same name. <lb/>

          <p>Soc. Now in good truth, Hermogenes, what does the word <lb/>

          <p>Soc. But know you not that he says, the golden race of <lb/>
            men was first created ?</p>
          <p>Herm. This I know.</p>
          <p>Soc. He says, then, concerning it,99 <lb/>
            But when concealed had Destiny this race, <lb/>
            Daemons there were, called holy, upon earth <lb/>
            Good, ill-averters, and of man the guard.</p>
          <p>Herm. What then ?</p>
          <p>Soc. I think he calls the race golden, not as being naturally <lb/>
            of gold, but as being beautiful and good. And I infer this, <lb/>
            from his calling us an iron race.</p>
          <p>Herm. You speak the truth.</p>
          <p>Soc. Do you not then think, that if any one of those living <lb/>
            now were good, Hesiod would say he was of that golden race ?</p>
          <p>Herm. Probably.</p>
          <p>Soc. But are the good any other than the prudent ?</p>
          <p>Herm. The prudent.</p>
          <p>[33.] Soc. On this account then, especially, as it appears <lb/>
            to me, he speaks of them as daemons ; because they were <lb/>
            (dæmones) prudent and learned. And, in our old language, <lb/>
            this very name occurs. Hence both lie, and many other <lb/>
            poets, say well, who say that when a good man shall have <lb/>
            reached his end, he receives a mighty destiny and honour, <lb/>
            and becomes a daemon, according to the appellation of pru­ <lb/>

          <p>Herm. And I, Socrates, seem to myself to give entirely <lb/>
            the same vote with you on this point. But what can the <lb/>
            name of hero be ?</p>
          <p>Soc. This is by no means difficult to understand. For <lb/>
            their name is drawn aside a little, showing that its origin is <lb/>
            from love.</p>
          <p>Herm. How is this ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Do you not know that heroes are demigods ?</p>
          <p>Herm. What then ?</p>
          <p>[34.] Soc. All of them were doubtless begotten either <lb/>
            from a god falling in love with a mortal woman, or from a <lb/>
            mortal man (falling in love) with a goddess. If then you <lb/>
            consider the matter according to the old Attic language, this <lb/>
            too you will more clearly understand. For it will show you <lb/>
            that the word (hero) is slightly drawn aside, for the sake of <lb/>
            the name,2 from the word love, through which the heroes were <lb/>
            begotten. And either this says the heroes,3 or because they <lb/>
            were wise and rhetoricians, powerful and skilled in dialec­ <lb/>

            difficult to understand; but rather this respecting men, why <lb/>
            they are called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄνθϱωποι</foreign>. Can you tell the reason ?</p>
          <p>Herm. From whence, my good (man), can I ? And in­ <lb/>
            deed were I at all able to find this out, I shall not exert my­ <lb/>
            self, through my thinking that you will more easily discover <lb/>
            it than myself.</p>
          <p>Soc. You appear to me to rely on the inspiration of Euthy­ <lb/>
            phron.</p>
          <p>Herm. Evidently so.</p>
          <p>Soc. And rightly relying. For I now seem to myself to <lb/>
            understand it in a clever manner; and I shall run the risk, if <lb/>
            I do not take care, of becoming to-day wiser than is fitting. <lb/>
            [35.] But consider what I am saying. For this ought in the <lb/>
            first place to be understood concerning names, that we often <lb/>
            introduce letters, and (often)7 take some away, while we give <lb/>
            names, as we please: and (often)8 change the acute syllables. <lb/>
            As when we say <foreign xml:lang="grc">Διἵ φίλος</foreign> (a friend of Dis): for, in order <lb/>
            that there may be a noun instead of a verb, we take away the <lb/>
            second <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰῶτα</foreign>, and, instead of an acute syllable in the middle, <lb/>
            we pronounce a grave one. But on the contrary, in others <lb/>
            we introduce letters, and others again, with a graver accent, <lb/>
            we pronounce with a more acute one.9</p>
          <p>Herm. You speak the truth.</p>
          <p>Soc. Of these things one, as it appears to me, takes place <lb/>
            in the name <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄνθϱωπος</foreign> (man): for a noun is generated from a <lb/>
            verb, one letter, a,. being taken away,10 and the end of the <lb/>
            word becoming more grave.</p>
          <p>Herm. How do you mean ? <note type="footnote"> 6 The MSS. vary between <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐϱωτητικοὶ</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐϱωτικοί</foreign>. Ficinus found both <lb/>

            11 and at the same time contemplates and reasons upon what he <lb/>

            after this, (and) which I would very gladly hear ?</p>
          <p>Soc. By all means.</p>
          <p>Herm. As then there appears to me to be something in <lb/>
            order after these; for we surely call the soul and body of man <lb/>
            by some name.13</p>
          <p>Soc. How not ?</p>
          <p>Herm. Let us, then, endeavour to divide these too, as we <lb/>
            did the former subjects.</p>
          <p>Soc. Do you say that you have considered14 first the soul, that <lb/>
            it has with reason this name, and afterwards so has the body?12</p>
          <p>Herm. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. To speak then off-hand, I think that those, who called <lb/>
            the soul by that name, understood some such thing as this; <lb/>
            that whenever it is present to the body, it is the cause of its <lb/>
            life, giving it the power to breathe, and cooling it; but as <lb/>
            soon as the cooling power ceases, the body is dissolved and <lb/>
            comes to an end. From whence, as it appears to me, they <note type="footnote"> 11__11 This clause is omitted by Ficinus, and after him by Taylor. <lb/>
            By its aid, however, we can restore what Plato wrote—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ δὲ ἄνθϱωπος ἅμα <lb/>
            ὄπωπε</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῦτο δὲ ἔστι</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑώϱακε</foreign>. For it is evident that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑώρακε</foreign>, the more <lb/>

            that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄπωπε</foreign> would be mentioned here as being one of the words, from <lb/>
            which <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄνθϱ-ωπος</foreign> is supposed to be derived. With regard to this descrip­ <lb/>

            called more elegantly <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψυχή</foreign>.16</p>
          <p>17 Herm. Entirely so ; and this latter appellation appears to <lb/>

          <p>Soc. For it is certainly so. It would however appear to <lb/>

              with common sense. He did not perceive that Plato wrote <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πόλλ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔχειν <lb/>

              The followers however of Orpheus appear to me to have <lb/>
              founded this name, especially since the soul suffers a punish­ <lb/>

              that we know nothing of the gods either themselves or the names <lb/>
              by which they call themselves; for it is evident that they call <lb/>
              themselves by correct names. But the second mode of pro­ <lb/>
              priety consists in our calling the gods by those names, by which <lb/>
              there is a law for us to invoke them in our prayers, whatever <lb/>
              they are, and by whatever name they like to be addressed, <lb/>

              let us consider this point, having previously, as it were, de­ <lb/>

            '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εστία</foreign> (Hestia), sacrificed to Hestia before all the gods. But <lb/>
            they who called it '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ωσία</foreign> (Osia), would nearly, according to <lb/>
            Heraclitus, consider that all things move, and nothing is at <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ὠθου̃ν</foreign> (the pushing on): and hence they very properly <lb/>

          <p>Soc. It is almost ridiculous to mention it; and yet I think <lb/>
            it has some plausibility.</p>
          <p>Herm. What is this ?</p>
          <p>Soc. I seem to myself to see Heracleitus speaking artlessly31 <note type="footnote"> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign> is found in the Doric of Archytas and Ocellus, quoted by <lb/>

            some old wise saw about Kronos and Rhea, which Homer too <lb/>
            asserts.</p>
          <p>Herm. How say you this ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Heracleitus says some where that all things move, and <lb/>
            nothing is at rest; and comparing things to the flowing <lb/>
            of a river, observes that " Thou canst not twice into the <lb/>
            same stream go." 32</p>
          <p>Herm. Such is the fact.</p>
          <p>Soc. What then, does he appear to you to think differently <lb/>
            from Heracleitus, who gave the names of Rhea and Kronos to <lb/>
            the progenitors of the other gods ? And do you think that <lb/>
            Heracleitus by chance assigned to both of them the names of <lb/>
            flowing streams?33 As then34 Homer (II. xiv. 201) calls <lb/>
            Ocean the generation of the gods, and Tethys their mother, <lb/>
            so I think the same is asserted by Hesiod.35 Likewise <lb/>
            Orpheus says some where, <lb/>
            Ocean with lovely streams did first begin <lb/>
            Marriage, and wedded Tethys, sister-kin. <lb/>
            Consider then, how all these harmonize with each, and all <lb/>
            tend to the doctrine of Heracleitus.</p>
          <p>[42.] Herm. You appear to me, Socrates, to say something <lb/>
            to the purpose. I do not however understand what the name <lb/>
            Tethys means.</p>
          <p>Soc. Surely it nearly implies this of itself, that there is a <lb/>
            name of a fountain concealed; for that which is percolated,36 <lb/>
            and strained through, is the representation of a fountain ; and <lb/>

          <p>Herm. This, Socrates, is elegant.</p>
          <p>Soc. How is not about to be?38 But what is after this? <lb/>
            Of Zeus we have already spoken.</p>
          <p>Herm. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Let us then speak of his brothers, Poseidon and Pluto, <lb/>
            and of that other name 39 by which he is called.</p>
          <p>Herm. By all means.</p>
          <p>Soc. The name then of Poseidon appears to me to have <lb/>
            been given by40 the party first naming it, because the nature <lb/>
            of the sea stopped him when walking, and did not permit <lb/>
            him to proceed any further, but became as it were a chain to <lb/>
            his feet. He therefore denominated the ruler of this power <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ποσειδω̃ν</foreign>, as <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ποσί-δεσμος ὣν</foreign> being (a foot-chainer). But the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ε</foreign> was perhaps added for the sake of elegance. And perhaps <lb/>
            too it would not mean this ; but two XX were originally spoken <lb/>
            instead of a ; signifying that this god is much-knowing.41 <lb/>
            And perhaps likewise he was denominated <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀσείων</foreign> (the shak­ <lb/>
            ing), from <foreign xml:lang="grc">σείειν</foreign> (to shake), and 7r and <foreign xml:lang="grc">δ</foreign> were added.42 [43.] <lb/>
            But <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πλούτων</foreign> (Pluto) was so called from the gift of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πλου̃τος</foreign> <lb/>
            (wealth), because riches are dug out of the bowels of the <lb/>
            earth.43 But by the appellation <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αἶδης</foreign>, the multitude appear <lb/>
            to me to understand that <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἀειδὲς</foreign>44 was spoken of, and that, <lb/>
            being terrified at this name, they call him Pluto.</p>
          <p>Herm. But how does it seem, Socrates, to you ?</p>
          <p>Soc. In many ways do men appear to me indeed to have <lb/>
            erred about the power of this god, and to have a fear of him, <lb/>
            who is not worthy of it. For they fear that, when any one <note type="footnote"> 38 Heind. was the first to restore Ti <foreign xml:lang="grc">δ</foreign>' of <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέλλει</foreign> instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέλλω</foreign> from <lb/>

            But all these things, the empire of the god, and his name, <lb/>
            appear to me to tend to something the same.</p>
          <p>Herm. How so ?</p>
          <p>Soc. I will tell you what appears to me. For tell me, <lb/>
            Which of these is the stronger bond to any animal whatever, <lb/>
            so as to cause it to remain in any place whatever, necessity, <lb/>
            or desire ?</p>
          <p>Herm. Desire, Socrates, is by far the superior.</p>
          <p>[44.] Soc. Do you not think that many would fly from <lb/>
            Hades, unless it held those who go thither by the strongest <lb/>
            bond?</p>
          <p>Herm. This is evident.</p>
          <p>Soc. It binds them then, as it appears, by a certain desire; <lb/>
            since it binds them with the greatest bond, and not with <lb/>
            necessity.</p>
          <p>Herm. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Now are there not many desires ?</p>
          <p>Herm. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. It binds them therefore with the greatest of all desires, <lb/>
            if it is about to bind them with the greatest of bonds.</p>
          <p>Herm. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Is there then any greater desire, than when any one, <lb/>
            by associating with another, thinks that, through him, he shall <lb/>
            become a better man ?</p>
          <p>Hewn. By Zeus, Socrates, there is not any whatever.</p>
          <p>Soc. On this account, Hermogenes, let us say, that not one <lb/>

            it is not even in this way. But he called her <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεονόη</foreign>, as she <lb/>
            understood divine concerns better than all the rest. Nor is <lb/>
            it far off to say that he was willing to call intelligence <lb/>

            But either the founder himself, or some persons afterwards, <lb/>
            turned the name aside to something more beautiful, as they <lb/>
            thought, and called her <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀθηνάα</foreign> (Athena).</p>

            who in his upper parts is smooth, but in his lower parts <lb/>
            rough and goat-formed: and Pan is either speech, or the <lb/>
            brother of speech, since he is the son of Hermes. But it is <lb/>
            by no means wonderful that brother should be similar to <lb/>
            brother. However, as I just now said, 0 blessed man ! let <lb/>
            us free ourselves from the gods.</p>
          <p>Herm. From gods of this kind, if you please, Socrates. <note type="footnote"> 101 How speech can be said to signify the all, is beyond my compre­ <lb/>

            general idea, it may be compared with what Pope says in his Abelard <lb/>

            " Speed the soft intercourse of soul with soul, <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">῞Ηλιος</foreign> (sun), and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σελήνη</foreign> (moon), and <foreign xml:lang="grc">῎Αστρα</foreign> (stars), and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γῆ</foreign> <lb/>

          <p>Soc. You enjoin me many things; still if it will gratify <lb/>
            you, I am willing (to speak).5</p>
          <p>Herm. You will indeed gratify me.</p>
          <p>[56.] Soc. What then do you wish the first ? Or shall we <lb/>
            discuss as you have enumerated, (first) the sun ?</p>
          <p>Herm. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Soc. It seems then that this would become more manifest, <lb/>
            if one should use the Doric name: for the Dorians call the sun <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">῞ Αλιος</foreign>. He will therefore be <foreign xml:lang="grc">῞Αλιος</foreign>, from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁλίζειν</foreign> (collecting) <lb/>
            men into one spot when he rises; and he would be so, from <lb/>
            always <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἱλεῖν</foreign> (revolving) while going round the earth. And <lb/>
            he would seem to be so, because in going he causes to be vari­ <lb/>
            ous the productions of the earth. Now the verbs <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποικίλλειν</foreign> <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰολεῖν</foreign> have the same meaning.</p>
          <p>Herm. But what will you say of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σελήνη</foreign> (moon) ?</p>
          <p>Soc. This name seems to press upon Anaxagoras.</p>
          <p>Herm. Why?</p>
          <p>Soc. It seems to indicate something of a more ancient <lb/>
            date than 6 what he lately stated, that the moon obtains her <lb/>
            light from the sun.</p>
          <p>Herm. But how ?</p>
          <p>Soc. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σέλας</foreign> is the same with <foreign xml:lang="grc">φῶς</foreign> (light).</p>
          <p>Herm. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. Now this light about the moon is perpetually <foreign xml:lang="grc">νέον</foreign> <lb/>
            (new), and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔνον</foreign> (old),7 if the Anaxagoreans say true; for, <lb/>
            perpetually revolving in a circle, she perpetually renews this <lb/>
            light; but the light of the former month becomes old.</p>
          <p>Herm. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Soc.

            but compressed together it is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σελαναία</foreign>.</p>
          <p>[57.] Herm. This name, Socrates, is dithyrambic. But <lb/>
            what will you say of <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μὴν</foreign> (month), and<foreign xml:lang="grc">῎Αστρα</foreign> (stars)?</p>
          <p>Soc. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μεὶς</foreign> (month) would be properly called <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεἷης</foreign>, from <foreign xml:lang="grc">μει­ <lb/>
            οῦσθαι</foreign> (to be diminished) ;9 but <foreign xml:lang="grc">῎Αστρα</foreign> (stars) appear to derive <lb/>
            their name from <foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽Αστραπὴ</foreign> (lightning). Now <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀστϱαπὴ</foreign> would be <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναστρωπὴ</foreign>, because it <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὦπα ἀναστϱέφει</foreign> (turns the eyes); but <lb/>
            being formed with elegance, it is now called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀστϱαπή</foreign>.</p>
          <p>Herm. But what (are) <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πῦρ</foreign> (fire) and <foreign xml:lang="grc">῞Υδωϱ</foreign> (water) ?</p>
          <p>Soc. About <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πῦρ</foreign> (fire) I am at a loss; and it nearly appears, <lb/>
            that either the Muse of Euthyphro has deserted me, or this <lb/>
            word is very difficult. Behold then the artifice which I in­ <lb/>
            troduce in all such cases where I am at a loss.</p>
          <p>Herm. What is it ?</p>
          <p>Soc. I will tell you. Answer me then. Do you know on <lb/>
            what account <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πῦρ</foreign> (fire) was so called ?</p>
          <p>Herm. By Zeus, not I.</p>
          <p>Soc. Consider then what my suspicions are concerning it. <lb/>
            For I think that the Greeks, especially such as dwelt under <lb/>
            the Barbarians, received many of their names from the <lb/>
            Barbarians.</p>
          <p>Herm. What then ?</p>
          <p>[58.] Soc. Should any one then investigate how reasonably <lb/>
            these names were given according to the Greek language, and <lb/>
            not according to that from which the name happens to come, <lb/>
            you know he would be at a loss.</p>
          <p>Herm. Very likely.</p>
          <p>Soc. Consider then, whether this name, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πῦρ</foreign> (fire), is not of <lb/>
            Barbaric origin. For it is by no means easy to adapt this to <lb/>
            the Greek language. But the Phrygians are thus clearly call­ <lb/>
            ing fire, with a trifling deviation, and the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕδωρ</foreign> (water), <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">κύνες</foreign> (dogs), 10 and many other names.</p>
          <p>Herm. They are so. <note type="footnote"> 9 How the idea of diminution came to be connected with the name of a <lb/>

          <p>Soc. It is not proper then to use violence with these words; <lb/>

            fore I reject the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">πῦϱ</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕδωϱ</foreign>. But <foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽Αὴρ</foreign> (air), Her­ <lb/>

            the earth; or because <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀεὶ ῥεῖ</foreign> (it always flows); or because, <lb/>
            from its flowing, a breathing is produced: for the poets14 call <lb/>
            winds <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀῆται</foreign> (breathings). Perhaps then it means as if a <lb/>
            person 15 should say <foreign xml:lang="grc">πνευματόϱϱουν</foreign> (a flowing breathing), or <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀητόϱϱουν</foreign> (a flowing wind), 16 [from whence he wishes to call <lb/>
            it thus, because it is <foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽Αήϱ</foreign>].16 But I consider <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰθὴϱ</foreign> (æther) in <lb/>
            some way as this; because <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀεὶ θεῖ περὶ τὸν ἀέϱα ῥέων</foreign> (it always <lb/>
            runs and flows about the air), it would be called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀειθεήρ</foreign>. [59.] <lb/>
            But <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γῆ</foreign> (earth), more plainly indicates its meaning, if any one <lb/>
            calls it <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γαῖα</foreign>. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">γαῖα</foreign> would be properly called <foreign xml:lang="grc">γεννήτειρα</foreign> <lb/>

              was imposed on the perception of what is just. But what is <lb/>
              just in itself, it is difficult (to say) :49 for it appears to be <lb/>
              agreed upon by the multitude up to a certain point; but be­ <lb/>
              yond it to be disputed. For indeed, such as think that the <lb/>
              universe is on a march, conceive the greatest part of it to be <lb/>
              of such a nature, that it does nothing but yield; and that, on <lb/>
              this account, there is something pervading the universe 50 by <lb/>
              which all generated natures are produced; and that this per­ <lb/>
              vading thing is most swift and most attenuated: for otherwise <lb/>
              it would be unable to pass through every thing while going <lb/>
              on, unless it were the most attenuated, so as to hold nothing; <lb/>
              and the most swift, 51 so as to make use of the other things as <lb/>
              if in a state of rest.51 Because therefore it governs all other <lb/>
              things <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαϊὸν</foreign> (by going through), it is properly called <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκαιον</foreign>, <lb/>
              receiving the value of the letter <foreign xml:lang="grc">κ</foreign> for the sake of an elegant <lb/>
              pronunciation. [64.] And thus far, as we have just now <lb/>
              stated, the multitude agree with us, that this is the meaning <lb/>
              of the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκαιον</foreign> (just).52 But I, Hermogenes, being <lb/>

              that this is54 the just and the cause; for that, through which <lb/>
              a thing is generated, is the cause;55 and some one has said <lb/>
              privately, that it was on this account it was (said) so cor­ <lb/>
              rectly. But when, after hearing this, I nevertheless quietly <lb/>
              ask them, What, 0 best of men, is the just, if this is (said) <lb/>
              so correctly ? I seem to inquire beyond what is becoming, and <lb/>
              to leap, as it is said, over the lines dug out; 56 for they say <lb/>
              I have sufficiently inquired and heard, and they endeavour, <lb/>
              through the wish to satisfy me, to say, one one thing, and <lb/>
              another another, and they no longer chime-in together. For <lb/>
              one says that the Sun is <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ δίκαιον</foreign> (the just); for that by it <lb/>
              alone, <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαϊόντα</foreign> (pervading) and <foreign xml:lang="grc">καίοντα</foreign> (burning), it becomes <lb/>
              the guardian of all things. But when, delighted, as having <lb/>
              heard something beautiful, I mention57 this to another <lb/>
              person, the hearer laughs at me,58 and asks me if I think <lb/>
              there is nothing just amongst men, when the sun has set ? <lb/>
              [65.] Upon my begging then (to know) what the other means, <lb/>
              he says it is fire itself.59 But this is by no means easy to <lb/>
              understand. But another person says, it is not fire itself, but <lb/>
              the heat itself which exists in fire. Another again says, that <lb/>
              he laughs at all these opinions; but that the just was that in­ <lb/>
              tellect of which Anaxagoras speaks; for he said that this pos­ <lb/>

            whatever it is, appears to me to show (itself) in <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δειλία</foreign> (timid­ <lb/>
            ity), which we have not yet discussed, but have passed it <lb/>
            over; although it is proper to consider it, after fortitude. <lb/>
            And we likewise seem to have passed over many other names. <lb/>
            Now <foreign xml:lang="grc">δελία</foreign> (timidity) means, that the bond of the soul is <lb/>
            strong: for the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">λίαν</foreign> (vehemently) is (applied to) <lb/>
            strength: and hence the vehement and greatest bond of the <lb/>
            soul will be timidity,77 just as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπορία</foreign> (want) is an evil, and <lb/>
            every thing, as it seems, which is an impediment to [going <lb/>
            and] marching on.78 To go on badly, then, seems to signify <lb/>
            the marching on in a restrained and shackled manner ; which <lb/>
            when the soul suffers,79 it becomes full of <foreign xml:lang="grc">κακίας</foreign> (evil). But <lb/>
            if to such things the name of vice is applicable, the contrary <lb/>
            of this would be <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρετὴ</foreign> (virtue), signifying, in the first place, <lb/>
            ease in marching; and, in the next place, that <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν ῥοὴν</foreign> (the <note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπωνυμίαν ἔχει τη̃ς κακίας</foreign>. Stalbaum's is," hoc a toto maxime appellatur, <lb/>
            hoc est, a pravitate," which I hope he could understand. It is above my <lb/>
            comprehension. Ficinus has, "communiter prava dicetur," which is <lb/>
            evidently a guess at the meaning. </note><note type="footnote"> 77 That Plato would thus, after saying in one sentence that timidity is <lb/>
            the greatest bond of the soul, repeat the very same idea in almost the <lb/>
            next sentence, I for one will never believe ; and still less that in deriving <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δειλία</foreign> from <foreign xml:lang="grc">δει̃ν</foreign> (to bind) and <foreign xml:lang="grc">λίαν</foreign> (vehemently), he would omit one <lb/>
            half of the etymology; and least of all that he would here assert that <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δειλία</foreign> is <foreign xml:lang="grc">τη̃ς ψυχη̃ς δεσμὸς</foreign>, when that is the very proposition to be <lb/>
            proved. There is evidently a lacuna here, which might be thus supplied, <lb/>
            " Now <foreign xml:lang="grc">δειλία</foreign> is some evil of the soul, and signifies, I think, a strong <lb/>
            binding. For <foreign xml:lang="grc">δέος</foreign> (fear), from whence is <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεσμὸς</foreign>, binds the foot, the <lb/>
            tongue, and the mind; and <foreign xml:lang="grc">λίαν</foreign> (vehemently) is applied to strength. <lb/>
            Hence <foreign xml:lang="grc">δειλία</foreign> would be the vehement binding of the soul." That there <lb/>
            was some allusion to <foreign xml:lang="grc">κακὸν</foreign> here, is evident from the subsequent expres­ <lb/>
            sion, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕσπερ ἐστὶ καὶ ἡἀπορία κακόν</foreign> ; and it is equally evident that some <lb/>
            affinity was pointed out between <foreign xml:lang="grc">δειλία</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">δέος</foreign>, of which the Etymol. </note><note type="footnote"> M. says that it is derived, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸ</foreign> TOV <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεσμεύειν ὁγὰρ φόβος συνδει̃ τοὺς <lb/>

            tia ; atque hoc nomen mora syllabæ ov est mutatum." But what he meant <lb/>
            by those words I confess myself unable to explain. For, 1. <foreign xml:lang="grc">λέγει</foreign> wants <lb/>
            its nominative. 2. Even if <foreign xml:lang="grc">λέγει αϱμονίᾳ</foreign> could mean " dicit numeri <lb/>
            gratia," <foreign xml:lang="grc">κα</foreign>ì <foreign xml:lang="grc">μήκει</foreign> would not be thus separated from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁϱμονίᾳ</foreign>, especially <lb/>
            if <foreign xml:lang="grc">μήκει</foreign> means, as Buttmann and Heindorf, whom Stalbaum follows, un­ <lb/>
            derstand it, the metrical quantity of a syllable. 3. A nominative is re­ <lb/>
            quired for <foreign xml:lang="grc">παϱη̃κται</foreign> : and lastly, <foreign xml:lang="grc">παϱη̃κται</foreign> does not mean " mutatum <lb/>
            for <foreign xml:lang="grc">παϱάγειν</foreign> is, etymologically speaking, " to derive." Correctly then <lb/>
            did Heindorf conceive the whole passage to be most obscure and corrupt. <lb/>
            And so too did Buttmann; who, thinking that <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλόν</foreign> had some affinity <lb/>
            with <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλει̃ν</foreign>, wished to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">καίτοι τοι̃ς λέγουσί γε αὐτό ἁϱμονίᾳ μόνον <lb/>

            wishes to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">μήκει του̃ νου̃ παϱη̃κται</foreign>. For, says he, to the question of <lb/>
            Hermogenes, What is <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλόν</foreign> ? Socrates replies by saying, " It is difficult to <lb/>
            understand. But by those who pronounce the word, it is turned aside <lb/>
            from voS by its harmony and length.’’ For thus the mention of voS is <lb/>
            connected with that of <foreign xml:lang="grc">διανοίας</foreign> just afterwards; while both are subse­ <lb/>

            there is a ridicule of the new speech in the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ καλὴ αὕτη</foreign>. But why <lb/>
            Plato should introduce this ridicule, neither he, nor Stalbaum, who fol­ <lb/>
            lows him, has deigned to explain. Besides, although Stalbaum asserts <lb/>

            sense would be none. For we have still to learn what is the contrary <lb/>

            words mean.</p>
          <p>Herm. How say you ?</p>
          <p>Soc. I will tell you. Our ancestors you know very fre­ <lb/>
            quently used the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ι</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">δ</foreign>, and not the least the women, who <lb/>
            particularly preserved the ancient tongue.3 But now, instead <lb/>
            of the i, they perversely use either <foreign xml:lang="grc">ε</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">η</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ζ</foreign> instead of o, <lb/>
            as being more stately.</p>
          <p>Herm. But how?</p>
          <p>Soc. Just as, for instance, the most ancient men called <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡμέρα</foreign> (day) <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱμέρα</foreign>, and some of them <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑμέϱα</foreign>; but those of the <lb/>
            present times <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡμέρα</foreign>.</p>
          <p>[75.] Herm. This is so.</p>
          <p>Soc. You know then that this ancient name alone points <lb/>
            out what was in the mind of the founder; for, because light <lb/>
            is wont to emerge from darkness upon men pleased with and <lb/>
            desiring its beams,4 on this account they called day <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱμέρα</foreign>.</p>
          <p>Herm. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Soc. But as it is now spoken in high-flown language, you <lb/>
            can by no means understand what <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡμέρα</foreign> means; although <lb/>
            some think that day is called on this account <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡμέρα</foreign>, because it <lb/>
            renders things <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἥμεϱα</foreign>, gentle.</p>
          <p>Herm. So it appears to me.</p>
          <p>Soc. And you likewise know that the ancients called <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ζυγὸν</foreign> <lb/>
            (a yoke) <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δυγὸν</foreign>.5</p>
          <p>Herm. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Now <foreign xml:lang="grc">ζυγὸν</foreign> indicates nothing. But that which exists <lb/>

            But that could be no reason for Socrates introducing a number of names. <lb/>
            He would rather have cut short his speech. Abresch. in Auctor. Thucyd. <lb/>
            p. 306, suggests <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέλος θεω̃</foreign>, " look to the end." He ought rather to have <lb/>
            proposed <foreign xml:lang="grc">θὲς εὖ</foreign>—But the imperative could not thus follow <foreign xml:lang="grc">γάρ</foreign>. Plato <lb/>
            wrote, I suspect, <foreign xml:lang="grc">βέλος γὰρ ἤ̨δη ἵσον θείῳ</foreign>, " For I have witnessed a bolt <lb/>
            equal to a divine one." And thus there would be an allusion to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">βολὴ</foreign> <lb/>

          <p>Soc. Should I be able to answer him ? you mean. Is it <lb/>
            not so ?</p>
          <p>[82.] Herm. Perfectly so.</p>
          <p>Soc. One thing I have just now got somehow, so that by <lb/>
            answering I shall appear to say something to the purpose.</p>
          <p>Herm. What is it ?</p>
          <p>Soc. To say that what we know not is of Barbarian origin: <lb/>
            for perhaps this would be really the case with some; and <lb/>
            the first names would be inscrutable on account of their <lb/>
            antiquity. For through the names being twisted in every <lb/>
            way, it would be not at all wonderful. if the ancient speech, <lb/>
            as compared with the present, differed in nothing from a <lb/>
            Barbarian one.</p>
          <p>Herm. You speak nothing from the purpose.</p>
          <p>Soc. Nay, I speak what is reasonable. But yet the con­ <lb/>
            test does not appear to me to admit of excuses ;44 but we must <lb/>
            be ready to reflect upon these matters; and let us consider, that, <lb/>
            should any one always inquire into the verbs, through which <lb/>
            a noun is spoken, and again those nouns through which verbs <lb/>
            are enunciated, and should do this without ceasing, must not <lb/>
            he, who answers such a one, fail at length in his replies ?</p>
          <p>Herm. It appears so to me.</p>
          <p>[83.] Soc. When therefore will he, who fails to answer, <lb/>
            justly fail ? Will it not be when he arrives at those names, <lb/>
            which are, as it were, the elements both of other discourses <lb/>
            and names ? For these, if they are so circumstanced, can no <lb/>
            longer justly appear to be composed from other names. Just <lb/>
            as we said above,45 that <foreign xml:lang="grc">τό ἀγαθόν</foreign> was composed from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγαστός</foreign> <lb/>
            (to be admired) and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϑοός</foreign> (swift). But <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϑοός</foreign>, we may perhaps <lb/>
            say, is composed from other words, and these last again from <lb/>
            others: but if we ever lay hold of that, which is no longer <lb/>
            composed from other names, we may justly say, that we have <lb/>
            at length arrived at an element; and that we ought no longer <lb/>
            to refer this to other names.</p>
          <p>Herm. You seem to me to speak correctly.</p>
          <p>Soc. Are not then the names, about which you are asking, <lb/>
            elements ? And must we not consider in some other manner <lb/>
            what is their propriety ?</p>
          <p>Herm. It is likely. <note type="footnote"> 44 On this expression see Heindorf's learned note. </note><note type="footnote"> 45 See § 63. </note> <pb n="362"/>
            </p>
          <p>Soc. It is likely indeed, Hermogenes. All the former <lb/>
            names, therefore, must come back to these. And if this be <lb/>
            the case, as it appears to me it is, consider again with me, <lb/>
            lest I act like a silly person, while stating what the propriety <lb/>
            of the first names ought to be.</p>
          <p>[84.] Herm. Only do but speak, and I will, to the utmost <lb/>
            of my power, consider the matter with you.</p>
          <p>Soc. I think then you will agree with me in this, that there <lb/>
            is one propriety in every name, both first and last; and that <lb/>
            none of them differ, so far as they are names.</p>
          <p>Herm. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Soc. But the propriety of the names we have just now <lb/>
            discussed, was such as to show of what kind is each of the <lb/>
            things existing.</p>
          <p>Herm. How should it be not so ?</p>
          <p>Soc. This property then the prior names ought to possess <lb/>
            no less than the posterior, if they are to be names.</p>
          <p>Herm. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Soc. But the posterior names, as it appears, are able to <lb/>
            effect this through the prior.</p>
          <p>Herm. It appears so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Be it so then. 46But after what manner will the first <lb/>
            names, which no others precede,47 make, as much as they pos­ <lb/>
            sibly can, the things existing clear to us, if they are about to <lb/>
            be names ?46 But answer me this. If we had neither voice <lb/>
            nor tongue, and yet wished to point out things to one another, <lb/>
            should we not, as the dumb do at present, endeavour to indi­ <lb/>
            cate them by the hands, head, and the rest of the body?</p>
          <p>[85.] Herm. How could we otherwise, Socrates ?</p>
          <p>Soc. I think then that if we wished to indicate that which <lb/>
            is (going)43 upwards and is light, we should raise our hands <lb/>
            towards heaven and imitate the nature of the thing itself; <lb/>
            but if (to indicate) things (going) downwards and heavy, (we <lb/>
            should point) to the earth. And if we were desirous of in­ <lb/>
            dicating a horse running, or any other animal, you know that <note type="footnote"> 46—46 I fear I do not quite understand this. </note><note type="footnote"> 47 So the sense requires. But <foreign xml:lang="grc">υ̒πόκειται</foreign> is " succeed." Hence since <lb/>

            we should make our bodies and gestures as like as possible to <lb/>
            those things.</p>
          <p>Herm. It appears to me that the facts are necessarily as <lb/>
            you say.</p>
          <p>Soc. For in this manner, I think, the indication of any <lb/>
            thing is produced by the body imitating,49 as it seems, that <lb/>
            which any one wishes to point out.</p>
          <p>Herm. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. But since we wish to indicate a thing by our voice, <lb/>
            and tongue, and mouth, will not an indication of each thing <lb/>
            then take place through these, when an imitation of any <lb/>
            thing whatever is produced through them ?</p>
          <p>Herm. It appears to me necessarily so.</p>
          <p>Soc. A name then is, as it seems, an imitation by the <lb/>
            voice50 of that, which he who imitates, imitates and nomi­ <lb/>
            nates by the voice what he imitates.51</p>
          <p>Herm. It appears so to me.</p>
          <p>Soc. But, by Zeus, my friend, I do not think that I have <lb/>
            yet spoken in a becoming manner.</p>
          <p>Herm. Why so ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Because we should be compelled to confess, that they <lb/>
            who imitate sheep and cocks, and other animals, give names <lb/>
            to the things which they imitate.</p>
          <p>Herm. You speak the truth.</p>
          <p>Soc. But do you think this is correct ?</p>
          <p>Herm. I do not. But what imitation, Socrates, will the <lb/>

          <p>[86.] Soc. 52In the first place, as it appears to me, not if, <lb/>
            as we imitate things with music, we so imitate, although we <lb/>
            then imitate with the voice: and in the next place, if we imi­ <lb/>
            tate what music imitates, we do not appear to me to make use <lb/>
            of names.52 But I assert something of this kind. There is <lb/>
            a certain voice, figure to each thing, and a colour to many.</p>
          <p>Herm. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Soc. It appears then that although any one should imitate <lb/>
            in this way, the name-giving art would not be conversant <lb/>
            with these imitations; for these are partly musical and partly <lb/>
            painting. Is it not so ?</p>
          <p>Herm. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. But what is this ? Seems there not to you an exist­ <lb/>
            ence to every thing, as well as colour, and the other things <lb/>
            we just now mentioned ? In the first place,53 is there not an <lb/>
            existence to colour itself, and voice, and to all the rest, which <lb/>
            are deemed deserving of the appellation of being ?</p>
          <p>Herm. It appears so to me.</p>
          <p>Soc. But what then, if any one is able to imitate this very <lb/>
            thing, the existence of each thing,54 by letters and syllables, <lb/>
            would he not indicate what each thing is ?</p>

          <p>[87.] Herm. This name, Socrates, appears to me what we <lb/>

            (flowing), and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ιέναι</foreign> (to go), and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σχέσις</foreign>56 (holding), whether <lb/>
            in their letters and syllables a person lays hold57 of entity, so <lb/>
            as to imitate existence or not.</p>
          <p>Herm. By all means.</p>
          <p>Soc. Come then, let us see whether these alone are a part <lb/>
            of the first names, or whether there are many others.</p>
          <p>Herm. I think there are many others.</p>
          <p>Soc. For it is probable. But what shall be the mode of <lb/>
            division from whence the imitator begins to imitate ? Is it <lb/>
            not, since the imitation happens to be by syllables and letters, <lb/>
            the most proper to distribute first the elements ? just as those <lb/>
            who put their hands to rhythms,58 distribute first the powers <lb/>

            things to become manifest through being imitated by letters <lb/>
            and syllables. And yet it must be so. For we have not any <lb/>
            thing better than this, to which we can refer, touching the <lb/>
            truth of the first names; unless, indeed, as the writers of tra­ <lb/>
            gedies, when they are in any difficulty, fly to their machinery <lb/>
            and introduce the gods,72 so we shall be released by assert­ <lb/>
            ing that the gods founded the first names, and that on this <lb/>
            account they exist correctly. Is not this the best of reasons ? <lb/>
            or the other, that we have got them from some Barbarians ? <lb/>
            -for the Barbarians are more ancient than us.—Or that, <lb/>
            through their antiquity it is impossible to perceive their <lb/>
            meaning, as is the case with the Barbaric names ? But all <lb/>
            these would be the (not) 73 very clever evasions on the part of <lb/>
            him who is not willing to give a reason for the right imposition <lb/>
            of the first names; although he who does not know the pro­ <lb/>
            priety of the first names, is surely unable to know that of the <lb/>
            subsequent, which must necessarily be made manifest from the <lb/>

            pressing a similitude to rushing on; and hence he in many <lb/>
            places employed it for this purpose. And in the first place, <lb/>
            the words '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ρει</foreign>v (to flow) and 'Pon<foreign xml:lang="grc">̀</foreign>) (flowing) imitate a rushing- <lb/>

            (trembling) and Tp<foreign xml:lang="grc">αΧύζ</foreign> (rough); also in such verbs as <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κϱούε</foreign>lv, <lb/>

            (to rumble): in all these he made for the most part a re­ <lb/>

            remains quiet for the least time on this letter, but is moved <lb/>
            the most; and hence it appears to me that he employed this <lb/>

            have composed what still86 remains, by imitating in this way. <lb/>
            [94.] Such, Hermogenes, appears to me to be the propriety <lb/>
            in names, unless Cratylus here asserts any thing else.</p>
          <p>Herm. In truth, Socrates, Cratylus very often gives me <lb/>
            much trouble, as I stated at the beginning, by his asserting <lb/>
            that there is a propriety in names; but he docs not clearly <lb/>
            inform me what it is; so that I am unable to know whether <lb/>
            he thus obscurely speaks on each occasion willingly or un­ <lb/>
            willingly. Now then, Cratylus, state before Socrates, whe­ <lb/>
            ther what Socrates says respecting names is pleasing to you, <lb/>
            or whether you have any thing better to produce ? and if you <lb/>
            have, mention it, so that either you may learn from Socrates, <lb/>
            or teach us both. ,</p>
          <p>Crat. But what, Hermogenes, does it appear to you to be <lb/>
            an easy matter to learn and teach any thing so suddenly, and <lb/>
            much less that which seems to be amongst the greatest ?87</p>
          <p>Herm. To me, by Zeus, it does not. But the saying of <lb/>
            Hesiod ('Epy. 359) appears to me well said, that, should one <lb/>
            a little to a little add, there would be something done of mo­ <lb/>
            ment. [95.] If then you are able to do any thing at all, <lb/>
            although but trifling, do not be faint-hearted, but benefit <lb/>
            Socrates here, for83 you can, and me.</p>
          <p>Soc. I would not myself, Cratylus, confidently assert a single <lb/>
            point of what I have said above. But I have considered with <lb/>
            Hermogenes in the way it seemed good to me; so that, on <lb/>
            this account at least, speak boldly, as I am ready to receive it, <lb/>
            if you have any thing better to say than this. Nor shall I <lb/>
            wonder, if you have something to say better; for you seem <lb/>
            to me to have considered things of this kind yourself, and to <lb/>
            have learnt them from others. Should you then say any <lb/>
            thing better, write me down as one of your disciples respect­ <lb/>
            ing the propriety of names.</p>
          <p>Crat. And in truth, Socrates, I have, as you say, made <lb/>
            this the subject of my meditations ; and perhaps I shall cause <lb/>
            you to become one of my disciples. And yet I fear that the <note type="footnote"> 86 In lieu of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ειδη</foreign>, MS. Gud. alone has in the text <foreign xml:lang="grc">η̏δη</foreign>, which is con­ <lb/>

            very contrary of all this will take place. For somehow it <lb/>
            comes into my mind to say to you, what Achilles did to Aias <lb/>
            in that part of the poem called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΛιΤαι</foreign>89 (supplications). For <lb/>
            he says, <lb/>
            " Alas, of Telamon the son, and sprung <lb/>
            From Zeus, and leader of the people, all <lb/>
            To my own heart thou seem'st to hare well said."</p>
          <p>And you too, Socrates, seem to have acted 'the prophet in a <lb/>
            reasonable manner according to my notions, whether you were <lb/>
            inspired by Euthyphron, or whether some other muse has <lb/>
            been existing in you in secret.90</p>
          <p>[96.] Soc. My good Cratylus, I have for a long time ago <lb/>
            been wondering myself at my own wisdom; and still do not <lb/>
            believe it. I think it therefore requisite for me to examine <lb/>
            again what I am saying. For to be deceived by one's own <lb/>
            self is the most terrible of all things ; for since the deceiver is <lb/>
            never for a moment absent, but always present, how can it <lb/>
            not be terrible ? It is necessary then, as it seems, to turn <lb/>
            ourselves frequently to what has been said before, and to en­ <lb/>
            deavour, according to the saying of the poet,91 " to look at the <lb/>
            same time before and behind." Let us then now take a view of <lb/>
            what has been asserted. We said then, that the propriety of <lb/>
            name is that which points out the quality of a thing. Shall <lb/>
            we say that this is sufficiently laid down ?</p>
          <p>Crat. To me, Socrates, it appears to be very much so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Names then are spoken for the sake of teaching ?</p>
          <p>Crat. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Shall we not therefore say that this is an art, and that <lb/>
            there are workmen of it.</p>
          <p>Crat. Perfectly so.</p>
          <p>Soc. But who are they ? <note type="footnote"> 89 Originally the Iliad was not divided into books, but into subjects. <lb/>
            The passage alluded to is in ix. 640, where an embassy is sent to Achilles <lb/>

          <p>[97.] Soc. Shall we then say, that this art subsists in men, <lb/>
            like other arts also, or not ? I mean to say some such thing <lb/>
            as this. Painters are surely some worse, some better.</p>
          <p>Crat. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Will not the better exhibit more beautiful pictures of <lb/>
            animals as their productions; but the worse, worse ? 93 And <lb/>
            in like manner, do not builders erect some more beautiful <lb/>
            dwellings, others more ugly ?</p>
          <p>Crat. Yes.</p>

          <p>Crat. It does not.</p>
          <p>Soc. Are all names then correctly laid down ?</p>

          <p>Soc. But what then shall we say to the name of Hermo­ <lb/>
            genes here, which we spoke of before? Shall we say that <lb/>
            this name was not rightly given him, unless something of <lb/>

          <p>Crat. It seems to me, Socrates, to be not given to him, but <lb/>
            only appears to be given; but that this is the name of some <lb/>
            other person, whose nature points out the name.96</p>
          <p>[91.] Soc. Will not then a person say false, who says <lb/>
            that he is Hermogenes? 97 for (see), lest on the other hand <lb/>
            even this be possible, to call this person Hermogenes,97 if he <lb/>
            is not so.</p>
          <p>Crat. How say you ?</p>
          <p>Soc. Does your reasoning mean this, that it is impossible <lb/>
            to speak a falsehood ? 98 For there are many, my dear Cratylus, <lb/>
            who say this now, and (have said it) of old.</p>
          <p>Crat. How is it possible, Socrates, that, when any one <lb/>
            speaks about any thing, he should speak about that which is <lb/>
            not ? Or is not this to speak a falsehood, to speak of things <lb/>
            which are not?</p>
          <p>Soc. This reasoning, my friend, is more clever than suits <lb/>

            Does it appear to you not possible to speak about a false­ <lb/>

            become foes in words, receive from me what I say. For, my <lb/>
            friend, I call such a distribution in the case of both imitations <lb/>
            [pictures (of animals)2 and names] correct; but in the case of <lb/>
            names, in addition to its being correct, true likewise: but I <lb/>
            call the other, [the giving and introduction,]3 relating to the <lb/>
            dissimilar, not correct; and, when it takes place in names, <lb/>
            false.</p>
          <p>Crat. But (consider), Socrates, whether this may not be <lb/>
            in the case of paintings, to make an incorrect distribution, but <lb/>
            in the case of names, not so; but that in this it is always <lb/>
            necessarily correct.</p>
          <p>[101.] Soc. How say you? In what does this differ from <lb/>
            that ? May not a person, on meeting a man, say to him, " This <lb/>
            is your picture," and show him, it may be, his own likeness, or <lb/>
            it may be, that of a woman ? by showing, I mean, placing it <lb/>
            before the sense of seeing.</p>
          <p>Crat. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Soc. But what, may he not again, meeting with the same <lb/>
            person, say to him, " This is your name ?" for a name, as well <lb/>
            as a painting, is an imitation. I mean this. May he not say, <lb/>
            " This is your name ?" And after this, may he not present to <lb/>
            the sense of hearing, it may be, an imitation of himself, by <lb/>
            saying that it is a man; and, it may be, an imitation of a <lb/>
            female of the human species, by saying that it is a woman ? <note type="footnote"> 2 Ficin. has " distributionem in imitationibus utrisque tarn nominibus <lb/>

            Does it not appear to you, that it is possible for this to occur <lb/>
            sometimes ?</p>
          <p>Crat. I am willing to concede it, Socrates; and let it be so.</p>
          <p>Soc. You do well, my friend, if such be the state of the <lb/>
            case; for there is no need at present to contest much about it. <lb/>
            If, then, there is a distribution of this kind on this point4 (in <lb/>
            names), we are willing to say5 that one of these speaks truly, <lb/>
            but the other falsely. [102.] And if this be the case, and it <lb/>
            is possible to distribute nouns not correctly, and not to assign <lb/>
            things adapted to each, 6 and (to assign) what is not adapted,6 <lb/>
            it will be possible to do the very same thing with verbs. And <lb/>
            if it is possible to thus put down verbs and nouns, there is a <lb/>
            necessity to do so with sentences likewise; for sentences are, <lb/>
            I think, but the putting together of those. Or how say you, <lb/>
            Cratylus ?</p>
          <p>Crat. Thus; for you appear to me to speak beautifully.</p>
          <p>Soc. If then we assimilate the first names to letters, it is <lb/>
            possible, as in the pictures of animals, to assign all the fitting <lb/>
            colours and figures; and on the other hand, not to assign all, <lb/>
            but to leave some and to add others, more and greater.7 Is it <lb/>
            not so ?</p>
          <p>Crat. It is.</p>
          <p>Soc. Does not he then, who assigns every thing (proper),8 <lb/>
            render beautiful both letters and resemblances; but he, who <lb/>
            adds or takes away, works out indeed letters and images, but <lb/>
            such as are faulty ?</p>

            cording to the same reasoning, a beautiful image, when he <lb/>

            is deficient even in small matters, or sometimes makes an <lb/>
            addition, a resemblance will be produced, but not a beautiful <lb/>
            one, so that some of the names will be beautifully formed, but <lb/>
            others badly ?</p>
          <p>Crat. Perhaps so.</p>
          <p>[103.] Soc. Perhaps then the one will be a good artificer <lb/>
            of names, but the other a bad one.</p>
          <p>Crat. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. Now was not the name of this person a name- <lb/>
            founder ? 9</p>
          <p>Crat. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Perhaps then, by Zeus, as in other arts, one name- <lb/>
            founder is good and another bad, if we agree in what has <lb/>
            been said before.</p>
          <p>Crat. It is so. But you surely perceive, Socrates, that,10 <lb/>
            when we assign the letters a and /3, and each of the elements <lb/>
            to names, according to the grammatical art, if we take away, <lb/>
            add, or change any thing, a name indeed is written by us, <lb/>

          <p>Soc. Perhaps such things as must necessarily be or not, when <lb/>

            such as Cratylus and the resemblance of Cratylus, if any one <lb/>
            of the gods should not only make a likeness of yourself in co­ <lb/>

            ness, and warmth, and motion, and soul, and intellect, as is in <lb/>
            you ; and, in one word, fashion every thing as you have, and <lb/>
            place such other things close to you,13 whether would there be <lb/>
            one Cratylus, and a resemblance of Cratylus, or two Cratyluses ?</p>
          <p>Crat. It appears to me, Socrates, that there would be two.</p>
          <p>Soc. You see then, my friend, that it is necessary to seek <lb/>
            after another propriety of a resemblance than what we just <lb/>
            now spoke of; and that there is no necessity, that, if any <lb/>
            thing is taken away or added, for it to be any longer a re­ <lb/>
            semblance. Or do you not perceive how much resemblances <lb/>
            want from being the same as their patterns ?</p>
          <p>Crat. I do.</p>
          <p>Soc. Those things then, 14 of which the names are names,14 <lb/>
            would suffer a ridiculous fate through their names, if they were <lb/>
            in every respect assimilated to them ; for all things would be­ <lb/>

            was the thing itself and which the name.</p>
          <p>Crat. You speak the truth.</p>
          <p>[105.] Soc. Boldly then, my noble fellow, admit that one <lb/>

              names some are formed from the preceding, and others are <lb/>
              themselves the first ?</p>
          <p>Crat. To me it seems so.</p>
          <p>[107.] Soc. But if the first names should be indications of <lb/>
            certain things, have you any better method for their being <lb/>
            indications than to make them as nearly as possible such as are <lb/>
            the things which they ought to indicate ? Or does the method <lb/>
            which Hermogenes and many others speak of please you more, <lb/>
            that names are conventional, and indicate (their meaning) to <lb/>
            those who have agreed together and known beforehand the <lb/>
            things (so named); and that in this conventionality exists 26 the <lb/>
            propriety of names; and that it matters not whether any one <lb/>
            agrees to call them, as they are at present imposed, or the con­ <lb/>
            trary, (to call) that which is now 27 small o great w, and great <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ω</foreign> small o?27 Which of these methods is agreeable to you?</p>
          <p>Crat. It is wholly and universally, Socrates, better to in­ <lb/>
            dicate by a resemblance what one wishes to indicate, 28 but <lb/>
            not by any chance 28 method.</p>
          <p>Soc. You speak well. If then the name shall be similar <lb/>
            to a thing, is it not necessary for the elements, from which a <lb/>
            person shall have composed the first names, to be naturally <lb/>
            similar to the things themselves ? My meaning is this, Could <lb/>
            any one put together a picture, which we have just now said <lb/>
            is the resemblance of something existing, unless the pigments, <lb/>
            from which the picture of living things is composed, were na­ <lb/>
            turally similar to those which the art of painting imitates ? <lb/>
            Or is it impossible?</p>
          <p>Crat. Impossible.</p>
          <p>[108.] Soc. In like manner then names would never become <lb/>

            are the things from which names are to be composed.</p>
          <p>Crat. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. You therefore now take a share in the discourse which <lb/>
            Hermogenes did a little before. Come then, do we seem to <lb/>
            you to have said correctly, or not, that the letter p is similar <lb/>
            to a rushing-on, and to motion, and to hardness ?</p>
          <p>Crat. To me, correctly.</p>
          <p>Soc. And that the letter X (is similar) to the smooth and <lb/>
            soft, and to what we just now mentioned?</p>
          <p>Crat. Yes.</p>
          <p>Soc. Do you know then that for the same thing we say <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σκληρότης</foreign>, but the Eretrians <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σκληρότηρ</foreign> ?</p>
          <p>Crat. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>Soc. Do then both p and a seem to be similar to the same <lb/>
            thing ? and does that word indicate the same thing to them, <lb/>
            ending with a p, as it does to us ending with a e ? or does <lb/>
            it indicate nothing to the others of us.30</p>
          <p>Crat. It indicates one thing 31 to both.</p>
          <p>Soc. Whether in that p and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ς</foreign> are similar, or in that they <lb/>
            are not?</p>
          <p>Crat. In that they are similar.</p>
          <p>Soc. Are they then similar in every way ?</p>
          <p>Crat. At least in indicating a rushing-on.</p>
          <p>Soc. But what as regards the inserted <foreign xml:lang="grc">λ</foreign> ? Does it not in­ <lb/>
            dicate the contrary of hardness ?</p>
          <p>[109.] Crat. Perhaps, Socrates, it is not correctly in­ <lb/>
            serted; just as in the names which you lately mentioned to <lb/>
            Hermogenes, by taking away and adding letters where it was <lb/>
            requisite. And you then appeared to me (to act) 32 properly. <lb/>
            And now, perhaps, p ought to be inserted instead of X.</p>

          <p>Crat. I do, my very good friend, through custom.</p>
          <p>Soc. But in saying custom, do you think you are saying <lb/>
            any thing different from convention ? Or do you call custom <lb/>
            any thing else than this, that when I pronounce this word, I <lb/>
            understand it, and you know that I understand it? Do you <lb/>
            not mean this ?</p>
          <p>Crat. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. If then you know this, when I pronounce it, there is <lb/>
            an indication (of something) 33 to you through me.</p>
          <p>Crat. Certainly.</p>

            when I pronounce it, if \ is dissimilar34 to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκληρότης</foreign>, <lb/>
            which you pronounce. [110.] And if this is the case, what <lb/>
            else is it, than that you have made a convention with yourself, <lb/>
            and that the propriety of the name is a compact with your­ <lb/>
            self; since both similar and dissimilar letters, when meeting <lb/>
            with custom and compact, indicate (the same thing)35 to you ? <lb/>
            But if custom is very far from being a compact, it will be no <lb/>
            longer proper to say that similitude is an indication, but custom <lb/>
            (rather): for this, as it appears, indicates both by the similar <lb/>
            and the dissimilar. Since then, Cratylus, we agree in this­ <lb/>
            for I will put down your silence as consent,36 it is surely <lb/>
            necessary that compact and custom should contribute to the <lb/>
            indication of what we have in mind and pronounce; since if, <lb/>
            0 best of men! you are willing to come to number, from <lb/>

            compact of yours to possess some authority about the propriety <lb/>

            when the contrary takes place. But after these still tell me <lb/>
            this. What power do names possess with respect to us, and <lb/>
            what beautiful effect must we say they produce ?</p>
          <p>[111.] Crat. To me, Socrates, they appear to teach; and <lb/>
            that it is without exception true, that he who knows the <lb/>
            names, knows the things likewise.</p>
          <p>Soc. Perhaps, Cratylus, you mean some such thing as this; <lb/>
            that when any one knows the quality of the name,-now it <lb/>
            is of the same quality as the thing,-he then also knows the <lb/>
            thing ; since it is similar to the name ; and that there is one and <lb/>
            the same art in all things, which are similar to one another; <lb/>
            and in consequence of this you appear to me to assert, that he, <lb/>
            who knows the names, knows also the things.</p>
          <p>Crat. You speak most truly.</p>
          <p>Soc. Come now, let us see what is this mode of teaching <lb/>
            existing things, of which you are now speaking, and whether <lb/>
            there is any other method, this however being the better;39 <lb/>
            or whether there is no other than this. Which do you think <lb/>
            is the case ?</p>
          <p>Crat. I think thus, that there is no other method; but that <lb/>
            this is the only one, and the best.</p>
          <p>Soc. But whether do you think that there is likewise the <lb/>
            very same invention of things existing, (and)40 that he, who <note type="footnote"> 37 In § 67, where <foreign xml:lang="grc">γλισχρω̃ς</foreign> is used as <foreign xml:lang="grc">γλισχρᾳ̃</foreign> is here. </note><note type="footnote"> 38—38 Heindorf says that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀνόματα</foreign> is to be thus supplied.

          <p>[112.] Soc. Come then, let us consider, 41Cratylus, if any <lb/>
            one, while seeking after things, follows after names, and looks <lb/>
            upon the quality of each, do you not consider41 that there is <lb/>
            no small danger of his being deceived ?</p>
          <p>Crat. How ?</p>
          <p>Soc. It is plain, that he, who first founded names, formed <lb/>
            them, as we have said, such as he thought the things them­ <lb/>
            selves were. Is it not so ?</p>
          <p>Crat. Certainly.</p>
          <p>Soc. If then he did not think rightly, but formed them, as <lb/>
            he fancied, 42what think you shall we suffer, who are his fol­ <lb/>
            lowers ?42 Is it aught else, than for us to be deceived ?</p>
          <p>Crat. But (see), Socrates, lest this be not the case; but <lb/>
            that it is necessary for him, who founded the names, to have <lb/>
            founded them knowingly; for otherwise, as I before remarked, <lb/>
            names would never have existed. And let this be the greatest <lb/>
            proof to you that he, who founded them, did not stumble from <lb/>
            the truth. For all things would not have thus chimed in with <lb/>
            him. Or, did you not perceive this yourself, when you were <lb/>
            saying, that all names were composed 43according to the same, <lb/>
            and for the same ?43</p>
          <p>[113.] Soc. But this apology, my worthy Cratylus, is of <lb/>
            no weight. For if the founder of names, after stumbling at <note type="footnote"> 41—41 Neither Heindorfnor Stalbaum have remarked, that, as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐννοήσω­ <lb/>

            take being trifling and unapparent, all the remaining parts, <lb/>
            although very numerous, follow as they ought,44 and agree <lb/>
            with each other. There ought then at the beginning of every <lb/>
            thing to be to every person much discussion and reflection, <lb/>
            whether the principle is properly laid down or not; and this <lb/>
            being sufficiently examined, the rest, I say, will appear45 to <lb/>
            follow it. And yet I should not wonder if names chime in <lb/>
            with each other. For let us again consider, what we dis­ <lb/>
            cussed before, that of the whole going on, and carried on, <lb/>
            and flowing, the names signify to us, we say, the existence. <lb/>
            Do they seem to you to indicate any thing else than 46 in this <lb/>
            way ?</p>
          <p>Crat. Very much so ; and that they correctly signify this.</p>
          <p>[114.] Soc. Let us consider then again taking from out of <lb/>
            them, in the first place, this name, '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Επιστήμη</foreign> (science); since it <lb/>
            is doubtful, and seems to signify that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἵστησιν</foreign> (it stops) our soul <lb/>
            in acts, rather than that it is borne along with them; and <lb/>
            hence it is more proper to enunciate its beginning as now, <lb/>
            47 than by throwing out <foreign xml:lang="grc">ε, πιστήμη</foreign>, and to make an insertion in <lb/>
            that of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ι</foreign> 47 in the place of that in <foreign xml:lang="grc">ε</foreign>. 43 In the next place, the <lb/>
            word <foreign xml:lang="grc">Βεβαιον</foreign> (firm) is so called, because it is the imitation of <lb/>
            a certain <foreign xml:lang="grc">βάσις</foreign> (basis), and <foreign xml:lang="grc">στάσις</foreign> (standing), but not of <foreign xml:lang="grc">φορὰ</foreign> <lb/>
            (rushing-on). Again, ‛<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ιστορία</foreign> (history) indicates surely that <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἵστησι τὸν</foreign> povv (it stops the flowing); and the word (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ΙΙιστὸν</foreign>) <lb/>
            (credible) indicates a thing <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱστα̃ν</foreign> (causing to stand).48 Like­ <lb/>

          <p>Crat. I think, Socrates, that the account respecting these <lb/>

            than that of man assigned the first names to things, so that <lb/>
            they must of necessity be in a correct state.</p>
          <p>Soc. Do you think then that he who laid down names, <lb/>
            whether he was a certain daemon, or a god,58 would lay down <lb/>
            things contrary to himself? Or do we appear to you, to have <lb/>

          <p>Soc. If then one may learn, as much as possible,63 the <lb/>
            things through names, and likewise through themselves, which <lb/>
            will be the best and clearest method of learning ? To learn <lb/>

            stirred about,66 and by dragging us along, hurl us into it. For <lb/>
            consider, 0 wondrous Cratylus, what I often dream about, <lb/>
            whether we should say or not that there exists in the abstract <lb/>
            the beautiful and the good, and each of the things existing.</p>
          <p>Crat. It appears to me, Socrates, that there does exist.</p>
          <p>Soc. Let us then consider that very thing, not as if a coun­ <lb/>
            tenance or any thing of this kind were beautiful-for 67 all these <lb/>
            appear to flow—but shall we say that beauty in the abstract <lb/>
            is not always such as it is ?</p>
          <p>Crat. We must.</p>
          <p>[120.] Soc. Can one then correctly say, if it is always <lb/>
            secretly going away, first, that it is, and next, that it is of <lb/>
            such a kind ? Or is it necessary, while we are speaking about <lb/>
            it, for it to become immediately something else, and to <lb/>
            secretly withdraw itself, and to be such no longer.</p>
          <p>Crat. It is necessary.</p>
          <p>Soc. How then can that be any thing, which never subsists <lb/>
            in a similar manner? For if it ever subsists68 in a similar <note type="footnote"> with <foreign xml:lang="grc">έξαπατα̃ται· τψ̃ ὅντι μὲν</foreign>—For he takes <foreign xml:lang="grc">έξαπατα̃ται</foreign> in an active <lb/>

            manner, during that time 69[when it subsists in a similar <lb/>
            manner],69 it is evident that it does not change; but, if it al­ <lb/>
            ways subsists in a similar manner, and is the same, how can <lb/>
            it change, or be moved, not having started out from its own <lb/>
            form of existence ?</p>
          <p>Crat. By no means.</p>
          <p>Soc. But neither can it be known by any one. For, as <lb/>
            soon as that approaches which is about to know it, it becomes <lb/>
            something else, and of a different kind, so that it cannot be <lb/>
            known of what quality it is, or how it subsists. Now surely <lb/>
            no knowledge knows that, which it knows has no manner of <lb/>
            subsistence.</p>
          <p>Crat. It is as you say.</p>
          <p>Soc. But neither, Cratylus, is it reasonable to say that <lb/>
            knowledge exists, if all things change and fall away, and <lb/>
            nothing abides. For if this very thing [I mean know­ <lb/>
            ledge]70 itself does not change and fall away, so as to be not <lb/>
            knowledge, it would remain for ever [knowledge],71 and be <lb/>
            knowledge; but if the form itself of knowledge changes and <lb/>
            falls away, it will at the same time change and fall away into <lb/>
            a form different from knowledge, and will be knowledge no <lb/>
            longer; but if it always changes and falls away, it will <lb/>
            always be not knowledge: and by this reasoning there would <lb/>
            be neither the thing about to know, nor that about to be <lb/>
            known. [121.] But if that always subsists which knows, <lb/>
            then that which is known subsists, and the beautiful subsists, <lb/>
            and the good subsists, and each single thing else of those ex­ <lb/>

            flowing, or rushing-on, of which we were speaking.72 But <lb/>

              the followers of Heraclitus and many others73 assert, (see) <lb/>
              that it is by no means an easy subject of inquiry ; nor is it the <lb/>
              part of a person possessing much mind, to give himself up, <lb/>
              and his own soul, to the study of names, (and) confiding74 in <lb/>
              them and those that founded them, to make a bold assertion, <lb/>
              as if he knew something, and to give a verdict against himself <lb/>
              and existing things, as if nothing of any thing were sound,75 <lb/>
              but that all things did, like (unsound)76 vessels of clay, let the <lb/>
              water run through ; and really, like persons labouring under a <lb/>
              catarrh, fancy that things are so disposed, and 77 things are <lb/>
              seized with a flowing and catarrh.77 [122.] Perhaps then, <lb/>
              Cratylus, this is the case, and perhaps not. Hence it is <lb/>
              proper to reflect upon this well and manfully,78 and not <lb/>
              to receive any thing easily :79 for as yet you are a young man, <lb/>

            <title type="main">INTRODUCTION TO THE PARMENIDES.</title>
          </head>
          <p>OF all the Dialogues of Plato the Parmenides is one of the most <lb/>
            remarkable. For not only does it turn upon questions relating to <lb/>
            the most abstruse abstractions of metaphysics, but the manner too, <lb/>
            in which the subject is handled, affords the best illustration of that <lb/>
            “sapientiæ insanientis”—cleverness without sound sense-in the <lb/>
            meshes of which Horace says he was at one time caught; and to <lb/>
            which he might have fairly applied his own graphic verse­ <lb/>
            " Diruit, ædificat, mutat quadrata rotundis." <lb/>
            Pulls down, builds up, and changes squares for rounds.</p>
          <p>By a chain of reasoning, where subtleties assume the garb of truths, <lb/>
            conclusions are arrived at, so as to fully justify the fear, which So­ <lb/>
            crates is here feigned to feel, that by pursuing metaphysical inqui­ <lb/>
            ries, he would fall into the bottomless sea of trifling; from which, <lb/>
            as from Hades, according to Virgil, only they, <lb/>
            " quos ardens evexit ad æthera virtus," <lb/>
            Valour soul-burning to the skies hath borne, <lb/>
            could hope to escape; and, like Ulysses under the guidance of the <lb/>
            goddess of wisdom, <lb/>
            " Salvos se superas potuisse evadere ad auras." <lb/>
            In safety could to upper air return.</p>
          <p>Such at least seems to have been the fate of every Commentator, <lb/>
            who has ventured to enter the maze of mind, which Plato has with <lb/>
            such art built up. For neither Proclus and Damascius of the olden <lb/>
            time, nor more recently Ficinus, nor, within the last hundred years, <lb/>
            Taylor in England, Schleiermacher and others in Germany, nor <lb/>
             <pb n="398"/>
            Cousin in France, have been able to understand thoroughly them­ <lb/>
            selves, and to explain satisfactorily to others, what is likely to re­ <lb/>
            main for ever an intellectual puzzle.</p>
          <p>It is then a fortunate circumstance for such as may be still dis­ <lb/>
            posed to enter the labyrinth, that Stalbaum has furnished them <lb/>
            with a clue, by prefixing to his edition of the Parmenides, published <lb/>
            at Leipsig in 1848, four books of elaborate Prolegomena, running <lb/>
            to 343 octavo pages. For the reader will find there an ample and <lb/>
            generally satisfactory discussion on various points connected with <lb/>
            the doctrines promulgated in the dialogue. Of these perhaps the <lb/>
            most startling is the theory of Socher, who would have the world <lb/>
            believe that the Parmenides was not written by Plato, but by some <lb/>
            anonymous philosopher, to whom is to be attributed likewise the <lb/>
            Sophist and Statesman. In defence of this novel notion, which, <lb/>
            says Stalbaum, Socher has been unable to support by a single argu­ <lb/>
            ment of the least weight, Stalbaum himself has produced one, that <lb/>
            Socher has omitted. For according to Stalbaum, Aristotle has never <lb/>
            made a direct allusion to the Parmenides ; although there seem to <lb/>
            be two indirect in Physic. i. 3, and as many in Sophist. El. c. ix. <lb/>
            But he might have added that, even if there were not a single one <lb/>
            of any kind whatever, it is easy to understand why Aristotle would <lb/>
            take no notice of Plato. For the Stagirite could not have failed to <lb/>
            perceive, that Plato was not so much giving expression to his own <lb/>
            opinions, as putting into prose what Parmenides appears to have <lb/>
            written in verse; while, as regards the doctrines of Zeno, it was far <lb/>
            better for Aristotle to draw them from the discourses of that phi­ <lb/>
            losopher himself, than from the representations of a less faithful <lb/>
            reporter.</p>
          <p>With far greater reason have Schleiermacher and Ast imagined <lb/>
            that the dialogue was left in an unfinished state. Perhaps it would <lb/>
            be safer to assert that it has come down to us ‘ shorn of its fair <lb/>
            proportions.' For it is hard to believe that Plato wanted either <lb/>
            the power or inclination to put the finishing hand to a production, <lb/>
            which exhibits the marks of no common mind.</p>
          <p>Respecting the object of the Dialogue, Taylor, echoing, as usual, <lb/>
            the sentiments of his favourite Proclus, fancies it was intended to <lb/>
            exhibit a complete system of a philosophical theology; and hence he <lb/>
            has given it the title of " Parmenides, or on the Gods." But here, <lb/>
            as indeed through the whole of Plato, the two Neo-Platonists have <lb/>
             <pb n="399"/>
            preferred to float amidst the mists of mysticism, rather than breathe <lb/>
            the generally clear empyreum of Plato's mind. More correctly does <lb/>
            Diogenes Laert., in ix. 13, entitle it <foreign xml:lang="grc">Παρμενίδης ἢ περὶ</foreign> ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ιδεω̃ν</foreign>, and, in <lb/>
            iii. 50, class it with the Statesman, the Sophist, and Cratylus, as <lb/>
            exhibiting proofs of the philosopher's powers as a dialectician.</p>
          <p>Amongst the more recent translations of this Dialogue, is one in <lb/>
            French by Schwalbé, Far. 1844, 12, where, in a note at the end of <lb/>
            the argument, a reference is made to his " Parmenide, traduit et <lb/>
            expliqué.” But whether he has been able to overcome any of the <lb/>
            difficulties arising from the corruptions of the text, I am unable <lb/>
            to state, as I have never seen the work; and a similar remark is <lb/>
            applicable to the various publications quoted by Stalbaum, who has <lb/>
            seldom taken the least notice of his countrymen's verbal criticism; <lb/>
            for, like Poppo in the case of Thucydides, he seems to think that <lb/>
            the very words of the author have been miraculously preserved by <lb/>
            a certain class of MSS.; and that if they are not found there, it is <lb/>
            merely labour in vain to endeavour to seek for them elsewhere; <lb/>
            and even in the Latin version of Ficinus, which was evidently made <lb/>
            from a MS. frequently superior to all that have been hitherto col­ <lb/>
            lated by Bekker and others. I suspect, however, that, like the ma­ <lb/>
            jority of modern scholars in France, Schwalbé does not feel himself <lb/>
            sufficiently strong in Greek to grapple with verbal difficulties; which <lb/>
            after all must be first successfully mastered, before a person pre­ <lb/>
            sumes to talk of that, with which most readers are satisfied, the <lb/>
            conventional sense of a passage which is felt to be difficult; but <lb/>
            which the genuine verbal critic knows to be difficult generally, <lb/>
            only because it is corrupt.</p>
          <p>As it is by no means easy, even with an attention constantly ex­ <lb/>
            erted, to follow the subtleties that pervade the whole Dialogue, it <lb/>
            will be perhaps not without its use to give Stalbaum's summary of <lb/>
            the principal questions discussed, and of the conclusions to which <lb/>
            they lead.</p>
          <p>A. If " the one " be supposed to exist-</p>
          <p>In the first place, it is necessary to consider it abstractedly by <lb/>
            itself, and likewise in a double point of view, either as existing apart <lb/>
            by itself, or united to " being;" from whence there arise two con­ <lb/>
            flicting propositions and conclusions-</p>
          <p>1. If "the one" exists, it is nothing, p. 137, C.—142, B.</p>
          <p>2. If " the one " exists, it is every thing, p. 142, B.—157, B.</p><pb n="400"/>
            
          <p>Secondly, we must consider the others;" by which is meant <lb/>
            every thing except the one" (p. 159, B. § 63); and respecting <lb/>
            these there arise two conflicting propositions and conclusions : for,</p>
          <p>1. If " the one" exists, “ the others" are all things, p. 157, B.- <lb/>
            159, B.</p>
          <p>2. If "the one" exists, "the others" are nothing, p. 159, B.- <lb/>
            160, B.</p>
          <p>B. If " the not-one " be supposed to exist-</p>
          <p>In the first place, we must consider the not-one" abstractedly <lb/>
            by itself, and likewise in a double point of view; from whence there <lb/>
            arise two conflicting propositions and conclusions-</p>
          <p>1. If "the not-one" exists, and is understood in a relative sense <lb/>
            with respect to "the others," it is by itself every thing, <lb/>
            p. 160, B.—163, B.</p>
          <p>2. If " the not-one " exists abstractedly, it is by itself nothing, <lb/>
            p. 163, B.—164, B.</p>
          <p>So too we must consider " the others." And hence there arise <lb/>
            two conflicting propositions and conclusions-</p>
          <p>1. If "the not-one" exists, "the others," as being freed from <lb/>
            one-ness, are every thing, p. 164, B.—165, E.</p>
          <p>2. If " the not-one" exists, " the others" are nothing, p. 165, E.</p>
          <p>Before, however, Parmenides, of whom Plato is the mouth-piece, <lb/>
            entered upon these inquiries, there should have been given defini­ <lb/>
            tions of the terms employed, or at any rate care should have been <lb/>
            taken by Plato to use the same terms in always the same sense. <lb/>
            But so far is this from being the case, that, as remarked by Wytten­ <lb/>
            bach, on Phædon. p. 270, with whom Creuzer, on Plotinus <foreign xml:lang="grc">Περὶ <lb/>
            Κάλλους</foreign>, p. 169 and 388, agrees, the same meaning is assigned to <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰδέαι</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴδη</foreign> ; although Stalbaum, on Parmenid. p. 128, E., at­ <lb/>
            tempts to draw a nice distinction between them; and so he does <lb/>
            too in the case of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄλλα</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕτερα</foreign>, in Prolegom. p. 114, although <lb/>
            he fairly confesses that those two words are sometimes used indis­ <lb/>
            criminately.</p><pb n="401"/>

          <p>[1.] WHEN we arrived at Athens from home, [from Clazo­ <lb/>
            menæ,1] we happened to meet with Adeimantus and Glaucon2 <lb/>
            in the place of assembly. And Adeimantus, taking me by the <lb/>
            hand, said, Hail, Cephalus ; 3 and if you are here in want of any <lb/>
            thing over which we have any power, mention it to me. Nay, <lb/>
            I replied, I came for this very purpose, to beg of you a favour. <lb/>
            Will you then, says he, state your request ? And I replied, <lb/>
            What was the name of your brother by the same mother ? for <note type="footnote"> 1 Although <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἴκοθεν ἐκ Κλαζομενω̃ν</foreign> would, no doubt, appear unobjection­ <lb/>

            immediately afterwards, it is evident that in this place those words are an <lb/>

            I do not remember it: for he was a child when I first4 came <lb/>
            here from Clazomenæ ; and it is now a long time since then. <lb/>
            His father's name was, I think, Pyrilampes.5 Just so, says <lb/>
            lie, and (his brother's) was Antipho. But why do you <lb/>
            especially ask ?, These, my fellow-citizens, said I, are much <lb/>
            given to philosophy, and have heard that this Antipho had <lb/>
            frequently met with one Pythodorus,6 a friend of Zeno ; and <lb/>
            that having frequently7 heard from Pythodorus the conversa­ <lb/>
            tions which Socrates,8 Zeno, and Parmenides held with each <lb/>
            other, he had remembered them. You speak the truth, says <lb/>
            he. These then, said I, we beg to hear. This, says he, is no <lb/>
            difficult matter. For, although young, he has exercised himself <lb/>
            greatly in them ; since9 he now, after the example of his grand­ <lb/>
            father, who is his namesake, applies himself much to equestrian <lb/>
            affairs. [2.] But, if it seems good,10 we will go to him: for he is <lb/>
            just gone home from hence; and dwells hard by, in Melita.12 <lb/>
            So saying, we went, and caught him at home, giving orders <lb/>
            to a coppersmith to make him a bit. But as soon as he was <lb/>
            at liberty, and his brothers told him the cause of our coming, <note type="footnote"> 4 The MSS. vary as usual between <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρότερον</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρω̃τον</foreign> : which is <lb/>

            he recognised me through my previous sojourn at this place, <lb/>
            and he embraced me; and on our begging him to go through <lb/>
            the conversations, he at first shrunk back, for he said it would <lb/>
            be a troublesome task; but afterwards, however, he detailed <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>Antipho then said that Pythodorus had told him that Zeno <lb/>
            and Parmenides once came to the great Panathenæa ; 13 that <lb/>
            Parmenides was then a rather old man, with very hoary locks, <lb/>
            but of a handsome and noble aspect, and full sixty-five years <lb/>
            of age ; but that Zeno was nearly forty years old, very <lb/>
            tall and graceful to behold, and was reported to have been <lb/>
            the bosom friend of Parmenides ; he said, too, that they lodged <lb/>
            with Pythodorus, in the Cerameicus,14 beyond the walls; whi­ <lb/>
            ther also Socrates came, and many others with him, who were <lb/>
            eager to hear the writings of Zeno ; for then for the first time <lb/>
            they had been brought by the (strangers); but that Socrates <lb/>
            was at that time very young. [3.] That Zeno therefore <lb/>
            himself read the writings to them; and Pythodorus further <lb/>
            related that Parmenides happened to be gone out; and that of <lb/>
            the discourses so read there remained only a very small portion, <lb/>
            when he himself entered, and Parmenides with him and Aris­ <lb/>
            totle,15 who was one of the Thirty (Tyrants); and that he heard <lb/>
            but a little at that time 16but that nevertheless he had (often) <lb/>
            heard the (whole)16 discourse previously from Zeno.</p>
          <p>(He added) that Socrates, on hearing (the discourses), <lb/>
            entreated him to read again the first hypothesis of his first <lb/>
            discourse ; and that, when it was read, Socrates said-How do <lb/>
            you, Zeno, assert this, that if the things existing are many, the <note type="footnote"> 13 On the Panathenæa, see Potter's or Smith's Grecian Antiquities. </note><note type="footnote"> 14 On the two Cerameici, see Schol. in Aristoph. ‛<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ιππ</foreign>. 769. They <lb/>
            were in fact burial-grounds, and strewed over with fragments of the cine­ <lb/>
            rary urns there deposited in honour of the dead. Of the same kind was <lb/>
            doubtless the Potter's Field, near Jerusalem, where the body of Judas <lb/>
            Iscariot was thrown. </note><note type="footnote"> 15 This Aristotle is numbered by Xenophon, in H. G. ii. 2, amongst the <lb/>
            Thirty Tyrants, as they were called, whom Lysander appointed to be the <lb/>

            same things must be both similar and dissimilar ? But that <lb/>
            this is impossible. For neither can things dissimilar be <lb/>
            similar, nor things similar be dissimilar. Is not this what <lb/>
            you assert? Zeno answered, It is. [4.] If then it is im­ <lb/>
            possible for dissimilars to be similar, and similars dissimilar, <lb/>
            it is impossible likewise for many things to exist ? For if <lb/>
            there were many, they would undergo impossibilities. Is this <lb/>
            what your discourses mean? Is it any thing else than to <lb/>
            contest, contrary17 to all that is (usually) asserted, that the <lb/>
            many" does not exist? And do you fancy that each of your <lb/>
            discourses is a proof of this very doctrine ? so that you conceive <lb/>
            you have produced as many proofs as you have written dis­ <lb/>
            courses, (to show) that "the many" does not exist? say you <lb/>
            thus, or do I not rightly understand you ? No, said Zeno; but <lb/>
            you understand quite well the meaning of the whole work. <lb/>
            Then said Socrates, I perceive, Parmenides, that Zeno here <lb/>
            wishes not only to be familiar with you in other bonds of <lb/>
            friendship, but in your writings likewise. For Zeno has, in <lb/>
            a certain manner, written the same as yourself; but by some <lb/>
            change he endeavours to deceive us, as if asserting something <lb/>
            different. For you in your poems assert that the universe is <lb/>
            "one;" and you produce beautiful and excellent arguments in <lb/>
            support of this opinion. [5.] But Zeno says that " the many" <lb/>
            does not exist, and he too produces very many and mighty <lb/>
            proofs. With regard then to the fact, that you assert that “ the <lb/>
            one" exists, and he, that " the many" does not exist; and that <lb/>
            each of you speak so as to appear to have said not an atom <lb/>
            of the same things, although you both assert nearly the same, <lb/>
            it seems to me that what has been said by you is above us the <lb/>
            rest.18 It is so, Socrates, said Zeno. But you do not per­ <lb/>
            fectly comprehend the truth of my writings; although, like <lb/>
            the dogs of Laconia,19 you excellently pursue and track out <note type="footnote"> 17 Heindorf properly translates 'rapa, " contrary to;" Ficinus, by <lb/>

              what is there asserted. But this in the first place lies hid <lb/>
              from you, that this discourse is not in every respect of so <lb/>
              solemn a cast, that it was written, as you say, with the set <lb/>
              purpose20 of being concealed from mankind,21 as if effecting <lb/>
              something great; yet you have spoken something of what has <lb/>
              happened; and in truth, these writings are a kind of sup­ <lb/>
              port to the doctrine of Parmenides against those who en­ <lb/>
              deavour to ridicule it, (by saying) that if "one" exists, it <lb/>
              would follow that such an assertion would suffer many things <lb/>
              of a laughable kind, and contrary to itself. This writing there­ <lb/>
              fore contradicts those, who assert that " the many" exists; <lb/>
              and it gives in return these22 and many other reasons; as it <lb/>
              intends to show that the hypothesis, which (asserts) the ex­ <lb/>
              istence of " the many," would suffer things still more laugh­ <lb/>
              able than that, which says of 23if "many" exist, or of "one" <lb/>
              existence,23 should a person go through the question sum­ <lb/>
              ciently. [6.] Through some such love of contention was this <lb/>
              discourse composed by me, when a youth; but some one stole it <lb/>

              fancy, by an older one, through the love of renown,24 since,25 <lb/>
              as I have said, you have not made a bad guess. I receive (the <lb/>
              account), says Socrates; and I think the case is as you have <lb/>
              stated. But tell me this too. Do you not think there is a cer­ <lb/>
              tain form of similitude, existing itself by itself? and that another <lb/>
              is contrary to this, which is dissimilar ? and that you and me, <lb/>
              and other things, which we call many, participate in these two ? <lb/>
              and that some things, participating in similitude, become similar <lb/>
              in that respect and so far as they participate ? but that others, <lb/>
              (which participate) in dissimilitude, (become) dissimilar ? and <lb/>
              that those (which participate in) both (become) both ? But if all <lb/>
              things participate in both, which are contrary to each other, and <lb/>
              that similar and dissimilar to each other exist through partici­ <lb/>
              pating of both, what is the wonder ? [7.] For, if any one should <lb/>
              show that similars themselves become dissimilar, or dissimilars <lb/>
              similar, I should think it would be a prodigy. But if he <lb/>
              shows'that such things, as participate in both of these, suffer <lb/>
              likewise both these, it does not appear to me, Zeno, that there <lb/>
              would be any thing absurd in the case; nor again, if any one <lb/>
              should show that all things are one, through their participat­ <lb/>
              ing in " the one," and that very same things are many, through <lb/>
              their participating in multitude. But I should very much <lb/>
              wonder if any one should show that what is one, is itself <lb/>
              many, and on the other hand, that what are many is one; and <lb/>
              in a similar manner concerning all the rest. It would indeed <lb/>
              be worthy of wonder, if he should show that both the genera <lb/>
              themselves and the species in them suffered these contrary <lb/>
              affections. But what is there wonderful, if any one should <lb/>
              show that I am both one thing and many, by saying, that <lb/>
              when he wishes to prove I am many, that the parts on <lb/>
              the right hand of me are different from those on the left, the <lb/>
              anterior from the posterior, and in like manner the upward <lb/>
              from the downward parts—for I think that I participate in <lb/>
              multitude-but when (he desires to show that) I am one, he <lb/>
              will say, that, we being seven in number, I am one man, <lb/>
              and participate in "the one"? so that he would by this <lb/>

              the many" one; and that he does not say any thing wonder­ <lb/>
              ful, but what we should all confess. [8.] But if any one <lb/>
              should, in the first place, distribute the species of things, con­ <lb/>
              cerning which I have just been speaking, separating them <lb/>
              according to their very selves, such as similitude and dissimili­ <lb/>
              tude, and multitude and the one, and standing and motion, <lb/>
              and the rest of this kind, and should afterwards show that <lb/>
              these things can in themselves be mixed and separated, I <lb/>
              should, Zeno, says he, be marvellously astonished. But it <lb/>
              appears to me that you have very manfully made this your <lb/>
              business; yet I should be much more astonished if any one <lb/>
              could solve this very same difficulty, which is involved on all <lb/>
              sides in species themselves; and, as you have gone through <lb/>
              in the case of things sensible to the sight, so (should he go <lb/>
              through) in the case of things comprehended by reason.</p>
          <p>On Socrates saying this, Pythodorus observed that he <lb/>
            thought that Parmenides and Zeno were at each remark an­ <lb/>
            noyed;26 but they gave the greatest attention to him, (Socrates,) <lb/>
            and frequently looking at each other smiled, as wondering at <lb/>
            Socrates. Hence on his ceasing to speak, Parmenides said- <lb/>
            How worthy, Socrates, are you of admiration27 for your <lb/>
            ardour in what relates to reasoning ! Tell me then, have you <lb/>
            thus separated, as you say, certain species apart by themselves, <lb/>
            and likewise those, that participate in them, apart ? And does <lb/>
            similitude itself appear to you to be separate from that simili­ <lb/>
            tude which we possess,28 and "one" and "many," and all such <lb/>
            other things as you have just now heard of from Zeno ? To me, <lb/>
            said Socrates, it does. [9.] And does it appear to you, (said <lb/>
            Parmenides,) that these things too exist, such as a species of <lb/>
            justice, itself by itself, and of the beautiful and the good, and all <lb/>
            things of such a kind ? Yes, says he. What, is there a species <note type="footnote"> 26 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄχθεσθαι</foreign> Heindorf suggested, what Stalbaum is disposed <lb/>

            29 some species itself of man,29 or of fire, or water ? I have often, <lb/>
            said (Socrates), been in doubt, Parmenides, on this point; whe­ <lb/>
            ther it is necessary to speak of these in the same manner as of <lb/>
            those, or in a different manner. And do you doubt, Socrates, <lb/>
            whether it is necessary to say that of each individual thing, as <lb/>
            may appear to be ridiculous, such as hair, clay, and filth, or <lb/>
            any thing else the most worthless and vile, there is a species <lb/>
            apart, as being different from those which we take into our <lb/>
            hands? By no means, said Socrates; but (I think)30 that <lb/>
            things are as we see them: but (consider) lest it be not very <lb/>
            absurd to think that there is a certain form of these ? Al­ <lb/>
            ready it has at some time disturbed me, lest there be some­ <lb/>
            thing of the same kind in the case of every thing. But <lb/>
            afterwards, when I have been standing31 in this way, I rapidly <lb/>
            . take myself off, fearing lest, falling into an abyss of trifling,32 <lb/>
            I should utterly perish and be lost. But, returning from <lb/>
            thence33 to what we have just now asserted as possessing <lb/>
            species, I have passed my time in busying myself about <lb/>
            them. [10.] For, said Parmenides, you are as yet but a <lb/>
            young man, Socrates, and Philosophy has not yet laid hold <lb/>
            of you, as she will yet lay hold of you, according to my <lb/>
            thinking, when you shall not despise any of these things: but <lb/>

            say, that there are certain species, of which these the rest34 <lb/>
            participating retain their appellations; as, for instance, that <lb/>
            such things as participate in similitude are similars; in great­ <lb/>
            ness, are great; and in beauty and justice, are beautiful and <lb/>
            just? Entirely so, said Socrates. Does not every thing <lb/>
            which participates, either participate in the whole species, or <lb/>
            only in a part of it ? Or can there be any other mode of <lb/>
            participation besides these? How can there be? said (So­ <lb/>
            crates). Does it then appear to you that the whole species in <lb/>
            each individual of many things is one ? Or how ? What, <lb/>
            said Socrates, prevents it, Parmenides, from being so?35 <lb/>
            Being, therefore, one and the same in things many and se­ <lb/>
            parate from each other, it will be36 at the same time whole, <lb/>
            and thus it will be separate itself from itself. It would not <lb/>
            be so, said (Socrates), if, just as the day, being one and the <lb/>
            same, is present in many places at the same time, and yet is <lb/>
            not the more separate from itself; in the same manner,37 if <lb/>
            every species may be at once one and the same in all. [11.] <lb/>
            Pleasantly indeed, said Parmenides, do you, Socrates, make <lb/>
            one and the same thing to be in many places; just as if, <lb/>
            covering many men with a sail-cloth, you should say that <lb/>
            there is one whole over many ; or do you think that you would <lb/>
            not assert something of this kind? Perhaps so, said So­ <lb/>
            crates. Will then the whole sail-cloth be over each person, <lb/>
            or one part of it over one person, and another over another ? <lb/>
            A part. Then, said Parmenides, these species, Socrates, are <lb/>
            divisible; and that which participates in them, would par­ <lb/>
            ticipate only in a part of them; and there would no longer <lb/>
            be in each a whole, but only a part of each.38 So it seems. <lb/>

            which are great, should be great by a part of magnitude, less <lb/>
            than magnitude itself, it would not appear absurd. Entirely <lb/>
            so, said (Socrates).</p>
          <p>What then ? 39 Will each little thing, by taking a part of <lb/>
            the equal, have that, which, to a thing less than the equal <lb/>
            itself, will be the thing having equal to some thing ?39 It is <lb/>
            impossible. '40 But some one of us will possess a part of the <lb/>
            small; and the small itself will be greater than this, inasmuch <lb/>
            as it is a part of itself; and thus the small itself will be <lb/>
            greater: but that to which the part taken away shall be added, <lb/>
            will become smaller, but not greater than before. [12.] This, <lb/>
            said Socrates, cannot be.40 After what manner then, Socrates, <note type="footnote"> 39—39 Such is the literal and nonsensical version of the unintelligible <lb/>
            Greek. Ficinus has, " Ipsius æqualis parte unumquidque parvum parti­ <lb/>

            æquale alicui sit;" which I cannot understand: and I am equally in the <lb/>

            quo, quanquam id minus sit quam ipsum TO 'aoy, tamen cuiquam rei <lb/>

              Proclus says, as translated by Taylor, " If any thing has a share in a <lb/>
              part of equality, it has a share in something less than the whole; but <lb/>
              that which participates in the lesser, is no longer lesser, but equal. This, <lb/>
              however, ought not to be; since it has been agreed that forms (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴδη</foreign>) <lb/>
              give the appellation of themselves to sensibles. Hence that which par­ <lb/>
              ticipates in the lesser, must not be called equal, but lesser; nor must that, <lb/>
              which participates in the equal, be called lesser, but equal; nor that, <lb/>
              which participates in the greater, be called equal or lesser, but greater." </note><note type="footnote"> 40—40 According to Proclus, all within the numerals was thought by some <lb/>
              persons to be spurious in consequence of the difficulty of perceiving what <lb/>
              Plato was aiming at. Tried by this test, nearly the whole of what Proclus <lb/>
              has written himself might be rejected as apocryphal. Absurd as the <lb/>
              theory is, it has been adopted by some of the modem scholars of Germany, </note> <lb/>

              can the other things participate in species, if they are able to <lb/>
              participate neither according to parts, nor according to wholes ? <lb/>
              It does not, said (Socrates), appear to me, by Zeus, to be at all <lb/>
              an easy matter to define in a question of this kind. What <lb/>
              then ? How stands the case with you in regard to this ? To <lb/>
              what ? I think that you consider every species as one, on some <lb/>
              such account as this. When some things many in number seem <lb/>
              to you to be great, there seems perhaps to be one and the same <lb/>
              idea to you, who survey them all; from whence you con­ <lb/>
              sider the great to be one. You speak the truth, said So­ <lb/>
              crates ; but what, as regards the great itself, and the other <lb/>
              things which are great, if you look upon them all in like <lb/>
              manner through the soul, will not, on the other hand, a cer­ <lb/>
              tain one thing appear to you great, through which all these <lb/>
              necessarily seem to be great ? It seems so. Another species <lb/>
              of magnitude will then become apparent, besides magnitude <lb/>
              itself and its participants: and in addition to all these, another <lb/>
              (species), through which all these become great; each of your <lb/>
              species will no longer be one, but infinite in number. But, <note type="footnote">in the case of Thucydides especially; for they thus found it much easier <lb/>
              to cut out corruptions than to cure them. In the present case, however, <lb/>
              Stalbaum refuses to admit the notion of an interpolation, and least of all <lb/>
              in a passage which, he says, is so clear, that a person must be blind in­ <lb/>
              deed not to understand it. Accordingly he thus translates the first sen­ <lb/>
              tence ; " Let us suppose that any one of us contains in himself a part <lb/>
              of smallness itself." But although he asserts that the use of the future <lb/>
              in a hypothetical sense has nothing uncommon in it, he will find it difficult <lb/>
              to produce a single similar instance in the whole of Plato. And even if <lb/>
              he could find one in every page, yet he ought to have shown likewise <lb/>
              how, in a purely abstract question, there could be any allusion to human <lb/>
              beings, taken individually; for the expressions <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν ἠμι̃ν</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡμι̃ν</foreign>, in <lb/>
              § 15, are not in point. By observing, however, the balance of the sen­ <lb/>
              tences, it is easy to see that as <foreign xml:lang="grc">του̃ σμικρου̃ μέρος</foreign> is opposed to the pre­ <lb/>
              ceding <foreign xml:lang="grc">του̃ ἴσου μέρος</foreign>, so ought the latter part of one clause to balance <lb/>
              the latter part of the other. Hence I suspect that Plato wrote—'<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αλλὰ</foreign> </note> <figure type="illustration">

              think, the small itself will be greater than this (great thing), as being (the <lb/>

              what Plato wrote, we must read—<foreign xml:lang="grc">Καὶ εἰ οὕτω δὴ αὐτὸ</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">σμικρόν μει̃ζον</foreign> </note> <figure type="illustration">

              greater than the great thing, that, to which what has been taken away shall <lb/>

              said Socrates, (Have a care,) Parmenides, lest each of these <lb/>
              species be nothing more than a mental conception, and that it <lb/>
              is not meet for it to exist any where but in souls. For thus <lb/>
              each would be one, nor would the consequences, just now <lb/>
              mentioned, occur. [13.] What then, said (Parmenides), is <lb/>
              each of these mental conceptions one, and is there a mental <lb/>
              conception of nothing ? This, (said Socrates,) is impossible. It <lb/>
              is then of something ? Yes. Of a being or of a non-being ? <lb/>
              Of a being. Is it not of some one thing, 41 which that mental <lb/>
              conception understands as being a one certain idea over all <lb/>
              things ?41 Yes. Will not then that species, which is under­ <lb/>
              stood to be one, be always the same over all things ? This, on <lb/>
              the other hand, seems to be necessary. But what, said Par­ <lb/>
              menides, Is it not necessary, since you say that the other <lb/>
              things participate in species, either that each should seem to <lb/>
              you to be from mental conceptions, and that all of them under­ <lb/>
              stand, or that being mental conceptions, they understand <lb/>
              nothing ? But this, said Socrates, has no reason for it. But <lb/>
              this appears, Parmenides, to me to be for the most part <lb/>
              the case. That these species stand, as it were, patterns <lb/>
              in nature; but that the other things are similar to them, <lb/>
              and are their resemblances: and that this participation of <lb/>
              species by the other things, is nothing more than an assi­ <lb/>
              milation to them. If then any thing, said (Parmenides), <lb/>
              becomes similar to the species, can it be possible for that <lb/>
              species not to be similar to the assimilated, so far as it is ren­ <lb/>
              dered similar ? Or is there any method by which the similar <lb/>
              would not be similar to the similar ? There is not. Is there <lb/>
              not, therefore, a great necessity for the similar to participate <lb/>
              in one and the same form as the similar ? There is a neces­ <lb/>
              sity. But will not that, through the participation of which <lb/>
              the similars become similars, be species itself? Entirely so. <lb/>
              [14.] It is not, therefore, posssible for a thing to be similar to <lb/>
              the species, nor the species to another. For otherwise an- <note type="footnote"> 41—41 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὸν νοει̃</foreign>, Thomson proposed to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπινοει̃</foreign>, and so one <lb/>
              MS. But <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ</foreign> would have no meaning here. The three oldest MSS. offer <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰ̄ποννοει̃ν</foreign>. Ficinus found in his MS. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑπομένην</foreign>. For his version is <lb/>
              " notionem—sequentem.” There is some deep-seated error here. From <lb/>
              the subsequent <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὂν</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὸ ἐπὶ πα̃σιν</foreign>, it is evident that Plato did not write <lb/>
              <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπόν</foreign>. He might have written, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὃ ἐπὶ πα̃σιν ὂν ἐκει̃νο</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόημα νοει̃, εἰπει̃ν <lb/>
              τ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὴν̄ μίαν τιν</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ̄σαν ἰδέαν</foreign>, i. e. " which that conception understands as <lb/>
              being over all, and of which one may speak as being a certain one idea." </note> <lb/>

              other species will always appear by the side of the species; <lb/>
              and should this again become similar to another, another <lb/>
              (would appear) ; and a new species would never cease to be <lb/>
              continually produced, if the species should be produced similar <lb/>
              to its participant. You speak most truly. Hence, then, the <lb/>
              other things do not participate in species through similitude; <lb/>
              but it is necessary to seek after something else, through <lb/>
              which they do participate. So it seems.</p>
          <p>See you then, Socrates, said (Parmenides), how great is the <lb/>
            difficulty, should any one define species as existing themselves <lb/>
            by themselves ? Very much so. Know then well, said (Parme­ <lb/>
            nides), that you do not apprehend at all, so to speak, how great <lb/>
            is the difficulty, if, separating each of the things existing, you <lb/>
            should lay down one species. How so, said (Socrates) ? There <lb/>
            are many and other (doubts), said (Parmenides); but this is <lb/>
            the greatest. Should any one assert that it is not proper for <lb/>
            the species to be known, if they are such as we have said they <lb/>
            ought to be, a person would not have it in his power to de­ <lb/>
            monstrate to the party asserting this, that he is deceived ; un­ <lb/>
            less he who doubts is skilled in many thngs, and is of a good <lb/>
            disposition, and willing to follow the demonstrator, while <lb/>
            busied in many (proofs), and these far-fetched; while he who <lb/>
            holds, as a matter of necessity, that they are not to be known, <lb/>
            will be unpersuaded. [15.] In what way, Parmenides? <lb/>
            said Socrates. Because, Socrates, I think that both you and <lb/>
            (any)42 other person, who lays down that the essence of each <lb/>
            species exists itself by itself, would allow, in the first place, <lb/>
            that not one of them exists in us. For, said Socrates, how <lb/>
            could it still exist itself by itself? You speak well, (Par­ <lb/>
            menides) said. But do not such ideas as are, with relation to <lb/>
            each other, such as they are, possess also their essence with <lb/>
            respect to themselves, and not with reference to things exist­ <lb/>
            ing among us, whether they are resemblances, or in whatever <lb/>
            manner a person may set them down; by the names of each <note type="footnote"> 42 This " any " is supported by " quemvis " in Ficinus; who found, I sus­ <lb/>

            of which, while we participate in them, we are called ? but <lb/>
            the things existing among us, and which are synonymous to <lb/>
            those, exist, on the other hand, with reference to themselves, <lb/>
            and not with relation to the species; and belong to themselves, <lb/>
            but not to those which receive from them a common appel­ <lb/>
            lation. How say you ? replied Socrates. As if, said Parme­ <lb/>
            nides, some one of us should be the master or slave of any one; <lb/>
            43 for a slave is surely not the slave of a master, who is ab­ <lb/>
            stractedly speaking a master, nor is a master the master of a <lb/>
            slave, who is abstractedly speaking a slave;43 44 but being <lb/>
            a man, both these are of a man ;44 45but master itself is that, <lb/>
            which it is from its relation to slavery itself; and slavery itself <lb/>
            is in a similar manner slavery with reference to mastery it­ <lb/>
            self.45 But what are in us do not possess any power, as regards <lb/>
            those, nor those any, as regards us; but they exist, as I say, from <lb/>
            themselves, and with relation to themselves ; and those by us <lb/>
            in a similar manner with relation to themselves. Or do you <lb/>
            not understand what I am saying ? I understand, said Socrates, <lb/>
            perfectly. [16.] 46 Would not science itself, said (Parmenides), <lb/>
            which is a thing science, be a science of that itself which is a <lb/>

              has been, Socrates, confessed by us, that those species do not <lb/>
              possess the power, which they possess, in relation to those <lb/>
              among us, nor those among us in relation to them; but that <lb/>
              each (possess their power) in relation to themselves. It was <lb/>
              so confessed. If then there is this52 the most exact mastery <lb/>
              with the deity, and this the most exact science, their53 mastery <lb/>
              will not rule over us, nor will (their) science know us, nor <lb/>
              aught of the things among us; and similarly we do not rule54 <lb/>
              over them by our rule, nor do we know aught of things di­ <lb/>
              vine55 by our science. [18.] 56[And again, according to the <lb/>
              same reasoning, they will neither, though gods, be our masters, <lb/>

              said (Socrates), lest the reasoning be not very wonderful, <lb/>

              said Parmenides, and very many others, Socrates, in addition <lb/>
              to these, it is necessary for the species to undergo, if there <lb/>
              are these ideas of things existing, and if any one shall define <lb/>
              each species, as being something itself; so that the hearer <lb/>
              may be in a difficulty, and, doubting, contend that such species <lb/>
              do not exist; or if they do exist ever so much, that there is a <lb/>

            and each of the other species: for I lately perceived, and I heard <lb/>
            you discoursing with this Aristotle here. Beautiful and <lb/>
            divine, be assured, is that ardour of yours, by which you rush <lb/>
            onwards to rational conversations. But draw yourself out,66 <lb/>

            account of (the ardour) appearing useless to the many, and <lb/>
            being called by them a mere idle talking; for if you do not, <lb/>

          <p>What then, said (Socrates), is the method of the exercise, <lb/>
            Parmenides ? That, said (Parmenides), which you have heard <lb/>

            trary to Zeno,68 that you did not permit (a person) in the things <lb/>
            seen (by the eye) to look into the aberration about them, but <lb/>
            about those, which a person could especially lay hold of by <lb/>
            reason, and would consider to be species.69 For it appears to <lb/>
            me, said (Socrates), that in this way it would be not difficult <lb/>
            to prove that the things existing are both similar and dis­ <lb/>
            similar, and suffering any other state whatever. You speak <lb/>
            well, said (Parmenides) : but it is necessary for you to do this <lb/>
            likewise; not only to make a supposition, whether each thing <lb/>
            exists, and to consider the consequences from the supposition, <lb/>
            but also, if it does not exist, to suppose this same thing,70 if <lb/>

              wish to (exercise yourself) in the hypothesis which Zeno has <lb/>
              laid down, that, " if there are many things," what must happen <lb/>
              both to "the many," with respect to themselves, and to " the <lb/>
              one;" and to "the one " with respect to itself, and to "the many:" <lb/>
              and “ if many are not," to consider again what will happen both <lb/>
              to " the one " and to " the many," with respect to themselves and <lb/>
              to each other: and again, if you made the supposition " if simi­ <lb/>
              litude is," or " if it is not," what will on each supposition happen <lb/>
              both to the things supposed and to the others, with respect to <lb/>
              themselves and to each other; and the same reasoning (must <lb/>
              be) concerning " the dissimilar," and " motion ” and " standing," <lb/>
              and "generation" and "destruction," and "entity" and " non­ <lb/>
              entity and, in one word, concerning every thing which you <lb/>
              suppose either to be or not'to be, or suffering any other state <lb/>
              whatever, it is necessary to consider what will happen both to <lb/>
              itself and to each individual of the other things, which you <lb/>
              may select, and towards many, and towards all things in a <lb/>
              similar manner ; and again, how the other things are related <lb/>
              to themselves, and to another, which you may select, whether <lb/>
              you suppose that, which is the subject of your supposition, <lb/>
              as existing or not existing; if you are about to be exercised <lb/>
              in a masterly manner, and to perceive thoroughly the truth.</p>
          <p>You are speaking, Parmenides, of an impossible occupation, <lb/>
            said Socrates, nor do I very well understand you. But why <lb/>
            do you not go through a certain supposition yourself, that I <lb/>
            may learn the better? You enjoin, Socrates, said (Parmenides), <lb/>
            a great task upon a man so old as myself. But why do not you <lb/>
            then, Zeno, said Socrates, go through it for us ? And then (Py­ <lb/>
            thodorus) stated that Zeno laughing said—[21.] Let us, So­ <lb/>
            crates, request Parmenides himself; for (see) lest it be no trifling <lb/>
            matter, as he says; or do you not perceive how great a task you <lb/>
            are enjoining ? If then we were many it would not be pro­ <lb/>
            per to make such a request; for it is unbecoming, especially <lb/>
            for a man of such an age, to speak things of this kind before <lb/>
            many. For the many are ignorant that, without this discur­ <lb/>
            siveness and wandering through all things, it is impossible for <lb/>
            the mind to meet with the truth, and to keep possession of it. <lb/>
            I,therefore, Parmenides, do, together with Socrates, make the <lb/>
            request in order that I too may after a long time hear it. On <lb/>
            Zeno so saying, Antiphon said that Pythodorus related that <note type="footnote"> 2E2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="420"/>
            he too, and Aristotle, and the rest, entreated Parmenides to de­ <lb/>
            clare what he had said, and not to do otherwise. There is a ne­ <lb/>
            cessity then, said Parmenides, for me to comply; although I <lb/>
            seem to myself to suffer the fate of the horse of Ibycus, to <lb/>
            whom as being a competitor and rather old, when about to <lb/>
            contend in a chariot race, and fearing through his experience <lb/>
            for the event, Ibycus71 compares himself by saying, " Thus I <lb/>
            too, who am so old, am forced to the contests of love to go;” <lb/>
            so I, upon recollection, appear to myself to feel a great fear <lb/>
            how I, at such an age, must swim through such and so great a <lb/>
            sea 72 of words ;73 yet I must gratify you, since, as Zeno says, <lb/>
            we are by ourselves. Whence then shall we begin ; and what <lb/>
            shall we first of all suppose? [22.] Or are you willing, <lb/>
            since it seems good to play a business-like game, for me to <lb/>
            begin from myself, and my own hypothesis, by supposing, <lb/>
            with respect to "the one itself," if one "is," or "is not," <lb/>
            what must happen ? By all means, said Zeno. Who then, <lb/>
            said (Parmenides), will answer me? Will the youngest? <lb/>
            For he will have very little trouble ; for he will answer <lb/>
            what he thinks; and his answer will be at the same time <lb/>
            a resting-place for me. I am prepared, said Aristotle, in <lb/>

          <p rend="script">If " one" is, is it not that " the one " will not be many ? <lb/>
            For how can it be? There must then be of it neither a part <lb/>
            nor a whole. How so ? Is not a part a part of a whole ? <lb/>
            Yes. But what is a whole? Would not that, to which no <lb/>
            part is wanting, be a whole ? Entirely so. On both sides <lb/>
            then " the one" would be (composed) of parts, as being a <lb/>
            whole and having parts ? It is necessary. And so in both <lb/>
            ways " the one " will be many, but not one. True. But it <lb/>
            must be not many, but one. It must. Hence, it will neither <lb/>
            be a whole, nor possess parts, if "the one" is one. It will <lb/>
            not. [23.] If then it has no parts, it has neither beginning, <lb/>
            nor middle, nor end; for such as these would be its parts ? <lb/>
            Right. But end and beginning are the bounds of each <lb/>
            thing ? How not ? " The one " therefore is infinite, if it has <lb/>
            neither beginning nor end ? Infinite. And therefore with­ <lb/>
            out figure; for it neither participates of the round nor the <lb/>
            straight. How so ? For the round figure75 is that, the ex­ <lb/>
            tremities of which are on all sides equally distant from the <lb/>
            middle. Yes. And the straight is that, the middle of which <lb/>
            is situated before both the extremes ?76 It is so. Would <lb/>
            not then “ the one " have parts, and be many, whether it par­ <lb/>
            ticipates in a straight figure or a round ? Entirely so. It is <lb/>
            therefore neither straight nor circular, since it has not parts. <lb/>
            Right. And being such, it will be no where; for it would <lb/>
            be neither in another, nor in itself. How so ? Being in <lb/>
            another, it would somehow be surrounded circularly by that, <lb/>
            in which it might be, and it would be touched by many things <lb/>
            in many places. But it is impossible for " the one," being <lb/>
            without parts, and not participating in a circle, to be touched <lb/>
            in a circle in many places. It is impossible. [24.] But <lb/>
            being itself in itself, it would be likewise surrounding itself; <lb/>

            impossible for a thing to be in that, which does not surround <lb/>
            it. It is impossible. [24.] Would not then that, which <lb/>
            contains, be one thing, and that which is contained, another ? <lb/>
            78 For the same whole cannot at the same time suffer and do <lb/>
            both these :78 and thus “the one " would no longer be one, <lb/>
            but two. It certainly would not. " The one," therefore, is <lb/>
            not any where, being neither in itself nor in another. It is <lb/>
            not. But consider, whether, being in this state, it is possible <lb/>
            for it to stand or be moved. Why can it not ? Because be­ <lb/>
            ing moved it would be carried on or be changed ;79 for these <lb/>
            alone are the kinds of motion. Certainly. But the one" <lb/>
            being changed from itself, it is impossible surely for it to be <lb/>
            still one. Impossible. It is not then moved as regards a <lb/>
            change. It appears it is not. But is it by being carried on ? <lb/>
            Perhaps so. And yet if " the one" is carried on, it would be <lb/>
            either carried round in the same circle, or it would change <lb/>
            from one place to another. Necessarily so. But ought not <lb/>
            that, which is carried round in a circle, to stand firm in the <lb/>
            middle, and to have the other parts of itself carried about the <lb/>
            middle ? But what method is there for that, which has neither <lb/>
            a middle nor parts, to be carried circularly about the middle ? <lb/>
            There is none. But by changing its position it is some­ <lb/>
            times here and other times there, and is moved ? If in­ <lb/>

            sible for “ the one " to be in any thing ? It has. [25.] Is <lb/>
            it not much more impossible for it to be in the act of being <lb/>
            (in any thing) ?81 I do not understand how. If any thing is <lb/>
            in the act of being in any thing, is it not necessary for it to be <lb/>

            out of it, if it be already in the act of being ? It is necessary. <lb/>
            If then any other thing suffers this state, that alone would <lb/>
            suffer it, which possesses parts; for one part of it would be <lb/>
            in that thing, but another out of it; but it will not be possible <lb/>
            for that, which has no parts, to be by any means wholly within <lb/>
            or without any thing. It is true. But is it not much more <lb/>
            impossible for that, which neither has parts nor happens to be <lb/>
            a whole, to be in the act of being in any thing; since it can <lb/>
            neither exist in the act of being according to parts, nor ac­ <lb/>

            in any thing, nor in being carried round in the same, nor in <lb/>
            being changed. It does not appear it does. " The one " there­ <lb/>

            movable. But we have likewise asserted that it is impossible <lb/>

            never therefore be in " the same." Why so? Because it <lb/>
            would be already in that,83 in which it is (as if) in "the same."83 <lb/>
            Entirely so. But the- one itself84 can neither be in itself nor <lb/>

            will it be the same either with “different,”87 or with itself ; nor <lb/>
            again different either from itself or from "different." How <lb/>
            so ? Being different from itself, it would surely be different <lb/>
            from " one," and so would not be " one." True. And if it <lb/>
            should be the same with " different," it would be that (" dif. <lb/>
            ferent"), and would not be itself; so that " one" would thus be <lb/>
            not what it is, but different from " one." It would not in­ <lb/>
            deed. 88 It will then be not the same with “different” or <lb/>
            different from itself ? It will not.88 But it will not be dif­ <lb/>
            ferent from "different," while it is "one." For it does not <lb/>
            belong to " one" to be different from any thing, but to be " dif­ <lb/>

            then, of its being " one," it will not be “ different ;” or do you <lb/>
            think (it can) ? Certainly not. 89 But if it is not (different) <lb/>
            through this, neither will it be through itself.89 But if not <lb/>

            one " to be either different from " different," or the same with <lb/>

            different nor the same, either with respect to itself or different. <lb/>
            It would not. But neither will it be similar to any thing, <lb/>

            cause the " similar " somehow has the accident of92 " same." <lb/>
            Certainly. But it has been seen that "the same" is naturally <lb/>
            separate from " the one." It has been so seen. But if " the <lb/>
            one" should suffer any thing apart from being " the one," <lb/>
            it would suffer the being more than one; but this is im­ <lb/>
            possible. Certainly. In no respect then can " the one" suf­ <lb/>
            fer the being " the same," either with another or with itself. <lb/>
            It does not appear it can. Nor can it therefore be similar <lb/>
            either to another or to itself. It seems it cannot. Nor yet <lb/>
            has "the one" suffered the being “different ;” for thus it <lb/>
            would suffer the being more than one. For (it would) more. <lb/>
            But that which suffers the being different either from itself or <lb/>
            from another, will be dissimilar either to itself or to another, <lb/>
            if that which suffers the being the same is similar. Right. <lb/>
            But " the one," as it appears, since it in no respect suffers the <lb/>
            being " different," would in no respect be dissimilar either to <lb/>

            greater measures. How should it not ? Is it not therefore <lb/>
            impossible for that which does not participate in " the same," <lb/>
            to consist either of the same measures, or of any thing else <lb/>
            whatever the same ? It is impossible. • It would therefore be <lb/>
            equal neither to itself nor to another, if it does not consist of <lb/>
            the same measures. It appears not. But if it consists of more <lb/>
            or fewer measures, it will be of as many parts as there are <lb/>
            measures; and thus again it will no longer be " one," but as <lb/>
            many as there are measures. Right. But even if it should <lb/>
            be of one measure, it would become equal to that measure. <lb/>
            But it has been seen to be impossible for one (itself)93 to be <lb/>
            equal to any thing. It has been seen. [29.] " The one" <lb/>
            therefore neither participates in one measure, nor in many, <lb/>
            nor in a few, nor in any way participates in "the same," nor <lb/>
            will it ever, as it seems, be equal to itself or to another; nor, <lb/>
            on the other hand, greater or less either than itself or " differ­ <lb/>
            ent." It is in every respect so. But what,94 does the one " <lb/>
            seem (to be) older or younger (than any thing), or to be of <lb/>
            the same age (with any thing) ? Why should it not ? If it <lb/>
            had in any respect the same age, either with itself or with <lb/>
            another, it would participate in the similitude and equality of <lb/>
            time, in which properties we have asserted "the one"95 does <lb/>
            not participate 96 [either similitude or equality].96 We so as­ <lb/>
            serted. And this also we asserted, that it participates neither <lb/>
            in dissimilitude nor inequality. Entirely so. How then, <lb/>
            being such, can it be either older or younger (than any <lb/>
            thing),97 or of the same age with any thing ? By no means. <lb/>

              become older than itself? It is necessary. But is not the <lb/>
              older always older than the younger? What then ? That <lb/>
              which is in the act of being older than itself, is at the same <lb/>
              time in the act of being younger than itself, 98ifit is about to <lb/>
              have that (through) which it is in the act of being older.98 <lb/>
              [30.] How say you ? Thus. It is requisite that nothing <lb/>
              should exist in the act of being at variance one with an­ <lb/>
              other, 99when it is already at variance;99 but that being now <lb/>

              nor to be at all at variance,100 but to be in the act, and <lb/>
              not otherwise to exist. It is necessary. But the older is at <lb/>
              variance with the younger, and with nothing else. Certainly. <lb/>
              Hence, that which is in the act of being older than itself, <lb/>
              must necessarily at the same time be in the act of being <lb/>

              are necessary. It is necessary therefore, as it appears, for <lb/>

            whole ? Of the whole.19 Whatever then is one, is a whole, <lb/>
            and possesses a part. Entirely so. What then, 20 of these parts <lb/>
            of the one being both "one" and "being," do either desert <lb/>
            each the other, so that " one" is wanting to “ being," and <lb/>

            least part is composed of two parts;21 and thus perpetually <lb/>
            by the same reasoning, whatever becomes a part possesses <lb/>
            these two parts perpetually; for " one" always contains <lb/>

          <p>Proceed still further by this road. By what? We have <lb/>
            said that the one participates in " being," so far as it is being. <lb/>
            We have said so. And on this account "one being'' appears <lb/>
            to be " many." It does so. What then ? If one itself, which <lb/>
            we say participates in being, we receive mentally, alone by <lb/>
            itself, and apart from that in which we say it participates, <lb/>

              ing;" but as being one 24 it participated in " being." It is ne­ <lb/>
              cessary. If then "being" is one thing, and "one" another, <lb/>
              neither is " one " by its existence as one different from " being," <lb/>
              nor " being " by its existence as " being " different from " one;" <lb/>
              but they are different from each other 25 through that which is <lb/>
              different and another.25 Entirely so. So that "the different" is <lb/>
              the same neither with "the one ” nor with the being." How <lb/>
              can it ? What then, if we should select from them, whether if <lb/>
              you will "the being" and “ the different," or "the being" and <lb/>
              "the one," or "the one" and "the different," should we not, in <lb/>
              each selection, select certain two things, which it is proper to <lb/>
              denominate both ? How so ? Thus. It is possible to speak of <lb/>
              “ being." It is. And again, to speak of " one." And this <lb/>
              likewise. Are not then either spoken of ? Yes. But what, <lb/>
              when I say “being,” and "one," do I not pronounce both? <lb/>
              Entirely so. And if I should say " being " and " different," <lb/>
              or "different" and "one," should I not in each of these pro­ <lb/>
              nounce both perfectly ?26 Yes. But can those things which <lb/>
              are properly denominated both, be both, and yet not two ? <lb/>
              They cannot. And is there any method for each of things, <lb/>
              that are two, not to be one ? There is not. Of these then, <lb/>
              since each two exist together, each would be one. It appears <lb/>
              so. [35.] But if each of them is one, and any one whatever <lb/>
              is placed together with them, by any kind of union whatever, <lb/>

              the evenly even, and the oddly odd; and the oddly even, and <lb/>

              think that any number is left, which is not necessarily there ? <lb/>
              By no means. If then “one” exists, it is necessary for <lb/>
              number to exist likewise. It is necessary. But if number <lb/>
              exists, the many would exist, and an infinite multitude of <lb/>
              beings; or is there not a number, infinite in multitude, and <lb/>
              participating in "being?" .There is, by all means. If then <lb/>
              every number participates in "being," would not each part <lb/>
              also of number participate in “being?” Yes. "Being" then <lb/>
              has been distributed through all things, being many, and <lb/>
              stands apart from nothing existing, whether the least or the <lb/>
              greatest. Or is it not absurd even to ask this question ?28 <lb/>
              For how could "being" stand apart from any thing existing ? <lb/>
              By no means. [36.] " Being" then is cut up into fractions <lb/>
              the smallest possible, and the greatest, and existing in every <lb/>
              degree, 29 and is divided the most of all things,29 and the parts <lb/>
              of "being" are infinite. 30 Such is the case. Very many, <lb/>
              therefore, are its parts. Very many, indeed.30 What then, is <lb/>
              there any one of these, which is a part of " being," and yet is <lb/>
              not one part ? But how can this be ? But if it is, I think there <lb/>

              a greater part, or in any thing else. It is so. Is then "one" <lb/>
              a whole, existing in many places at the same time ? Look into <lb/>
              this. I do look, and I see it is impossible. It is divided then, <lb/>
              since it is not a whole; for it will not otherwise than in a <lb/>
              divided state, be present to all the parts of " being." Certainly. <lb/>
              But there is a great necessity for that, which is divisible, to <lb/>
              be as many as are the parts. There is a necessity. [37.] We <lb/>
              did not then just now say truly, when we said that "being" <lb/>
              was distributed into very many parts. For it is not divided into <lb/>
              more parts than “one” itself,32 but into parts equal to those of <lb/>
              " the one: for neither is "being" wanting to “ the one," nor <lb/>
              " the one " to " being ;" but being two are always equalized <lb/>
              through all things. It appears to be entirely so. " One it­ <lb/>
              self," therefore, having been cut up into fractions by " being," <lb/>
              becomes many and infinite in multitude. So it appears. Not <lb/>
              only then is “ the being ”33 many, but it is likewise necessary <lb/>
              for " the one," when distributed by " being," to be many. <lb/>
              Entirely so. Moreover, because the parts are parts of a <lb/>
              whole, " the one" will be finite according as it is a whole. Or <lb/>
              are not the- parts included in the whole ? Necessarily so. <lb/>
              But that which includes would be a bound. How not ? <lb/>
              " The one " therefore is somehow both one and many, whole <lb/>
              and parts, finite and infinite in multitude. It appears so. <lb/>
              As it is bounded then, has it not likewise extremes ? Of <lb/>
              necessity. But what, if it be a whole, would it not have <lb/>
              likewise a beginning, a middle, and an end ? Or can there be <lb/>
              any whole without these three ? And if any one whatever of <lb/>
              these be wanting34 to any thing, will that thing be willing to <lb/>
              be any longer a whole ? It will not. " The one " then, as it <lb/>

              pate in a certain figure, either straight or round, or mixed up <lb/>
              of both. It would so. Will it then, being such, not exist itself <lb/>
              in itself and in another ? How ? Each of the parts is surely in <lb/>
              the whole, nor is any one out of the whole. It is so. But <lb/>
              all the parts are surrounded by the whole. Yes. But " the <lb/>
              one" is all the parts of itself; and is neither more nor less <lb/>
              than all. Certainly. Is not then the one the whole ? How <lb/>
              not ? If then all the parts are in the whole, and all the parts <lb/>
              are the one, and the whole itself and all the parts are surround­ <lb/>
              ed by the whole, "the one" would be surrounded by "the one," <lb/>
              and thus " the one " would be already in itself. It appears so. <lb/>
              But on the other hand, the whole is not in the parts, neither <lb/>
              in all, nor in any one. For, if it were in all, it would'neces­ <lb/>
              sarily be in one: for, if it were not in some one, it would not <lb/>
              be able to be in all. But if this one is a portion of all the <lb/>
              parts, and the whole is not in this, how can it be 35 any longer <lb/>
              in all the parts ? Not at all. Nor yet in any of the parts. For <lb/>
              if the whole were in some of the parts, the greater would be <lb/>
              in the lesser; which is impossible. It is impossible. [39.] <lb/>
              But since the whole is neither in many, nor in one, nor in all <lb/>
              the parts, is it not necessary for it to be either in some other, <lb/>
              or no where ? It is necessary. But if no where, will it not be <lb/>
              nothing ? And if it is a whole, since it is not in itself, is it <lb/>
              not necessary for it to be in another ? Entirely so. So far <lb/>
              therefore as "the one" is a whole, it is in another; but so far <lb/>
              as all things are its parts, and itself all the parts, it is in <lb/>
              itself; and thus the one will necessarily be in itself and in <lb/>
              another. Necessarily.</p>
          <p>But as "the one" is naturally such, is it not necessary for <lb/>
            it to be both moved and to stand still ? How ? It stands still, <lb/>
            if it be in itself. For being in one and not departing from <lb/>

            not the same or different, it will be a part of that, to which it <lb/>

            appears so. Is then the one" a part of itself? By no means. <lb/>
            36 It will not then with respect to a part of itself be a whole, <lb/>
            nor with respect to itself a part.36 For it cannot. But is <lb/>
            " one "'therefore different from “the one ?" By no means. It <lb/>
            will not then be different from itself. Certainly not. If then <lb/>
            it is neither different, nor a whole, nor yet a part, with respect <lb/>
            to itself, is it not necessary for it to be the same with itself? <lb/>
            It is necessary. What then, is it not necessary for that, <lb/>
            which is elsewhere than itself while existing in the same <lb/>
            with itself, to be different from itself, if indeed it shall be <lb/>

              in another. So it seems. In this way then it appears that " the <lb/>
              one" will be different from itself. It does so. What then, <lb/>
              if any thing39 is different from any thing, will it not be differ­ <lb/>
              ent from that which is different ? Necessarily so. But are <lb/>
              not all such things, as are not one, different from " the one?" <lb/>
              And is not " the one " (different from such things as) are not <lb/>
              one ? How not ? " The one" therefore will be different from <lb/>
              the rest. Different. See then, are not " the different" and <lb/>
              " the same " contrary to each other. How not ? Is the same <lb/>
              ever wont to be in the different, or the different in the same ? <lb/>
              It is not wont. [41.] If therefore the different is never in the <lb/>
              same, there is not one of existing things, in which the differ­ <lb/>
              ent exists for any time; for if it existed in any thing during <lb/>
              any time'whatever, during that time the different would be in <lb/>
              the same. Is it not so ? It is so. But since it is never in the <lb/>
              same, the different would never exist in any of existing things. <lb/>
              True. Neither therefore would the different exist in things <lb/>
              which are not one, nor in " the one." It would not. Through <lb/>
              " the different" therefore the one will not be different from <lb/>
              things which are not one, nor things which are not one be <lb/>
              different from " the one." Not indeed. Nor through them­ <lb/>
              selves will they be different from each other, since they do <lb/>
              not participate in " the different." For how can they ? But <lb/>
              if they are different neither through themselves, nor through <lb/>
              " the different," would they not escape entirely from being <lb/>
              different from each other ? They would escape. But neither <lb/>
              do things, which are not one, participate in "the one:" for <lb/>
              they would be no longer not one, but in some way one. True. <lb/>
              Nor would things, which are not one, be number; for possess­ <lb/>
              ing number, they would thus be altogether not one. They <lb/>
              would not. But what, can things which are not one be parts <lb/>
              of one ? Or would not things, which are not one, in this way <lb/>
              participate in “the one?” They would participate. If then <lb/>

              same with them ? Let us say so. " The one " then, as it ap­ <lb/>

              from this reasoning.</p>
          <p>But is it also similar and dissimilar to itself and others ? <lb/>
            Perhaps so. Since then it appears to be different from the <lb/>
            others, the others likewise will be somehow different from it. <lb/>
            But what then ? Will it not then be different from the others <lb/>
            in the same manner as the others from it ? And this neither <lb/>
            more nor less ? For what should it be ? If then neither more <lb/>
            nor less, it (will be) similarly. Certainly. In the manner <lb/>
            then through which the one ”42 suffers to become different <lb/>
            from the others, and the others similarly from it, in that <lb/>
            manner would the one be suffering similarly to the others, and <lb/>
            the others (similarly) to the one ? How say you ? Thus. Do <lb/>
            not you apply each name to something ? I do; what then ? <lb/>
            Could you pronounce the same name often or once ? I could.43 <lb/>

            there not a great necessity for you always to speak of the same <lb/>

            What then ? [43.] Is not " different" a name applied to some <lb/>

            same therefore will render something dissimilar; or it will <lb/>
            not be contrary to the different. So it appears. [44.] “ The <lb/>
            one" therefore will be both similar and dissimilar to " the <lb/>
            others;" so far as it is different it will be similar ; but so far <lb/>
            as it is the same, dissimilar. 49 It has, it seems, such reasoning.49 <lb/>
            And it has this likewise. What ? So far as it suffers the <lb/>
            same, it does not suffer what is of a different kind; and not <lb/>
            suffering what is of a different kind, it is not dissimilar; and <lb/>
            not being dissimilar, it is similar: but so far as it suffers an­ <lb/>
            other thing, it is of a different kind; and being of a different <lb/>
            kind, it is dissimilar. You speak the truth. Since then “the <lb/>
            one " is both the same with and different from " the others," <lb/>
            according to both and each of these cases, it will be similar <lb/>

          <p>But consider now how " the one " subsists with respect to <lb/>

            which it touches ?50 It is necessary. " The one," therefore, if <lb/>
            it is about to touch itself, ought to lie close to itself, and occupy <lb/>
            the place close to that in which it is. It ought so. [45.] <lb/>
            Would not " the one," if it were two, do this, and be in two <lb/>
            places at once ? But as long as it is one, it will not be wont <lb/>
            to do so. It will not. The same necessity therefore belongs <lb/>
            to " the one," to be neither two nor to touch itself. The same. <lb/>
            But neither will it touch the others. Why? Because we <lb/>
            have said, that when any thing is about to touch any thing, <lb/>
            which is separate from it, it ought to be placed close to that <lb/>
            which it is about to touch ; but that there must be no third in <lb/>
            the middle of them. True. Two things therefore at the least <lb/>
            are requisite, if contact is about to take place. Certainly. <lb/>
            But if a third is added close upon the two terms,51 there will <lb/>
            now be three, but the contacts two. Certainly. And thus <lb/>
            one always being added, one contact will be likewise added ; <lb/>
            and the result is that the contacts will be less by one than the <lb/>
            multitude of the numbers. For by how much the two first <lb/>
            things exceeded the contacts, 52 so as to be more in number <lb/>
            than the contacts,]52 by just so much does all the following <lb/>
            number exceed the multitude of the contacts. For already <lb/>
            hereafter53 one is added to the number, and one contact to the <lb/>
            contacts. Right. As many then as are in number the things <lb/>
            existing, (by so many,) less by one, are the contacts always. <lb/>
            True. If then there is only one thing, and not a pair, there <lb/>
            can be no contact. How can there ? Have we not said that <lb/>
            the other things, different from the one," are neither one nor <lb/>
            participate of it, since they are different ? We have. [46.] <note type="footnote"> evidently the interpretation of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν ἐχομένην</foreign>. For thus the expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν <lb/>

            Number therefore is not in the others, since one is not in <lb/>
            them. How can it? The others, therefore, are not one, or <lb/>
            two, or 54any thing possessing the name of another number.54 <lb/>
            No. "The one," therefore, is one alone, and could not be <lb/>
            two. It appears not. Contact, therefore, is not, when two <lb/>
            are not. It is not. " The one " therefore will neither touch <lb/>

            fore, "the one" will both touch and not touch others and <lb/>
            itself. So it appears.</p>
          <p>Is it not therefore equal and unequal to itself and "the <lb/>
            others?" How ? If " the one " were greater or less than " the <lb/>
            others," or "the others" greater or less than the one," would <lb/>
            it not follow that by “the one " being one, and “ the others " dif­ <lb/>
            ferent from " the one," they would be not an atom greater or <lb/>
            an atom less than each other, by those very existences ? But <lb/>
            if, in addition to their being such as they are, each possessed <lb/>
            equality, they would be equal to each other. But if “ the one" <lb/>
            possessed magnitude, and " the others " smallness, or “ the one " <lb/>
            magnitude, but the others" smallness, would not that, to <lb/>
            whatever species magnitude was present, be the greater; and <lb/>
            that, to whatever (species) smallness (was present), be the less. <lb/>
            Necessarily so. Are there not therefore these two species, <lb/>
            magnitude and smallness ? For if they had no existence they <lb/>
            surely could never be contrary to each other, and be inherent <lb/>
            in things existing. [47. ] How should they ? If then small­ <lb/>
            ness is inherent in " the one," it will either be inherent in the <lb/>
            whole or in a part of it. It is necessary. But what if it be in­ <lb/>
            herent in the whole? Will it not either be extended on an <lb/>
            equality through the whole of " the one," or surround " the <lb/>
            one?" Plainly so. If smallness then is inherent on an <lb/>
            equality in "the one," will it not be equal to " the one;" but <lb/>
            if it surrounds " the one," will it not be greater ? How not ? <lb/>
            Can then smallness be equal to or greater than any thing, and <lb/>
            produce the effects of magnitude and equality, but not on itself ? <lb/>
            It is impossible. Smallness then will not be inherent in the <lb/>
            whole of " the one;" but, if at all, in a part. Certainly. Nor <note type="footnote"> 54_54 From Taylor's translation of the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὔτε ἄλλου ἀριθμου̃ <lb/>

            yet, on the other hand, in the whole part; for if not, it would <lb/>
            produce the same effect as in the case of the whole; (for)65 it <lb/>
            would either be equal to, or greater than, the part in which it <lb/>
            is inherent. It is necessary. Smallness then will not be in <lb/>
            any thing existing, being inherent in neither a part nor a <lb/>
            whole; nor will there be any thing small, except smallness <lb/>
            itself. It seems not. 56 Neither will magnitude be in it. For <lb/>
            there would be some other thing greater, and, besides magni­ <lb/>
            tude itself, that in which magnitude is inherent, and this too, <lb/>
            although it being not small, which it ought to exceed, if in­ <lb/>
            deed it be great;56 but which in this case is impossible, since <lb/>
            smallness is not inherent in any thing existing. True. But <lb/>
            magnitude itself is not greater than any thing else but small­ <lb/>
            ness itself; nor is smallness less than any thing else but mag­ <lb/>
            nitude itself. [48.] It is not. Neither then would " the others ” <lb/>
            be greater than " the one," nor less, since they possess neither <lb/>
            magnitude nor smallness; nor do these two possess any power <lb/>
            either of exceeding or of being exceeded with respect to " the <lb/>
            one," but only with respect to each other; nor, on the con­ <lb/>
            trary, will " the one " be either greater or less than these two, <lb/>
            or "the others," as it possesses neither magnitude nor smallness. <lb/>
            So indeed it appears. If then " the one " is neither greater <lb/>
            nor less than " the others," is it not necessary for it to neither <lb/>
            exceed nor be exceeded by them ? It is necessary. Is there <lb/>
            not also a great necessity for that, which neither exceeds nor <lb/>
            is exceeded, to be on an equality? and if on an equality, to <lb/>
            be equal ? How not ? " The one " therefore will be in this <lb/>
            state with respect to itself. Possessing neither magnitude <lb/>
            nor smallness in itself, it would neither exceed nor be ex­ <lb/>
            ceeded by itself; but being on an equality, it would be equal <lb/>
            to itself. Entirely so. " The one " therefore will be equal <lb/>
            both to itself and " the others." So it appears.</p>
          <p>But being itself in itself, it would also be externally about <lb/>
            itself; and surrounding itself, it would be greater than itself; <note type="footnote"> 55 Ficinus has “quippe.”From whence Thomson suggested yap <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἴση</foreign> <lb/>

            intelligible than the Greek. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="444"/>
            but being surrounded, less than itself; and thus " the one" <lb/>
            would be both greater and less than itself. It would so. Is <lb/>
            not this also necessary, that there is nothing beyond " the one " <lb/>
            and "the others ?" How should it be otherwise ? But ought <lb/>
            not that, which has a being, to be always some where ? Yes. <lb/>
            And does not that, which exists in another, exist as the less <lb/>
            in the greater? For one thing cannot otherwise exist in <lb/>
            another. [49.] It cannot. But since there is nothing else <lb/>
            apart from " the one " and “the others," and it is necessary for <lb/>
            these to be in something, is it not necessary for them to be in <lb/>
            one another, 57 [the others in " the one," and " the one" in <lb/>
            the others] ;57 or that they should be no where ? It appears <lb/>
            so. Because then the one ” is in "the others," "the others" will <lb/>
            be greater than " the one," through surrounding it; and " the <lb/>
            one " will be less than "the others," by being surrounded. But <lb/>
            because " the others " are in " the one," " the one," by the same <lb/>
            reasoning, would be greater than "the others;" and "the others" <lb/>
            less than " the one." It appears so. " The one," therefore, <lb/>
            is equal to, greater and less, than both itself and others. It <lb/>
            seems so. But if it is greater, equal, and less, it will be of <lb/>
            equal, more, and fewer measures, both than itself and " the <lb/>
            others;" and if of measures, also of the parts. How should <lb/>
            it not? Being, therefore, of equal, more, and fewer mea­ <lb/>
            sures, it will also in number be more and less than itself and <lb/>
            “the others ;” and also, for the same reason, equal to itself and <lb/>
            “the others." How ? It would surely be of greater measures <lb/>
            than are those things, than which it is greater; and (it would <lb/>
            be) of as many parts as measures ; and in the same manner, (in <lb/>
            the case of those) than which it is less; and similarly (in the <lb/>
            case of those) to which it is equal. It is so. Since then " the <lb/>
            one" is both greater, less, and equal to itself, will it not also <lb/>
            contain measures equal to, more, and fewer than itself? And <lb/>
            if of measures, will not this also be true of parts ? How not ? <lb/>
            If then it contains equal parts with itself, it will be equal <lb/>
            in multitude to itself; but if more, more in multitude, and <lb/>
            if fewer, less in multitude, than itself. It appears so. [50.] <lb/>
            But will not " the one " be in a similar state as regards " the <lb/>
            others?" Because it appears to be greater in magnitude than <lb/>
            them, is it not necessary for it to be more in number than " the <note type="footnote"> 57—57 The words within brackets are evidently an interpolation. </note> <lb/>

            others?" and, because less in magnitude, fewer in number? and <lb/>
            because equal in magnitude, equal likewise in multitude to "the <lb/>
            others ?" It is necessary. And thus again, as it seems, " the <lb/>
            one" will be equal, more, and less in number, both than itself <lb/>
            and " the others." It will so.</p>
          <p>Does " the one," then, participate in time ? And is it, and <lb/>
            does it become, younger and older, itself than itself and " the <lb/>
            others?" And again,58 neither younger nor older than itself <lb/>
            and the others, although participating of time ? How ? " To <lb/>
            be " is surely its property, since it " is the one." Certainly. <lb/>
            But what else is " to be " than a participation in “being " in <lb/>
            conjunction with the present ? Just as " it was" is a parti­ <lb/>
            cipation in " being" in conjunction with the past, and " it <lb/>
            will be " with the future ? It is so. It must participate then in <lb/>
            time, if it participates in " being." Entirely so. Must it not <lb/>
            therefore participate in time while progressing ? Certainly. <lb/>
            It is always, therefore, in the act of being older than itself, <lb/>
            if it proceeds according to time. It is necessary. Do we <lb/>
            then remember that the older is (always)59 becoming older <lb/>
            than that which is becoming younger ?60 We remember. <lb/>
            Would not then " the one," since it is becoming older than <lb/>
            itself, become older than itself, while it is thus becoming <lb/>
            younger? Necessarily so. It becomes then both younger <lb/>
            and older than itself. Certainly. [51.] But is it not then <lb/>
            older, when it is in the act of being according to the present <lb/>
            time, which is between the "was" and the will be:" for in <lb/>
            proceeding from the "then" to " the hereafter," it will not pass <lb/>
            over " the now ?" It will not. Will it not then stop in the act <lb/>
            of being older, when it arrives at "the now," and is no longer <lb/>
            in the act of being, but is already61 older ? For as it proceeds <note type="footnote"> 58Ficinus has " et rursus contra," as if he had found in his MS. <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ <lb/>

            it will never be laid hold of by "the now." For that which is <lb/>
            proceeding is in such a state as to touch both "the now” and <lb/>
            "the hereafter," leaving hold of "the now," but laying hold of <lb/>
            the hereafter," because it is in the act of being between "the <lb/>
            hereafter" and the now." True. But if it is necessary for <lb/>
            whatever is in the act of being not to pass by "the now," <lb/>
            when it arrives at that point, it always stops in the act of <lb/>
            being, and "is" then whatever it may happen to become. It <lb/>
            appears so. " The one," then, when, in becoming older, it <lb/>
            arrives at "the now," stops in the act of being, and then <lb/>
            "is" older. Entirely so. "Is" it not then older than what <lb/>
            it was becoming older? And was it not becoming (older) <lb/>
            than itself? Certainly. Now the older is older than the <lb/>
            younger. It is. " The one" then is younger than itself, <lb/>
            when in becoming older, it arrives at " the now." Of neces­ <lb/>
            sity. But the now" is always present with the one," <lb/>
            through the whole of its being; for it is always "now," as <lb/>
            long as it "is." How not ? " The one," therefore. always is, <lb/>
            and is in the act of being younger and older than itself. So <lb/>
            it appears. But " is the one," or is it in the act of being, <lb/>
            62for a time longer than or equal to itself?62 An equal time. <lb/>
            [52.] But that which either is in the act of being, or is for <lb/>
            an equal time, has the same age. How not ? But that which <lb/>
            has the same age is neither older nor younger. It is neither. <lb/>
            "The one," therefore, since it is in the act of being, and is <lb/>
            for a time equal to itself, neither is nor is in the act of being <lb/>
            younger or older than itself. It appears to me not.</p>
          <p>But what of " the others ?"63 I have not what to say. But <lb/>
            this at least you have to say, that "the others," if they are <lb/>
            different things from " the one,"64 and not a different thing, are <lb/>
            more than “one.” For that which is different would be one ; <lb/>
            but those that are different are more than one, and would <lb/>
            possess multitude. They would. But being a multitude <note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">κοςπικϱα̃ςΟἶνον,τότ</foreign>’av <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἷδ</foreign>’<foreign xml:lang="grc">ψυ̃χοςἐνδόμοιςπέλειν</foreign>,quoted by Paley <lb/>

            they would participate in a greater number than the one ?" <lb/>
            How not ? What then ? Shall we say that the things more in <lb/>
            number are, or have been, generated prior, or the less ? The <lb/>
            less. The least then is the first. Now is not this " the one ?" <lb/>
            Certainly. " The one," therefore, was generated the first of all <lb/>
            things possessing number: but all "the others" have number, <lb/>
            if they are others and not another. They have. But that <lb/>
            which was first generated was, I think, prior in existence: <lb/>
            but the others are posterior. But such as have been gener­ <lb/>
            ated posterior, are younger than that which was generated <lb/>
            prior; and thus the others" would be younger than the one," <lb/>
            and the one" would be older than the others." It would. <lb/>
            But what is this ? Could the one" be generated contrary <lb/>
            to its nature? or is this impossible? Impossible. But the <lb/>
            one has appeared to possess parts ; and, if parts, a beginning, <lb/>
            an end, and a middle. Yes. Is not then the beginning <lb/>
            generated first of all, both of "the one" and of each of "the <lb/>
            others ;" and after the beginning all " the others," as far as the <lb/>
            end ? What then ? [53.] We will say moreover, that all <lb/>
            the others are parts of the whole and of one ; but that "the <lb/>
            one," together with the end, has been generated one and a <lb/>
            whole. We will say so. Now the end, I think, is generated the <lb/>
            last of all, but the one" is naturally generated together with <lb/>
            this ; so that, if it is necessary for the one " to be generated not <lb/>
            contrary to nature, it would, having been generated together <lb/>
            with the end, be naturally generated the last of" the others." It <lb/>
            appears so. " The one," therefore, is younger than " the others," <lb/>
            but " the others" are older than the one." So again it appears <lb/>
            to me. But what, must not the beginning or any other part <lb/>
            whatever of "the one," or of any thing else, if it is a part, and <lb/>
            not parts, be necessarily one, [sinee it is a part] ?65 Neces­ <lb/>
            sarily. "The one," therefore, would be generated together <lb/>
            with the first (part), while in the act of being, and together <lb/>
            with the second; and is never wanting to any one of the other <lb/>
            parts, while in the act of being, until, arriving at the extremity, <lb/>
            it becomes one whole, having been left out neither from the <lb/>
            middle, nor from the last. nor the first, nor from any other <lb/>
            (part) whatever in its generation. True. " The one," there­ <lb/>
            fore, will have the same age with " the others," so that, if it be <note type="footnote"> " The words within brackets are evidently an interpolation. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="448"/>
            not “the one" contrary to its own nature, it would be generated <lb/>
            neither prior nor posterior to " the others," but together with <lb/>
            them ; and according to this reasoning, "the one" will neither <lb/>
            be older nor younger than " the others," nor " the others" than <lb/>
            "the one:" but, according to the former reasoning, "the one" <lb/>
            was both older and younger than " the others," and they in a <lb/>
            similar manner than it. Entirely so.</p>
          <p>[54.] After this manner, then, "the one" is and has been <lb/>
            generated. But what again shall we say of its becoming <lb/>
            older and younger than the others, and of the others than <lb/>
            "the one;" and again, that it neither becomes older nor <lb/>
            younger ? (As we said) respecting its being, (shall we say) <lb/>
            in the same manner respecting its becoming to be ? or other­ <lb/>
            wise ? I am not able to say. But I am able (to say) this ; <lb/>
            that, although one thing is older than another, yet it cannot <lb/>
            become still older, than by that difference of age which it <lb/>
            possessed as soon as it was produced; nor, on the other hand, <lb/>
            can that which is younger become younger. For, equal things <lb/>
            being added to unequals, whether they are times or any thing <lb/>
            else, always cause them to differ by the same degree as that, by <lb/>
            which they were distant at first. How not? "That which is" <lb/>
            therefore would never become older or younger than any being,66 <lb/>
            if it is always different by an equal quantity from it in age: <lb/>
            but (this)67 is and was older, and that younger; but is not <lb/>
            becoming so. True. " The one " likewise will never become <lb/>
            either older or younger than " the others," it being so already. <lb/>
            Never. But see whether in this way (they) become younger and <lb/>
            older.68 In what way ? The same as that through which " the <note type="footnote"> 68 Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">του̃ἑνὸςὄντος</foreign>,Schleiermacher.with whom Heindorf, Bek­ <lb/>

            others " (older) than " the one." [55.] What then ? Since " the <lb/>
            one " is older than " the others," it has been generated during a <lb/>
            longer time than " the others." Certainly. Now consider again, <lb/>
            if we add an equal time to a longer and shorter time, does the <lb/>
            longer differ from the shorter by an equal or by a smaller part ? <lb/>
            By a smaller. 69 Will not then the one" differ from the <lb/>
            others" by an age as great subsequently as it did at first? but, <lb/>
            receiving an equal time with " the others," it will differ always <lb/>
            in age less than before.69 Will it not be so? Yes. But <lb/>
            would not that, which differs less in age, with respect to any <lb/>
            thing, than it did before, become younger than before, with <lb/>
            respect to those, than which it was before older ? Younger. <lb/>
            But if that is younger, will not, on the other hand, " the others" <lb/>
            be older with respect to "the one" than before? Entirely <lb/>
            so. That, therefore, which was generated younger, would be <lb/>
            in the act of becoming older, with respect to that which was <lb/>
            before generated and is older; but it never is older, but is <lb/>
            always in the act of becoming older than it; for the one ad­ <lb/>
            vances to a younger, but the other to an older, state; and on <lb/>
            the other hand, that which is older is in the act of becoming <lb/>
            younger in the same manner than the younger. For both <lb/>
            tending to that which is contrary to themselves, they are in <lb/>
            the act of becoming contrary to each other; the younger be­ <lb/>
            coming older than the older, and the older younger than the <lb/>
            younger. But they would not be able to become so. For <lb/>
            should they become so, they would no longer be in the act of be­ <lb/>

            of becoming younger and older than each other; and " the <lb/>

            because it has been made to appear to be older, and to <lb/>
            have had a prior generation: but the others" (have been <lb/>
            made to appear to be) older than the one," because they <lb/>
            have had a posterior generation. [56.] According to the <lb/>
            same reasoning, " the others " likewise are similarly related <lb/>
            with respect to “ the one," since they were made to appear to <lb/>
            be older and to have had a prior generation. So indeed <lb/>
            it appears. So far then as neither becomes younger or older <lb/>
            than the other, through their differing by an equal num­ <lb/>
            ber from each other, "the one" will not become older or <lb/>
            younger than " the others," nor the others than " the one." But <lb/>
            so far as it is necessary for the prior71 to differ 72by a part <lb/>
            ever another 72 from the posterior, and the posterior from the <lb/>
            prior, so far it is necessary for them to become older and <lb/>
            younger than each other, and the others" than " the one," and <lb/>
            "the one" than the others ?" Entirely so. On all these ac­ <lb/>
            counts then " the one " is, and is in the act of becoming older <lb/>
            and younger both than itself and " the others;" and again, it <lb/>
            neither is nor is in the act of " becoming " older or younger <lb/>
            than itself and " the others." It is perfectly so. But since " the <lb/>
            one" participates in time, and in the act of becoming older <lb/>
            and younger, is it not necessary for it to participate in " the <lb/>
            then," and " the hereafter," and " the now," if it participates <lb/>
            in time ? It is necessary. " The one," therefore, was, <lb/>
            and will be, and is; and has been in the act of becoming, <lb/>
            and is in the act of becoming, and will be in the act of be­ <lb/>

            regard to " the others," take place with regard likewise to " the <lb/>
            one." Such is entirely the case.</p>
          <p>Let us then speak of the third point. If " the one " is such <lb/>
            as we have discussed, is it not necessary, since it is both one <lb/>
            and many, and again neither one nor many, and participating <lb/>
            in time, that because it is one, it should participate at one time <lb/>
            in " being;" but that because it is not one, it should participate <lb/>
            at no time in " being ?" It is necessary. Will it then be pos­ <lb/>
            sible for it not to participate, when it does; or to participate, <lb/>
            when it does not ? It will not be possible. It participates <lb/>
            then at one time, and does not participate at another; for <lb/>
            thus alone can it participate and not participate in the same. <lb/>
            Right. Is not this then the time when it participates in "be­ <lb/>
            ing," and again is freed from it ? Or how is it possible for it <lb/>
            to possess at one time the same thing, and at another time not, <lb/>
            unless at some time it both receives and dismisses it ? Not <lb/>
            otherwise. Do you not call the receiving of “being”by the term <lb/>
            to be generated? I do. And to be freed from "being" (by the <lb/>
            term) to be destroyed ? Entirely so. " The one " then, as it <lb/>
            seems, by receiving and dismissing " being," is generated and <lb/>
            destroyed. Necessarily so. [58.] But since it is one and <lb/>
            many, and is generated and destroyed, when it becomes one, <lb/>
            is not the being many destroyed, and when it becomes many, <lb/>
            is not the being one destroyed ? Entirely so. But, when it <lb/>
            becomes one and many, must it not be separated and united ? <lb/>
            It must. And when it becomes unlike and like, must it <lb/>
            not be made like and unlike ? Certainly. And when it be­ <lb/>
            comes greater, less, and equal, must it not be increased, and <lb/>
            wasted away,74 and equalized ? It must so. But when from <lb/>
            being moved it stands still, and when from standing still it <lb/>
            changes into being moved, 75 it is requisite surely for it to be not <lb/>

            change. For how can it ? But there is no time, in which any <lb/>
            thing can at once be neither moved nor stand still. There is not. <lb/>
            But it cannot change without a change. It is probable not. <lb/>
            When, therefore, does it change ? For it would change, neither <lb/>
            while it stands still, nor while it is moved, nor while it is in time. <lb/>
            It would not. Is there then that strange thing, in which it would <lb/>
            be, when it changes ? What thing ? " The sudden."76 77 For <lb/>
            " the sudden " seems to signify some such thing as 77 changing <lb/>
            from it to either.77 For there is no change from standing, <lb/>
            while standing ; nor a change from motion, while in motion; <lb/>
            but that wonderful nature " the sudden " is situated between <lb/>
            motion and standing, and is in no time; 78 and into this and <lb/>
            from this that, which is moved, changes for the purpose of <lb/>
            standing still; and that which stands, for the purpose of being <lb/>
            moved. It nearly appears so. [59.] " The one," therefore, <lb/>
            if it stands still and is moved, must change into either; for <lb/>
            thus alone would it produce both these effects. But in chang­ <lb/>
            ing, it changes suddenly; and when it changes, it would be in <lb/>
            no time, and would neither stand still nor be moved. It <lb/>
            would not. Is then the one" in this state also with respect <lb/>
            to the other changes ? and when it changes from being into <lb/>
            being destroyed, or from non-being into the act of becoming, <lb/>
            does it not then become a medium between certain movements <lb/>
            and standings ? and then it neither is nor is not, nor is in the <lb/>
            act of becoming, nor is destroyed ? It appears so.

            then, if " one " exists, what " the other " must suffer from 80 <lb/>
            "the one?" Let us state. Since then the others" are <lb/>
            different from " the one," they are not " the one:" for other­ <lb/>
            wise they would not be different from " the one ?" Right. <lb/>
            Nor yet are “ the others " entirely deprived of " the one," but <lb/>
            somehow participate in it. In what way ? Because " the <lb/>
            others," having parts, are different from " the one:" for if <lb/>
            they had not parts, they would be entirely one. Right. But <lb/>
            parts, we have said,81 belong to that, which is a whole. We <lb/>
            said 81 so. But it is necessary for a whole to be one (com­ <lb/>
            posed) of many, of which one the parts are parts: for each <lb/>
            of the parts must not be a part of many, but of a whole. <lb/>
            How is this ? [60.] If any thing should be a part of many, <lb/>
            amongst which it is itself, it would surely be both a part of <lb/>
            itself, which is impossible, and of each one of the others; <lb/>
            since it is a part of all. For if it is not a part of one of <lb/>
            these, it will be a part of the others, with the exception of <lb/>
            this; and thus it will not be a part of each one; and not <lb/>
            being a part of each, it will be a part of not one of the <lb/>
            many; and being a part of not one of these (the many), it <lb/>

            of not one of which it is either 82a part, or82 any thing <lb/>
            else. So it appears. A part, therefore, is neither a part of <lb/>
            the many nor of all; but of some one idea and of some one <lb/>
            thing, which we call a whole, having become from all one <lb/>
            thing complete. 83[Of this a part would be a part].83 En­ <lb/>
            tirely so. If therefore the others have parts, they too would <lb/>
            participate in a whole and one. Certainly. One perfect <lb/>
            whole then possessing parts, must necessarily be different84 <lb/>
            from " the one." It is necessary. There is moreover the <lb/>
            same reasoning respecting each of the parts: for it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary that this85 (each part) should participate in "the one." <lb/>
            For, if each of these is a part, the very being each signifies <lb/>
            surely one thing, separated indeed from others, but existing by <lb/>
            itself, if it shall be truly each. Right. But it would partici­ <lb/>
            pate in "the one," as being evidently something else than "the <lb/>
            one;" for (otherwise)86 it would not have participated, but <lb/>
            would have been " the one itself." But now it is surely im­ <lb/>
            possible for any thing to be " the one," except " the one <lb/>
            itself." Impossible. [61.] But it is necessary for both the <lb/>
            whole and the part to participate in "the one." 87 For the <lb/>
            whole will be one thing87 of which the parts are parts; but on <lb/>
            the other hand each (part will be) a part of the whole,87 of <lb/>
            whatever whole it may be a part.88 It is so. Will not then <note type="footnote"> 82—82 Ficinus, "vel pars vel aliud quodlibet." He therefore found <lb/>

              this quantity so taken away, be a multitude, and not one, <lb/>

            ent from " the one " are not likewise in this state, or after this <lb/>
            manner alone ? Entirely so. Let us then say again as at the <lb/>
            beginning, if “the one" is, what must the things different <lb/>
            from " the one ” suffer. Let us say it. Is not then “ the one ” <lb/>
            separate from the others," and are not the others separate <lb/>
            from " the one ? " Why ? Because there is nothing else " differ­ <lb/>
            ent" except these, (namely,) that which is different from " the <lb/>
            one," and that which is "different" from the others ”for all <lb/>
            is said, when the one" and the others are said. All, in­ <lb/>
            deed. There is nothing else therefore except these, in which, <lb/>
            as being the same, " the one " and " the others " would exist. <lb/>
            Nothing. " The one” and " the others” are therefore never in <lb/>
            the same. They are not. Are they then separate ? Yes. We <lb/>
            have said moreover that " the truly one " has not any parts. <lb/>
            For how can it ? Neither therefore will the whole of "the one" <lb/>
            nor its parts be in " the others," if it is separate from " the <lb/>
            others," and has no parts. How not ? In no way then will " the <lb/>
            others" participate in "the one;" since they participate neither <lb/>
            according to a certain part, nor according to the whole. It <lb/>
            seems not. By no means then are the others" "one," nor <lb/>
            have they any one in themselves. [64.] They have not. Neither, <lb/>
            then, are " the others" many; for, if they were many, each of <lb/>
            them, as being a part of a whole, would be one; but now the <lb/>
            things different from " the one" are neither one nor many, <lb/>
            nor a whole nor parts, since they in no respect participate in <lb/>
            " the one." Right. " The others " then 99 are of themselves 99 <lb/>
            neither two nor three, nor one in them, because they are en­ <lb/>
            tirely deprived of "the one." So it is. "The others," therefore, <lb/>
            are of themselves 100 neither similar nor dissimilar to " the one," <lb/>
            nor are similitude and dissimilitude in them. For if they were <lb/>
            similar and dissimilar, or1 possessed in themselves similitude <lb/>
            and dissimilitude, the things different from the one" would <lb/>
            possess in themselves two species contrary to each other. So <lb/>
            it appears. But it is impossible for those to participate in <lb/>
            any two things, which do not participate even in one. Im- <note type="footnote"> 99–99 Ficinus, " nee duo nec tria sunt nec unum iris inest." He there­ <lb/>

            possible. "The others" therefore are neither similar nor dis­ <lb/>
            similar, nor both. For, if they were similar or dissimilar, <lb/>
            they would participate in one species of the different; and if <lb/>
            they were both, they would participate in two contrary species : <lb/>
            but this has been shown to be impossible. True. They are <lb/>
            therefore neither same nor different, nor moved, nor standing <lb/>
            still, nor generated, nor destroyed, nor greater, nor less, nor <lb/>
            equal, (nor unequal,)2 nor do they suffer any thing else of this <lb/>
            kind. For, if the others could endure to suffer any such acci­ <lb/>
            dent, they would participate in one, and two, and three, and in <lb/>
            even and odd; in all which it has been shown it is impossible <lb/>
            for them to participate; since they are in every way and en­ <lb/>
            tirely deprived of " the one." Most true. Hence, then, if " the <lb/>
            one" exists, "the one" is all things and nothing, both as re­ <lb/>
            gards itself, and as regards the others" 3in like manner.3 <lb/>
            Entirely so.</p>
          <p>[65.] Be it so. But if " the one " is not, must we not con­ <lb/>
            sider after this what ought to happen ? We must consider. <lb/>
            What then would be this supposition, if " one is not ?" Does <lb/>
            it differ from this, " If that, which is not one, is non-existing ?” <lb/>
            It does differ. Does it differ merely from, or is the saying, " If <lb/>
            that which is not one, is non-existing," entirely contrary (to <lb/>
            the saying), "If the one is not?" Entirely the contrary. But <lb/>
            what, should any one say, if magnitude is not, or if smallness <lb/>
            is not, or any thing else of this kind, would he not show in <lb/>
            each of these cases that he is speaking of that, which is not, as <lb/>
            something different ? Entirely so. Would he not therefore <lb/>

            which may be known; and next of something different from <lb/>

              others :”4 is it not so ? Necessarily so. Let us then say (as) at <lb/>
              the beginning, " If the one is not," what ought to occur. In <lb/>
              the first place then this, as it seems, ought to occur to it; that <lb/>
              either there should be a knowledge of it, or that nothing of <lb/>
              what is said can be known, when any one says, " If one is non- <lb/>
              existing." True. (Must not this too happen), either that "the <lb/>
              others ” are different from it, or that even it cannot be said <lb/>
              to be different from the others?" Entirely so. It has there­ <lb/>
              fore diversity in addition to knowledge. For he does not <lb/>
              speak of the diversity of " the others," when he says that " the <lb/>
              one" is different from " the others," but of the diversity of <lb/>
              " the one." It appears so. And yet the one which is non-ex­ <lb/>
              isting, participates in "that," and "some," and “this,”5 and <lb/>
              " these," and every thing of this kind. For neither could " the <lb/>
              one" be spoken of, nor things different from the one," nor <lb/>
              would there be any thing for it, or belonging to it, nor could <lb/>
              it be called any thing, if it had no share in something, or in <lb/>
              the other things of this kind.6 Right. [66.] But to be can­ <lb/>
              not be present to " the one," if it non-exists ; though nothing <lb/>
              prevents it from participating in the many; nay, it must <lb/>
              (participate), if the one" is that, 7and not another thing is <lb/>
              not existing.7 8 If however it will not be either " the one" <lb/>
              nor that, but the discourse about something else, it is meet to <lb/>

              and not as another to non-exist, it is necessary for it to par­ <lb/>

              tude, therefore, is present to it with respect to " the others <lb/>
              for " the others," being different from " the one," will also be <lb/>
              foreign (from it). Certainly. But are not things foreign <lb/>
              various ? How not ? And are not things various dissimilars ? <lb/>
              Dissimilars. If then they are dissimilars to " the one," it is <lb/>
              evident they would be dissimilars to that which is dissimilar. <lb/>
              It is evident. There would then be present to " the one " a <lb/>
              dissimilitude with respect to which the others" are dissimilar <lb/>
              to it. It seems so. But if there is to it a dissimilitude from the <lb/>
              others," must there not be to it a similitude of itself? How ? <lb/>
              If there be a dissimilitude of "the one" to "the one," no <lb/>
              discourse would take place about a thing of such a kind as <lb/>
              "the one;" nor would the supposition be about "the one," <lb/>
              but about something different from " the one." Entirely so. <lb/>
              But it ought not. Certainly. There ought, then, to be a simili­ <lb/>
              tude of itself to "the one." There ought. But neither is "the <lb/>
              one" equal to " the others." For, if it were equal, *it would <lb/>
              be according to equality, similar to them ;* but both these are <lb/>
              impossible, if "the one" is not. Impossible. [67.] But <lb/>
              since it is not equal to "the others," is it not necessary for "the <lb/>
              others" also to be not equal to it? It is necessary. But are <lb/>
              not things which are not equal unequal ? Certainly. And <lb/>
              are not unequals unequal by that which is unequal ? How <lb/>
              not? "The one," therefore, participates in the inequality, ac­ <lb/>
              cording to which the others" are unequal to it. It does par­ <lb/>
              ticipate. But magnitude and smallness belong to inequality. <lb/>
              They do. Do magnitude and smallness then belong to one <lb/>

              smallness are always separated from each other. Entirely so. <lb/>
              There is then always something between them. Certainly. <lb/>
              Can you mention any thing else between these, except <lb/>
              equality ? Nothing else. To whatever thing therefore <lb/>
              there is magnitude and smallness, to this there is equality <lb/>
              also as a medium between the two. It appears so. To " the <lb/>
              one" then which is non-existing, equality, magnitude, and <lb/>
              smallness, as it appears, belong. So it seems. But it ought <lb/>
              likewise to participate in a certain way in "being." How so ? It <lb/>
              ought to be in the state which we have mentioned ? for, unless it <lb/>
              be in that 'state, we should not speak the truth in saying that <lb/>
              " the one" is not; but if (we speak) the truth, it is evident that <lb/>
              we have spoken of things that exist. Is it not so ? It is so. But <lb/>
              since we assert that we speak the truth, it is necessary for us <lb/>
              to assert that we are speaking of things which exist. It is <lb/>
              necessary. 9"The one," therefore, which does not exist, as it <lb/>
              appears, does exist; for if it should non-exist while non- <lb/>
              existing, but remit something of existence with respect to <lb/>
              non-existence, it will immediately become existing.9 Entirely <lb/>
              so. [68.] 10It ought therefore to have, as the bond of non- <lb/>
              existence, an existence not existing, if it is about to non-exist; <lb/>
              just as existence (ought) to have (as a bond of existence) a <lb/>

              state, indicates some change. How not ? Is change motion ? or <lb/>
              what shall we call it ? It is motion. But has not “ the one " ap­ <lb/>
              peared to be both "being" and "not-being?" Yes. It appears <lb/>
              then to be and not to be in such a state. It seems so. " The <lb/>
              non-existing one " appears then to be moved, since it has a <lb/>
              change from "being" into "not-being." It appears so. But if it <lb/>
              be no where among beings, as it is not, since it is a not-being, <lb/>
              it cannot change its place from any where to any where. For <lb/>
              it cannot. It will not then be moved by changing its place. <lb/>

              it will never touch " the same," since the same is "being." But <lb/>
              it is impossible for “not-being " to reside in any "being." Im­ <lb/>
              possible. [69.]“ The one," therefore, "which is not," cannot <lb/>
              revolve in that, in which it is not. It cannot. Neither will "the <lb/>
              one " be altered from itself, either into " being " or " not-be­ <lb/>
              ing :” for our discourse would no longer be concerning the one, <lb/>
              if it were altered from itself, but concerning something else. <lb/>
              Right. But if it is neither altered, nor revolves in the same, <lb/>
              nor changes its place, can it still be moved in any way ? How <lb/>
              can it? But it is necessary for that, which is unmoved, to <lb/>
              be at rest; and for that, which is at rest, to stand still.13 It is <lb/>
              necessary. As it seems, therefore, " the one" which is not, <lb/>
              both stands still and is moved. It appears so. And yet if <lb/>
              it be moved, there is a great necessity for it to be altered; <lb/>
              for, so far as any thing is moved, it is no longer in the same <lb/>
              state that it was, but in a different one. So it is. " The one," <lb/>
              therefore, since it is moved, is also altered. Yes. And yet <lb/>
              being moved not at all, it would be not at all altered. It <lb/>
              would not. So far then as " the one " which is not, is moved, <lb/>
              it is altered; but so far as it is not moved, it is not altered. <lb/>
              Certainly not. " The one," therefore, which is not, is both <lb/>
              altered and not altered. It appears so. But is it not neces­ <lb/>
              sary for any thing, when it is altered, to be in the act of being <lb/>
              different from what it was before, and to die away from its <lb/>
              former state; but for a nature, which is not altered, to be <lb/>
              neither in the act of being, nor of dying away ? It is neces­ <lb/>
              sary. " The one," therefore, which is not, by being altered, <lb/>
              is in the act of being, and of dying away; but at the same <lb/>
              time, from its not being altered, it is not in the act of being <lb/>
              or of dying away. [70.] And thus “ the one," which is not, <lb/>
              is in the act of being and of dying, and is neither in the act <lb/>
              of being nor of dying away. For it is not (otherwise).</p>
          <p>But let us again return to the beginning, about to see <lb/>
            whether these things will appear to us as they do now, or <lb/>
            otherwise. It is necessary. Have we not already said, 14 " If <lb/>
            ‛the one is not, what ought to happen concerning it ? " Cer- <note type="footnote"> 13 Here, as in § 25,1 am unable to see the difference between <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡσυχίαν <lb/>

            tainly. But when we say " it is not," do we intend any thing <lb/>
            else than the absence of "being" from that which we say is not ? <lb/>
            Nothing else. Whether therefore, when we say that a thing <lb/>
            " is not,” 14 do we say that in a certain respect it is not, and <lb/>
            that in a certain respect it is ? 15 or does the term " is not " <lb/>
            simply signify that, what is not, is no where at all, and that it <lb/>
            does not in any way participate in " being," if it is not ? It <lb/>
            signifies this most distinctly. Neither then can that, which is <lb/>
            not, be, nor in any other way participate in " being." It can­ <lb/>
            not. But are the terms "to be generated" and "to be de­ <lb/>
            stroyed," any thing else than for one thing to participate in <lb/>
            "being," and for another to lose "being?" It is nothing <lb/>
            else. The thing therefore to which no atom of " being" is <lb/>
            present, can neither receive nor lose it. How can it ? " The <lb/>
            one" therefore, since it is not at all, can neither possess, be <lb/>
            freed from, nor participate in " being," in any manner what­ <lb/>
            ever. This seems reasonable. " The one" which is not, <lb/>
            is then neither destroyed nor in the act of being, if it par­ <lb/>
            ticipates not at all in being. It appears not. Neither <lb/>
            therefore is it at all altered ; for if it thus suffered it would <lb/>
            be in the act of being destroyed. True. But if it is not <lb/>
            altered, is it not also necessary for it to be not moved ? It is <lb/>
            necessary. But that, which in no respect is, we will say <lb/>
            cannot stand still; for that which stands still ought to be in <lb/>
            some (spot) ever the same? In the same; 16 for how not? <lb/>
            [71.] Thus then let us say, that "not-being" at no time either <lb/>
            stands or is moved. For it does not. Moreover not any of <lb/>
            things existing is present to it; for participating in any of <lb/>
            things existing17 it would participate in "being." It is evident <note type="footnote"> 15–15 Such is evidently what the train of ideas demands. But in that <lb/>

            It has therefore neither magnitude, nor smallness, nor equality. <lb/>
            It has not. It has moreover neither similitude nor diversity, <lb/>

            What then, is it possible for it to have the other things, if <lb/>
            nothing must be present to it? It is not possible. To it <lb/>

          <p>But let us still (again)20 say, if " one" is not, what must <lb/>
            "the others" suffer. Let us say. In a certain way "others" <lb/>
            must exist themselves; for, if "others" do not exist, there <lb/>
            would be nothing21 said about "the others." True. But if there <lb/>

            and the word " different ? " I do. But we surely say that 22 the <lb/>
            “ different” is different from "different," and the other" is <lb/>
            other than "other ?"22 Yes. To “the others,” therefore, if there <lb/>
            are about to be " others," there is something from which they <lb/>

            for this alone remains to them, or to be23 different from no­ <lb/>

            In what way? Just as objects in a shaded picture appear <lb/>
            all to be one to a person standing at a distance, (they will <lb/>
            seem) to suffer the same accident, and to be similar. En­ <lb/>
            tirely so. But to him, who approaches nearer, (they will <lb/>
            appear) to be many and different, and different from and dis­ <lb/>
            similar to themselves, through the fancied notion of diversity. <lb/>
            It is so. It is therefore necessary for the masses to appear <lb/>
            to be similar and dissimilar to themselves and to each other. <lb/>
            Entirely so. And to be the same with, and different from, <lb/>
            each other, and to touch and be apart32 from themselves, and <lb/>
            be moved through all possible movements, and standing still <lb/>
            every where, and be in the act of being and of destruction, <note type="footnote"> 29—29 I cannot understand all within the brackets ; nor could Ficinus, <lb/>
            who has omitted them. Heindorf says those words refer to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχὴν, πέρας <lb/>

            easy for us to go through, if, though one does not exist, many <lb/>
            do exist ? Most true.</p>
          <p>[74.] Once more then, returning again to the beginning, <lb/>
            let us say, "If one is not," but the things different from <lb/>
            " the one," what ought to happen. Let us say. " The others " <lb/>
            then are not one. How should they be ? Nor yet are they <lb/>
            many; for in many there would be one likewise. For if <lb/>
            none of these is one, all are nothing; so that there would be <lb/>
            not even many. True. One therefore not being in the others, <lb/>
            the others arp neither many nor one. They are not. Nor <lb/>
            do they appear to be either one or many. Why not ? Be­ <lb/>
            cause " the others " have not in any way any communication at <lb/>
            all with any of the things which are not, nor is any one of <lb/>
            the non-existing present to " the others;" for there is no part 34 <lb/>
            to non-beings. True. Neither therefore is there any opinion <lb/>
            about that, which is not in "the others," nor any fancied notion ; <lb/>
            nor does that" which is not," become in any way the subject of <lb/>
            opinion applicable to "the others."35 It does not. If there­ <lb/>
            fore one does not exist, not any of " the others " is conceived in <lb/>
            opinion to be one or many; for it is impossible to form an <lb/>
            opinion of many without one. It is impossible. If one there­ <lb/>
            fore does not exist, neither do " the others " exist; nor is one <lb/>
            or many conceived by opinion. It seems not. Neither there­ <lb/>
            fore do similars or dissimilars exist. They do not. Nor the <lb/>
            same nor different, nor things touching nor apart, 36nor such <lb/>
            others, as we have already discussed, as appearing themselves ;36 <note type="footnote"> 33—33 As there is nothing on which <foreign xml:lang="grc">μηδέτερα καὶ πάντα που τὰ τοι</foreign>­ <lb/>

            <title type="main">INTRODUCTION TO THE BANQUET.</title>
          </head>
          <p>IF the beauty of a dialogue of Plato is to be estimated by the <lb/>
            number of separate Editions to which it has given rise, and by the <lb/>
            quantity of Annotations written upon it, the Banquet would be <lb/>
            fairly deemed to be second only to the Phædo, if not superior to it. <lb/>
            For during the last seventy-four years it has been edited by Fischer, <lb/>
            Wolf, Ast, Sommer, Dindorf, Reynders, Rückert, Hommel, twice by <lb/>
            Stalbaum and the triumvirate of the Scholars at Zurich; and it <lb/>
            has been commented upon by Wyttenbach, Schütz, Bast, Heusde, <lb/>
            Thiersch, Orelli, Creuzer, and Voegelin : and to these must be added <lb/>
            the pamphlets of Hartmann and C. F. Hermann, (of which I know <lb/>
            nothing but the titles,) together with the Academical Dissertations of <lb/>
            different Professors and embryo Critics in Germany, and the articles <lb/>
            written in various periodicals of that country, devoted wholly or in <lb/>
            part to classical literature.</p>
          <p>Nor is this all; for during the same period the dialogue has been <lb/>
            translated twice into English, thrice into German, and once into <lb/>
            French. But even here it has been the misfortune of the philoso­ <lb/>
            pher to have his ideas travestied, rather than transferred to modem <lb/>
            tongues. Such at least is the case in the miscalled versions of Syden­ <lb/>
            ham and Shelley; the latter of whom has never looked beyond the <lb/>
            Latin of, Ficinus, reprinted by Bekker from the original edition ; <lb/>
             <pb n="472"/>
            while the former, disdaining to follow as closely a generally faithful <lb/>
            guide, has given a paraphrase rather than a translation; and this to <lb/>
            such an extent, that more than a third of what he has put down is <lb/>
            the mere coinage of his own brain, and not a vestige of it is to be <lb/>
            found in the original Greek.</p>
          <p>Nor is it amongst the moderns alone that this dialogue has met <lb/>
            with a marked attention. For it seems to have been no less a fa­ <lb/>
            vourite with the Moral Philosophers of the Pagan world, and the <lb/>
            Fathers of the Christian Church, and of those too, who, like the Neo- <lb/>
            Platonists, occupied the neutral ground between the rising and <lb/>
            decaying forms of faith. Of this the edition of Reynders affords <lb/>
            abundant proof; who has either collected himself, or found in the <lb/>
            notes of Wyttenbach, perhaps all the references to this dialogue to <lb/>
            be met with in the series of authors alluded to; and after their <lb/>
            united labours in this field, a very scanty gleaning has been left, I <lb/>
            suspect, for such as may be disposed to go over the same ground. <lb/>
            Far different, however, is the case as regards the verbal difficulties <lb/>
            of the text. For there, after all the labours of the learned, I have <lb/>
            found not a little to exercise my own ingenuity; and where I have <lb/>
            failed, others will, I hope, be led to try their hands; for it is only by <lb/>
            such continued efforts that we can expect to recover what has been <lb/>
            lost, or to correct what has become corrupted, in one of the most <lb/>
            fanciful, and, despite a portion of its matter, happily abhorrent from <lb/>
            our finer feelings, one of the most beautiful dialogues of Plato.</p>
          <p>With regard to the object which Plato had in view in writing the <lb/>
            Banquet, they who are desirous of seeing the conflicting and equally <lb/>
            untenable notions of some of the scholars of Germany, must turn to <lb/>
            Stalbaum's Prolegomena, p. 35—39, where they will find a sensible <lb/>
            rejection of the theory of Schleiermacher; who with a perversity of <lb/>
            judgment for which it is difficult to account, considered the Banquet <lb/>
            as being closely connected with the Sophist and Statesman, with <lb/>
            which it has not an atom in common, instead of being rather a com­ <lb/>
            panion to the Phædrus, but written if not in a more chaste, at least <lb/>
            a more chastened, style, than that misunderstood rhapsody.</p><pb n="473"/>

              for him. He then said, Apollodorus, I was just now looking <lb/>
              after you, being desirous of hearing fully about the meeting <lb/>
              between Agatho, and Socrates, and Alcibiades, and the rest <lb/>
              who were present at the supper, which took place then, when <lb/>
              there were5 some speeches on the subject of love. For another <lb/>
              person narrated a part,6 having heard it from Phoenix, the <lb/>
              son of Philip; and he said that you knew (all): but that he <lb/>
              had it not in his power to state any thing clearly. Do you <lb/>
              then tell me; for you have the best right to narrate the con­ <lb/>
              versation of your friend. But first, said he, tell me, were you <lb/>
              present yourself at the meeting or not ?-It appears, said I, <lb/>
              that your informant has by no means given you a clear ac­ <lb/>
              count, if you suppose that the meeting, about which you are <lb/>
              asking, took place recently, so that I could be present at it. <lb/>

              years ?7 whereas, since I first passed my time with Socrates, and <lb/>
              made it my care each day to know what he said and did, it is <lb/>
              not yet three years. Before that time, running about wherever <lb/>

              after that in which he and his performers in the Chorus had <lb/>
              made the sacrifice for his victory.-It is then, said he, a long <lb/>

              it to Phoenix. It was one Aristodemus,9 a Cydathenæan, a <lb/>
              man of small size, and who always went without sandals.10 He <lb/>
              was present at the meeting, being, it seems to me, an admirer, <lb/>
              the greatest amongst those then living, of Socrates. Never­ <lb/>
              theless, I inquired of Socrates himself about some of the <lb/>

              convenient for persons, as they walk along, to speak and hear.11 <lb/>
              Proceeding in this way we entered into conversation together, <lb/>
              so that I am now, as I said at the commencement, not quite un­ <lb/>
              prepared. If then I must relate these matters ( over again) to <lb/>
              you, I must do so.12 Besides, for in other respects, when I am <lb/>
              either making myself or hearing from others, any discourse on <lb/>
              philosophy, I feel, independent of considering myself bene­ <lb/>
              fited, a delight beyond all bounds. But when (I hear) some <lb/>
              other conversation, and especially yours, who are wealthy, <lb/>
              and engaged in money-making, I feel a weariness myself, <lb/>
              and pity for you my friends, who fancy you are doing some­ <lb/>
              thing, while you are in fact doing nothing. But perhaps, on <lb/>

          <p>[2.] Friend. You are always the same man, Apollodorus, <lb/>
            ever railing at yourself and others, and you seem to me as <lb/>
            if you really thought all men, commencing from yourself, to <lb/>
            be, with the exception of Socrates, miserable. Now, from <lb/>
            whence you acquired the surname of a madman,13 I know <lb/>
            not;14 for in your discourses, you are ever in such a mood, <lb/>
            and are savage against yourself15 and all others, Socrates ex­ <lb/>
            cepted.</p>
          <p>Apol. And is it,16 my dearest friend, evident then that <lb/>
            by so thinking of myself, and you, I am mad and talk at <lb/>
            random ?17</p>
          <p>Friend. It is not worth while, Apollodorus, to dispute <lb/>
            about this now. But as to what we have requested, do not <lb/>
            do otherwise, but tell us what the speeches were.</p>
          <p>Apol. The speeches then were of some such kind as this. <lb/>
            But I will rather endeavour to relate, as he (Aristodemus) re­ <lb/>
            lated to me (all)18 from the beginning.</p>
          <p>For he told me that Socrates, having washed himself and put <lb/>
            on his slippers, which he was wont to do very seldom,19 met <lb/>
            him ; and that he asked him, whither he was going, after he had <lb/>
            made himself so smart; when Socrates told him, he was going <lb/>
            to Agatho's to supper; for yesterday (said he) at the sacri- <note type="footnote"> 13 Apollodorus was not really mad, but only as violent as a madman in <lb/>

            how, said he, Aristodemus, have you the disposition to be <lb/>

            The good of their own accord.</p>
          <p>Homer, however, nearly seems to have not merely perverted <lb/>
            the proverb, but to have done violence to it. For after de­ <lb/>
            scribing Agamemnon as pre-eminently good in the affairs of <lb/>
            war, and Menelaus as "a soft-hearted spearman, ”(in IX. P. 588,) <lb/>
            yet, when Agamemnon had made a sacrifice and was feasting, <lb/>
            he has introduced (in <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ιλ</foreign>. B. 408) Menelaus as coming to the <lb/>
            feast uninvited, an inferior man to the banquet of his betters. <lb/>
            On hearing this, said (Aristodemus), Perhaps I too shall run <lb/>
            a risk, not Socrates, as you say, but as in Homer, if I, a person <lb/>
            of no parts, go to the banquet of a clever man uninvited. <lb/>
            Will you then make an apology for bringing me ? for, as to <lb/>
            myself, I will not confess that I came uninvited, but invited <lb/>
            by you. <lb/>

            replied (Socrates). But come, let us be going. [3.] After <lb/>
            conversing a little in this way, he said, on they went. But <lb/>
            on the way, Socrates, attending to something in his own mind, <lb/>
            was left behind in the walk; and that he, (Socrates,) bade <lb/>

            you yesterday, that I might invite you, but I could not see <lb/>
            you. But how are you not bringing Socrates to us ?-And I, <lb/>
            turning round, said he, saw no where Socrates following me. <lb/>
            I stated however that I had come with Socrates, having been <lb/>
            invited hither by him to supper.—You did well, said Agatho ; <lb/>

              most of you have; for you were here yesterday. Consider <lb/>
              then in what way we may drink the easiest.37—Aristophanes38 <lb/>
              then said, You speak however39 well, Pausanias, on this point, <lb/>
              that we should by all means procure for ourselves an easy <lb/>
              method in our drinking. For I am one of those, who were <lb/>
              thoroughly drenched yesterday.-Upon hearing this, Eryxi­ <lb/>
              maehus,41 the son of Aeu<foreign xml:lang="grc">̄</foreign>me<foreign xml:lang="grc">̆</foreign>nus, said, Both of you say well: <lb/>
              but I want to hear from one of you, how does Agatho bear <lb/>
              up with strength in drinking.—I am by no means very strong, <lb/>
              said (Agatho).—It would be a god-send, said Eryximaehus, for <lb/>
              us, both myself and Aristodemus, and Phædrus,42 and these <lb/>
              here, if you, the stouter men at the bottle, have on the present <lb/>
              occasion flinehed. For we are at all times weak. Soerates <lb/>
              indeed I put out of the account; for he is all-sufficient on <lb/>
              both points,43 so that it matters not to him, whichsoever we <lb/>
              may do. Since then none of the persons present seem in­ <lb/>
              elined to drink much wine, I may be perhaps the less dis­ <lb/>
              agreeable, if I tell the truth about getting drunk. For from <lb/>
              the physieian's art, I conceive that this has become a matter <lb/>
              quite evident to myself, that drunkenness is for men a very <lb/>
              bad thing; and I would neither willingly myself 44 be willing <lb/>

              what kind of conversation I am willing, if you wish it, to <lb/>

          <p>Hereupon Eryximachus said, The commencement then of <lb/>

            The tale I have to tell is not my own,48 <lb/>

            56(Strange) that about such subjects many should have be­ <lb/>
            stowed great care,56 but that not a single person should ever to <lb/>
            this day have dared to hymn Love worthily; and thus has a <lb/>
            deity so great been neglected. Now, in all this, Phædrus <lb/>
            seems to me to speak correctly. I am desirous, therefore to <lb/>
            bring at the same time my contribution to this subject, and <lb/>
            to gratify him; and at the same time it seems to me becom­ <lb/>
            in- for the persons here on the present occasion to give glory <lb/>
            to the god. If then this seems good to you likewise, there will <lb/>
            be a sufficient subject of discussion before us. For I vote that <lb/>
            each of us shall speak in praise of Love, an oration, the most <lb/>
            beautiful he can, proceeding on the right-hand side; and that <lb/>
            Phædrus shall begin, as he is reclining at the top, and is; <lb/>
            moreover, the father of the discussion.-Not a single person, <lb/>
            Eryximachus, said Socratcs, will give a contrary vote.57 For <lb/>
            neither would I say no, who say that I know nothing else than <lb/>
            the matters relating to love; nor would Agatho, nor Pau­ <lb/>
            sanias,58 nor would, I ween,59 Aristophanes, whose whole <lb/>
            occupation is relating to Dionysus and Aphrodité; 60 nor <note type="footnote"> 56—56 The Greek is, TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὔν τοιούτων μὲν πέρι πολλὴν ϭπουδὴν ποιή­ <lb/>

            However, if those who are before us shall speak sufficiently <lb/>
            and well, it will be enough for us. Let Phædrus then, with <lb/>

            [6.] To this all the rest assented, and bade him do, as So­ <lb/>

              tion what is a greater good than a useful lover, or69 to a <lb/>

              neither consanguinity70 is able to produce in us, nor honours, <lb/>
              nor wealth, nor any thing else, so well as love; 711 mean some <lb/>
              such thing as71 the shame for base acts, and the love of glory <lb/>
              for honourable deeds. For without these (two) it is not pos­ <lb/>
              sible for a state or individual to accomplish any thing great <lb/>
              or honourable. I assert therefore that he, who loves, if he is <lb/>
              found committing any base act, or suffering one from any body, <lb/>
              and failing through cowardice to revenge himself, would not <lb/>

              ashamed before the parties loving, if discovered doing any dis­ <lb/>

              he has fallen,)74 or not to assist him when in danger, he would <lb/>
              rather die many deaths. There is not a man so much of a <lb/>
              coward as that Love would not divinely inspire him to deeds of <lb/>
              valour, and make him equal to the very best by birth. [7.] <lb/>
              And in good truth, what Homer says,75 that a god did into <lb/>
              some heroes breathe a spirit, this, from himself produced, does <lb/>
              Love to (all)76 lovers furnish. Moreover, to die (for another)77 <lb/>
              lovers alone are ready, not only men, but women too. Of this <lb/>
              Alcestis, the daughter of Pelias, affords a sufficient proof <lb/>
              amongst the Hellenes in behalf of this reasoning, in being <lb/>
              alone willing to die for her husband, although his father and <lb/>
              mother were then living; whom she so much excelled in affec­ <lb/>
              tion through love as to prove them to be aliens (in blood) to <lb/>
              their own son, and relations only in name. And having done <lb/>
              this deed so noble, she was thought by not only men, but the <lb/>
              gods likewise, to have effected that, although many had <lb/>
              achieved many and noble acts, to only some,78 to be easily count­ <lb/>
              ed, did the gods grant this as a gift, for the soul to return from <lb/>
              Hades; but79 they sent her back, struck with admiration of <lb/>
              the deed. Thus do even the gods especially honour the zeal <lb/>
              bestowed on Love and valour. But Orpheus, the son of <lb/>
              Oeagrus, did the gods send back from Hades with his object <lb/>
              unaccomplished, by showing him the phantom merely of his <note type="footnote"> —<foreign xml:lang="grc">γε</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν</foreign> before <foreign xml:lang="grc">καταλιπεῖν</foreign> are equally unintelligible, I have trans­ <lb/>

              For so those words are constantly united; and we should thus perceive <lb/>

              cause he appeared to act the coward, as being a harper, and <lb/>
              not daring, like Alcestis, to die for Love, but contriving to <lb/>
              go alive to Hades. Hence on this very account did the gods <lb/>
              impose on him a punishment, and caused his death to take <lb/>
              place at the hands of women. Not so did they honour him, as <lb/>
              they did Achilles, the son of Thetis, whom they sent even to <lb/>
              the islands of the blest,80 because, having heard from his <lb/>
              mother, that he would die himself, after he had slain Hector, <lb/>
              but that if he slew not Hector, he would return home and <lb/>
              die an old man, he dared to prefer, after aiding his lover <lb/>
              Patroclus and avenging his fate, not only to die for him, but <lb/>
              over him when dead. From whence the gods, being amazingly <lb/>
              struck with admiration, honoured him exceedingly, because <lb/>
              he had valued so highly the person who had loved him. For <lb/>
              Æschylus 81 talks idly, in saying that Achilles was in love <lb/>
              with Patroclus; for Achilles was more handsome not only <lb/>
              than Patroclus, but all the other heroes, and still beardless, <lb/>
              and moreover, as Homer says,82 much younger. But in <lb/>
              reality the gods honour most the valour, which is shown in <lb/>
              behalf of love : they still feel a greater wonder and admiration, <lb/>
              and act more kindly, when the person loved has an affection <lb/>
              for the lover, than when the lover has for the loved. For the <lb/>
              lover is more of a godlike thing than the loved, as being in­ <lb/>
              spired by a god. On this account did (the gods) honour <lb/>
              Achilles even more than Alcestis, by sending him to the <lb/>
              islands of the blest. Thus then do I assert that Love is the <lb/>
              most ancient, and most honoured, and most- powerful of the <lb/>
              gods, for the attainment of valour and happiness by man <lb/>

            encomium upon Love. This would have been well had there <lb/>
            been but one Love; 83but now it is not, for one there is not83 <lb/>
            Since then one there is not, the better way is for it to be <lb/>
            stated beforehand which kind of love we ought to praise. <lb/>
            I will endeavour then to put the question on a right footing, <lb/>
            and to state first what Love we ought to praise; and then to <lb/>
            praise in a manner worthy of the god. We all know that <lb/>
            without Love Venus is not. If then there were only one <lb/>
            Venus, there would have been only one Love. But since there <lb/>
            are two, there must be likewise two Loves. And how are <lb/>
            there not two,84 one the elder, and who had no mother, a <lb/>
            daughter of Uranus, (Heaven,) whom we name the celestial; <lb/>
            the other, younger, a daughter of Jupiter and Dione, whom <lb/>
            we call the vulgar. It is necessary then for the Love who <lb/>
            works with the latter Venus to be called the vulgar, but the <lb/>
            other, the celestial. All the gods, indeed, we ought to praise; <lb/>
            but we must endeavour to state what each has obtained by lot. <lb/>
            For every action is in this state; it is itself by itself neither <lb/>
            honourable nor base; as for instance, what we are now doing, <lb/>
            either drinking, or singing, or discoursing, there is not one of <lb/>
            these acts which is good, itself by itself, but it turns out such <lb/>
            in the doing. Rightly performed 85 [according as it may be <lb/>
            done] 85 it is right and honourably ; not rightly performed, it <lb/>
            is dishonourable. So in the case of loving, not every Love is <lb/>
            honourable, and worthy to be highly praised, but that which <lb/>
            impels to loving honourably. The one then belonging to <lb/>
            the vulgar Venus is a Love truly vulgar, and works out <note type="footnote"> 83—83 Ficinus omits all between the numerals; and so does Shelley, who <lb/>
            here, as elsewhere, has looked rather to the Latin translation than to the <lb/>

            whatever may happen; and this it is which inspires the <lb/>
            worthless love; and such persons in the first place love women <lb/>

              naturally of greater strength and possesses more of mind. <lb/>
              [9.] And any one would in the boy-love itself discover those <lb/>
              sincerely impelled by this passion. For they do not love boys, <lb/>
              but (youths),90 when they are beginning to possess mind. <lb/>
              91 Now this is near the time of their obtaining a beard.91 But <lb/>
              they who begin from this date to love, are, I think, prepared, <lb/>
              as if about to associate through the whole of life together, and <lb/>
              to live in common, 92and not, after having obtained an object <lb/>
              in an hour of imprudence, through cheating him as a youth, <lb/>
              to go away, laughing at him, and to run to another one.92 <lb/>
              There ought then to be a law not to love a boy, in order that <lb/>
              much care may not be wasted upon an uncertainty; for it is <lb/>
              uncertain to what end may come that relating to boys, whether <lb/>
              of vice or virtue, as regards the body or soul. Such a law do <lb/>
              men of virtue indeed lay down, themselves for themselves, <lb/>
              of their own accord ; but we ought to compel in some such <lb/>
              way as this those vulgar lovers; just as we compel them, as <lb/>
              -far as we can, not to fall in love with free-born women. For <lb/>
              it is such lovers as these who give rise to the reproach, that, <lb/>
              as some dare to say, it is shameful to gratify a lover. Now <lb/>

              certainly no act done decently and lawfully can bring with it <lb/>
              justly blame. And indeed the law relating to love in other <lb/>

              plex. For in Elis, and amongst the Bœotians, and wherever <lb/>
              there are not persons clever in speaking, the law is laid down <lb/>
              simply, that it is honourable to gratify a lover; nor would <lb/>
              any one there, either young or old, say that it is disgraceful, <lb/>
              in order, I presume, that they who endeavour to persuade <lb/>
              over the youths, may not be put to trouble, as being unskilled <lb/>
              in speaking. But by those 93 in Ionia, and many other places, <lb/>
              94 [where persons live under the barbarians,] 94 it is held to be <lb/>
              dishonourable. For through their tyrannical governments <lb/>
              this, and the love of wisdom and of gymnastic exercises,95 <lb/>
              (are considered) disgraceful. For it is not, I conceive, to the <lb/>
              interest of the rulers that high thoughts should be engendered <lb/>
              in their subjects, nor strong friendships formed, nor societies <lb/>
              in common; all which96 those other things and love especially <lb/>
              is wont to introduce. And thus by experience learnt the <lb/>
              tyrants here. For the love of Aristogeiton and the firm <lb/>
              friendship of Harmodius dissolved their power.97 [10.] And <lb/>
              thus, wherever it has been held disgraceful to gratify a lover, <lb/>
              it has been so laid down through the depravity of the legis­ <lb/>
              lators, and the desire of possession in the rulers, and the want <lb/>
              of manliness in the ruled ; but wherever it is simply enjoined, <lb/>
              it is through the listlessness of soul in the legislators. But <lb/>
              here the law is placed upon a better footing; although, as I <lb/>
              said before, it is not easy to understand it. For to a person <lb/>

              as performing some very honourable act. But the most <lb/>
              terrible thing is what the multitude say, that there is to him <lb/>
              alone, after swearing an oath, a pardon from the gods for <lb/>
              transgressing it. 5"For an oath, they say, of Venus is no <lb/>
              oath."5 Thus both gods and men give all kinds of licence to <lb/>
              the lover, as says the law here. In this way then a person <lb/>
              would imagine that in this state it is held a very honourable <lb/>

              loved, do not permit them to have any intercourse with their <lb/>

              able; if disgracefully, disgraceful. Now to gratify a vicious <lb/>
              person in a vicious manner is (to carry it on) disgracefully; <lb/>
              but ( to gratify) a virtuous person in a virtuous manner (is to <lb/>
              carry it on) honourably. The vicious lover is he of the vul­ <lb/>
              gar kind, who is in love with the body rather than the mind. <lb/>
              For he is not a lasting lover, being in love with a thing which <lb/>
              is not lasting; since, with the decaying flower of the body, of <lb/>
              which he is enamoured,7 he goes away on wing,8 putting to <lb/>
              shame all his speeches and promises. But he who is enamour­ <lb/>
              ed of a virtuous character, abides a lover through life, as being <lb/>
              closely united with what is itself abiding. Now these our law <lb/>
              is desirous to test well and truly, and (to permit)9 persons to <lb/>
              gratify some, and to fly from others. On this account therefore <lb/>
              it exhorts some to pursue, but others to fly; by appointing itself <lb/>
              the judge in a contest, and testing of what kind is the lover, and <lb/>
              of what the loved. And thus 10by this very reason10 it is held by <lb/>
              law to be disgraceful, in the first place, for a person to be cap­ <lb/>
              tivated quickly; in order that time may intervene, which seems <lb/>
              to be of many things the fairest test; in the next place, it is <lb/>
              held disgraceful for a person to be caught by considerations <lb/>
              of money or political power; whether he crouch on being ill <lb/>
              used and do not bear up manfully, or whether, being kindly <lb/>
              treated as regards pecuniary and political transactions, he does <lb/>
              not feel a contempt. For none of these things appear to be <lb/>
              firm and abiding, without a generous friendship being pro­ <lb/>
              duced from them. [12.] There is left then one only way for <lb/>

          <p>For our law. is, as it was in the case of lovers, that for a person <lb/>
            willing to endure any servitude whatever for his beloved youth, <lb/>
            it is not an act of fawning nor worthy of reproach. 11 Thus then <lb/>
            there is left only one other willing servitude not worthy of <lb/>
            reproach;11 and this is that which relates to virtue. For it <lb/>
            is a settled law with us, that whoever wishes to pay court to <lb/>
            any one, conceiving that through that person he shall be­ <lb/>
            come better as regards wisdom, or any other part of virtue, <lb/>
            such voluntary servitude again12 is neither disgraceful nor an <lb/>
            act of fawning. Now these two laws ought to come to the same <lb/>
            point, and both the one relating to the love of youths, and the <lb/>
            other relating to philosophy and the other parts of virtue, if <lb/>
            indeed it is about to be agreed that it is honourable to gratify <lb/>
            a lover. For, when the lover and the beloved youth come to­ <lb/>

            ing to the beloved youth, who is complying, 13would justly <lb/>
            minister any thing whatever, and the other (being subservient <lb/>

            other hand be justly subservient13 in any thing whatever. <lb/>

              ject has ended imperfectly, 24 it seems that I must of neces­ <lb/>
              sity24 endeavour to put the finish to the speech. In dis­ <lb/>
              tinguishing Love into two kinds, he appears to me to have <lb/>
              correctly divided. And that the Love exists not only in the <lb/>
              soul of man for beautiful persons, but for many other objects in <lb/>
              other beings likewise, in the bodies of all animals as well as in <lb/>
              the productions of the earth, and, so to speak, in all existing <lb/>
              things I seem to myself to see clearly from my own healing <lb/>
              art; and how great land wonderful] 25 a god is Love, who ex­ <lb/>
              tends his sway over all, as regards things human and divine. <lb/>
              And I will commence with the healing art in order that I may <lb/>
              give the highest honours to my own profession. [14.] Now <lb/>
              the very nature of our bodies partakes of this twofold love. <lb/>
              For health and disease in the body are confessedly different <lb/>
              and unlike. Now the unlike longs for and loves the unlike. <lb/>
              The love in a healthy body is of one kind; the love in a dis­ <lb/>
              eased body is of another. Now it is, as Pausanias just stated, <lb/>
              honourable to gratify the good amongst men, but dishonour­ <lb/>
              able the vicious; so in the case of bodies themselves, to gratify <lb/>
              the good and healthy parts of each is well and necessary, and <lb/>
              this it is from which there is the name of the healing art. <lb/>
              But (to gratify) the bad and diseased is disgraceful; and he <lb/>
              who would act according to art, must deny the gratification.26 <lb/>
              For medical science, to speak summarily, is the knowledge of <lb/>
              the feelings of love in the body relating to repletion and <lb/>
              evacuation ;27 and he, who in these appetites can distinguish <note type="footnote"> 24—24 This will doubtless appear to some a sufficiently accurate trans­ <lb/>

              For he should be able to cause things in the body, that are <lb/>

            there would be the greatest happiness to the human 58 race. <lb/>
            I will, therefore, endeavour to explain to you his power, and <lb/>
            you shall be the teacher of it to others. But you must first <lb/>
            learn the nature of man, and what sufferings it has undergone. <lb/>
            For our nature of old was not the same as it is now. In the <lb/>
            first place, there were three kinds of human beings, not as at <lb/>
            present, only two, male and female; but there was also a <lb/>
            third common to both of those; the name only of which now <lb/>
            remains, it has itself disappeared. It was then [one] 60 man- <lb/>
            woman,61 whose form and name partook of and was common <lb/>
            to both the male and the female. But it is now nothing but <lb/>
            a name, given by way of reproach. In the next place, the <lb/>
            entire form of every individual of the human race was round­ <lb/>
            ed, having the back and sides as in a circle. It had four hands, <lb/>
            and legs equal in number to the hands; and two faces upon <lb/>
            the circular neck, alike in every way, and one head on <lb/>
            both the faces placed opposite,62 and four ears, and two kinds <note type="footnote"> shows that, after <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέντοι, ἄνατον</foreign> has dropt out; a word elsewhere lost and <lb/>

            all the other parts were (doubled).63 They walked, as now, <lb/>
            upright, whithersoever they pleased. And when it made haste <lb/>
            to run, it did, 64 in the manner of tumblers, who after turning <lb/>
            their legs (upward) in a circle, place them accurately in an <lb/>
            upright position,64 support itself on its eight limbs,65 and after­ <lb/>
            wards turn itself over quickly in a circle. Now these three <lb/>
            and such kinds of beings existed on this account, 66 because the <lb/>
            male kind was the produce originally of the sun, the female <lb/>
            of the earth, and that which partook of the other two, of the <lb/>
            moon; 66 for the moon partakes of both the others (the sun <lb/>
            and the earth). The bodies thus were round, and the man­ <lb/>
            ner of their running was circular, through their being like <lb/>
            their parents. [17.] They were terrible in force and strength <lb/>
            and had high aspirations, and they made an attempt against <lb/>
            the gods; and what Homer (in <foreign xml:lang="grc">Οδ</foreign>. X. 307) says of Ephi­ <lb/>
            altus and Otus, was told of them likewise ; that they attempt­ <lb/>

            then the honours and the holy rites paid them by that race would <lb/>

            parts, as people cut medlars68 when about to pickle them, or as <lb/>
            they cut eggs with hairs. But whomsoever he cut, he ordered <lb/>
            Apollo 69to turn the face and the half of the neck to that <lb/>
            part where the section had taken place, in order that the man <lb/>
            might, on seeing the cutting off,69 be better behaved than before, <lb/>
            and he ordered 70 him to heal the other parts. And he <lb/>
            (Apollo) turned the face; and 71 pulling the skin together on <lb/>
            every side like a contracted purse,71 over that which is now <lb/>
            called the belly, he did, after making a single orifice, tie up (the <lb/>
            skin) at the middle of the belly, now called the navel. He <lb/>
            then smoothed the greater part of the remainder of the wrinkles <lb/>
            of the skin, and jointed the breast, having an instrument such <lb/>
            as shoemakers use when they smooth wrinkles of the leather <lb/>
            on the last. But he left a few wrinkles on the belly and navel <lb/>
            as a memorial of their original suffering. Now when their <lb/>
            nature had been bisected, each half perceived with a longing its <lb/>
            other self; 72 and throwing their arms around each other and <lb/>

              life. From this77 (period) has been implanted by nature in <lb/>
              mankind a mutual love, which is the bringer together of their <lb/>
              ancient nature, and which endeavours to make one out of two, <lb/>
              and to heal the nature 78 of man. Each of us then is but the <lb/>
              counterpart 79 of a human creature, as having been cut like the <lb/>
              Psettæ80 from one into two. Hence each one is in search of <lb/>
              his counterpart. As many men then as are sections of the <lb/>
              form common to men, which was then called Man-Woman, <lb/>
              are lovers of women; and from this race are sprung the majority <lb/>

              from the same81 race. But such women as are sections of the <lb/>

              rather to women; and from this race are the (Lesbian) <lb/>

              then such a person is both a lover of youths and a lover of <lb/>
              those who love him, and ever embraces what is from the same <lb/>
              race as himself. [19.] Now, whenever 83the lover of youths, <lb/>
              and every one else,83 meet with that very thing, the half of him­ <lb/>
              self, they are both smitten with a friendship in a wondrous <lb/>
              manner, and (attracted)84 by an intimacy and love, and are un­ <lb/>
              willing to be separated from each other for even, so to say, a <lb/>
              brief period. And these are they, who continue to live together <lb/>
              through life; and yet they could not tell what they wish to take <lb/>
              place to themselves from each other; for it does not seem to be <lb/>
              sexual intercourse, that the one should, for the sake of that, be <lb/>
              delighted with the company of the other, and (seek it) with <lb/>
              so much trouble; but the soul of each being evidently de­ <lb/>
              sirous of something else, which it is unable to tell, it divines <lb/>
              what it wishes, and hints at it.85 And if while they are lying <lb/>
              down in the same place, Vulcan were to stand over them with <lb/>
              his tools in his hand, and ask them " What is it do ye, mortals, <lb/>
              desire to take place, the one by the other?" and if, finding <lb/>
              them in a difficulty, were he to demand them again, “Do ye <lb/>
              desire this, to be as much as possible in the same place with <lb/>
              each other, so as never, by night or day, to be apart from <lb/>
              each other ? 86 for if ye long for this, I am willing to melt you <lb/>

            You say well, Phædrus, (said Agatho); and there is nothing <lb/>
            to prevent me from beginning my speech. For I shall have <lb/>
            frequently the means of conversing again with Socrates.</p>
          <p>[21.] I wish in the first place to state how I ought to speak; <lb/>
            and I will then so speak.2 For all of those who have <lb/>
            spoken before me, appear to me to have celebrated not the <lb/>
            god, but to felicitate mankind upon the good, of which the <lb/>
            god is the cause. But what he is himself, who has bestow­ <lb/>

            each subject of every panegyric, there is only one correct <lb/>
            method ; and that is, to detail in a rational way of how great <lb/>
            things how great a cause is he, respecting whom the dis­ <lb/>
            course may be.3 In this way then it is meet for us to make <lb/>
            the encomium upon Love, (by showing,) first, how great he is, <lb/>
            and afterwards his gifts. I assert then, that of all the gods <lb/>

            without calling down vengeance, the most blessed of all the <lb/>
            gods, and at once5 the most beautiful and the best. 6But <lb/>
            such he is, being the most beautiful.6 In the first place, <lb/>

            in haste from Old Age, who is quick-footed, it is plain, at <lb/>
            least it approaches quicker than is necessary; and which, <lb/>

            and is.8 For, as the old proverb rightly has it, " Like always <lb/>
            doth approach to like."9 Now, though I agree with Phæ­ <lb/>
            drus in many other points, I do not agree in this, that Love <lb/>
            is older than Saturn and Japetus ; but of gods, I affirm, he is <lb/>
            the youngest, and is ever young, and that the doings 10 of the <lb/>
            olden time, which Hesiod and Parmenides detail, were pro­ <lb/>
            duced, if indeed they say true, by the power of Necessity, and <lb/>
            not Love. For, had Love been with them, there had been no <lb/>

            violence, but friendship and peace, as now, from the time <lb/>

            derness of the god. Now Homer describes Ate as a goddess, <lb/>
            and of a tender frame. At least he speaks of her feet as <lb/>
            being tender: <lb/>
            Her feet are tender; not on ground she stalks, <lb/>
            But on the top 13 of human heads she walks.</p>
          <p>The poet then seems to me to show by such a proof her ten. <lb/>
            derness; because she walks not upon a hard place, but a soft <lb/>
            one. And the same proof we shall use respecting Love, that <lb/>
            he too is tender. For he neither walks on the ground, nor <lb/>
            upon (human) skulls, which in truth are places not very soft; <lb/>
            but on the softest of all existing things, he walks and dwells <lb/>
            there. For he has fixed his abode in the dispositions and souls <lb/>
            of gods and men :14 and yet not in all souls indiscriminately: <lb/>
            but whenever he meets with a soul possessing a harsh dispo­ <lb/>
            sition, away he goes, and takes up his abode with a tender one. <lb/>
            Since, then, he is ever touching with his feet, and in every <lb/>
            way the softest parts in the softest persons, he must needs be <lb/>
            extremely tender. Thus then he is very young and very <lb/>
            tender; and in addition to these qualities he is of a flexible <lb/>
            form. For he would not be able to entwine himself around every <lb/>
            thing, nor to pass through every soul, at first unperceived, <lb/>
            and to go out (again),15 if he were of a hard substance. And a <lb/>
            great proof of his form being in proportion 16 and flexible, is <lb/>
            in its gracefulness, which Love confessedly possesses in a man­ <lb/>
            ner superior to all. For between Ungracefulness and Love <lb/>
            there is always a war. His diet too on flowers points out the <lb/>
            beauty of his colour. 17 For Love does not settle upon a body, <note type="footnote"> 13 I have translated as if the Greek were <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλ' ἄκϱ</foreign>' ap' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἥγε κατ' ἀν­ <lb/>

              fallen off; but wherever is a spot flowery and fragrant, there <lb/>
              he settles and fixes his abode.17 [22.] As regards then the <lb/>
              beauty of the god 18 thus much is sufficient; although much <lb/>
              still remains.18 I must speak after this on virtue of Love. <lb/>
              Now is the highest (praise); that he does no injury to a god <lb/>
              or man, nor by a god or man is he injured. Nor, if he suffers <lb/>
              aught, does he suffer by violence; for violence touches not <lb/>
              Love; nor if he does aught, does he it with violence ;19 for <lb/>
              every one willingly ministers in every thing to Love.20 But <lb/>
              whatever one party agrees (to do) of his own accord for an­ <lb/>
              other party of his own accord, such acts the laws, that are <lb/>
              the rulers in a state, say are justly done. In addition to jus­ <lb/>
              tice, Love has the greatest share of temperance. For to be <lb/>
              superior to pleasures and to passions, is every where confessed <lb/>
              to be temperance. But no pleasure is superior to Love. If <lb/>
              then they are inferior, they will be Love's subjects; and he <lb/>
              will be their master; and being thus superior to pleasures and <lb/>
              passions, lie will be pre-eminently temperate. Moreover, as <lb/>
              regards valour, not Ares (Mars) himself can stand up against <lb/>
              Love.21 22 For it is not Ares that holds Love, but Love Ares, <note type="footnote"> 18—18 Ficinus has, " permulta insuper afferri possent; sed ista sum­ <lb/>

              and men.25 From whence26 then were the affairs of the gods <lb/>
              put into order ? Through the birth, it is plain, of the love of <lb/>
              beauty; for Love does not follow27 ugliness. For previously, <lb/>
              as I stated at the commencement, many and terrible things <lb/>

              Thus, Phædrus, Love appears to me to be, in the first place,30 <lb/>
              himself the most beautiful and best; in the next, to be the <lb/>

          <p>[24.] When Agatho had done speaking, all present, said <lb/>
            Aristodemus, roared out (applause), for he had spoken in a <lb/>
            manner worthy of himself and the god.—Upon which Socrates, <lb/>
            looking at Eryximachus, said, Do I appear to you, son of Acu<foreign xml:lang="grc">̄</foreign>­ <lb/>
            me<foreign xml:lang="grc">̆</foreign>nus, to have felt just now a fear that was no fear,40 when I <lb/>
            spoke prophetically, what I asserted lately, that Agatho would <lb/>
            speak marvellously well, and that I should be placed in a diffi­ <lb/>
            culty ?-One portion, replied Eryximachus, you appear to have <lb/>
            foretold truly, that Agatho would speak excellently, but the <lb/>
            other, that you would be in a difficulty, I do not consider (true). <lb/>
            And how, 0 happy man, said Socrates, am I not likely to be in a <lb/>
            difficulty, and any one else too, who is to speak after a speech so <lb/>
            full of beauty and variety? 41 In other respects it was not equally <lb/>
            admirable,41 but who, that heard the conclusion, would not <lb/>
            have been struck with the beauty 42 of the nouns and verbs ?42 <lb/>
            For when I consider how unable I shall be to say any thing <lb/>
            beautiful approaching. to this, I should run away for very <lb/>
            shame, had I in any way the power. For the speech put me <lb/>
            in mind of Gorgias : so that I suffered what is told in Ho­ <lb/>
            mer.43 For I feared that Agatho would at last send in his <lb/>
            speech the head of that formidable speaker Gorgias against my <lb/>
            speech ; and, through my inability to say a word, turn me into <lb/>
            stone! And I perceived how ridiculous I was then, when <lb/>
            I agreed that I would in my turn after you make an encomium <lb/>
            upon Love, and asserted that I had some skill in the matter <lb/>
            of Love, yet knowing nothing of it, nor how it was necessary <lb/>
            to praise any thing whatever. For in my stupidity I thought <note type="footnote"> 40 Suidas in <foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽Αδεές</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽ Αδεὲς δέδιας δέος</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 41—41 Ficinus has “ et cetera quidem, quamvis apte composita non <lb/>

            one ought to speak truths respecting each subject praised, <lb/>
            and that these were to be the substratum, and that selecting <lb/>
            out of these very matters the most beautiful, to put them to­ <lb/>
            gether in the most becoming manner. And I had a great <lb/>
            notion that I should speak well, as knowing well the truths <lb/>
            relating to the praising of any thing whatever. But this it <lb/>
            seems is not the way to praise correctly, but (we must) attri­ <lb/>
            bute to the subject qualities the greatest and the best possible, <lb/>
            whether they are such or not; and if the encomiums are un­ <lb/>
            true, that is an affair quite immaterial. For it was stated <lb/>
            before, as it seems, that each of us 44 should appear to praise <lb/>
            Love, and not merely to praise.44 On this account, I suppose, <lb/>
            you 45 turn over every topic and attribute to Love,45 and <lb/>
            assert that he is of such a kind, and the cause of things so <lb/>
            great, as to appear the most beautiful and best-to those <lb/>
            it is clear who know him not-for he certainly would not <lb/>
            (appear so) to those who did know him. And thus the praise <lb/>
            becomes fine and pompous. But for my part, I know nothing <lb/>
            of this kind of praise ; and through not knowing, I agreed <lb/>
            to compose myself in my turn a panegyric. " But my tongue <lb/>
            only46 promised, not my mind." And so farewell to it. For <lb/>

            not merely be thought to praise him." For thus there would be a proper <lb/>
            antithesis between real and seeming praise. On this antithesis I have <lb/>

            trifling questions; that, 51 after having obtained a confession <lb/>
            from him, I may then speak 51 in this way. I permit you, <lb/>
            said Phædrus. Question him. Hereupon he said, that <lb/>
            Socrates began somewhat after this fashion:</p>
          <p>In good truth, friend Agatho, you seem to me to have begun <lb/>
            your speech well, in saying that we ought in the first place to set <lb/>
            forth what is the nature of Love, and afterwards his doings. <lb/>
            With this introduction I am quite delighted. Come, then, <lb/>
            touching this Love; since you have gone through the other <lb/>
            points in a beautiful and splendid manner, tell me this also. Is <lb/>
            Love a being of such a kind as to be (the love) of something or <lb/>
            nothing ? I do not ask, whether it is of some father or mother; <note type="footnote"> 27, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Οὐ γὰρ ὀῑω</foreign> or, and Hipp. Maj. p. 292, B., <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὔμοι δοκει̃</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">οὔκ</foreign> : but <lb/>

            -for the question, whether love is the love of a father or <lb/>
            mother, would be ridiculous-but as if I had asked this re­ <lb/>
            specting a father, Is a father a father ; and the father of some­ <lb/>
            thing, or not ? In this case you would surely have said, if <lb/>
            you wished to answer correctly, that a father is the father of a <lb/>
            son or daughter, would you not ?-Certainly, said Agatho.— <lb/>
            And is not a mother in the same predicament ?-To this too <lb/>
            Agatho assented.-Answer me still further, said Socrates, to <lb/>
            a question a little larger, that you may the better apprehend <lb/>
            my meaning. If I had asked, What, then, of a brother- <lb/>
            whatever that very thing may be-is he a brother of some <lb/>
            person, or not ?—(Agatho) said, He is.—Is he not of a brother <lb/>
            or a sister ?—Agatho assented.—Try then, said (Socrates), to <lb/>
            tell me about love. Is it the love of nothing, or of something ?— <lb/>
            Of something,52 by all means, (replied Agatho).—This, there­ <lb/>
            fore,53 said Socrates, keep to yourself, remembering what it <lb/>
            is ; but tell me so much as this. Does love desire that very <lb/>
            thing, of which it is the love, or does it not ?-Desires it, cer­ <lb/>
            tainly.—Whether, when possessing what it desires and loves, <lb/>
            does it then desire and love it ? or only when not possessing it ? <lb/>
            -It would seem, he replied, only when not possessing it.- <lb/>
            [26.] Instead of seeming,54 said Socrates, consider if it be not <lb/>
            of necessity thus, that desire desires only that, of which it is in <lb/>
            want; and that it does not desire, if it be from want. For <lb/>
            to me, Agatho, this seems to be marvellously necessary. But <lb/>
            how does it to you ?- To me too it seems, replied (Agatho).— <lb/>
            You say well, said (Socrates). Would then a big man, being <lb/>
            big already, wish to be big ? or a man being strong, wish <lb/>
            to be strong ?-This is, from what has been just now stated, <lb/>
            impossible (replied Agatho). For, being so,55 he would not <note type="footnote">52 In lieu of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐστιν</foreign> we must read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐστί τινος</foreign>, as shown by " Alicujus <lb/>

            be wanting on those points.-You say true, replied Socrates ; <lb/>
            for, if a person, being already strong, should wish to be strong, <lb/>
            and being swift, (wish to be) swift, and (being) healthy, (wish <lb/>
            to be) healthy,57 one might perhaps imagine 58that those who <lb/>
            are such, as regards these and such-like points, and possess <lb/>
            these, would desire those things which they already possess.58 <lb/>
            That we may not therefore be deceived, it is for this that I <lb/>
            speak. For if you consider the matter, Agatho, (you will <lb/>
            see) that they, who possess at present any of those things, <lb/>
            must possess them, whether they will or not; and of such a <lb/>
            thing, how can any one ever have a desire? But when a <lb/>
            person says thus—“ I, who am now in health, desire to be in <lb/>
            health; and I, who am now wealthy, desire to be wealthy; <lb/>
            and I long for those very things, which I possess we should <lb/>
            say to him thus: " You mean, my man, that you, who now <lb/>
            possess wealth, and health, and strength, are desirous to pos­ <lb/>
            sess those things for the time to come; since at the present time <lb/>
            you possess them, whether you will or not." When you say, <lb/>
            therefore, thus—“ I desire what is present," consider whether <lb/>
            you are saying any thing else than this—“ I wish that what are <lb/>
            now present may be present for the time to come." Would aught <lb/>
            else but this be acknowledged ?59—Agatho agreed that it would <lb/>
            not.-Go Is not this then, said Socrates, to love (to desire)60 <note type="footnote"> " After " healthy," Stalbaum fancies that the apodosis is wanting ; for <lb/>

              Both this man, therefore, (said Socrates,) and every one else <lb/>
              who feels a desire, desires that which lies not at hand, and <lb/>
              which is not present, and which he has not, and which he <lb/>
              himself is not, and of which he is in want of; such things <lb/>
              only are those of which there is the desire and the love.- <lb/>
              Certainly, said he.—61 Come then, said Socrates, let us agree <lb/>
              upon what has been said.61 Is Love any thing else than, in <lb/>
              the first place, the love of something ? next, of those things <lb/>
              of which there is a want ?-Clearly (not), replied Agatho.— <lb/>
              In addition to these, said Socratcs, recollect, of what things <lb/>
              you asserted in your speech there was a Love. But, if you <lb/>
              wish it, I will remind you. For, I think, you said something <lb/>
              like this—“ that their affairs were put into order by the gods, <lb/>
              through a love of things beautiful: for that of things ugly <lb/>
              there could be no love." Did you not say some such thing ? <lb/>
              I did say so, answered Agatho.—And you spoke reason­ <lb/>
              ably, friend, replied Socrates. Now, if such be the case, <lb/>
              would Love be any thing else than the love of beauty, and <lb/>
              not of ugliness ?-He confessed it.-And has it not been <lb/>
              confessed, said Socrates, that a person loves that thing of <lb/>
              which he is in want, and which he does not possess ?—Yes, <lb/>
              said (Agatho).—Love then, (said Socrates,) is in want of, and <lb/>
              does not possess, beauty.-It is so of necessity, said (Agatho). <lb/>
              -What then, (said Socrates,) do you call that beautiful, to <lb/>
              which beauty is wanting, and does not possess it at all?- <lb/>
              Certainly not, (replied Agatho).—Do you then, said Socrates, <lb/>
              still confess that Love is beautiful, if such be the case ?-And <lb/>
              Agatho then said, I seem nearly, Socrates, to know nothing <lb/>
              of what I then asserted.-And you have, Agatho, spoken <lb/>
              fairly, said Socrates. But tell me still one little thing. Do <lb/>
              not things good seem to you to be also beautiful ?- They do, <lb/>

              the case be as you say.—You are not able, my beloved <lb/>

              now here I will leave you. But as regards the discourse <lb/>
              about Love, which I heard for merly from Diotima of Manti­ <lb/>

              the Scholiast on Aristid. T. p. 468, ed. Dind., she was a priestess of the <lb/>
              temple of Zeus Lyceus in Arcadia ; while Aristides himself, in the speech <lb/>

              Ach. 529, as being the real cause of the Peloponnesian war, just as <lb/>
              Helen had been of the Trojan. Maximus Tyrius too seems to have had <lb/>
              some such notion; for his words are, <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴτε Μαντινικὴ εἴτε</foreign> Kat <foreign xml:lang="grc">Λεσβία τις <lb/>

              is then some such thing as correct opinion between intelli­ <lb/>

              compel what is not beautiful to be ugly; or what is not good to <lb/>
              be evil. And thus, since you have confessed that Love is <lb/>
              neither good nor beautiful, do not fancy a whit the more that <lb/>

              ance is in a hard case, in that a person,88 being neither beau­ <lb/>
              tiful, nor good, nor wise, still appears to himself to be all- <lb/>
              sufficient. Hence he who fancies himself to be not wanting, <lb/>
              does not desire that, of which he fancies he is not in want. <lb/>
              -Who then, Diotima, said I, are they who philosophize ? if <lb/>
              they are neither the wise nor the ignorant ?-This, said she, <lb/>
              is surely clear even to a child, that they are those between <lb/>
              both of these; of whom Love too (is one).89 For of the things <lb/>
              most beautiful is wisdom. Now Love is conversant with the <lb/>
              beautiful. So that it is of necessity for Love to be a lover of <lb/>
              wisdom, and for a lover of wisdom to be between the wise and <lb/>
              the ignorant. And of this too the cause is in his birth ; for <lb/>
              he is from a father wise and in abundance, but from a mother <lb/>
              unwise and in want. [30.] Such, my dear Socrates, is the <lb/>
              nature of this daemon. But as to whom you fancied to be <lb/>
              Love, you have suffered nothing to be wondered at. For you <lb/>
              fancied, as it seems to me, making a guess from what you are <lb/>
              saying, that Love is the thing loved, and not the loving; and <lb/>
              hence, I think, Love appeared to you to be all-beautiful. <lb/>
              For the thing loved is in reality beautiful and delicate and <lb/>
              perfect and blest. But the thing loving possesses another na­ <lb/>
              ture, and such as I have described.-Be it so, stranger lady, <lb/>
              said I; for you have spoken well. But if Love be of such a <lb/>
              nature, of what advantage is he to mankind ?- This, Socrates, <lb/>
              said she, I will subsequently endeavour to teach you. Love <lb/>
              then is of such a nature, and has been so begotten; and he <lb/>
              is, as you assert, the love of things beautiful. Now should <lb/>
              any one ask us, What is, 0 Socrates and Diotima, the Love <lb/>
              of things beautiful ?-:-but I will speak more clearly. in this <lb/>
              way—What does the lover of things beautiful long for?- <lb/>
              For them to be his, said I.—This answer, said she, seeks still <note type="footnote"> wanting in the MS. used by Proclus, who quotes <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτό</foreign> yap <foreign xml:lang="grc">του̃τό ἐϭτιν ή <lb/>

              such a question as this. What will there be to that man, who <lb/>
              shall possess things beautiful ?-To this question I said, I had <lb/>
              it not in my power to give an answer very ready at hand.- <lb/>
              But, said she, should a person making a change, and putting <lb/>
              good in the place of beautiful, inquire of you (by saying), <lb/>
              Come (tell me), Socrates, what does the lover of good things <lb/>
              long for ?-For them to be his, I answered.-And what will <lb/>
              there be to a man, who shall possess good things ?-This, said <lb/>
              I, is more easy to answer: that he will be happy.—(Right,) <lb/>
              said she; for by the possession of good things the happy are <lb/>
              happy, nor is there any need to ask, Why does he, who wishes <lb/>
              to be happy, wish so; but the answer appears to be conclu­ <lb/>
              sive.—You say true, I replied.-Now do you conceive, said <lb/>
              she, that this wishing and this longing is common to all men, <lb/>
              and that all wish for good things to be in their possession <lb/>
              always; or how say you ?—I think in this way, said I; that <lb/>
              it is common to all.—Why then, Socrates, said she, do we <lb/>
              not say that all men are in love, if all love the same things, <lb/>
              and always ? but say (rather),90 that some are in love, and <lb/>
              some are not?—I too91 am in a wonderment, said I.—Do not <lb/>
              wonder, said she; 92for after we have taken away a certain <lb/>
              species of love, we call it love, adding the name of the whole; <lb/>
              but as regards the rest, we make an improper use of other <lb/>
              names.92—As how, for example ? said I.—As this, said she. <lb/>
              You know that creation is a thing of extensive meaning. For <lb/>
              that which is the cause of any thing coming out of non-existence <lb/>
              into existence, is altogether a creation. So that all the oper­ <lb/>
              ations effected by all the arts, are creations; and all the <lb/>
              workers of them are creators.—You say true, said I.—And <lb/>
              yet you know, continued she, they are not called creators, but <lb/>
              have other names; but from all kinds of creation one portion <lb/>

              is beautiful is suited. 5 For Beauty is Fate and Eileithuia, who <lb/>
              presides over child-birth.5 Hence when what is yearning comes <lb/>
              close to what is beautiful, it becomes joyous, and being de­ <lb/>

              matter grievously to heart. Hence to the party yearning and <lb/>
              swelling with desire, there is an excessive fluttering of mind <lb/>

              said she, this is not, as you fancied, the love of the beautiful.- <lb/>

              immortal, as far as it can be for a mortal. 12 Now from what has <lb/>
              been agreed upon it is necessary to desire immortality with <lb/>
              a good, if there is to Love the desire of the good being ever <lb/>
              present to himself. It is necessary then from this reasoning, <lb/>
              that there is a love likewise of immortality.12</p>
          <p>[32.] All this did Diotima teach me, when she was dis­ <lb/>

            ῷ</foreign> Z<foreign xml:lang="grc">ευ̃, τη̃σδε ποήσης μ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἒλπἰδος</foreign>. For by the slight change of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψευ̃σον</foreign> into <lb/>

            there is, I suspect, an error in <foreign xml:lang="grc">παϱατεινόμενα</foreign>. For the effect of hunger <lb/>

            Now this it effects only by generation; when it leaves another <lb/>
            new thing in the place of the old; since at the time when each <lb/>
            individual animal 16 is said to live, and to be the same; 16 as for <lb/>
            instance, a person is called the same from childhood, until he <lb/>
            becomes an old man; and though he never possesses the same <lb/>
            things in himself, he is nevertheless called the same person, <lb/>
            17 being perpetually altered, (by obtaining some new things,) <lb/>
            and losing (the old),17 as regards the hair and flesh, and bones <lb/>
            and blood, and the whole body. And not only as regards the <lb/>
            body, but the soul likewise; his manners, morals, opinions, de­ <lb/>
            sires, pleasures, pains, fears, all these never remain the same <lb/>
            to any man; but some are produced, and some destroyed. <lb/>
            And there is something still more strange than this; since not <lb/>
            only are some sciences produced, and some lost by us, but we <lb/>
            are never the same, not even as regards sciences in general; <lb/>
            but each single science suffers in a similar way. For what <lb/>
            we call to practise oneself is to act, as if a science were about <lb/>
            to depart; and indeed oblivion is the departure of science; <lb/>
            but practice, introducing again a fresh remembrance in the <lb/>
            place of the departing one, preserves the science, so that it <lb/>
            seems to be the same. In this manner every thing mortal is <lb/>
            preserved, not by its being in every respect the same for ever, <note type="footnote"> to explain. Nor just before do I see how <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνταυ̃θα</foreign>, an adverb of time or <lb/>
            place, can be opposed to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκείνψ</foreign>, a pronoun relating to a thing or person. <lb/>
            Hence, since nearly all the MSS. read TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶναι</foreign>, perhaps Plato wrote <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀειγενές <lb/>
            τι εἰ̃ναι καὶ άθάνατον</foreign>, as just before in § 31, <foreign xml:lang="grc">άειγενές-καὶ άθάνατον</foreign>: <lb/>

              origin in the Mysteries. The first degree was called " purgation," the <lb/>
              second " illumination," and the third " a looking-on." The consummation <lb/>
              however did not take place until five years after the initiation. Agreeable <lb/>
              to this gradation Diotima initiates Socrates into the mysteries of Love; <lb/>
              where her confutation of his pretended former notions, but, in reality, of <lb/>
              the preceding speeches in this Dialogue, answers to the first step, "pur­ <lb/>

              second step, " illumination." And the remainder of her discourse alludes <lb/>
              to the last step, " a looking-on." But Sydenham seems to have forgotten <lb/>

              και ταῡτα</foreign> could not have reference to what had been already said; for <lb/>
              from the passage quoted by himself from § 35, <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεώμενος</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὸς τέλος <lb/>
              η̃δη</foreign> ì<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὼν</foreign>, it is evident that Plato wrote ra <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὲ τέλεια, ὣν ἒνεκά γε αὐτὰ τὰ <lb/>
              ἐποπτικά ἐστιν</foreign> : and so I have translated; for we thus get at the natural <lb/>
              meaning of simple words, out of which Ficinus has made this high- <lb/>
              flown sense—" Utrum vero ulterius procedas ac perfecta demum amatoria, <lb/>
              quæve sublime spectant, quorum gratia hæc sunt, animadvertas utrum <lb/>

              arrive at this consummation, must begin when young to direct <lb/>
              his steps to forms that are beautiful. And if, in the first <lb/>

              beauty, which exists in any form whatever, is the brother to <lb/>

              become a lover of all beautiful forms, 51 and relax the violence <lb/>
              (of his love) for a -single form, and despise it, and hold it of <lb/>
              no moment ;51 and afterwards consider of greater value the <lb/>
              beauty existing in the soul, than that existing in the body; <lb/>

            that he might sit down; and sitting down he embraced Agatho, <lb/>
            and bound the fillet on him. Thereupon said Agatho, Slaves, <lb/>
            unloose the sandals of Alcibiades, that he may recline as the <lb/>
            third among us. By all means, said Alcibiades;78 but, who is this <lb/>

              that wine cooler, which seems86 to hold more than eight <lb/>

              I assert any thing not true, lay hold of me while speaking if you <lb/>
              will, and say that I am telling a falsehood; for I shall not will­ <lb/>

              to enumerate readily, and in succession, your strange be­ <lb/>
              haviour. [39.] I will then endeavour, gentlemen, to praise <lb/>
              Socrates in this way by means of images. He indeed will per­ <lb/>
              haps imagine that I am turning him into ridicule; but the <lb/>
              image will be for the sake of what is true, and not ridiculous.</p>
          <p>I say, then, that Socrates is most like the figures of Silenus <lb/>
            that are seated in the workshops of statuaries, which the <lb/>
            artists have made, holding reeds or flutes; but which, when <lb/>
            they are opened down the middle, appear to contain within them <lb/>
            statues of the gods. And I again say, that he resembles the <lb/>
            satyr Marsyas.97 Now that in your outward form, Socrates, <lb/>
            you resemble these things, even you yourself will not deny; <lb/>
            but that you resemble them likewise in other points, hear in <lb/>
            the next place. You are saucy in deeds; or are you not? <lb/>
            For, if you do not acknowledge it, I will bring witnesses to <lb/>
            the fact. Are you not also a piper much more wonderful than <lb/>
            Marsyas ? For98 he charmed men through instruments, by a <lb/>
            power proceeding from the mouth; and he (charms)99 even <lb/>
            now, when any one plays his melodies. For what Olympus 100 <note type="footnote"> 96 Taylor refers here to the Scholia of Maximus on Pseudo-Dionysius <lb/>
            Areopagite, t. ii. p. 209, where it is said that " the Greeks made statues, <lb/>
            without hands or feet, which they called Hermæ, hollow within, but <lb/>
            with doors: within these they placed statues of the gods whom they <lb/>
            worshipped, but they closed them by the Hermæ externally. Hence <lb/>
            these Hermæ appeared to be things of no value; but inwardly they con­ <lb/>

            played, I call the melodies of Marsyas, who taught him. Now <lb/>
            his melodies, whether a good male flute-player plays them, or a <lb/>
            bad female one, alone1 cause a person to be spell-bound, and <lb/>
            point out, through their being divine, those that stand in need 2 <lb/>
            of the gods and the mysteries; but you in this respect alone <lb/>
            differ from him, that you effect the very same thing by naked <lb/>
            words without instruments. We therefore, when we hear <lb/>
            another person, although a good speaker himself, pronouncing <lb/>
            the speeches of others, not a single hearer, so to say, pays <lb/>
            any regard to them; but when any one hears you, or your <lb/>
            discourses spoken by another, although he is a wretched <lb/>
            speaker, yet, whether a woman or a man or a lad is the <lb/>
            auditor, we are astonished and spell-bound. I therefore, gen­ <lb/>
            tlemen, unless I seemed to be very much in liquor, would tell <lb/>
            you upon oath what I have suffered by the discourses of this <lb/>
            man, and am suffering even now. For when I hear him, my <lb/>
            heart leaps much more than that of the Corybantes;3 and <lb/>
            my tears flow forth through his discourses. I see too many <lb/>
            others suffering in the very same way. But when I hear <lb/>
            Pericles, and other excellent orators, I think indeed that they <lb/>
            speak well, but I suffer nothing of this kind; nor is my soul <lb/>
            agitated with tumult, nor is it indignant, as if I were in a <lb/>
            servile state. But by this Marsyas here I am often so affected, <lb/>
            that it appears to me I ought not to live, while I am in such a <lb/>
            state. You will not, Socrates, say that this is not true. And <lb/>
            even now I feel conscious that, were I willing to lend him my <lb/>
            ears, I could not bear it, but should suffer in the very same <lb/>
            way. For lie would compel4 me to confess, that, being yet <lb/>
            very deficient, I neglect my own affairs,5 but attend to those <lb/>
            of the Athenians.6 7By violence therefore restraining my­ <lb/>

            inability to deny that what he exhorts me to do ought not to <lb/>

              since by gratifying Socrates it would be in my power to hear <lb/>
              from him all that he knew. For I prided myself on my <lb/>
              beauty marvellously. With these thoughts in my head, al­ <lb/>
              though I had previously been never accustomed to be in his <lb/>
              company without an attendant, on that occasion I sent the <lb/>
              page away and remained with him alone; for I must state <lb/>
              the whole truth, and do you give me your attention; and if I <lb/>
              am telling a falsehood, do you, Socrates, confute me. I was, <lb/>
              gentlemen, alone with him alone; and I thought he would <lb/>
              immediately converse with me in the way that lovers are <lb/>
              wont to speak to their beloved in private ; and15 I was (highly) <lb/>
              delighted (with the expectation).15 Nothing however of this <lb/>
              kind very much16 took place ; but after conversing somewhat17 <lb/>
              and passing the day with me as usual, he went away. Then <lb/>
              I challenged him to contend with me in the naked exercises, <lb/>
              and I did contend as if about to effect something by this <lb/>
              means. He engaged therefore naked, and had a tussel fre­ <lb/>

              son so suffering is unwilling to tell what it is, except to those who <lb/>
              have been bitten, as being alone about to know and to pardon <lb/>

              than that from the viper, when they (the discourses) lay hold of <lb/>
              a young person with a not badly-disposed soul, and cause him <lb/>

              own property, or that of my friends: for nothing is to me of <lb/>
              greater moment than to become the best of men : and for this <lb/>
              I think there is no person a more competent assister than <lb/>
              yourself; and I should feel a much greater shame before the <lb/>
              wise, in not gratifying such a man, than before the 27 [many <lb/>

              But, 0 blessed man, think better of it, nor let me lie hid from <lb/>
              you, as being nothing. The power of intellectual vision be­ <lb/>
              gins then to see acutely, when that of the eye loses its acmé.30 <lb/>
              You however are still far off from this. And I, having heard <lb/>
              him, replied, As regards myself the facts are so; of which not <lb/>
              one has been stated otherwise than as I conceive myself. But <lb/>
              do you counsel me in what you may consider to be best both <lb/>
              for you and me. In this, said he, you say well: for in the <lb/>
              time to come let us consult together, and we will do what ap­ <lb/>
              pears to be the best for us, both with respect to these and <lb/>
              other matters. [42.] Having thus heard and 31 spoken, and sent <lb/>
              as it were arrows,31 I thought that he was wounded; and I <lb/>
              rose up, and not suffering him to speak any more, I wrapped <lb/>
              myself round with this garment, (for it was winter,) and lying <lb/>
              down under the old cloak of this man, I threw my arms <lb/>
              around the truly divine and wonderful man, and lay there the <lb/>
              whole night. And in this again, Socrates, you will not say <lb/>
              that I am telling a falsehood. But though I acted in this <lb/>
              manner, yet he was victorious, and despised, and jeered at, and <lb/>
              even insulted my beauty. And yet I fancied it was some­ <lb/>
              thing, men and judges, for judges you are, of the haughtiness <lb/>
              of Socrates. For by the gods and goddesses, rest assured that <lb/>
              I rose from Socrates no otherwise than if I had slept with my <lb/>
              father, or my elder brother. <note type="footnote"> 30 The same theory is promulgated, if I rightly remember, by Aristotle. <lb/>

          <p>32 What feelings then do you fancy I had after this,32 on <lb/>
            reflecting that I had been dishonoured, but yet admiring the <lb/>
            nature, and the temperance and fortitude of this man, after <lb/>
            I had met with a person such as I never thought I should <lb/>
            meet with for prudence and self-control; so that I neither <lb/>
            had it in my power to be angry with him, nor though I was <lb/>
            deprived of intercourse with him, had I any means of attach­ <lb/>
            ing him to myself. For I well knew that he would be on <lb/>
            every side more invulnerable to money, than Ajax33 was to <lb/>
            the sword; and that he had escaped me, at the very time <lb/>
            when I fancied he would be caught. And thus I was reduced <lb/>
            to my wits' ends, and went about, the slave of this man, as <lb/>
            no one else was of any other. For not only did all this occur <lb/>
            to me formerly, but after this likewise, during a campaign <lb/>
            common to both of us, took place against Potidæa, and there <lb/>
            we messed together. And here, in the first place, he not <lb/>
            only surpassed myself, but all others, in the labours of the <lb/>
            field. But when we were left some where, and compelled, as <lb/>
            happens in campaigns, to be greatly34 without food, the rest <lb/>
            were nothing to him for the power of endurance. On the <lb/>
            other hand, at our jollifications, he was the only person who <lb/>
            could enjoy them; for though he was generally unwilling <lb/>
            to drink, yet when forced to do so, he beat all the rest; and <lb/>
            what is the most wonderful of all, no one ever saw Socrates <lb/>
            intoxicated. But of this it appears to me there will be shortly <lb/>
            a confutation. Again, with respect to his endurance in winter, <lb/>
            for the winters there are very severe,36 he performed wonders <lb/>
            in other ways, and once also when the frost was most bitter, <note type="footnote"> 32—32 Compare Iph.

            he clothed himself in wonderfully thick (cloaks),37 had his <lb/>

          <p>"But what this patient man did do and dare,"38 during the <lb/>

            thinking of some question from himself he stood from the <lb/>
            dawn investigating it; and, as he did not succeed, he did not <lb/>
            desist, but stood still investigating it. It was mid-day, and <lb/>
            some persons perceived him, and wondering said, one to the <lb/>
            other, that Socrates had been standing from the morning think­ <lb/>
            ing upon something. At length some Ionian soldiers, when <lb/>
            it was evening, having supped-for it was then summer­ <lb/>
            brought out their ground-litters, and partly slept in the cold <lb/>
            and partly kept watch, whether he would stand there all night. <lb/>
            And he did stand until the dawn appeared and the sun rose; <lb/>
            after which he departed, having first offered a prayer to the <lb/>
            sun.40 And if you are willing (to hear), 41 what he was in <lb/>
            battle, must not be passed by.41 For it is surely just to pay <lb/>
            him this tribute. For when the battle took place, in which <lb/>
            the generals assigned to myself the prize of superior good <lb/>

            eager for me to receive them than for yourself. Further still, <lb/>
            gentlemen, it was well worth while to see Socrates when our <lb/>
            army retreated from Delium ;42 for I happened to be present <lb/>
            with the cavalry, but Socrates was among the heavy-armed. <lb/>
            For when the troops were already scattered, both he and <lb/>
            Laches retreated; and I, meeting with and seeing the two, <lb/>
            immediately exhorted them to take courage, and said that I <lb/>
            would not abandon them. Here then I had a better view of <lb/>
            Socrates than at Potidæa; for I was in less fear, because I <lb/>
            was on horseback. In the first place then, how greatly did he <lb/>
            surpass Laches in his being cautious; and in the next place, <lb/>
            he seemed, according to your description, Aristophanes, to <lb/>
            carry himself loftily,43 and to throw his eye on one side, to <lb/>
            survey quietly both friends and foes ; and it was manifest to <lb/>
            every one, and even to a person at a distance, that whoever <lb/>
            presumed to touch this man, would be very vigorously re­ <lb/>
            pulsed. Hence both he and the other departed in safety; for <lb/>
            scarcely any one, who thus conducts himself in war, is <lb/>
            touched ; but the pursuit is of those who turn and run away. <lb/>
            [44.] 44 There are many other things for which a person would <lb/>
            have it in his power to praise Socrates wondrously. But of <lb/>
            his other pursuits, some one may perhaps speak in this way <lb/>
            even about another person;44 but to be like not one, either of <lb/>
            the ancients or moderns, this is a thing worthy of all wonder. <lb/>
            For such as Achilles was, one might conjecture was Brasidas45 <lb/>
            and others: and again, that, such as Pericles was, were An- <note type="footnote"> 42 This event took place in 01. 89, 1. See Thueyd. iv. 96. </note><note type="footnote"> 43The passage of Aristophanes alluded to is in <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νεφ</foreign>. 361. With regard <lb/>

            bird, found in marshes, and that walks with its long legs, as if on stilts. <lb/>
            From this reference to the very play of Aristophanes where Socrates is made <lb/>
            the constant butt of the dramatist, and from the two being thus brought to­ <lb/>
            gether, as the common friends of Agatho, it has been fairly inferred, that <lb/>
            either the dramatist had in reality no ill-will towards Socratcs, or that the <lb/>

            such a strange character as is this man, both in himself and <lb/>
            in his discourses, no one will by searching discover any man <lb/>
            approaching near to him, either among those living now or <lb/>
            in the olden time ; unless indeed some one should compare him <lb/>
            to no human being, but to what I have mentioned, Silenuses <lb/>
            and Satyrs. For I omitted to state this at first, that his dis­ <lb/>
            courses too are. very like the Silenuses when opened. For <lb/>
            should any one be willing to hear the discourses of Socrates, <lb/>
            they will appear to be 47 very ridiculous at first ;47 with such <lb/>
            nouns and verbs do they envelop externally, 48 as it were, the <lb/>
            hide of a Satyr.48 For he speaks of panniered asses,49 and of <lb/>

            it is fitting for him to consider, who intends to become a man <lb/>
            at once beautiful and good. These then are the reasons, <lb/>
            gentlemen, for which I praise Socrates; but on the other <lb/>
            hand, for what I blame him, I have mixed up in the recital of <lb/>
            the insults he has heaped upon me. Nor has he acted in this <lb/>
            manner towards me alone, but. also towards Charmides, the <lb/>
            son of Glauco, Euthydemus, the son of Diodes, and very <lb/>
            many others; whom this man has deceived, as if he were their <lb/>
            lover, when, instead of the loving, he is himself the beloved. <lb/>
            Hence,53 I caution you, Agatho, not to be deceived by this <lb/>
            man; but, taught by my sufferings, to have a care, and not, <lb/>
            according to the proverb, By suffering, like a silly person, <lb/>
            knowledge gain.54</p>
          <p>When Alcibiades had thus spoken, there was a (general)55 <lb/>
            laugh at his freedom of speech, because he appeared to be <lb/>
            lovingly disposed towards Socrates; who thereupon observed, <lb/>
            You seem to me, Alcibiades, to be sober ; for, otherwise, you <lb/>
            would not have attempted in so elegant and circuitous a man­ <lb/>
            ner to conceal that, for the sake of which you have said all <lb/>
            this; and, as if mentioning something of no consequence, you <lb/>
            have cleverly placed at the end that you have said all this <lb/>
            on this account, namely, to throw discord56 between me and <lb/>
            Agatho, conceiving that I ought to love you and no other <lb/>
            person, and that Agatho ought to be loved by you, and by no <lb/>
            one else. But you have not lain hid from me; but this play <lb/>
            of yours is plainly a Satyric one and Silenus-like. But, my <lb/>
            dear Agatho, let not any thing occur in his favour, but do you <lb/>
            prepare yourself so that no one may set you and me at vari­ <lb/>
            ance. Whereupon said Agatho, You seem indeed, Socrates, <lb/>
            to be speaking very nearly the truth, and I conjecture that he <note type="footnote"> 53 The Greek is now A <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὴ</foreign> it was <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δί᾽</foreign> A <foreign xml:lang="grc">δὴ</foreign>, as shown by " quamobrem," <lb/>

            us apart. There will not, however, occur any thing in his <lb/>
            favour from this ; for I will come and recline by you. By all <lb/>
            means, said Socrates, come hither, and recline below me. 0 <lb/>
            Zeus! said Alcibiades, how greatly again do I suffer from <lb/>
            this man ! He fancies he must surpass me in every thing; <lb/>
            but, 0 wonderful man, if nothing else, suffer at least Agatho <lb/>
            to recline between us. It is impossible, said Socrates: for <lb/>
            as you have praised me, it is now necessary for me to praise <lb/>
            him, reclining at my right hand. If, therefore, Agatho reclines <lb/>
            below you, he will not surely again praise me, before he has <lb/>
            been praised by me. Cease, then, thou happy fellow, and do <lb/>
            not grudge my being praised by the youth ; for I have a great <lb/>
            desire to pass an encomium on him. Ho ! ho ! said Agatho to <lb/>
            Alcibiades, there is no reason why I should remain here, but <lb/>
            every reason rather that I should change my place, that I may be <lb/>
            praised by Socrates. This is, said Alcibiades, as usual. When <lb/>
            Socrates is present, it is impossible for any other to share the <lb/>
            favours of the beautiful. And now observe how easily he <lb/>
            has discovered a persuasive language, so that this youth should <lb/>
            recline at his side. After this Agatho rose up, as if about to <lb/>
            recline close to Socrates. But on a sudden there came very <lb/>
            many revellers to the gates, and, finding them open, in con­ <lb/>
            sequence of some one having gone out in an opposite direction, <lb/>
            they marched in, and threw themselves on the couches; and <lb/>
            the whole place was filled with uproar, and no longer in any <lb/>
            order (every one)57 was compelled to drink a great quantity <lb/>
            of wine. Whereupon Eryximachus and Phædrus, and some <lb/>
            others, said Aristodemus, went away,58 but that sleep laid <lb/>
            hold of him ;59 and that he slept for a very long time, as the <note type="footnote"> 57 As there is nothing to which <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναγκάξεσθαι</foreign> can be referred, Sydenham <lb/>

            sum of it, he said, was this, that Socrates was compelling <lb/>
            them to admit that it was the province of the same person to <lb/>
            know how to write comedy and tragedy, and that he, who was <lb/>
