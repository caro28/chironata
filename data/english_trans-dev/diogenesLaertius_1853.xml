          <p>DIOGENES, the author of the following work, was a native <lb/>
            (as is generally believed) of Laerte, in Cilicia, from which <lb/>
            circumstance he derived the cognomen of Laërtius. Little is <lb/>
            known of him personally, nor is even the age in which he lived <lb/>
            very clearly ascertained. But as Plutarch, Sextus Empiricus, <lb/>
            and Saturninus are among the writers whom he quotes, he is <lb/>
            generally believed to have lived near the end of the second <lb/>
            century of our era: although some place him in the time <lb/>
            of Alexander Severus, and others as late as Constantine. His <lb/>
            work consists of ten books, variously called: The Lives of <lb/>
            Philosophers, A History of Philosophy, and The Lives of <lb/>
            Sophists. From internal evidence (iii. 47, 29), we learn <lb/>
            that he wrote it for a noble lady (according to some, <lb/>
            Arria; according to others, Julia, the Empress of Severus), <lb/>
            who occupied herself with the study of philosophy, and es- <lb/>
            pecially of Plato.</p>
          <p>Diogenes Laërtius divides the philosophy of the Greeks into <lb/>
            the Ionic, beginning with Anaximander, and ending with <lb/>
            Theopbrastus (in which class, he includes the Socratic philo- <lb/>
            sophy and all its various ramifications); and the Italian, <lb/>
            beginning with Pythagoras, and ending with Epicurus, in <lb/>
            which he includes the Eleatics, as also Heraclitus and the <lb/>
            Sceptics. From the minute consideration which he devotes <lb/>
            to Epicurus and his system, it has been supposed that he <lb/>
            himself belonged to that school.</p>
          <p>His work is the chief source of information we possess <note type="footnote">B </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="2"/>
            concerning the history of Greek philosophy, and is the <lb/>
            foundation of nearly all the modern treatises on that sub- <lb/>
            ject; some of the most important of which are little more <lb/>
            than translations or amplifications of it. It is valuable, <lb/>
            as containing a copious collection of anecdotes illustrative of <lb/>
            the life and manners of the Greeks; but he has not always <lb/>
            been very careful in his selection, and in some parts there <lb/>
            is a confusion in his statements that makes them scarcely <lb/>
            intelligible. These faults have led some critics to consider <lb/>
            the work as it now exists merely a mutilated abridgment of the <lb/>
            original. Breslæus, who in the thirteenth century, wrote a <lb/>
            Treatise on the Lives and Manners of the Philosophers, <lb/>
            quotes many anecdotes and sayings, which seem to be de- <lb/>
            rived from Diogenes, but which are not to be found in our <lb/>
            present text; whence Schneider concludes that he had a very <lb/>
            different and far more complete copy than has come down <lb/>
            to us.</p>
          <p>The text used in the following translation is chiefly that of <lb/>
            Huebner, as published at Leipsic, A.D. 1828.</p><pb n="3"/>

          <p>I. SOME say that the study of philosophy originated with <lb/>
            the barbarians. In that among the Persians there existed <lb/>
            the Magi,* and among the Babylonians or Assyrians the <lb/>
            Chaldæi.† among the Indians the Gymnosophistæ,‡ and among <lb/>
            the Celts and Gauls men who were called Druids § and <note type="footnote"> * " The religion of the ancient Persians was the worship of fire or of <lb/>
            the elements, in which fire was symbolical of the Deity. At a later <lb/>
            period, in the time of the Greeks, the ancient worship was changed into <lb/>
            the adoration of the stars (Sabæism), especially of the sun and of the <lb/>
            morning star. This religion was distinguished by a simple and majestic <lb/>
            character. Its priests were called Magi.”—Tenneman’s Manual of the <lb/>
            History of Philosophy, Introd. § 70. </note><note type="footnote"> t " The Chaldeans were devoted to the worship of the stars and to <lb/>
            astrology; the nature of their climate and country disposing them to <lb/>
            it. The worship of the stars was revived by them and widely dissemi- <lb/>
            nated even subsequently to the Christian era.”—Ibid. § 71. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ " Cicero speaks of those who in India are accounted philosophers, <lb/>
            living naked and enduring the greatest severity of winter without be- <lb/>
            traying any feeling of pain, and displaying the same insensibility when <lb/>
            exposed to the flames.”—Tusc. Quœst. v. 27. </note> <lb/>
            § " The religion of the Britons was one of the most considerable <lb/>
            parts of their government, and the Druids who were their priests, pos- <lb/>
            sessed great authority among them. Besides ministering at the altar, <lb/>
            and directing all religious duties, they presided over the education of <lb/>
            youth; they possessed both the civil and criminal jurisdiction, they <lb/>
            decided all controversies among states as well as among private persons, <lb/>
            and whoever refused to submit to their decree was exposed to the most <lb/>
            severe penalties. The sentence of excommunication was pronounced <note type="footnote">B 2</note> <lb/>

            Semnothei, as Aristotle relates in his book on Magic, and <lb/>
            Sotion in the twenty-third book of his Succession of Philoso- <lb/>
            phers. Besides those men there were the Phœnician Ochus, <lb/>
            the Thracian Zamolxis,* and the Libyan Atlas. For the <note type="footnote">against him; he was forbidden access to the sacrifices of public worship; <lb/>
            he was debarred all intercourse with his fellow citizens even in the <lb/>
            common affairs of life : his company was universally shunned as profane <lb/>
            and dangerous, he was refused the protection of law, and death itself <lb/>
            became an acceptable relief from the misery and infamy to which he <lb/>
            was exposed. Thus the bonds of government, which were naturally <lb/>
            loose among that rude and turbulent people, were happily corroborated <lb/>
            by the terrors of their superstition. </note><note type="footnote"> " No species of superstition was ever more terrible than that of the <lb/>
            Druids ; besides the several penalties which it was in the power of the <lb/>
            ecclesiastics to inflict in this world, they inculcated the eternal trans- <lb/>
            migration of souls, and thereby extended their authority as far as the <lb/>
            fears of their timorous votaries. They practised their rites in dark <lb/>
            groves or other secret recesses, and in order to throw a greater mystery <lb/>
            over their religion, they communicated their doctrines only to the <lb/>
            initiated, and strictly forbade the committing of them to writing, lest <lb/>
            they should at any time be exposed to the examination of the profane <lb/>
            and vulgar. Human sacrifices were practised among them; the spoils <lb/>
            of war were often devoted to their divinities, and they punished with <lb/>
            the severest tortures whoever dared to secrete any part of the con- <lb/>
            secrated offering. These treasures they kept secreted in woods and <lb/>
            forests, secured by no other guard than the terrrors of their religion ; <lb/>
            and their steady conquest over human avidity may be regarded as more <lb/>
            signal than their prompting men to the most extraordinary and most <lb/>
            violent efforts. No idolatrous worship ever attained such an ascendant <lb/>
            over mankind as that of the ancient Gauls and Britons. And the <lb/>
            Romans after their conquest, finding it impossible to reconcile those <lb/>
            nations to the laws and institutions of their masters while it maintained <lb/>
            its authority, were at last obliged to abolish it by penal statutes, a <lb/>
            violence which had never in any other instance been resorted to by <lb/>
            those tolerating conquerors.”—Hume’s History of England, chap. 1. § 1. </note><note type="footnote"> * Zamolxis, or Zalmoxis, so called from the bear-skin (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ζάλμος</foreign>)in <lb/>
            which he was wrapped as soon as he was born, was a Getan, and <lb/>
            a slave cf Pythagoras at Samos; having been emancipated by his <lb/>
            master, he travelled into Egypt; and on his return to his own country <lb/>
            he introduced the ideas which he had acquired in his travels on the <lb/>
            subject of civilisation, religion, and the immortality of the soul. He <lb/>
            was made priest of the chief deity among the Getæ, and was afterwards <lb/>
            himself worshipped as a divine person. He was said to have lived in a <lb/>
            subterraneous cavern for three years, and after that to have re-appeared <lb/>
            among his countrymen. Herodotus, however, who records these stories <lb/>
            (iv. 95), expresses his disbelief of them, placing him before the time of <lb/>
            Pythagoras by many years, and seems to incline to the belief that he <lb/>
            was an indigenous Getan deity. </note> <lb/>

            Egyptians say that Vulcan was the son of Nilus, and that <lb/>
            he was the author of philosophy, in which those who were <lb/>
            especially eminent were called his priests and prophets.</p>
          <p>II. From his age to that of Alexander, king of the Mace- <lb/>
            donians were forty-eight thousand eight hundred and sixty- <lb/>
            three years, and during this time there were three hundred <lb/>
            and seventy-three eclipses of the sun, and eight hundred and <lb/>
            thirty-two eclipses of the moon.</p>
          <p>Again, from the time of the Magi, the first of whom was <lb/>
            Zoroaster the Persian, to that of the fall of Troy, Hermodorus <lb/>
            the Platonic philosopher, in his treatise on Mathematics, <lb/>
            calculates that fifteen thousand years elapsed. But Xanthus <lb/>
            the Lydian says that the passage of the Hellespont by <lb/>
            Xerxes took place six thousand years after the time of <lb/>
            Zoroaster,* and that after him there was a regular succession <note type="footnote">* " The real time of Zoroaster is, as may be supposed, very un- <lb/>
            certain, but he is said by some eminent writers to have lived in <lb/>
            the time of Darius Hystaspes; though others, apparently on better <lb/>
            grounds, place him at a very far earlier date. He is not mentioned <lb/>
            by Herodotus at all. His native country too is very uncertain. Some <lb/>
            writers, among whom are Ctesias and Ammian, call him a Bactrian, <lb/>
            while Porphyry speaks of him as a Chaldæan, and Pliny as a native <lb/>
            of Proconnesus ;—Niebuhr considers him a purely mythical per- <lb/>
            sonage. The great and fundamental article of the system (of the <lb/>
            Persian theology) was the celebrated doctrine of the two principles; <lb/>
            a bold and injudicious attempt of Eastern philosophy to reconcile <lb/>
            the existence of moral and physical evil with the attributes of a benefi- <lb/>
            cent Creator and governor of the world. The first and original being, <lb/>
            in whom, or by whom the universe exists, is denominated, in the writ- <lb/>
            ings of Zoroaster, Time without bounds From either the <lb/>
            blind or the intelligent operation of this infinite Time, which bears but <lb/>
            too near an affinity to the Chaos of the Greeks, the two secondary but <lb/>
            active principles of the universe were from all eternity produced; <lb/>
            Ormusd and Ahriman, each of them possessed of the powers of creation, <lb/>
            but each disposed by his invariable nature to exercise them with different <lb/>
            designs ; the principle of good is eternally absorbed in light, the prin- <lb/>
            ciple of evil is eternally buried in darkness. The wise benevolence of <lb/>
            Ormusd formed man capable of virtue, and abundantly provided his <lb/>
            fair habitation with the materials of happiness. By his vigilant provi- <lb/>
            dence the motion of the planets, the order of the seasons, and the <lb/>
            temperate mixture of the elements are preserved. But the maker of <lb/>
            Ahriman has long since pierced Ormusd’s Egg, or in other words, has <lb/>
            violated the harmony of his works. Since that fatal irruption, the most <lb/>
            minute articles of good and evil are intimately intermingled and agitated <lb/>
            together; the rankest poisons spring up among the most salutary <lb/>
            plants; deluges, earthquakes, and conflagrations attest the conflict of </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="6"/>
            of Magi under the names of Ostanes and Astrampsychos and <lb/>
            Gobryas and Pazatas, until the destruction of the Persian <lb/>
            empire by Alexander.</p>
          <p>III. But those who say this, ignorantly impute to the <lb/>
            barbarians the merits of the Greeks, from whom not only <lb/>
            all philosophy, but even the whole human race in reality <lb/>
            originated. For Musæus was born among the Athenians, <lb/>
            and Linus among the Thebaus; and they say that the former, <lb/>
            who was the son of Eumolpus, was the first person who taught <lb/>
            the system of the genealogy of the gods, and who invented <lb/>
            the spheres; and that he taught that all things originated <lb/>
            in one thing, and when dissolved returned to that same thing; <lb/>
            and that he died at Phalerum, and that this epitaph was <lb/>
            inscribed on his tomb: — <lb/>
            Phalerum's soil beneath this tomb contains <lb/>
            Musæus dead, Eumolpus' darling son.</p>
          <p>And it is from the father of Musæus that the family called <lb/>
            Eumolpidæ among the Athenians derive their name. They <lb/>
            say too that Linus was the son of Mercury and the Muse <lb/>
            Urania; and that he invented a system of Cosmogony, and <lb/>
            of the motions of the sun and moon, and of the genera- <lb/>
            tion of animals and fruits; and the following is the be- <lb/>
            ginning of his poem, <lb/>
            There was a time when all the present world <lb/>
            Uprose at once.</p>
          <p>From which Anaxagoras derived his theory, when he said that <note type="footnote"> nature, and the little world of man is perpetually shaken by vice and <lb/>
            misfortune. While the rest of mankind are led away captives in the <lb/>
            chains of their infernal enemy, the faithful Persian alone reserves his <lb/>
            religious adoration for his friend and protector Ormusd, and fights <lb/>
            under his banner of light, in the full confidence that he shall, in the <lb/>
            last day, share the glory of his triumph. At that decisive period, the <lb/>
            enlightened wisdom of goodness will render the power of Ormusd <lb/>
            superior to the furious malice of his rival; Ahriman and his followers, <lb/>
            disarmed and subdued, will sink into their native darkness, and virtue <lb/>
            will maintain the eternal peace and harmony of the universe.... </note><note type="footnote"> .. As a legislator, Zoroaster " discovered a liberal concern for the <lb/>
            public and private happiness seldom to be found among the visionary <lb/>
            schemes of superstition. Fasting and celibacy, the common means of <lb/>
            purchasing the divine favour, he condemns with abhorrence, as a <lb/>
            criminal rejection of the best gifts of Providence.”—Gibbon, Decline <lb/>

            shot with an arrow by Apollo, and that this epitaph was set <lb/>
            over him: — <lb/>
            The Theban Linus sleeps beneath this ground, <lb/>
            Urania's son with fairest garlands crown'd.</p>
          <p>IV. And thus did philosophy arise among the Greeks, and <lb/>
            indeed its very name shows that it has no connection with the <lb/>
            barbarians. But those who attribute its origin to them, intro- <lb/>
            duce Orpheus the Thracian, and say that he was a philosopher, <lb/>
            and the most ancient one of all. But if one ought to call a <lb/>
            man who has said such things about the gods as he has said, a <lb/>
            philosopher, I do not know what name one ought to give to <lb/>
            him who has not scrupled to attribute all sorts of human feel- <lb/>
            ings to the gods, and even such discreditable actions as are but <lb/>
            rarely spoken of among men; and tradition relates that he <lb/>
            was murdered by women ;* but there is an inscription at Dium <lb/>
            in Macedonia, saying that he was killed by lightning, and it <lb/>
            runs thus :— <lb/>
            Here the bard buried by the Muses lies, <lb/>
            The Thracian Orpheus of the golden lyre; <lb/>
            Whom mighty Jove, the Sovereign of the skies, <lb/>
            Removed from earth by his dread lightning’s fire.</p>
          <p>V. But they who say that philosophy had its rise among <lb/>
            the barbarians, give also an account of the different systems <lb/>
            prevailing among the various tribes. And they say that the <lb/>
            Gymnosophists and the Druids philosophize, delivering their <lb/>
            apophthegmns in enigmatical language, bidding men worship <lb/>
            the gods and do no evil, and practise manly virtue. <note type="footnote"> * This is the account given by Virgil- <lb/>

          <p>VI. Accordingly Clitarchus, in his twelfth book, says that <lb/>
            the Gymnosophists despise death, and that the Chaldseans <lb/>
            study astronomy and the science of soothsaying—that the Magi <lb/>
            occupy themselves about the service to be paid to the gods, and <lb/>
            about sacrifices and prayers, as if they were the only people to <lb/>
            whom the deities listen: and that they deliver accounts of the <lb/>
            existence and generation of the gods, saying that they are fire, <lb/>
            and earth, and water; and they condemn the use of images, <lb/>
            and above all things do they condemn those who say that the <lb/>
            gods are male and female ; they speak much of justice, and <lb/>
            think it impious to destroy the bodies of the dead by fire ; they <lb/>
            allow men to marry their mothers or their daughters, as So- <lb/>
            tion tells us in his twenty-third book; they study the arts of <lb/>
            soothsaying and divination, and assert that the gods reveal <lb/>
            their will to them by those sciences. They teach also that the <lb/>
            air is full of phantoms, which, by emanation and a sort of eva- <lb/>
            poration, glide into the sight of those who have a clear percep- <lb/>
            tion ; they forbid any extravagance of ornament, and the use <lb/>
            of gold ; their garments are white, their beds are made of leaves, <lb/>
            and vegetables are their food, with cheese and coarse bread; <lb/>
            they use a rush for a staff, the top of which they run into the <lb/>
            cheese, and so taking up a piece of it they eat it. Of all kinds <lb/>
            of magical divination they are ignorant, as Aristotle asserts in <lb/>
            his book on Magic, and Dinon in the fifth book of his Histories. <lb/>
            And this writer says, that the name of Zoroaster being inter- <lb/>
            preted means, a sacrifice to the stars; and Hermodorus makes <lb/>
            the same statement. But Aristotle, in the first book of his <lb/>
            Treatise on Philosophy, says, that the Magi are more ancient <lb/>
            than the Egyptians; and that according to them there are two <lb/>
            principles, a good demon and an evil demon, and that the <lb/>
            name of the one is Jupiter or Oromasdes, and that of the other <lb/>
            Pluto or Arimanius. And Hermippus gives the same account <lb/>
            in the first book of his History of the Magi; and so does <lb/>
            Eudoxus in his Period; and so does Theopompus in the eighth <lb/>
            book of his History of the Affairs of Philip ; and this last <lb/>
            writer tells us also, that according to the Magi men will have <lb/>
            a resurrection and be immortal, and that what exists now will <lb/>
            exist hereafter under its own present name ; and Eudemus of <lb/>
            Rhodes coincides in this statement. But Hecatæus says, that <lb/>
            according to their doctrines the gods also are beings who have <lb/>
            been born. But Clearchus the Solensian, in his Treatise on <lb/>
             <pb n="9"/>
            Education says, that the Gymnosophists are descendants of the <lb/>
            Magi; and some say that the Jews also are derived from them. <lb/>
            Moreover, those who have written on the subject of the Magi <lb/>
            condemn Herodotus; for they say that Xerxes would never <lb/>
            have shot arrows against the sun, or have put fetters on the <lb/>
            sea, as both sun and sea have been handed down by the Magi <lb/>
            as gods, but that it was quite consistent for Xerxes to destroy <lb/>
            the images of the gods.</p>
          <p>VII. The following is the account that authors give of the <lb/>
            philosophy of the Egyptians, as bearing on the gods and on <lb/>
            justice. They say that the first principle is matter ; then that <lb/>
            the four elements were formed out of matter and divided, and <lb/>
            that some animals were created, and that the sun and moon are <lb/>
            gods, of whom the former is called Osiris and the latter Isis, <lb/>
            and they are symbolised under the names of beetles and <lb/>
            dragons, and hawks, and other animals, as Manetho tells us <lb/>
            in his abridged account of Natural Philosophy, and Hecatæus <lb/>
            confirms the statement in the first book of his History of <lb/>
            the Philosophy of the Egyptians. They also make images of <lb/>
            the gods, and assign them temples because they do not know <lb/>
            the form of God. They consider that the world had a begin- <lb/>
            ning and will have an end, and that it is a sphere ; they think <lb/>
            that the stars are fire, and that it is by" a combination of them <lb/>
            that the things on earth are generated; that the moon is <lb/>
            eclipsed when it falls into the- shadow of the earth ; that the <lb/>
            soul is eternal and migratory; that rain is caused by the changes <lb/>
            of the atmosphere ; and they enter into other speculations on <lb/>
            points of natural history, as Hecatseus and Aristagoras inform <lb/>
            us.</p>
          <p>They also have made laws about justice, which they attribute <lb/>
            to Mercury, and they consider those animals which are useful <lb/>
            to be gods. They claim to themselves the merit of having <lb/>
            been the inventors of geometry, and astrology, and arithmetic. <lb/>
            So much then for the subject of invention.</p>
          <p>VIII. But Pythagoras was the first person who invented the <lb/>
            term Philosophy, and who called himself a philosopher; when <lb/>
            he was conversing at Sicyon with Leon, who was tyrant of the <lb/>
            Sicyonians or of the Phliasians (as Heraclides Ponticus relates <lb/>
            in the book which he wrote about a dead woman) ; for he said <lb/>
            that no man ought to be called wise, but only God. For for- <lb/>
            merly what is now called philosophy (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ϕιλοσοϕία</foreign>) was called <lb/>
             <pb n="10"/>
            wisdom (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σοϕία</foreign>), and they who professed it were called wise men <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σοϕοί</foreign>), as being endowed with great acuteness and accuracy of <lb/>
            mind ; but now he who embraces wisdom is called a philosopher <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ϕιλόσοϕος</foreign>.)</p>
          <p>But the wise men were also called Sophists. And not <lb/>
            only they, but poets also were called Sophists : as Cratinus in <lb/>
            his Archilochi calls Homer and Hesiod, while praising them <lb/>
            highly.</p>
          <p>IX. Now these were they who were accounted wise men. <lb/>
            Thales, Solon, Periander, Cleobulus, Chilo, Bias, Pittacus. <lb/>
            To these men add Anacharsis the Scythian, Myson the <lb/>
            Chenean, Pherecydes the Syrian, and Epimenides the Cretan ; <lb/>
            and some add, Pisistratus, the tyrant: These then are they <lb/>
            who were called the wise men.</p>
          <p>X. But of Philosophy there arose two schools. One de- <lb/>
            rived from Anaximander, the other from Pythagoras. Now, <lb/>
            Tbales had been the preceptor of Anaximander, and Phere- <lb/>
            cydes of Pythagoras. And the one school was called the <lb/>
            Ionian, because Thales, being an Ionian (for he was a native <lb/>
            of Miletus), had been the tutor of Anaximander;—but <lb/>
            the other was called the Italian from Pythagoras, because he <lb/>
            spent the chief part of his life in Italy. And the Ionic <lb/>
            school ends with Clitomachus, and Chrysippus, and Theo- <lb/>
            phrastus ; and the Italian one with Epicurus ; for Anaxi- <lb/>
            mander succeeded Thales, and he was succeeded again by <lb/>
            Anaximenes, and he by Anaxagoras, and he by Archelaus, <lb/>
            who was the master of Socrates, who was the originator of <lb/>
            moral philosophy. And he was the master of the sect of the <lb/>
            Socratic philosophers, and of Plato, who was the founder of <lb/>
            the old Academy; and Plato's pupils were Speusippus and <lb/>
            Xenocrates; and Polemo was the pupil of Xenocrates, <lb/>
            and Crantor and Crates of Polemo. Crates again was the <lb/>
            master of Arcesilaus, the founder of the Middle Academy, <lb/>
            and his pupil was Lacydes, who gave the new Academy <lb/>
            its distinctive principles. His pupil was Carneades, and he <lb/>
            in his turn was the master of Clitomachus. And this school; <lb/>
            ends in this way with Clitomachus and Chrysippus.</p>
          <p>Antisthenes was the pupil of Socrates, and the master of <lb/>
            Diogenes the Cynic ; and the pupil of Diogenes was Crates <lb/>
            the Theban; Zeno the Cittiæan was his; Cleanthes was his ; <lb/>
            Chrysippus was his. Again it ends with Theophrastus in <lb/>
            the following manner :-</p><pb n="11"/>
            
          <p>Aristotle was the pupil of Plato, Theophrastus the pupil <lb/>
            of Aristotle; and in this way the Ionian school comes to <lb/>
            an end.</p>
          <p>Now the Italian school was carried on in this way. <lb/>
            Pythagoras was the pupil of Pherecydes; his pupil was <lb/>
            Telauges his son; he was the master of Xenophanes, and he <lb/>
            of Parmenides; Parmenides of Zeno the Eleatic, he of <lb/>
            Leucippus, he of Democritus : Democritus had many disciples, <lb/>
            the most eminent of whom were Nausiphanes and Nausicydes, <lb/>
            and they were the masters of Epicurus.</p>
          <p>XI. Now, of Philosophers some were dogmatic, and others <lb/>
            were inclined to suspend their opinions. By dogmatic, I <lb/>
            mean those who explain their opinions about matters, as if <lb/>
            they could be comprehended. By those who suspend their <lb/>
            opinions, I mean those who give no positive judgment, think- <lb/>
            ing that these things cannot be comprehended. And the <lb/>
            former class have left many memorials of themselves; <lb/>
            but the others have never written a line ; as for in- <lb/>
            stance, according to some people, Socrates, and Stilpo, and <lb/>
            Philippus, and Menedemus, and Pyrrho, and Theodorus, and <lb/>
            Carneades, and Bryson ; and, as some people say, Pythagoras, <lb/>
            and Aristo of Chios, except that he wrote a few letters. There <lb/>
            are some men too who have written one work only, Melissus, <lb/>
            Parmenides, and Anaxagoras ; but Zeno wrote many works, <lb/>
            Xenophanes still more; Democritus more, Aristotle more, <lb/>
            Epicurus more, and Chrysippus more.</p>
          <p>XII. Again, of philosophers some derived a surname from <lb/>
            cities, as, the Elians, and Megaric sect, the Eretrians, and <lb/>
            the Cyrenaics. Some from the places which they frequented, <lb/>
            as the Academics and Stoics. Some from accidental circum- <lb/>
            stances, as the Peripatetics; or, from jests, as the Cynics. <lb/>
            Some again from their dispositions, as the Eudæmonics ; some <lb/>
            from an opinion, as the Elenctic, and Analogical schools. <lb/>
            Some from their masters, as the Socratic and Epicurean phi- <lb/>
            losophers; and so on. The Natural Philosophers were so <lb/>
            called from their study of nature; the Ethical philosophers <lb/>
            from their investigation of questions of morals (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πεϱὶ τὰ ἔθη</foreign>). <lb/>
            The Dialecticians are they who devote themselves to quibbling <lb/>
            on words.</p>
          <p>XIII. Now there are three divisions of philosophy. <lb/>
            Natural, Ethical, and Dialectic. Natural philosophy occupies <lb/>
             <pb n="12"/>
            itself about the world and the things in it; Ethical philosophy <lb/>
            about life, and the things which concern us; Dialectics are <lb/>
            conversant with the arguments by which both the others are <lb/>
            supported.</p>
          <p>Natural philosophy prevailed till the time of Archelaus; <lb/>
            but after the time of Socrates, Ethical philosophy was pre- <lb/>
            dominant ; and after the time of Zeno the Eleatic, Dialectic <lb/>
            philosophy got the upper hand.</p>
          <p>Ethical philosophy was subdivided into ten sects; the <lb/>
            Academic, the Cyrenaic, the Elian, the Megaric, the Cynic, <lb/>
            the Eretrian, the Dialectic, the Peripatetic, the Stoic, and <lb/>
            the Epicurean. Of the old Academic school Plato was the <lb/>
            president; of the middle, Arcesilaus; and of the New, <lb/>
            Lacydes:—the Cyrenaic school was founded by Aristippus the <lb/>
            Cyrenian; the Elian, by Phasdo, of Elis ; the Megaric, by <lb/>
            Euclid, of Megara ; the Cynic, by Antisthenes, the Athenian ; <lb/>
            the Eretrian, by Menedemus, of Eretria; the Dialectic by <lb/>
            Clitomachus, the Carthaginian ; the Peripatetic, by Aristotle, <lb/>
            the Stagirite; the Stoic, by Zeno, the Cittiæan ; the Epicurean <lb/>
            school derives its name from Epicurus, its founder.</p>
          <p>But Hippobotus, in his Treatise on Sects, says that there <lb/>
            are nine sects and schools : first, the Megaric ; secondly, the <lb/>
            Eretrian; thirdly, the Cyrenaic; fourthly, the Epicurean; <lb/>
            fifthly, the Annicerean; sixthly, the Theodorean; seventhly, <lb/>
            the sect of Zeno and the Stoics; eighthly, that of the Old <lb/>
            Academy; and ninthly, the Peripatetic ;-not counting <lb/>
            either the Cynic, or the Eliac, or the Dialectic school. That <lb/>
            also which is called the Pyhrronean is repudiated by many <lb/>
            writers, on account of the obscurity of its principles. But <lb/>
            others consider that in some particulars it is a distinct sect, <lb/>
            and in others not. For it does appear to be a sect-for what <lb/>
            we call a sect, say they, is one which follows, or appears to <lb/>
            follow, a principle which appears to it to be the true one; on <lb/>
            which principle we correctly call the Sceptics a sect. But if <lb/>
            by the name sect we understand those who incline to rules <lb/>
            which are consistent with the principles which they profess, <lb/>
            then the Pyrrhonean cannot be called a sect, for they have no <lb/>
            rules or principles.</p>
          <p>These, then, are the beginnings, these are the successive <lb/>
            masters, these are the divisions, and schools of philosophy.</p>
          <p>XIV. Moreover, it is not long ago, that a new Eclectic <lb/>
             <pb n="13"/>
            school was set up by Potamo, of Alexandria, who picked out <lb/>
            of the doctrines of each school what pleased him most. And <lb/>
            as he himself says, in his Elementary Instruction, he thinks <lb/>
            that there are certain criteria of truth : first of all the faculty <lb/>
            which judges, and this is the superior one; the other that <lb/>
            which is the foundation of the judgment, being a most <lb/>
            exact appearance of the objects. And the first principles of <lb/>
            everything he calls matter, and the agent, and the quality, and <lb/>
            the place. For they show out of what, and by what, and <lb/>
            how, and where anything is done. The end is that to which <lb/>
            everything is referred ; namely, a life made perfect with every <lb/>
            virtue, not without the natural and external qualities of the <lb/>
            body.</p>
          <p>But we must now speak of the men themselves ; and first <lb/>
            of all about Thales.</p><pb n="14"/>
            
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF THALES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. THALES, then, as Herodotus and Duris and Democritus <lb/>
            say, was the son of Euxamius and Cleobule; of the family of <lb/>
            the Thelidæ, who are Phœnicians by descent, among the <lb/>
            most noble of all the descendants of Cadmus and Agenor, as <lb/>
            Plato testifies. And he was the first man to whom the name <lb/>
            of Wise was given, when Damasius was Archon at Athens, in <lb/>
            whose time also the seven wise men had that title given to <lb/>
            them, as Demetrius Phalereus records in his Catalogue of the <lb/>
            Archons. He was enrolled as a citizen at Miletus when <lb/>
            he came thither with Neleus, who had been banished from <lb/>
            Phœnicia ; but a more common statement is that he was a <lb/>
            native Milesian, of noble extraction.</p>
          <p>II. After having been immersed in state affairs he <lb/>
            applied himself to speculations in natural philosophy; <lb/>
            though, as some people state, he left no writings behind him, <lb/>
            For the book on Naval Astronomy, which is attributed to him <lb/>
            is said in reality to be the work of Focus the Samian. But <lb/>
            Callimachus was aware that he was the discoverer of the Lesser <lb/>
            Bear ; for in his Iambics he speaks of him thus : <lb/>
            And, he, 'tis said, did first compute the stars <lb/>
            Which beam in Charles's wain, and guide the bark <lb/>
            Of the Phœnician sailor o'er the sea.</p>
          <p>According to others he wrote two books, and no more, <lb/>
            about the solstice and the equinox ; thinking that everything <lb/>
            else was easily to be comprehended. According to other <lb/>
            statements, he is said to have been the first who studied <lb/>
            astronomy, and who foretold the eclipses and motions of the <lb/>
            sun, as Eudemus relates in his history of the discoveries <lb/>
            made in astronomy; on which account Xenophanes and <lb/>
            Herodotus praise him greatly; and Heraclitus and De- <lb/>
            mocritus confirm this statement.</p>
          <p>III. Some again (one of whom is Chærilus the poet) say <lb/>
            that he was the first person who affirmed that the souls of <lb/>
            men were immortal; and he was the first person, too, who <lb/>
             <pb n="15"/>
            discovered the path of the sun from one end of the ecliptic to <lb/>
            the other; and who, as one account tells us, defined the <lb/>
            magnitude of the sun as being seven hundred and twenty <lb/>
            times as great as that of the moon. He was also the first <lb/>
            person who called the last day of the month the thirtieth. <lb/>
            And likewise the first to converse about natural philosophy, as <lb/>
            some say. But Aristotle and Hippias say that he attributed <lb/>
            souls also to lifeless things, forming his conjecture from the <lb/>
            nature of the magnet, and of amber. And Pamphile relates <lb/>
            that he, having learnt geometry from the Egyptians, was the <lb/>
            first person to describe a right-angled triangle in a circle, and <lb/>
            that he sacrificed an ox in honour of his discovery. But others, <lb/>
            among whom is Apollodorus the calculator, say that it was <lb/>
            Pythagoras who made this discovery. It was Thales also who <lb/>
            carried to their greatest point of advancement the discoveries <lb/>
            which Callimachus in his iambics says were first made by Eu- <lb/>
            phebus the Phrygian, such as those of the scalene angle, and of <lb/>
            the triangle, and of other things which relate to investigations <lb/>
            about lines. He seems also to have been a man of the greatest <lb/>
            wisdom in political matters. For when Crcesus sent to the <lb/>
            Milesians to invite them to an alliance, he prevented them <lb/>
            from agreeing to it, which step of his, as Cyrus got the victory, <lb/>
            proved the salvation of the city. But Clytus relates, as <lb/>
            Heraclides assures us, that he was attached to a solitary and <lb/>
            recluse life.</p>
          <p>IV. Some assert that he was married, and that he had a <lb/>
            son named Cibissus; others, on the contrary, say that he <lb/>
            never had a wife, but that he adopted the son of his sister ; <lb/>
            and that once being asked why he did not himself become a <lb/>
            father, he answered, that it was because he was fond of chil- <lb/>
            dren. They say, too, that when his mother exhorted him to <lb/>
            marry, he said, " No, by Jove, it is not yet time." And <lb/>
            afterwards, when he was past his youth, and she was again <lb/>
            pressing him earnestly, he said, " It is no longer time."</p>
          <p>V. Hieronvmus, of Rhodes, also tells us, in the second <lb/>
            book of his Miscellaneous Memoranda, that when he was <lb/>
            desirous to show that it was easy to get rich, he, foreseeing <lb/>
            that there would be a great crop of olives, took some large <lb/>
            plantations of olive trees, and so made a great deal of <lb/>
            money.</p>
          <p>VI. He asserted water to be the principle of all things, <lb/>
             <pb n="16"/>
            and that the world had life, and was full of daemons : they <lb/>
            say, too, that he was the original definer of the seasons of the <lb/>
            year, and that it was he who divided the year into three <lb/>
            hundred and sixty-five days. And he never had any teacher <lb/>
            except during the time that he went to Egypt, and associated <lb/>
            with the priests. Hieronymus also says that he measured the <lb/>
            Pyramids : watching their shadow, and calculating when they <lb/>
            were of the same size as that was. He lived with Thrasy- <lb/>
            bulus the tyrant of Miletus, as we are informed by Minyas.</p>
          <p>VII. Now it is known to every one what happened with <lb/>
            respect to the tripod that was found by the fishermen and <lb/>
            sent to the wise men by the people of the Milesians. For <lb/>
            they say that some Ionian youths bought a cast of their net <lb/>
            from some Milesian fishermen. And when the tripod was <lb/>
            drawn up in the net there was a dispute about it; until <lb/>
            the Milesians sent to Delphi: and the God gave them the <lb/>
            following answer :- <lb/>
            You ask about the tripod, to whom you shall present it; <lb/>
            'Tis for the wisest, I reply, that fortune surely meant it.</p>
          <p>Accordingly they gave it to Thales, and he gave it to some <lb/>
            one, who again handed it over to another, till it came to <lb/>
            Solon. But he said that it was the God himself who <lb/>
            was the first in wisdom; and so he sent it to Delphi. But <lb/>
            Callimachus gives a different account of this in his Iambics, <lb/>
            taking the tradition which he mentions from Leander the <lb/>
            Milesian; for he says that a certain Arcadian of the name of <lb/>
            Bathydes, when dying, left a goblet behind him with an injunc- <lb/>
            tion that it should be given to the first of the wise men. And <lb/>
            it was given to Thales, and went the whole circle till it came <lb/>
            back to Thales, on which he sent it to Apollo Didymæus, adding <lb/>
            (according to Callimachus,) the following distich:- <lb/>
            Thales, who's twice received me as a prize, <lb/>
            Gives me to him who rules the race of Neleus.</p>
          <p>And the prose inscription runs thus — <lb/>
            Thales the son of Examius, a Milesiam, offers this to Apollo Didy- <lb/>
            mæus, having twice received it from the Greeks as the reward for <lb/>
            virtue.</p>
          <p>And the name of the son of Bathydes who carried the goblet <lb/>
             <pb n="17"/>
            about from one to the other, was Thyrion, as Eleusis tells <lb/>
            us in his History of Achilles. And Alexander the Myndian <lb/>
            agrees with him in the ninth book of his Traditions. But <lb/>
            Eudoxus of Cnidos, and Evanthes of Miletus, say that one of <lb/>
            the friends of Crœsus received from the king a golden goblet, <lb/>
            for the purpose of giving it to the wisest of the Greeks; and <lb/>
            that he gave it to Thales, and that it came round to Chilo, and <lb/>
            that he inquired of the God at Delphi who was wiser than him- <lb/>
            self ; and that the God replied, Myson, whom we shall mention <lb/>
            hereafter. (He is the man whom Eudoxus places among the <lb/>
            seven wise men instead of Cleobulus ; but Plato inserts his <lb/>
            name instead of Periander.) The God accordingly made this <lb/>
            reply concerning him:— <lb/>
            I say that Myson, the Ætœan sage, <lb/>
            The citizen of Chen, is wiser far <lb/>
            In his deep mind than you.</p>
          <p>The person who went to the temple to ask the question was <lb/>
            Anacharsis ; but again Dsedacus, the Platonic philosopher, <lb/>
            and Clearchus, state that the goblet was sent by Crcesus to <lb/>
            Pittacus, and so was carried round to the different men. <lb/>
            But Andron, in his book called The Tripod, says that the <lb/>
            Argives offered the tripod as a prize for excellence to the wisest <lb/>
            of the Greeks; and that Aristodemus, a Spartan, was judged <lb/>
            to deserve it, but that he yielded the palm to Chilo; and <lb/>
            Alcæus mentions Aristodemus in these lines :— <lb/>
            And so they say Aristodemus once <lb/>
            Uttered a truthful speech in noble Sparta : <lb/>
            'Tis money makes the man; and he who's none, <lb/>
            Is counted neither good nor honourable.</p>
          <p>But some say that a vessel fully loaded was sent by Periander <lb/>
            to Thrasybulus the tyrant of the Milesians; and that as the <lb/>
            ship was wrecked in the sea, near the island of Cos, this tri- <lb/>
            pod was afterwards found by some fishermen. Phanodicus <lb/>
            says that it was found in the sea near Athens, and so brought <lb/>
            into the city; and then, after an assembly had been held to <lb/>
            decide on the disposal, it was sent to Bias-and the reason <lb/>
            why we will mention in our account of Bias. Others say that <lb/>
            this goblet had been made by Vulcan, and presented by the <lb/>
            Gods to Pelops, on his marriage ; and that subsequently it.came <lb/>
            into the possession of Menelaus, and was taken away by Paris <note type="footnote"> c </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="18"/>
            when he carried off Helen, and was thrown into the sea near <lb/>
            Cos by her, as she said that it would become a cause of battle. <lb/>
            And after some time, some of the citizens of Lebedos having <lb/>
            bought a net, this tripod was brought up in it; and as they <lb/>
            quarrelled with the fishermen about it, they went to Cos; and <lb/>
            not being able to get the matter settled there, they laid it before <lb/>
            the Milesians, as Miletus was their metropolis ; and they sent <lb/>
            ambassadors, who were treated with neglect, on which account <lb/>
            they made war on the Coans ; and after each side had met with <lb/>
            many revolutions of fortune, an oracle directed that the tripod <lb/>
            should be given to the wisest; and then both parties agreed <lb/>
            that it belonged to Thales : and he, after it had gone the <lb/>
            circuit of all the wise men, presented it to the Didymæan <lb/>
            Apollo. Now, the assignation of the oracle was given to the <lb/>
            Coans in the following words :— <lb/>
            The war between the brave Ionian race <lb/>
            And the proud Meropes will never cease, <lb/>
            Till the rich golden tripod which the God, <lb/>
            Its maker, cast beneath the briny waves, <lb/>
            Is from your city sent, and justly given <lb/>
            To that wise being who knows all present things, <lb/>
            And all that's past, and all that is to come.</p>
          <p>And the reply given to the Milesians was- <lb/>
            You ask about the tripod : <lb/>
            and so on, as I have related it before. And now we have said <lb/>
            enough on this subject.</p>
          <p>But Hermippus, in his Lives, refers to Thales what has <lb/>
            been by some people reported of Socrates; for he recites that <lb/>
            he used to say that he thanked fortune for three things :—first <lb/>
            of all, that he had been born a man and not a beast; secondly, <lb/>
            that he was a man and not a woman ; and thirdly, that he was <lb/>
            a Greek and not a barbarian.</p>
          <p>VIII. It is said that once he was led out of his house by an <lb/>
            old woman for the purpose of observing the stars, and he fell <lb/>
            into a ditch and bewailed himself, on which the old woman <lb/>
            said to him—“ Do you, 0 Thales, who cannot see what is <lb/>
            under your feet, think that you shall understand what is in <lb/>
            heaven ?" Timon also knew that he was an astronomer, and <lb/>
            in his Silli he praises him, saying:- <lb/>
             <pb n="19"/>
            Like Thales, wisest of the seven sages, <lb/>
            That great astronomer.</p>
          <p>And Lobon, of Argos, says, that which was written by him ex- <lb/>
            tends to about two hundred verses; and that the following <lb/>
            inscription is engraved upon his statue <lb/>
            Miletus, fairest of Ionian cities, <lb/>
            Gave birth to Thales, great astronomer, <lb/>
            Wisest of mortals in all kinds of knowledge.</p>
          <p>IX. And these are quoted as some of his lines :— <lb/>
            It is not many words that real wisdom proves; <lb/>
            Breathe rather one wise thought, <lb/>
            Select one worthy object, <lb/>
            So shall you best the endless prate of silly men reprove.-</p>
          <p>And the following are quoted as sayings of his :—" God is the <lb/>
            most ancient of all things, for he had no birth: the world is the <lb/>
            most beautiful of things, for it is the work of God : place is <lb/>
            the greatest of things, for it contains all things : intellect is the <lb/>
            swiftest of things, for it runs through everything: necessity <lb/>
            is the strongest of things, for it rules everything : time is the <lb/>
            wisest of things, for it finds out everything."</p>
          <p>He said also that there was no difference between life and <lb/>
            death. " Why, then," said some one to him, " do not you <lb/>
            die ?” "Because," said he, "it does make no difference." <lb/>
            A man asked him which was made first, night or day, and he <lb/>
            replied, " Night was made first by one day." Another man <lb/>
            asked him whether a man who did wrong, could escape the <lb/>
            notice of the Gods. " No, not even if he thinks wrong," said <lb/>
            he. An adulterer inquired of him whether he should swear that <lb/>
            he had not committed adultery. " Perjury,” said he, "is no <lb/>
            worse than adultery." When he was asked what was very <lb/>
            difficult, he said, " To know one's self." And what was easy, <lb/>
            " To advise another." What was most pleasant ? “To be <lb/>
            successful." To the question, " What is the divinity ?” he re- <lb/>
            plied, " That which has neither beginning nor end." When <lb/>
            asked what hard thing he had seen, he said, " An old man a <lb/>
            tyrant." When the question was put to him how a man might <lb/>
            most easily endure misfortune, he said, " If he saw his enemies <lb/>
            more unfortunate still." When asked how men might live <lb/>
            most virtuously and most justly, he said, "If we never do our- <lb/>
            selves what we blame in others." To the question, " Who was <note type="footnote"> c 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="20"/>
            happy ?" he made answer, " He who is healthy in his body, easy <lb/>
            in his circumstances, and well-instructed as to his mind." He <lb/>
            said that men ought to remember those friends who were <lb/>
            absent as well as those who were present, and not to care about <lb/>
            adorning their faces, but to be beautified by their studies. " Do <lb/>
            not," said he, " get rich by evil actions, and let not any one <lb/>
            ever be able to reproach you with speaking against those <lb/>
            who partake of your friendship. All the assistance that you <lb/>
            give to your parents, the same you have a right to expect from <lb/>
            your children." He said that the reason of the Nile over- <lb/>
            flowing was, that its streams were beaten back by the Etesian <lb/>
            winds blowing in a contrary direction.</p>
          <p>X. Apollodorus, in his Chronicles, says, that. Thales was <lb/>
            born in the first year of the thirty-fifth Olympiad ; and he <lb/>
            died at the age of seventy-eight years, or according to the <lb/>
            statement of Sosicrates, at the age of ninety, for he died in the <lb/>
            fifty-eighth Olympiad, having lived in the time of Crœsus, to <lb/>
            whom he promised that he would enable him to pass the Halys <lb/>
            without a bridge, by turning the course of the river.</p>
          <p>XI. There have also been other men of the name of Thales, <lb/>
            as Demetrius of Magnesia says, in his Treatise on People and <lb/>
            Things of the same name; of whom five are particularly <lb/>
            mentioned, an orator of Calatia of a very affected style of <lb/>
            eloquence; a painter of S icy on, a great man; the third was <lb/>
            one who lived in very ancient times, in the age of Homer and <lb/>
            Hesiod and Lycurgus ; the fourth is a man who is mentioned <lb/>
            by Duns in his work on Painting; the fifth is a more modern! <lb/>
            person, of no great reputation, who is mentioned by Dionysius <lb/>
            in his Criticisms.</p>
          <p>XII. But this wise Thales died while present as a spectator <lb/>
            at a gymnastic contest, being worn out with heat and thirst and <lb/>
            weakness, for he was very old, and the following inscription <lb/>
            was placed on his tomb : — <lb/>
            You see this tomb is small-but recollect, <lb/>
            The fame of Thales reaches to the skies.</p>
          <p>I have also myself composed this epigram on him in the firs <lb/>
            book of my epigrams or poems in various metres: — <lb/>
            0 mighty sun, our wisest Thales sat <lb/>
            Spectator of the games, when you did seize upon him; <lb/>
            But you were right to take him near yourself, <lb/>
            Now that his aged sight could scarcely reach to heaven.</p><pb n="21"/>
            
          <p>XIII. The apophthegm, "know yourself," is his; though <lb/>
            Antisthenes in his Successions, says that it belongs to <lb/>
            Phemonoe, but that Chilo appropriated it as his own.</p>
          <p>XIV. Now concerning the seven, (for it is well here to <lb/>
            speak of them all together,) the following traditions are handed <lb/>
            down. Damon the Cyrenæan, who wrote about the philosophers, <lb/>
            reproaches them all, but most especially the seven. And <lb/>
            Anaximenes says, that they all applied themselves to poetry, <lb/>
            But Dicæarchus says, that they were neither wise men nor <lb/>
            philosophers, but merely shrewd men, who had studied <lb/>
            legislation. And Archetimus, the Syracusian, wrote an account <lb/>
            of their having a meeting at the palace of Cypselus, at which <lb/>
            he says that he himself was present. Ephorus says that they <lb/>
            all except Thales met at the court of Crœsus. And some say <lb/>
            that they also met at the Pandionium,* and at Corinth, and <lb/>
            at Delphi. There is a good deal of disagreement between <lb/>
            different writers with respect to their apophthegms, as the <lb/>
            same one is attributed by them to various authors. For <lb/>
            instance there is the epigram: — <lb/>
            Chilo, the Spartan sage, this sentence said : <lb/>
            Seek no excess-all timely things are good.</p>
          <p>There is also a difference of opinion with respect to their <lb/>
            number. Leander inserts in the number instead of Cleobulus <lb/>
            and Myson, Leophantus Gorsias, a native of either Lebedos or <lb/>
            Ephesus; and Epimenides, the Cretan; Plato, in his Protagoras, <lb/>
            reckons Myson among them instead of Periander. And <lb/>
            Ephorus mentions Anacharsis in the place of Myson; some <lb/>
            also add Pythagoras to the number. Dicaearchus speaks of <lb/>
            four, as universally agreed upon, Thales, Bias, Pittacus, and <lb/>
            Solon; and then enumerates six more, of whom we are to <lb/>
            select three, namely, Aristodemus, Pamphilus, Chilo the <lb/>
            Lacedaemonian, Cleobulus, Anacharsis, and Periander. Some <lb/>
            add Acusilaus of Argos, the son of Cabas, or Scabras. But <lb/>
            Hermippus, in his Treatise on the Wise Men says that there <lb/>
            were altogether seventeen, out of whom different authors <lb/>
            selected different individuals to make up the seven. These <lb/>
            seventeen were Solon, Thales, Pittacus, Bias, Chilo, Myson, <note type="footnote"> * This was the temple of the national diety of the Ionians, Neptune <lb/>

            Cleobulus, Periander, Anacharsis, Acusilaus, Epimenides, <lb/>

            son of Charmantides, or Sisymbrinus, or as Aristoxenus calls <lb/>
            him the son of Chabrinus, a citizen of Hermione, and Anaxa- <lb/>
            goras. But Hippobotus in his Description of the Philoso- <lb/>

          <p>I hear that you are disposed, as no other Ionian has been, <lb/>
            to discourse to the Greeks about divine things, and perhaps it <lb/>
            will be wiser of you to reserve for your own friends what you <lb/>
            write rather than to entrust it to any chance people, without <lb/>
            any advantage. If therefore it is agreeable to you, I should <lb/>
            be glad to become a pupil of yours as to the matters about <lb/>
            which you write; and if you invite me I will come to you to <lb/>
            Syros; for Solon' the Athenian' and I must be out of our <lb/>
            senses if we sailed to Crete to investigate the history of that <lb/>
            country, and to Egypt for the purpose of conferring with the <lb/>

            more suitably than anywhere else, for here there are no <lb/>
            annoyances of any kind. And if you are indignant because we <lb/>
            Milesians are governed by a tyrant, (for you yourself hate all <lb/>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF SOLON.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. SOLON the son of Execestides, a native of Salamis, was <lb/>
            the first person who introduced among the Athenians, an <lb/>
            ordinance for the lowering * of debts ; for this was the name <lb/>
            given to the release of the bodies and possessions of the <lb/>
            debtors. For men used to borrow on the security of their <lb/>
            own persons, and many became slaves in consequence of their <lb/>
            inability to pay; and as seven talents were owed to him as a <lb/>
            part of his paternal inheritance when he succeeded to it, he <lb/>
            was the first person who made a composition with his debtors, <lb/>
            and who exhorted the other men who had money owing to <lb/>
            them to do likewise, and this ordinance was called (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σεισάχθεια</foreign>; <lb/>
            and the reason why is plain. After that he enacted his other <lb/>
            laws, which it would take a long time to enumerate; and he <lb/>
            wrote them on wooden revolving tablets.</p>
          <p>II. But what was his most important act of all was, when <lb/>
            there had been a great dispute about his native land Salamis, <lb/>
            between the Athenians and Megarians, and when the Athenians <lb/>
            had met with many disasters in war, and had passed a decree <lb/>
            that if any one proposed to the people to go to war for the <lb/>
            sake of Salamis he should be punished with death, he then <lb/>
            pretended to be mad and putting on a crown rushed into the <lb/>
            market place, and there he recited to the Athenians by the <lb/>
            agency of a crier, the elegies which he had composed, and <lb/>
            which were all directed to the subject of Salamis, and by these <lb/>
            means he excited them; and so they made war again upon the <lb/>
            Megarians and conquered them by means of Solon. And the <lb/>
            elegies which had the greatest influence on the Athenians were <lb/>
            these: — <lb/>
            Would that I were a man of Pholegandros,t <lb/>
            Or small Sicinna,‡ rather than of Athens : <note type="footnote"> * Vide Thirlwall, Hist. of Greece, ii. p. 34. t One of the Sporades. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡An island near Crete. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="24"/>
            For soon this will a common proverb be, <lb/>
            That's an Athenian who won't fight for Salamis.</p>
          <p>And another was: — <lb/>
            Let's go and fight for lovely Salamis, <lb/>
            And wipe off this our present infamy.</p>
          <p>He also persuaded them to take possession of the Thracian <lb/>
            Chersonesus, and in order that it might appear that the Athenians <lb/>
            had got possession of Salamis not by force alone, but also with <lb/>
            justice, he opened some tombs, and showed that the corpses <lb/>
            buried in them were all turned towards the east, according to <lb/>
            the Athenian fashion of sepulture; likewise the tombs them- <lb/>
            selves all looked east, and the titles of the boroughs to which <lb/>
            the dead belonged were inscribed on them, which was a custom <lb/>
            peculiar to the Athenians. Some also say that it was he who <lb/>
            added to the catalogue of Homer, after the lines: — <lb/>
            With these appear the Salaminian bands, <lb/>
            Whom Telamon’s gigantic son commands-</p>
          <p>These other verses: — <lb/>
            In twelve black ships to Troy they steer their course, <lb/>
            And with the great Athenians join their force.*</p>
          <p>III. And ever after this time the people was willingly <lb/>
            obedient to him, and was contented to be governed by him; <lb/>
            but he did not choose to be their ruler, and moreover, as <lb/>
            Sosicrates relates, he, as far as in him lay, hindered also his <lb/>
            relative Pisistratus from being so, when he saw that he was <lb/>
            inclined to such a step. Rushing into one of the assemblies <lb/>
            armed with a spear and shield, he forewarned the people of <lb/>
            the design of Pisistratus, and not only that but told them that <lb/>
            he was prepared to assist them; and these were his words: <lb/>
            " Ye men of Athens, I am wiser than some of you, and <lb/>
            braver than others. Wiser than those of you who do not per- <lb/>
            ceive the treachery of Pisistratus; and braver than those who <lb/>
            are aware of it, but out of fear hold their peace." But the <lb/>
            council, being in the interest of Pisistratus, said that he was <lb/>
            mad, on which he spoke as follows: —— <lb/>
            A short time will to all my madness prove, <lb/>
            When stern reality presents itself. <note type="footnote"> * Horn. II. 2. 671. Dryden's Version. </note> <pb n="25"/>
            </p>
          <p>And these elegiac verses were written by him about the I <lb/>
            tyranny of Pisistratus, which he foretold, <lb/>
            Fierce snow and hail are from the clouds borne down, <lb/>
            And thunder after brilliant lightning roars; <lb/>
            And by its own great men a city falls, <lb/>
            The ignorant mob becoming slaves to kings.</p>
          <p>IV. And when Pisistratus had obtained the supreme power, <lb/>
            he, as he would not influence him, laid down his arms before <lb/>
            the chief council-house, and said, " 0 my country, I have stood <lb/>
            by you in word and deed." And then he sailed away to <lb/>
            Egypt, and Cyprus, and came to Croesus. And while at his <lb/>
            court being asked by him, " Who appears to you to be happy?"* <lb/>
            He replied, "Tellus the Athenian, and Cleobis and Biton," <lb/>
            and enumerated other commonly spoken of instances. But <lb/>
            some people say, that once Crœsus adorned himself in every <lb/>
            possible manner, and took his seat upon his throne, and then <lb/>
            asked Solon whether he had ever seen a more beautiful sight. <lb/>
            But he said, "Yes, I have seen cocks and pheasants, and <lb/>
            peacocks ; for they are adorned with natural colours, and such <lb/>
            as are ten thousand times more beautiful." Afterwards leav- <lb/>
            ing Sardis he went to Cilicia, and there he founded a city <lb/>
            which he called Soli after his own name; and he placed in it a <lb/>
            few Athenians as colonists, who in time departed from the <lb/>
            strict use of their native language, and were said to speak <lb/>
            Solecisms; and the inhabitants of that city are called Solen- <lb/>
            sians; but those of Soli in Cyprus are called Solians.</p>
          <p>V. And when he learnt that Pisistratus continued to rule in <lb/>
            Athens as a tyrant, he wrote these verses on the Athenians:— <lb/>
            If through your vices you afflicted are, <lb/>
            Lay not the blame of your distress on God ; <lb/>
            You made your rulers mighty, gave them guards, <lb/>
            So now you groan 'neath slavery's heavy rod— <lb/>
            Each one of you now treads in foxes' steps, <lb/>
            Bearing a weak, inconstant, faithless mind, <lb/>
            Trusting the tongue and slippery speech of man ; <lb/>
            Though in his acts alone you truth can find.</p>
          <p>This, then, he said to them.</p>
          <p>VI. But Pisistratus, when he was leaving Athens, wrote him <lb/>
            a letter in the following terms: — <note type="footnote"> * Vide Herod. lib. 1. c. 30—33. </note> <pb n="26"/>

            <title type="sub">PISISTRATUS TO SOLON.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I am not the only one of the Greeks who has seized the <lb/>
            sovereignty of his country, nor am I one who had no right <lb/>
            whatever to do so, since I am of the race of Codrus ; for I have <lb/>
            only recovered what the Athenians swore that they would give to <lb/>
            Codrus and all his family, and what they afterwards deprived <lb/>
            them of. And in all other respects I sin neither against men <lb/>
            nor against gods, but I allow the Athenians to live under the <lb/>
            laws which you established amongst them, and they are now <lb/>
            living in a better manner than they would if they were under <lb/>
            a democracy; for I allow no one to behave with violence : and <lb/>
            I, though I am the tyrant, derive no other advantage beyond <lb/>
            my superiority in rank and honour, being content with the <lb/>
            fixed honours which belonged to the former kings. And every <lb/>
            one of the Athenians brings the tithe of his possessions, not <lb/>
            to me, but to the proper place in order that it may be devoted <lb/>
            to the public sacrifices of the city; and for any other public <lb/>
            purposes, or for any emergencies of war which may arise.</p>
          <p>But I do not blame you for laying open my plans, for I <lb/>
            know that you did so out of regard for the city rather than out <lb/>
            of dislike to me; and also because you did not know what sort <lb/>
            of government I was about to establish ; since, if you had been <lb/>
            acquainted with it, you would have been content to live under <lb/>
            it and would not have fled. Now, therefore, return home <lb/>
            again; believing me even without my swearing to you that <lb/>
            Solon shall never receive any harm at the hands of Pisistratus ; <lb/>
            know also that none of my enemies have suffered any evil from <lb/>
            me ; and if you will consent to be one of my friends, you shall <lb/>
            be among the first; for I know that there is no treachery or <lb/>
            faithlessness in you. Or if you wish to live at Athens in any <lb/>
            other manner, you shall be allowed to do so; only do not <lb/>
            deprive yourself of your country because of my actions. <lb/>
            Thus wrote Pisistratus.</p>
          <p>VII. Solon also said, that the limit of human life was <lb/>
            seventy years, and he appears to have been a most excellent <lb/>
            lawgiver, for he enjoined, " that if any one did not support his <lb/>
            parents he should be accounted infamous; and that the man <lb/>
            who squandered his patrimony should be equally so, and the <lb/>
            inactive man was liable to prosecution by any one who choose <lb/>
            to impeach him. But Lysias, in his speech against Nicias, <lb/>
             <pb n="27"/>
            says that Draco first proposed this law, but that it was Solon <lb/>
            who enacted it. He also prohibited all who lived in debauchery <lb/>
            from ascending the tribunal; and he diminished the honours <lb/>
            paid to Athletes who were victorious in the games, fixing the <lb/>
            prize for a victor at Olympia at five hundred drachmae,* and for <lb/>
            one who conquered at the Isthmian games at one hundred; <lb/>
            and in the same proportion did he fix the prizes for the other <lb/>
            games, for he said, that it was absurd to give such great <lb/>
            honours to those men as ought to be reserved for those only <lb/>
            who died in the wars ; and their sons he ordered to be educated <lb/>
            and bred up at the public expense. And owing to this encou- <lb/>
            ragement, the Athenians behave themselves nobly and valiantly <lb/>
            in war; as for instance, Polyzelus, and Cynægirus, and <lb/>
            Callimachus, and all the soldiers who fought at Marathon, and <lb/>
            Harmodius, and Aristogiton, and Miltiades, and numberless <lb/>
            other heroes.</p>
          <p>But as for the Athletes, their training is very expensive, <lb/>
            and their victories injurious, and they are crowned rather as <lb/>
            conquerors of their country than of their antagonists, and <lb/>
            when they become old, as Euripides says : — <lb/>
            They're like old cloaks worn to the very woof.</p>
          <p>IX. So Solon, appreciating these facts, treated them with <lb/>
            moderation. This also was an admirable regulation of his, that <lb/>
            a guardian of orphans should not live with their mother, and <lb/>
            that no one should be appointed a guardian, to whom the <lb/>
            orphans' property would come if they died. Another excellent <lb/>
            law was, that a seal engraver might not keep an impression <lb/>
            of any ring which had been sold by him, and that if a person <lb/>
            struck out the eye of a man who had but one, he should lose <lb/>
            both his own, and that no one should claim what he had not <lb/>
            deposited, otherwise death should be his punishment. If an <lb/>
            archon was detected being drunk, that too was a capital crime <lb/>
            And he compiled the poems of Homer, so that they might be <lb/>
            recited by different bards, taking the cue from one another, so <lb/>
            that where one had left off the next one might take him up, <lb/>
            so that it was Solon rather than Pisistratus who brought <lb/>
            Homer to light, as Dieuchidas says, in the fifth book of his <lb/>
            History of Megara, and the most celebrated of his verses <lb/>
            were :- <note type="footnote"> ✳ A drachma was something less than ten pence. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="28"/>
            Full fifty more from Athens stem the main.</p>
          <p>And the rest of that passage-" And Solon was the first person <lb/>
            who called the thirtieth day of the month <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔνη ϰαὶ νέα</foreign>’* He was <lb/>
            the first person also who assembled the nine archons together <lb/>
            to deliver their opinions, as Apollodorus tells us in the second <lb/>
            book of his Treatise on Lawgivers. And once, when there was <lb/>
            a sedition in the city, he took part, neither with the citizens, <lb/>
            nor with the inhabitants of the plain, nor with the men of the <lb/>
            sea-coast.</p>
          <p>X. He used to say, too, that speech was the image of actions, <lb/>
            and that the king was the mightiest man as to his power ; but <lb/>
            that laws were like cobwebs-for that if any trifling or power- <lb/>
            less thing fell into them, they held it fast; but if a thing <lb/>
            of any size fell into them, it broke the meshes and escaped. <lb/>
            He used also to say that discourse ought to be sealed by silence, <lb/>
            and silence by opportunity. It was also a saying of his, that <lb/>
            those who had influence with tyrants, were like the pebbles which <lb/>
            are used in making calculations; for that every one of those <lb/>
            pebbles were sometimes worth more, and sometimes less, and <lb/>
            so that the tyrants sometimes made each of these men of con- <lb/>
            sequence, and sometimes neglected them. Being asked why <lb/>
            be had made no law concerning parricides, he made answer, <lb/>
            that he did not expect that any such person would exist. <lb/>
            When he was asked how men could be most effectually deterred <lb/>
            from committing injustice, he said, If those who are not in- <lb/>
            jured feel as much indignation as those who are." Another <lb/>
            apophthegm of his was, that satiety was generated by wealth, <lb/>
            and insolence by satiety.</p>
          <p>XI. He it was who taught the Athenians to regulate their <lb/>
            days by the course of the moon ; and he also forbade Thespis <lb/>
            to perform and represent his tragedies, on the ground of <lb/>
            falsehood being unprofitable; and when Pisistratus wounded <lb/>
            himself, he said it all came of Thespis's tragedies. <note type="footnote"> * “”<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ενη καὶ</foreign>via the last day of the month :-elsewhere <foreign xml:lang="grc">τριανιὰς</foreign>. So <lb/>
            called for this reason. The old Greek year was lunar; now the moon's <lb/>
            monthly orbit is twenty-nine and a half days. So that if the first month <lb/>
            began with the sun and moon together at sunrise, at the month's end <lb/>
            it would be sunset; and the second month would begin at sunset. To <lb/>
            prevent this irregularity, Solon made the latter half day belong to the <lb/>
            first month; so that this thirtieth day consisted of two halves, one <lb/>
            belonging to the old, the other to the new moon. And when the lunar <lb/>
            month fell into disuse, the last day of the calendar month was still <lb/>

          <p>XII. He gave the following advice, as is recorded by Apol- <lb/>
            lodorus in his Treatise on the Sects of Philosophers :—" Con- <lb/>
            sider your honour, as a gentleman, of more weight than an <lb/>
            oath.-Never speak falsely.—Pay attention to matters of im- <lb/>
            portance.—Be not hasty in making friends ; and do not cast <lb/>
            off those whom you have made.-Rule, after you have first <lb/>
            learnt to submit to rule.-Advise not what is most agreeable, <lb/>
            but what is best.-Make reason your guide.-Do not asso- <lb/>
            ciate with the wicked.—Honour the gods ; respect your <lb/>
            parents."</p>
          <p>XIII. They say also that when Mimnermus had written :- <lb/>
            Happy's the man who 'scapes disease and care, <lb/>
            And dies contented in his sixtieth year :</p>
          <p>Solon rebuked him, and said :- <lb/>
            Be guided now by me, erase this verse, <lb/>
            Nor envy me if I'm more wise than you. <lb/>
            If you write thus, your wish would not be worse, <lb/>
            May I be eighty ere death lays me low.</p>
          <p>The following are some lines out of his poems :— <lb/>
            Watch well each separate citizen, <lb/>
            Lest having in his heart of hearts <lb/>
            A secret spear, one still may come <lb/>
            Saluting you with cheerful face, <lb/>
            And utter with a double tongue <lb/>
            The feigned good wishes of his wary mind.</p>
          <p>As for his having made laws, that is notorious ; he also com- <lb/>
            posed speeches to the people, and a book of suggestions to <lb/>
            himself, and some elegiac poems, and five thousand verses about <lb/>
            Salamis and the constitution of the Athenians ; and some iam- <lb/>
            bics and epodes.</p>
          <p>XV. And on his statue is the following inscription— <lb/>
            Salamis that checked the Persian insolence, <lb/>
            Brought forth this holy lawgiver, wise Solon.</p>
          <p>He flourished about the forty-sixth Olympiad, in the third year <lb/>
            of which he was archon at Athens, as Sosicrates records ; and <lb/>
            it was in this year that he enacted his laws; and he died in <lb/>
            Cyprus, after he had lived eighty years, having given charge to <lb/>
            his relations to carry his bones to Salamis, and there to burn <lb/>
            them to ashes, and to scatter the ashes on the ground. In re- <lb/>
             <pb n="30"/>
            ference to which Cratinus in his Chiron represents him as <lb/>
            speaking thus :- <lb/>
            And as men say, I still this isle inhabit, <lb/>
            Sown o'er the whole of Ajax' famous city.</p>
          <p>There is also an epigram in the before mentioned collection <lb/>
            of poems, in various metres, in which I have made a collection <lb/>
            of notices of all the illustrious men that have ever died, in every <lb/>
            kind of metre and rhythm, in epigrams and odes. And it runs <lb/>
            thus:— <lb/>
            The Cyprian flame devour'd great Solon's corpse, <lb/>
            Far in a foreign land; but Salamis <lb/>
            Retains his bones, whose dust is turned to corn. <lb/>
            The tablets of his laws do bear aloft <lb/>
            His mind to heaven. Such a burden light <lb/>
            Are these immortal rules to th' happy wood.</p>
          <p>XVI. He also, as some say, was the author of the apoph- <lb/>
            thegm—”Seek excess in nothing." And Dioscorides, in his <lb/>
            Commentaries, says, that, when he was lamenting his son, <lb/>
            who was dead (with whose name I am not acquainted), and when <lb/>
            some one said to him, " You do no good by weeping," he replied, <lb/>
            " But that is the very reason why I weep, because I do no <lb/>
            good."</p>
          <p>XVII. The following letters also are attributed to him:—</p>

          <p>You send me word that many people are plotting against <lb/>
            you ; but if you were to think of putting everyone of them out <lb/>
            of the way, you would do no good; but some one whom you do <lb/>
            not suspect would still plot against you, partly because he would <lb/>
            fear for himself, and partly out of dislike to you for fearing all <lb/>
            sorts of things ; and he would think, too, that he would make <lb/>
            the city grateful to him, even if you were not suspected. It is <lb/>
            better, therefore, to abstain from the tyranny, in order to es- <lb/>
            cape from blame. But if you absolutely must be a tyrant, then <lb/>
            you had better provide for having a foreign force in the city <lb/>
            superior to that of the citizens ; and then no one need be for- <lb/>
            midable to you, nor need you put any one out of the way.</p>

          <p>XVIII. My laws were not destined to be long of service <lb/>
             <pb n="31"/>
            to the Athenians, nor have you done any great good by puri- <lb/>
            fying the city. For neither can the Deity nor lawgivers do <lb/>
            much good to cities by themselves ; but these people rather <lb/>
            have this power, who, from time to time, can lead the people <lb/>
            to any opinions they choose; so also the Deity and the <lb/>
            laws, when the citizens are well governed, are useful ; but <lb/>
            when they are ill governed ,they are no good. Nor are my laws <lb/>
            nor all the enactments that I made, any better ; but those who <lb/>
            were in power transgressed them, and did great injury to the <lb/>
            commonwealth, inasmuch as they did not hinder Pisistratus <lb/>
            from ursurping the tyranny. Nor did they believe me when I <lb/>
            gave them warning beforehand. But he obtained more credit <lb/>
            than I did, who flattered the Athenians while I told him the <lb/>
            truth: but I, placing my arms before the principal council- <lb/>
            house, being wiser than they, told those who had no suspicion of <lb/>
            it, that Pisistratus was desirous to make himself a tyrant; and <lb/>
            I showed myself more valiant than those who hesitated to de- <lb/>
            fend the state against him. But they condemned the madness <lb/>
            of Solon. But at last I spoke loudly-,, 0, my country, I, <lb/>
            Solon, here am ready to defend you by word and deed ; but to <lb/>
            these men I seem to be mad. So I will depart from you, being <lb/>
            the only antagonist of Pisistratus ; and let these men be his <lb/>
            guards if they please." For you know the man, my friend, and <lb/>
            how cleverly he seized upon the tyranny. He first began by <lb/>
            being a demagogue; then, having inflicted wounds on him- <lb/>
            self, he came to the Heliæa, crying out, and saying, " That he <lb/>
            had been treated in this way by his enemies.' And he en- <lb/>
            treated the people to assign him as guards four hundred young <lb/>
            men; and they, disregarding my advice, gave them to him. <lb/>
            And they were all armed with bludgeons. And after that he <lb/>
            put down the democracy. They in vain hoped to deliver the <lb/>
            poor from their state of slavery, and so now they are all of them <lb/>
            slaves to Pisistratus."</p>

          <p>I am well assured that I should suffer no evil at your <lb/>

            friend of yours, and now my case is not different from that of <lb/>
            any other Athenian who is not pleased with tyranny. And <lb/>

            according to his own sentiments. And I admit that of all <lb/>

            for me to return to Athens, lest any one should blame me, <lb/>
            for, after having established equality of civil rights among the <lb/>
            Athenians, and after having refused to be a tyrant myself <lb/>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF CHILO.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. CHILO was a Lacedemonian, the son of Damagetus. He <lb/>
            composed verses in elegiac metre to the number of two <lb/>
            hundred : and it was a saying of his that a foresight of future <lb/>
            events, such as could be arrived at by consideration was the <lb/>
            virtue of a man. He also said once to his brother, who was <lb/>
            indignant at not being an epbor, while he himself was one, <lb/>
            " The reason is because I know how to bear injustice ; but <lb/>
            you do not." And he was made ephor in the fifty-fifth Olym- <lb/>
            piad ; but Pamphila says that it was in the fifty-sixth. And <lb/>
            he was made first ephor in the year of the archonship of <lb/>
            Euthydemus, as we are told by Sosicrates. Chilo was also <lb/>
            the first person who introduced the custom of joining the <lb/>
            ephors to the kings as their counsellors: though Satyrus <lb/>
            attributes this institution to Lycurgus. He, as Herodotus <lb/>
            says in his first book, when Hippocrates was sacrificing at <lb/>
            Olympia, and the cauldrons began to boil of their own accord, <lb/>
            advised him either to marry, or, if he were married already, <lb/>
            to discard his wife, and disown his children.</p><pb n="33"/>
            
          <p>II. They tell a story, also, of his having asked Æsop what <lb/>
            Jupiter was doing, and that Æsop replied, " He is lowering <lb/>
            what is high, and exalting what is low." Being asked in what <lb/>
            educated men differed from those who were illiterate, he said, <lb/>
            " In good hopes." Having had the question put to him, What <lb/>
            was difficult, he said, " To be silent about secrets; to make <lb/>
            good use of one's leisure, and to be able to submit to in- <lb/>
            justice." And besides these three things he added further, <lb/>
            " To rule one's tongue, especially at a banquet, and not to <lb/>
            speak ill of one's neighbours; for if one does so one is sure <lb/>
            to hear what one will not like." He advised, moreover, " To <lb/>
            threaten no one; for that is a womanly trick. To be more <lb/>
            prompt to go to one's friends in adversity than in prosperity. <lb/>
            To make but a moderate display at one's marriage. Not to <lb/>
            speak evil of the dead. To honour old age.-To keep a <lb/>
            watch upon one's self.-To prefer punishment to disgraceful <lb/>
            gain; for the one is painful but once, but the other for one's <lb/>
            whole life.-Not to laugh at a person in misfortune.-If one <lb/>
            is strong to be also merciful, so that one's neighbours may <lb/>
            respect one rather than fear one.-To learn how to regulate <lb/>
            one's own house welL-Not to let one's tongue outrun one's <lb/>
            sense.-To restrain anger.-Not to dislike divination.-Not <lb/>
            to desire what is impossible.-Not to make too much haste on <lb/>
            one's road.- When speaking not to gesticulate with the hand; <lb/>
            for that is like a madman.—To obey the laws.-To love <lb/>
            quiet."</p>
          <p>And of all his songs this one was the most approved :— <lb/>
            Gold is best tested by a whetstone hard, <lb/>
            Which gives a certain proof of purity; <lb/>
            And gold itself acts as the test of men, <lb/>
            By which we know the temper of their minds.</p>
          <p>III. They say, too, that when he was old he said, that he <lb/>
            was not conscious of having ever done an unjust action <lb/>
            in his life; but .'that he doubted about one thing. For <lb/>
            that once when judging in a friend's cause he had voted <lb/>
            himself in accordance with the Jaw, but had persuaded a <lb/>
            friend to vote for his acquittal, in order that so he might <lb/>
            maintain the law, and yet save his friend.</p>
          <p>IV. But he was most especially celebrated among the <lb/>
            Greeks for having delivered an early opinion about Cythera <lb/>
            an island belonging to Laconia. For having become ac- <note type="footnote"> D </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="34"/>
            quainted with its nature, he said, " I wish it had never <lb/>
            existed, or that, as it does exist, it were sunk at the bottom <lb/>
            of the sea." And his foresight was proved afterwards. For when <lb/>
            Demaratus was banished by the Lacedaemonians, he advised <lb/>
            Xerxes to keep his ships at that island: and Greece would <lb/>
            have been subdued, if Xerxes had taken the advice. And' <lb/>
            afterwards Nicias, having reduced the island at the time of the <lb/>
            Peloponnesian war, placed in it a garrison of Athenians, and <lb/>
            did a great deal of harm to the Lacedaemonians.</p>
          <p>V. He was very brief in his speech. On which account <lb/>
            Aristagoras, the Milesian, calls such conciseness, the Chilo- <lb/>
            nean fashion ; and says that it was adopted by Branchus, who <lb/>
            built the temple among the Branchidæ. Cliilo was an old <lb/>
            man, about the fifty-second Olympiad, when Æsop, the fable <lb/>
            writer, flourished. And he died, as Hermippus says, at Pisa, <lb/>
            after embracing his son, who had gained the victory in boxing <lb/>
            at the Olympic games. The cause of his death was excess of <lb/>
            joy, and weakness caused by extreme old age. All the <lb/>
            spectators who were present at the games attended his <lb/>
            funeral, paying him the highest honours. And we have written <lb/>
            the following epigram on him :— <lb/>
            I thank you, brightest Pollux, that the son <lb/>
            Of Chilo wears the wreath of victory; <lb/>
            Nor need we grieve if at the glorious sight <lb/>
            His father died. May such my last end be !</p>
          <p>And the following inscription is engraved on his statue :- <lb/>
            The warlike Sparta called this Chilo son, <lb/>
            The wisest man of all the seven sages.</p>
          <p>One of his sayings was, "Suretyship, and then destruction." <lb/>
            The following letter of his is also extant :-</p>

            that tyrant a fortunate man who dies a natural death in his <lb/>
            own house.</p><pb n="35"/>
            
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF PITTACUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. PITTACUS was a native of Mitylene, and son of Hyrradius. <lb/>
            But Duris says, that his father was a Thracian. He, in union <lb/>
            with the brothers of Alcæus, put down Melanchrus the tyrant <lb/>
            of Lesbos. And in the battle which took place between the <lb/>
            Athenians and Mitylenæans on the subject of the district of <lb/>
            Achilis, he was the Mitylenæan general; the Atheniar <lb/>
            commander being Phrynon, a Pancratiast, who had gained the <lb/>
            victory at Olympia. Pittacus agreed to meet him in single <lb/>
            combat, and having a net under his shield, he entangle. <lb/>
            Phrynon without his being aware of it beforehand, and so, <lb/>
            having killed him, he preserved the district in dispute to his <lb/>
            countrymen. But Apollodorus, in his Chronicles, says, that <lb/>
            subsequently, the Athenians had a trial with the Mitylenæans <lb/>
            about the district, and that the cause was submitted to Peri- <lb/>
            ander, who decided it in favour of the Athenians.</p>
          <p>II. In consequence of this victory the Mitylenaeans held <lb/>
            Pittacus in the greatest honour, and committed the supreme <lb/>
            power into his hands. And he held it for ten years, and then, <lb/>
            when he had brought the city and constitution into good order, <lb/>
            he resigned the government. And he lived ten years after <lb/>
            that, and the Mitylenæans assigned him an estate, which he <lb/>
            consecrated to the God, and to this day it is called the Pitta- <lb/>
            cian land. But Sosicrates says that he cut off a small portion <lb/>
            of it, saying that half was more than the whole; and when <lb/>
            Crœsus offered him some money he would not accept it, as he <lb/>
            said that he had already twice as much as he wanted; for that <lb/>
            he had succeeded to the inheritance of his brother, who had <lb/>
            died without children.</p>
          <p>III. But Pamphila says, in the second book of his Com- <lb/>
            mentaries, that he had a son named Tyrrhæus, who was killed <lb/>
            while sitting in a barber's shop, at Cyma, by a brazier, who <lb/>
            threw an axe at him; and that the Cymæans sent the murderer <lb/>
            to Pittacus, who when he had learnt what had been done, <lb/>
            dismissed the man, saying, " Pardon is better than repent- <lb/>
            ance." But Heraclitus says that the true story is, that he had <lb/>
            got Alcæus into his power, and that he released him, saying, <lb/>
            Pardon is better than punishment." He was also a law- <note type="footnote">D 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="36"/>
            giver; and he made a law that if a man committed a crime <lb/>
            while drunk, he should have double punishment; in the hope <lb/>
            of deterring men from getting drunk, as wine was very <lb/>
            plentiful in the island.</p>
          <p>IV. It was a saying of his that it was a hard thing to be <lb/>
            good, and this apophthegm is quoted by Simonides, who says, <lb/>
            " It was a saying of Pittacus, that it is a hard thing to be <lb/>
            really a good man." Plato also mentions it in his Protagoras. <lb/>
            Another of his sayings was, "Even the Gods cannot strive <lb/>
            against necessity." Another was, " Power shows the man." <lb/>
            Being once asked what was best, he replied, " To do what one <lb/>
            is doing at the moment well." When Crcesus put the question <lb/>
            to him, “ What is the greatest power ?" " The power," he <lb/>
            replied, “ of the variegated wood," meaning the wooden tablets <lb/>
            of the laws. He used to say too, that there were some victories <lb/>
            without bloodshed. He said once to a man of Phocæa. who <lb/>
            was saying that we ought to seek out a virtuous man, " But <lb/>
            if you seek ever so much you will not find one." Some people <lb/>
            once asked him what thing was very grateful ? and he replied, <lb/>
            “Time.”—What was uncertain? "The future.”—What was <lb/>
            trusty? "The land.”—What was treacherous? "The. sea " <lb/>
            Another saying of his was, that it was the part of wise men, <lb/>
            before difficult circumstances arose, to provide for their not <lb/>
            arising ; but that it was the part of brave men to make the <lb/>
            best of existing circumstances. He used to say too, " Do <lb/>
            not say before hand what you are going to do; for if you <lb/>
            fail, you will be laughed at." “ Do not reproach a man <lb/>
            with his misfortunes, fearing lest Nemesis may overtake <lb/>
            you." " If you have received a deposit, restore it." " Forbear <lb/>
            to speak evil not only of your friends, but also of your enemies." <lb/>
            " Practise piety, with temperance." "■ Cultivate truth, good <lb/>
            faith, experience, cleverness, sociability, and industry."</p>
          <p>V. He wrote also some songs, of which the following is the <lb/>
            most celebrated one :— <lb/>
            The wise will only face the wicked man, <lb/>
            With bow in hand well bent, <lb/>
            And quiver full of arrows- <lb/>
            For such a tongue as his says nothing true, <lb/>
            Prompted by a wily heart <lb/>
            . To utter double speeches.</p>
          <p>He also composed six hundred verses in elegiac metre; and <lb/>
             <pb n="37"/>
            he wrote a treatise in prose, on Laws, addressed to his country- <lb/>
            men.</p>
          <p>VI. He flourished about the forty-second Olympiad; and <lb/>
            he died when Aristomenes was Archon, in the third year of <lb/>
            the fifty-second Olympiad; having lived more than seventy <lb/>
            years, being a very old man. And on his tomb is this in- <lb/>
            scription :— <lb/>
            Lesbos who bore him here, with tears doth bury <lb/>
            Hyrradius' worthy son, wise Pittacus.</p>
          <p>Another saying of his was, " Watch your opportunity.,,</p>
          <p>VII. There was also another Pittacus, a lawgiver, as Favo- <lb/>
            rinus tells us in the first book of his Commentaries; and <lb/>
            Demetrius says so too, in his Essay on Men and Things of the <lb/>
            same name. And that other Pittacus was called Pittacus the less.</p>
          <p>VIII. But it is said that the wise Pittacus once, when a <lb/>
            young man consulted him on the subject of marriage, made <lb/>
            him the following answer, which is thus given by Callimachus <lb/>
            in his Epigrams.</p>
          <p>Hyrradius' prudent son, old Pittacus <lb/>
            The pride of Mitylene, once was asked <lb/>
            By an Atarnean stranger; " Tell me, sage, <lb/>
            I have two marriages proposed to me; <lb/>
            One maid my equal is in birth and riches; <lb/>
            The other's far above me;—which is best ? <lb/>
            Advise me now which shall I take to wife ?' <lb/>
            Thus spoke the stranger; but the aged prince, <lb/>
            Raising his old man's staff before his face, <lb/>
            Said, " These will tell you all you want to know <lb/>
            And pointed to some boys, who with quick lashes <lb/>
            Were driving whipping tops along the street. <lb/>
            " Follow their steps," said he ; so he went near them <lb/>
            And heard them say, " Let each now mind his own.”— <lb/>
            So when the stranger heard the boys speak thus, <lb/>
            He pondered on their words, and laid aside <lb/>
            Ambitious thoughts of an unequal marriage. <lb/>
            As then he took to shame the poorer bride, <lb/>
            So too do you, 0 reader, mind thy own.</p>
          <p>And it seems that he may have here spoken from experience, <lb/>
            for his own wife was of more noble birth than himself, since she <lb/>
            was the sister of Draco, the son of Penthilus; and she gave <lb/>
            herself great airs, and tyrannized over him.</p><pb n="38"/>
            
          <p>IX. Alcseas calls Pittacus <foreign xml:lang="grc">σαϱάπους</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">σάϱαπος</foreign>, because he <lb/>
            was splay-footed, and used to drag his feet in walking; he also <lb/>
            called him <foreign xml:lang="grc">χειϱοπόδης</foreign>, because he had scars on his feet which <lb/>
            were called <foreign xml:lang="grc">χειϱάδες</foreign>. And <foreign xml:lang="grc">γαύϱηξ</foreign>, implying that he gave <lb/>
            himself airs without reason. And <foreign xml:lang="grc">φύσχων</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">γάστϱων</foreign>, because <lb/>
            he was fat. He also called him <foreign xml:lang="grc">ξοϕοδοϱπίδας</foreign>, because he bad <lb/>
            weak eyes, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">άγάσυϱτος</foreign>, because he was lazy and dirty. He <lb/>
            used to grind corn for the sake of exercise, as Clearchus, the <lb/>
            philosopher, relates.</p>
          <p>X. There is a letter of his extant, which runs thus :—</p>
          <ab>

          </ab>
          <p>You invite me to come to Lydia in order that I may see <lb/>
            your riches; but I, even without seeing them, do not doubt that <lb/>
            the son of Alyattes is the richest of monarchs. But I should <lb/>
            get no good by going to Sardis ; for I do not want gold myself, <lb/>
            but what I have is sufficient for myself and my companions. <lb/>
            Still, I will come, in order to become acquainted with you as a <lb/>
            hospitable man.</p>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF BIAS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. BIAS was a citizen of Priene, and the son of Teutamus, and <lb/>
            by Satyrus he is put at the head of the seven wise men. Some <lb/>
            writers affirm that he was one of the richest men of the city; <lb/>
            but others say that he was only a settler. And Phanodicus <lb/>
            says, that he ransomed some Messenian maidens who had been <lb/>
            taken prisoners, and educated them as his own daughters, and <lb/>
            gave them dowries, and then sent them back to Messina to their <lb/>
            fathers. And when, as has been mentioned before, the tripod <lb/>
            was found near Athens by some fishermen, the brazen tripod <lb/>
            I mean, which bore the inscription—“For the Wise;" then <lb/>
            Satyrus says that the damsels (but others, such as Phano- <lb/>
            dicus, say that it was their father,) came into the assembly, <lb/>
            and said that Bias was the wise man—recounting what he had <lb/>
            done to them: and so the tripod was sent to him. But Bias, <lb/>
            when he saw it, said that it was Apollo who was " the Wise," <lb/>
            and would not receive the tripod.</p><pb n="39"/>
            
          <p>II. But others say that he consecrated it at Thebes to Her- <lb/>
            cules, because he himself was a descendant of the Thebans, <lb/>
            who had sent a colony to Priene, as Phanodicus relates. It is <lb/>
            said also that when Alyattes was besieging Priene, Bias fattened <lb/>
            up two mules, and drove them into his camp ; and that the <lb/>
            king, seeing the condition that the mules were in, was astonished <lb/>
            at their being able to spare food to keep the brute beasts so well, <lb/>
            and so he desired to make peace with them, and sent an am- <lb/>
            bassador to them. On this Bias, having made some heaps <lb/>
            of sand, and put corn on the top, showed them to the convoy ; <lb/>
            and Alyattes, hearing from him what he had seen, made peace <lb/>
            with the people of Priene ; and then, when he sent to Bias, <lb/>
            desiring him to come quickly to him, " Tell Alyattes, from <lb/>
            me," he replied, " to eat onions;”—which is the same as if he <lb/>
            had said, " go and weep."</p>
          <p>III. It is said that he was very energetic and eloquent when <lb/>
            pleading causes ; but that he always reserved his talents for <lb/>
            the right side. In reference to which Demodicus of Alerius <lb/>
            uttered the following enigmatical saying—“ If you are a judge, <lb/>
            give a Prienian decision." And Hipponax says, " More ex- <lb/>
            cellent in his decisions than Bias of Priene." Now he died in <lb/>
            this manner :—</p>
          <p>IV. Having pleaded a cause for some one when he was ex- <lb/>
            ceedingly old, after he had finished speaking, he leaned back <lb/>
            with his head on the bosom of his daughter's son; and after the <lb/>
            advocate on the opposite side had spoken, and the judges had <lb/>
            given their decision in favour of Bias's client, when the court <lb/>
            broke up he was found dead on his grandson's bosom. And <lb/>
            the city buried him in the greatest magnificence, and put over <lb/>
            him this inscription- <lb/>
            Beneath this stone lies Bias, who was born <lb/>
            In the illustrious Prienian land, <lb/>
            The glory of the whole Ionian race.</p>
          <p>And we ourselves have also written an epigram on him— <lb/>
            Here Bias lies, whom, when the hoary snow <lb/>
            Had crowned his aged temples, Mercury <lb/>
            Unpitying led to Pluto's darken'd realms. <lb/>
            He pleaded his friend's cause, and then reclin'd <lb/>
            In his child's arms, repos'd in lasting sleep.</p>
          <p>V. He also wrote about two thousand verses on Ionia, to <lb/>
             <pb n="40"/>
            show in what matter a man might best arrive at happiness ; and <lb/>
            of all his poetical sayings these have the greatest reputation :- <lb/>
            Seek to please all the citizens, even though <lb/>
            Your house may be in an ungracious city. <lb/>
            For such a course will favour win from all: <lb/>
            But haughty manners oft produce destruction.</p>
          <p>And this one too :— <lb/>
            Great strength of body is the gift of nature; <lb/>
            But to be able to advise whate'er <lb/>
            Is most expedient for one's country's good, <lb/>
            Is the peculiar work of sense and wisdom.</p>
          <p>Another is:- <lb/>
            Great riches come to many men by chance.</p>
          <p>He used also to say that that man was unfortunate who <lb/>
            could not support misfortune; and that it is a disease of the <lb/>
            mind to desire what was impossible, and to have no regard for <lb/>
            the misfortunes of others. Being asked what was difficult, he <lb/>
            said—“ To bear a change of fortune for the worse with magna- <lb/>
            nimity." Once he was on a voyage with some impious men, <lb/>
            and the vessel was overtaken by a storm; so they began to in- <lb/>
            voke the assistance of the Gods ; on which he said, " Hold your <lb/>
            tongues, lest they should find out that you are in this ship." <lb/>
            When he was asked by an impious man what piety was, he <lb/>
            made no reply ; and when his questioner demanded the reason <lb/>
            of his silence, he said, " I am silent because you are putting <lb/>
            questions about things with which you have no concern." <lb/>
            Being asked what was pleasant to men, he replied, " Hope." <lb/>
            It was a saying of his that it was more agreeable to decide <lb/>
            between enemies than between friends; for that of friends, one <lb/>
            was sure to become an enemy to him; but that of enemies, one <lb/>
            was sure to become a friend. When the question was put to <lb/>
            him, what a man derived pleasure while he was doing, he <lb/>
            said, " While acquiring gain." He used to say, too, that men <lb/>
            ought to calculate life both as if they were fated to live a long <lb/>
            and a short time : and that they ought to love one another as if <lb/>
            at a future time they would come to hate one another; for that <lb/>
            most men were wicked. He used also to give the following <lb/>
            pieces of advice :—" Choose the course which you adopt with <lb/>
            deliberation; but when you have adopted it, then persevere in <lb/>
             <pb n="41"/>
            it with firmness.—Do not speak fast, for that shows folly.- <lb/>
            Love prudence.-Speak of the Gods as they are.-Do not <lb/>
            praise an undeserving mail because of his riches.—Accept of <lb/>
            things, having procured them by persuasion, not by force.- <lb/>
            Whatever good fortune befalls you, attribute it to the gods. <lb/>
            —Cherish wisdom as a means of travelling from youth to <lb/>
            old age, for it is more lasting than any other possession."</p>
          <p>VI. Hipponax also mentions Bias, as has been said before; <lb/>
            and Heraclitus too, a man who was not easily pleased, has <lb/>
            praised him; saying, in Priene there lived Bias the son of <lb/>
            Teutamus, whose reputation is higher than that of the others ; <lb/>
            and the Prienians consecrated a temple to him which is called <lb/>
            the Teutamium. A saying of his was, " Most men are <lb/>
            wicked.”</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF CLEOBULUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. CLEOBULUS was a native of Lindus, and the son of <lb/>
            Evagoras; but according to Duns he was a Carian; others <lb/>
            again trace his family back to Hercules. He is reported to <lb/>
            have been eminent for personal strength and beauty, and to <lb/>
            have studied philosophy in Egypt; he had a daughter named <lb/>
            Cleobulina, who used to compose enigmas in hexameter verse, <lb/>
            and she is mentioned by Cratinus in his play of the same <lb/>
            name, except that the title is written in the plural number. <lb/>
            They say also that he restored the temple of Minerva which <lb/>
            had been built by Danaus.</p>
          <p>II. Cleobulus composed songs and obscure sayings in verse <lb/>
            to the number of three thousand lines, and some say that it was <lb/>
            he who composed the epigram on Midas.</p>
          <p>I am a brazen maiden lying here <lb/>
            Upon the tomb of Midas. And as long <lb/>
            As water flows, as trees are green with leaves, <lb/>
            As the sun shines and eke the silver moon, <lb/>
            As long as rivers flow, and billows roar, <lb/>
            So long will I upon this much wept tomb, <lb/>
            Tell passers by, " Midas lies buried here."</p>
          <p>And as an evidence of this epigram being by him they quote <lb/>
            song of Simonides, which runs thus :— <lb/>
             <pb n="42"/>
            What men possessed of sense <lb/>
            Would ever praise the Lindian Cleobulus ? <lb/>
            Who could compare a statue made by man <lb/>
            To everflowing streams, <lb/>
            To blushing flowers of spring, <lb/>
            To the sun's rays, to beams o' the golden morn, <lb/>
            And to the ceaseless waves of mighty Ocean ? <lb/>
            All things are trifling when compared to God. <lb/>
            Whjle men beneath their hands can crush a stone; <lb/>
            So that such sentiments can only come from fools.</p>
          <p>And the epigram cannot possibly be by Homer, for he lived <lb/>
            many years, as it is said, before Midas.</p>
          <p>III. There is also the following enigma quoted in the <lb/>
            Commentaries of Pamphila, as the work of Cleobulus : <lb/>
            There was one father and he had twelve daughters, <lb/>
            Each of his daughters had twice thirty children. <lb/>
            But most unlike in figure and complexion ; <lb/>
            For some were white, and others black to view, <lb/>
            And though immortal they all taste of death.</p>
          <p>And the solution is, " the year."</p>
          <p>IV. Of his apophthegms, the following are the most cele- <lb/>
            lebrated. Ignorance and talkativeness bear the chief sway <lb/>
            among men. Opportunity will be the most powerful. Cherish <lb/>
            not a thought. Do not be fickle, or ungrateful. He used to <lb/>
            say too, that men ought to give their daughters in marriage <lb/>
            while they were girls in age, but women in sense ; as indicating <lb/>
            by this that girls ought to be well educated. Another of his <lb/>
            sayings was, that one ought to serve a friend that he may be- <lb/>
            come a greater friend; and an enemy, to make him a friend. <lb/>
            And that one ought to guard against giving one's friends occa- <lb/>
            sion to blame one, and one's enemies opportunity of plotting <lb/>
            against one. Also, when a man goes out of his house, he should <lb/>
            consider what he is going to do: and when he comes home <lb/>
            again he should consider what he has done. He used also to <lb/>
            advise men to keep their bodies in health by exercise.-To be <lb/>
            fond of hearing rather than of talking.- To be fond of learning <lb/>
            rather than unwilling to learn.-To speak well of people.-To <lb/>
            seek virtue and eschew vice.-To avoid injustice.-To give the <lb/>
            best advice in one's power to one's country.-To be superior to <lb/>
            pleasure.-To do nothing by force.-To instruct one's children, <lb/>
             <pb n="43"/>
            -To be ready for reconciliation after quarrels.-Not to caress <lb/>
            one's wife, nor to quarrel with her when strangers are present, <lb/>
            for that to do the one is a sign of folly, and to do the latter is <lb/>
            downright madness.-Not to chastise a servant while elated <lb/>
            with drink, for so doing one will appear to be drunk one's self.- <lb/>
            To marry from among one's equals, for if one takes a wife of a <lb/>
            higher rank than one's self, one will have one's connexions for <lb/>
            one's masters.-Not to laugh at those who are being reproved, <lb/>
            for so one will be detested by them.-Be not haughty when <lb/>
            prosperous.-Be not desponding when in difficulties.—Learn to <lb/>
            bear the changes of fortune with magnanimity.</p>
          <p>V. And he died at a great age, having lived seventy years, <lb/>
            and this inscription was put over him :— <lb/>
            His country, Lindus, this fair sea-girt city <lb/>
            Bewails wise Cleobulus here entombed.</p>
          <p>VI. One of his sayings was, " Moderation is the best thing." <lb/>
            He also wrote a letter to Solon in these terms :—</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CLEOBULUS TO SOLON.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>You have many friends, and a home everywhere, but yet <lb/>
            I think that Lindus will be the most agreeable habitation for <lb/>
            Solon, since it enjoys a democratic government, and it is a ma- <lb/>
            ritime island, and whoever dwells in it has nothing to fear from <lb/>
            Pisistratus, and you will have friends flock to you from all <lb/>
            quarters.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF PERIANDER.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. PERIANDER was a Corinthian, the son of Cypselus, of the <lb/>
            family of the Heraclidæ. He married Lyside (whom he <lb/>
            himself called Melissa), the daughter of Procles the tyrant of <lb/>
            Epidaurus, and of Eristhenea the daughter of Aristocrates, and <lb/>
            sister of Aristodemus, who governed nearly all Arcadia, as He-. <lb/>
            raclides Ponticus says in his Treatise on Dominion and had by <lb/>
            her two sons Cypselus and Lycophron, the younger of whom was t <lb/>
            a clever boy, but the elder was deficient in intellect. At a sub- <lb/>
            sequent period he in a rage either kicked or threw his wife down <lb/>
            stairs when she was pregnant, and so killed her, being wrought <lb/>
             <pb n="44"/>
            upon by the false accusations of his concubines, whom he after- <lb/>
            wards burnt alive. And the child, whose name was Lycophron, <lb/>
            he sent away to Corcyra because he grieved for his mother.</p>
          <p>II. But afterwards, when he was now extremely old, he sent <lb/>
            for him back again, in order that he might succeed to the <lb/>
            tyranny. But the Corcyreans, anticipating his intention, put <lb/>
            him to death, at which he was greatly enraged, and sent their <lb/>
            children to Corcyra to be made eunuchs of; and when the ship <lb/>
            came near to Samos, the youths, having made supplications to <lb/>
            Juno, were saved by the Samians. And he fell into despondency <lb/>
            and died, being eighty years old. Sosicrates says that he died <lb/>
            forty-one years before Croesus, in the last year of the forty- <lb/>
            eighth Olympiad. Herodotus, in the first book of his History, <lb/>
            says that he was connected by ties of hospitality with Thrasy- <lb/>
            bulus the tyrant of Miletus. And Aristippus, in the first book <lb/>
            of his Treatise on Ancient Luxury, tells the following story <lb/>
            of him; that his mother Cratea fell in love with him, and in- <lb/>
            troduced herself secretly into his bed ; and he was delighted ; <lb/>
            but when the truth was discovered he became very oppressive <lb/>
            to all his subjects, because he was grieved at the discovery. <lb/>
            Ephoras relates that he made a vow that, if he gained the <lb/>
            victory at Olympia in the chariot race, he would dedicate a <lb/>
            golden statue to the God. Accordingly he gained the victory; <lb/>
            but being in want of gold, and seeing the women at some <lb/>
            national festival beautifully adorned, he took away their golden <lb/>
            ornaments, and then sent the offering which he had vowed.</p>
          <p>III. But some writers say that he was anxious that his tomb <lb/>
            should not be known, and that with that object he adopted the <lb/>
            following contrivance. He ordered two young men to go out <lb/>
            by night, indicating a particular road by which they were to go, <lb/>
            and to kill the first man they met, and bury him ; after them <lb/>
            he sent out four other men who were to kill and bury them. <lb/>
            Again he sent out a still greater number against these four, <lb/>
            with similar instructions. And in this manner he put himself <lb/>
            in the way of the first pair, and was slain, and the Corinthians <lb/>
            erected a cenotaph over him with the following inscription :— <lb/>
            The sea-beat land of Corinth in her bosom, <lb/>
            Doth here embrace her ruler Periander, <lb/>
            Greatest of all men for his wealth and wisdom.</p>
          <p>We ourselves have also written an epigram upon him:— <lb/>
             <pb n="45"/>
            Grieve not when disappointed of a wish, <lb/>
            But be content with what the Gods may give you— <lb/>
            For the great Periander died unhappy, <lb/>
            At failing in an object he desired.</p>
          <p>IV. It was a saying of his that we ought not to do anything <lb/>
            for the sake of money; for that we ought only to acquire such <lb/>
            gains as are allowable. He composed apophthegms in verse to <lb/>
            the number of two thousand lines; and said that those who <lb/>
            wished to wield absolute power in safety, should be guarded by <lb/>
            the good will of their countrymen, and not by arms. And <lb/>
            once, being asked why he assumed tyrannical power, he replied, <lb/>
            " Because, to abdicate it voluntarily, and to have it taken from <lb/>
            one, are both dangerous." The following sayings also belong <lb/>
            to him :-Tranquillity is a good thing.-Rashness is danger- <lb/>
            ous.—Gain is disgracefuL-Democracy is better than tyranny. <lb/>
            -Pleasures are transitory, but honour is immortaL-Be <lb/>
            moderate when prosperous, but prudent when unfortunate.- <lb/>
            Be the same to your friends when they are prosperous, and <lb/>
            when they are unfortunate.- Whatever you agree to do, observe <lb/>
            -Do not divulge secrets.-Punish not only those who do <lb/>
            wrong, but those who intend to do so.</p>
          <p>V. This prince was the first who had body-guards, and who <lb/>
            changed a legitimate power into a tyranny ; and he would not <lb/>
            allow any one who chose to live in his city, as Euphorus and <lb/>
            Aristotle tell us.</p>
          <p>VI. And he flourished about the thirty-eighth Olympiad, and <lb/>
            enjoyed absolute power for forty years. But Sotion, and He- <lb/>
            raclides, and Pamphila, in the fifth book of her Commen- <lb/>
            taries, says that there were two Perianders ; the one a tyrant, <lb/>
            and the other a wise man, and a native of Ambracia. And <lb/>
            Neanthes of Cyzicus makes the same assertion, adding, that <lb/>
            the two men were cousins to one another. And Aristotle says, <lb/>
            that it was the Corinthian Periander who was the wise one; <lb/>
            but Plato contradicts him. The saying—“ Practice does <lb/>
            everything," is his. He it was, also, who proposed to cut <lb/>
            through the Isthmus.</p>
          <p>VII. The following letter of his is quoted :—</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">PERIANDER TO THE WISE MEN.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I give great thanks to Apollo of Delphi that my letters are <lb/>
             <pb n="46"/>
            able to determine you all to meet together at Corinth; and I <lb/>
            will receive you all, as you may be well assured, in a manner <lb/>
            that becomes free citizens. I hear also that last year you met <lb/>
            at Sardis, at the court of the King of Lydia. So now do not <lb/>
            hesitate to come to me, who am the tyrant of Corinth; for the <lb/>
            Corinthians will all be delighted to see you come to the house <lb/>
            of Periander.</p>
          <p>VIII. There is this letter too :—</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">PERIANDER TO PROCLES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>The injury of my wife was unintended by me ; and you <lb/>
            have done wrong in alienating from me the mind of my child. <lb/>
            I desire you, therefore, either to restore me to my place in his <lb/>
            affections, or I will revenge myself on you ; for I have myself <lb/>
            made atonement for the death of your daughter, by burning in <lb/>
            her tomb the clothes of all the Corinthian women.*</p>
          <p>IX. Thiasybulus also wrote him a letter in the following <lb/>
            terms:— <lb/>
            I have given no answer to your messenger; but having <lb/>
            taken him into a field, I struck with my walking-stick all the <lb/>
            highest ears of corn, and cut off their tops, while he was walking <lb/>
            with me. And he will report to you, if you ask him, every- <lb/>
            thing which he heard or saw while with me; and do you act <lb/>
            accordingly if you wish to preserve your power safely, taking <lb/>
            off the most eminent of the citizens, whether he seems an <lb/>
            enemy to you or not, as even his companions are deservedly <lb/>
            objects of suspicion to a man possessed of supreme power.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF ANACHARSIS, THE SCYTHIAN.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. ANACHARSIS the Scythian was the son of Gnurus, and <lb/>
            the brother of Caduides the king of the Scythians; but his <lb/>
            mother was a Grecian woman; owing to which circumstance <lb/>
            he understood both languages.</p>
          <p>II. He wrote about the laws existing among the Scythians, <lb/>
            and also about those in force among the Greeks, urging men <note type="footnote"> * Herodotus mentions the case of Periander's children, iii. 50, and <lb/>
            the death of his wife, and his burning the clothes of all the Corinthian <lb/>
            women, v. 92. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="47"/>
            to adopt a temperate course of life; and he wrote also about war, <lb/>
            his works being in verse, and amounting to eight hundred lines. <lb/>
            He gave occasion for a proverb, because he used great freedom <lb/>
            of speech, so that people called such freedom the Scythian <lb/>
            conversation.</p>
          <p>III. But Sosicrates says that he came to Athens in the <lb/>
            forty-seventh Olympiad, in the archonsbip of Eucrates. And <lb/>
            Hermippus asserts that he came to Solon's house, and ordered <lb/>
            one of the servants to go and tell his master that Anacharsis was <lb/>
            come to visit him, and was desirous to see him, and, if possible, <lb/>
            to enter into relations of hospitality with him. But when the <lb/>
            servant had given the message, he was ordered by Solon to reply <lb/>
            to him that, 11 Men generally limited such alliances to their <lb/>
            own countrymen." In reply to this Anacharsis entered the <lb/>
            house, and told the servant that now he was in Solon's country, <lb/>
            and that it was quite consistent for them to become connected <lb/>
            with one another in this way. On this, Solon admired the <lb/>
            readiness of the man, and admitted him, and made him one of <lb/>
            his greatest friends.</p>
          <p>IV. But after some time, when he had returned to Scythia, <lb/>
            and shown a purpose to abrogate the existing institutions of his <lb/>
            country, being exceedingly earnest, in his fondness for Grecian <lb/>
            customs, he was shot by his brother while he was out hunting, <lb/>
            and so he died, saying, " That he was saved on account of the <lb/>
            sense and eloquence which he had brought from Greece, but <lb/>
            slain in consequence of envy in his own family." Some, how- <lb/>
            ever, relate that he was slain while performing some Grecian <lb/>
            sacrificatory rites. And we have written this epigram on him :— <lb/>
            When Anacharsis to his land returned, <lb/>
            His mind was turn'd, so that he wished to make <lb/>
            His countrymen all live in Grecian fashion- <lb/>
            So, ere his words had well escaped his lips, <lb/>
            A winged arrow bore him to the Gods.</p>
          <p>V. He said that a vine bore three bunches of grapes. The <lb/>
            first, the bunch of pleasure ; the second, that of drunkenness; <lb/>
            the third, that of disgust. He also said that he marvelled that <lb/>
            among the Greeks, those who were skilful in a thing contend <lb/>
            together; but those who have no such skill act as judges of the <lb/>
            contest. Being once asked how a person might be made not <lb/>
            fond of drinking, he said, "If he always keeps in view the. <lb/>
            indecorous actions of drunken men." He used also to say, <lb/>
             <pb n="48"/>
            that he marvelled how the Greeks, who make laws against <lb/>
            those who behave with insolence, honour Athletæ because of <lb/>
            their beating one another. When he had been informed that <lb/>
            the sides of a ship were four fingers thick, he said, " That those <lb/>
            who sailed in one were removed by just that distance from <lb/>
            death. He used to say that oil was a provocative of madness, <lb/>
            " because Athlete, when anointed in the oil, attacked one <lb/>
            another with mad fury."</p>
          <p>" How is it," he used to say, " that those who forbid men <lb/>
            to speak falsely, tell lies openly in their vintners' shops?” <lb/>
            It was a saying of his, that he " marvelled why the Greeks, at <lb/>
            the beginning of a banquet, drink out of small cups, but when <lb/>
            they have drunk a good deal, then they turn to large goblets." <lb/>
            And this inscription is on his statues—“ Restrain your tongues, <lb/>
            your appetites, and your passions." He was once asked <lb/>
            if the flute was known among the Scythians ; and he said, " No, <lb/>
            nor the vine either." At another time, the question was put <lb/>
            to him, which was the safest kind of vessel? and he said, <lb/>
            " That which is brought into dock." He said, too, that the <lb/>
            strangest things that he had seen among the Greeks was, that <lb/>
            " They left the smoke* in the mountains, and carried the wood <lb/>
            down to their cities." Once, when he was asked, which were <lb/>
            the more numerous, the living or the dead? he said, " Under <lb/>
            which head do you class those who are at sea." Being re- <lb/>
            proached by an Athenian for being a Scythian, he said, " Well, <lb/>
            my country is a disgrace to me, but you are a disgrace to your <lb/>
            country." When he was asked what there was among men <lb/>
            which was both good and bad, he replied, " The tongue." He <lb/>
            used to say " That it was better to have one friend of great <lb/>
            value, than many friends who were good for nothing." Another <lb/>
            saying of his was, that " The forum was an established place <lb/>
            for men to cheat one another, and behave covetously." Being <lb/>
            once insulted by a young man at a drinking party, he said, <lb/>
            " 0, young man, if now that you are young you cannot bear <lb/>
            wine, when you are old you will have to bear water."</p>
          <p>VI. Of things which are of use in life, he is said to have <lb/>
            been the inventor of the anchor, and of the potter's wheel. <note type="footnote"> * Some propose to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">καρπὸν</foreign>, fruit, instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">καπνὸν</foreign>, smoke, here; <lb/>
            others explain this saying as meaning that the Greeks avoided houses <lb/>
            on the hills in order not to be annoyed with the smoke from the low <lb/>
            cottages, and yet did not use coal, but wood, which made more smoke. </note> <pb n="49"/>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF MYSON.</title>

          <p>I. MYSON, the son of Strymon, as Sosicrates states, quoting <lb/>
            Hermippus as his authority, a Chenean by birth, of some <lb/>

            one was wiser than he, the priestess at Delphi gave the <lb/>
            answer which has been already quoted in the life of Thales <lb/>
            in reference to Chilo :— <lb/>
            I say that Myson the Ættæan sage, <lb/>
            The citizen of Chen, is wiser far <lb/>
            In his deep mind than you.</p>
          <p>And that he, having taken a great deal of trouble, came to the <lb/>
            village, and found him in the summer season fitting a handle <lb/>
            to a plough, and he addressed him, " 0 Myson, this is not <lb/>
            now the season for the plough." " Indeed," said he, " it is a <lb/>
            capital season for preparing one;" but others say, that the <lb/>
            words of the oracle are the Etean sage, and they raise the ques- <lb/>
            tion, what the word Etean means. So Parmenides says, that <lb/>
            it is a borough of Laconia, of which Myson was a native; <lb/>
            but Sosicrates, in his Successions says, that he was an Etean <lb/>
            on his father's side, and a Chenean by his mother's. But <lb/>
            Euthyphron, the son of Heraclides Ponticus, says that he was <lb/>
            a Cretan, for that Etea was a city of Crete.</p>
          <p>II. And Anaxilaus says that he was an Arcadian. Hipponax <lb/>
            also mentions him, saying, "And Myson, whom Apollo stated <note type="footnote"> E </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="50"/>
            to be the most prudent of all men." But Aristoxenus, in his <lb/>
            Miscellanies, says that his habits were not very different from <lb/>
            those of Timon and Apemantus, for that he was a misanthrope. <lb/>
            And that accordingly he was one day found in Lacedæmon <lb/>
            laughing by himself in a solitary place, and when some one <lb/>
            came up to him on a sudden and asked him why he laughed <lb/>
            when he was by himself, he said, " For that very reason." <lb/>
            Aristoxenus also says that he was not thought much of, <lb/>
            because he was not a native of any city, but only of a village, <lb/>
            and that too one of no great note ; and according to him, it is <lb/>
            on account of this obscurity of his that some people attribute <lb/>
            his sayings and doings to Pisistratus the tyrant, but he excepts <lb/>
            Plato the philosopher, for he mentions Myson in his Prota- <lb/>
            goras, placing him among the wise men instead of Periander.</p>
          <p>III. It used to be a common saying of his that men ought <lb/>
            not to seek for things in words, but for words in things; for <lb/>
            that things are not made on account of words, but that words <lb/>
            are put together for the sake of things.</p>
          <p>IV. He died when he had lived ninety-seven years.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF EPIMENIDES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. EPIMENTDES, as Theopompus and many other writers tell <lb/>
            us, was the son of a man named Phsedrus, but some call him <lb/>
            the son of Dosiadas; and others of Agesarchus. He was a <lb/>
            Cretan by birth, of the city of Gnossus ; but because he let his <lb/>
            hair grow long, he did not look like a Cretan.</p>
          <p>II. He once, when be was sent by his father into the fields <lb/>
            to look for a sheep, turned out of the road at mid-day and lay <lb/>
            down in a certain cave and fell asleep, and slept there fifty- <lb/>
            seven years ; and after that, when he awoke, he went on looking <lb/>
            for the sheep, thinking that he had been taking a short nap; <lb/>
            but as he could not find it he went on to the field and there he <lb/>
            found everything changed, and the estate in another person's <lb/>
            possession, and so he came back again to the city in great <lb/>
            perplexity, and as he was going into his own house he met <lb/>
            some people who asked him who he was, until at last he found <lb/>
             <pb n="51"/>
            his younger brother who had now become an old man, and <lb/>
            from him he learnt all the truth.</p>
          <p>III. And when he was recognized he was considered by the <lb/>
            Greeks as a person especially beloved by the Gods, on which <lb/>
            account when the Athenians were afflicted by a plague, and <lb/>
            the priestess at Delphi enjoined them to purify their city, <lb/>
            they sent a ship and Nicias the son of Niceratus to Crete, to <lb/>
            invite Epimenides to Athens ; and he, coming there in the forty- <lb/>
            sixth Olympiad, purified the city and eradicated the plague for <lb/>
            that time ; he took some black sheep and some white ones and <lb/>
            led them up to the Areopagus, and from thence he let them <lb/>
            go wherever they chose, having ordered the attendants to <lb/>
            follow them, and wherever any one of them lay down they <lb/>
            were to sacrifice him to the God who was the patron of the <lb/>
            spot, and so the evil was stayed ; and owing to this one may <lb/>
            even now find in the different boroughs of the Athenians <lb/>
            altars without names, which are a sort of memorial of the <lb/>
            propitiation of the Gods that then took place. Some said that <lb/>
            the cause of the plague was the pollution contracted by the <lb/>
            city in the matter of Cylon, and that Epimenides pointed out <lb/>
            to the Athenians how to get rid of it, and that in consequence <lb/>
            they put to death two young men, Cratinus and Ctesilius, and <lb/>
            that thus the pestilence was put an end to.</p>
          <p>III. And the Athenians passed a vote to give him a talent <lb/>
            and a ship to convey him back to Crete, but he would not <lb/>
            accept the money, but made a treaty of friendship and alliance <lb/>
            between the Gnossians and Athenians.</p>
          <p>IV. And not long after he had returned home he died, as <lb/>
            Phlegon relates in his book on long-lived people, after he had <lb/>
            lived a hundred and fifty-seven years; but as the Cretans <lb/>
            report he had lived two hundred and ninety-nine ; but as <lb/>
            Xenophones the Colophonian, states that he had heard it <lb/>
            reported, he was a hundred and fifty-four years old when he <lb/>
            died.</p>
          <p>V. He wrote a poem of five thousand verses on the Gene- <lb/>
            ration and Theogony of the Curetes and Corybantes, and <lb/>
            another poem of six thousand five hundred verses on the <lb/>
            building of the Argo and the expedition of Jason to Colchis.</p>
          <p>VI. He also wrote a treatise in prose on the Sacrifices <lb/>
            in Crete, and the Cretan Constitution, and on-Minos and <lb/>
            Rhodamanthus, occupying four thousand lines. <note type="footnote"> E 2 </note> <pb n="52"/>
            </p>
          <p>VI. Likewise he built at Athens the temple which is there <lb/>
            dedicated to the venerable goddesses, as Lobon the Augur says <lb/>
            in his book on Poets; and he is said to have been the first <lb/>
            person who purified houses and lands, and who built temples.</p>
          <p>VII. There are some people who assert that he did not <lb/>
            sleep for the length of time that has been mentioned above, <lb/>
            but that he was absent from his country for a considerable <lb/>
            period, occupying himself with the anatomisation and ex- <lb/>
            amination of roots.</p>
          <p>VIII. A letter of his is quoted, addressed to Solon the <lb/>
            lawgiver, in which he discusses the constitution which Minos <lb/>
            gave the Cretans. But Demetrius the Magnesian, in his <lb/>
            treatise on Poets and Prose writers of the same name as one <lb/>
            another, attempts to prove that the letter is a modern one, <lb/>
            and is not written in the Cretan but in the Attic dialect, and <lb/>
            the new Attic too.</p>
          <p>IX. But I have also discovered another letter of his which <lb/>
            runs thus :-</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">EPIMENIDES TO SOLON.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Be of good cheer, my friend ; for if Pisistratus had imposed <lb/>
            his laws on the Athenians, they being habituated to slavery <lb/>
            and not accustomed to good laws previously, he would have <lb/>
            maintained his dominion for ever, succeeding easily in en- <lb/>
            slaving his fellow countrymen ; but as it is, he is lording it over <lb/>
            men who are no cowards, but who remember the precepts of <lb/>
            Solon and are indignant at their bonds, and who will not <lb/>
            endure the supremacy of a tyrant. But if Pisistratus does <lb/>
            possess the city to-day, still I have no expectation that the <lb/>
            supreme power will ever descend to his children. For it is <lb/>
            impossible that men who have lived in freedom and in the <lb/>
            enjoyment of most excellent laws should be slaves perma- <lb/>
            nently ; but as for yourself, do not you go wandering about at <lb/>
            random, but come and visit me, for -here there is no supreme <lb/>
            ruler to be formidable to you ; but if while you are wandering <lb/>
            about any of the friends of Pisistratus should fall in with you, <lb/>
            I fear you might suffer some misfortune.</p>
          <p>He then wrote thus: — <lb/>
            X. But Demetrius says that some writers report that he <lb/>
            used to receive food from the nymphs and keep it in a <lb/>
            bullock's hoof; and that eating it in small quantities he never <lb/>
             <pb n="53"/>
            required any evacuations, and was' never seen eating. And <lb/>
            Timæus mentions him in his second book.</p>
          <p>XI. Some authors say also that the Cretans sacrifice to him <lb/>
            as a god, for they say that be was the wisest of men; and <lb/>
            accordingly, that when he saw the port of Munychia,* at <lb/>
            Athens, he said that the Athenians did not know how many <lb/>
            evils that place would bring upon them: since, if they did, <lb/>
            they would tear it to pieces with their teeth; and he said this <lb/>
            a long time before the event to which he alluded. It is said <lb/>
            also, that he at first called himself Æacus; and that he fore- <lb/>
            told to the Lacedaemonians the defeat which they should suffer <lb/>
            from the Arcadians; and that be pretended that he had lived <lb/>
            several times. But Theopompus, in his Strange Stories, says <lb/>
            that when he was building the temple of the Nymphs, a voice <lb/>
            burst forth from heaven ; — " Oh ! Epimenides, build this <lb/>
            temple, not for the Nymphs but for Jupiter." He also fore- <lb/>
            told to the Cretans the defeat of the Lacedæmonians by the <lb/>
            Arcadians, as has been said before. And, indeed, they were <lb/>
            beaten at Orchomenos.</p>
          <p>XII. He pretended also, that he grew old rapidly, in the <lb/>
            same number of days as he had been years asleep ; at least, <lb/>
            so Theopompus says. But Mysonianus, in his Coincidences, <lb/>
            says, that the Cretans call him one of the Curetes. And the <lb/>
            Lacedæmonians preserve his body among them, in obedience <lb/>
            to some oracle, as Sosilius the Lacedæmonian says.</p>
          <p>XIII. There were also two other Epimenides, one the <lb/>
            genealogist; the other, the man who wrote a history of Rhodes <lb/>
            in the Doric dialect.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF PHERECYDES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. PHERECYDES was a Syrian, the son of Babys, and, as Alex- <lb/>
            ander says, in his Successions, he had been a pupil of Pittacus. <note type="footnote"> * This refers to the result of the war which Antipater, who became <lb/>
            regent of Macedonia on the death of Alexander the Great, carried on <lb/>
            against the confederacy of Greek states, of which Athens was the <lb/>
            head; and in which, after having defeated them at Cranon, he com- <lb/>
            pelled the Athenians to abolish the democracy, and to admit a garrison <lb/>
            into Munychia. </note></p><pb n="54"/>
            
          <p>II. Theopompus says that he was the first person who ever <lb/>
            wrote among the Greeks on the subject of Natural Philosophy <lb/>
            and the Gods. And there are many marvellous stories told of <lb/>
            him. For it is said that he was walking along the sea-shore <lb/>
            at Samos, and that seeing a ship sailing by with a fair wind, he <lb/>
            said that it would soon sink ; and presently it sank before their <lb/>
            eyes. At another time he was drinking some water which had <lb/>
            been drawn up out of a well, and he foretold that within three <lb/>
            days there would be an earthquake ; and there was one. And <lb/>
            as he was going up to Olympia, and had arrived at Messene, <lb/>
            he advised his entertainer, Perilaus, to migrate from the city <lb/>
            with all his family, but that Perilaus would not be guided by <lb/>
            him ; and afterwards Messene was taken.</p>
          <p>III. And he is said to have told the Lacedaemonians to <lb/>
            honour neither gold nor silver, as Theopompus says in his <lb/>
            Marvels ; and it is reported that Hercules laid this injunc- <lb/>
            tion on him in a dream, and that the same night he appeared <lb/>
            also to the kings of Sparta, and enjoined them to be guided by <lb/>
            Pherecydes ; but some attribute these stories to Pythagoras.</p>
          <p>IV. And Hermippus relates that when there was a war <lb/>
            between the Ephesians and Magnesians, he, wishing the Ephe- <lb/>
            sians to conquer, asked some one, who was passing by, from <lb/>
            whence he came ? and when he said, " From Ephesus," " Drag <lb/>
            me now," said he, " by the legs, and place me in the terrritory <lb/>
            of the Magnesians, and tell your fellow countrymen to bury me <lb/>
            there after they hare got the victory; and that he went and re- <lb/>
            ported that Pherecydes had given him this order. And so they <lb/>
            went forth the next day and defeated the Magnesians ; and as <lb/>
            Pherecydes was dead, they buried him there, and paid him <lb/>
            very splendid honours.</p>
          <p>V. But some writers say that he went to Delphi, and threw <lb/>
            himself down from the Corycian hill; Aristoxenus, in his <lb/>
            History of Pythagoras and his Friends, says that Pherecydes <lb/>
            fell sick and died, and was buried by Pythagoras in Delos : <lb/>
            But others say that he died of the lousy disease; and when <lb/>
            Pythagoras came to see him, and asked him how he was, he put <lb/>
            his finger through the door, and said, " You may see by my <lb/>
            skin." And from this circumstance that expression passed <lb/>
            into a proverb among the philosophers, when affairs are going <lb/>
            on badly ; and thos e who apply it to affairs that are go ng on <lb/>
            well, make a blunder. He used to say, also, that the Gods <lb/>
            call their table <foreign xml:lang="grc">θυωϱὸς</foreign>.</p><pb n="55"/>
            
          <p>VI. But Andron, the Ephesian, says that there were two <lb/>
            men of the name of Pherecydes, both Syrians : one an astro- <lb/>
            nomer, and the other a writer on God and the Divine Nature ; <lb/>
            and that this last was the son of Babys, who was also the master <lb/>
            of Pythagoras. But Eratosthenes asserts that there was but <lb/>
            one, who was a Syrian ; and that the other Pherecydes was an <lb/>
            Athenian, a genealogist; and the work of the Syrian Phere- <lb/>
            cydes is preserved, and it begins thus :—" Jupiter, and Time, <lb/>
            and Chthon existed externally." And the name of Cthonia <lb/>
            became Tellus, after Jupiter gave it to her as a reward. A <lb/>
            sun-dial is also preserved, in the island of Syra, of his making.</p>
          <p>VII. But Duris, in the second book of his Boundaries, <lb/>
            says that this epigram was written upon him :— <lb/>
            The limit of all wisdom is in me ; <lb/>
            And would be, were it larger. But report <lb/>
            To my Pythagoras that he's the first <lb/>
            Of all the men that tread the Grecian soil; <lb/>
            I shall not speak a falsehood, saying this.</p>
          <p>And Ion, the Chian, says of him :— <lb/>
            Adorned with valour while alive, and modesty, <lb/>
            Now that he's dead he still exists in peace; <lb/>
            For, like the wise Pythagoras, he studied <lb/>
            The manners and the minds of many nations.</p>
          <p>And I myself have composed an epigram on him in the Phere- <lb/>
            cratean metre:- <lb/>
            The story is reported, <lb/>
            That noble Pherecydes <lb/>
            Whom Syros calls her own, <lb/>
            Was eaten up by lice; <lb/>
            And so he bade his friends, <lb/>
            Convey his corpse away <lb/>
            To the Magnesian land, <lb/>
            That he might victory give <lb/>
            To holy Ephesus. <lb/>
            For well the God had said, <lb/>
            (Though he alone did know <lb/>
            Th' oracular prediction), <lb/>
            That this was fate's decree. <lb/>
            So in that land he lies. <lb/>
            This then is surely true, <lb/>
            That those who're really wise <lb/>
            Are useful while alive, <lb/>
            And e'en when breath has left them.</p><pb n="56"/>
            
          <p>VIII. And he flourished about the fifty-ninth Olympiad. <lb/>
            There is a letter of his extant in the following terms:-</p>

          </ab>
          <p>May you die happily when fate overtakes you. Disease <lb/>
            has seized upon me at the same time that I received your <lb/>
            letter. I am all over lice, and suffering likewise under a low <lb/>
            fever. Accordingly, I have charged my servants to convey this <lb/>
            book of mine to you, after they have buried me. And do you, <lb/>
            if you think fit, after consulting with the other wise men, publish <lb/>
            it; but if you do not approve of doing so, then keep it unpublished, <lb/>
            for I am not entirely pleased with it myself. The subject is <lb/>
            not one about which there is any certain knowledge, nor do I <lb/>
            undertake to say that I have arrived at the truth ; but I have <lb/>
            advanced arguments, from which any one who occupies himself <lb/>
            with speculations on the divine nature, may make a selection ; <lb/>
            and as to other points, he must exercise his intellect, for I <lb/>
            speak obscurely throughout. I, myself, as I am afflicted more <lb/>
            severely by this disease every day, no longer admit any phy- <lb/>
            sicians, or any of my friends. But when they stand at the <lb/>
            door, and ask me how I am, I put out my finger to them through <lb/>
            the opening of the door, and show them how I am eaten up with <lb/>
            the evil; and I desired them to come to-morrow to the funeral <lb/>
            of Pherecydes.</p>
          <p>These, then, are they who were called wise men ; to which <lb/>
            list some writers add the name of Pisistratus. But we must <lb/>
            also speak of the philosophers. And we will begin first with <lb/>
            the Ionic philosophy, the founder of which school was Thales, <lb/>
            who was the master of Anaximander.</p><pb n="57"/>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF ANAXIMANDER.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. ANAXBIANDER, the son of Praxiadas, was a citizen of <lb/>
            Miletus.</p>
          <p>II. He used to assert that the principle and primary element <lb/>
            of all things was the Infinity, giving no exact definition as to <lb/>
            whether he meant air or water, or anything else. And he <lb/>
            said that the parts were susceptible of change, but that the <lb/>
            whole was unchangeable ; and that the earth lay in the middle, <lb/>
            being placed there as a sort of centre, of a spherical shape. <lb/>
            The moon, he said, had a borrowed light, and borrowed it from <lb/>
            the sun ; and the sun he affirmed to be not less than the earth, <lb/>
            and the purest possible fire.</p>
          <p>III. He also was the first discoverer of the gnomon; and he <lb/>
            placed some in Lacedaemon on the sun-dials there, as Pharo- <lb/>
            rinus says in his Universal History, and they showed the solstices <lb/>
            and the equinoxes; he also made clocks. He was the first <lb/>
            person, too, who drew a map of the earth and sea, and he also <lb/>
            made a globe ; and he published a concise statement of what- <lb/>
            ever opinions he embraced or entertained; and this treatise <lb/>
            was met with by Apollodorus, the Athenian.</p>
          <p>IV. And Apollodorus, in his Chronicles, states, that in the <lb/>
            second year of the fifty-eighth Olympiad, he was sixty-four <lb/>
            years old. And soon after he died, having flourished much <lb/>
            about the same time as Polycrates, the tyrant, of Samos. They <lb/>
            say that when he sang, the children laughed; and that he, <lb/>
            hearing of this, said, "We must then sing better for the sake of <lb/>
            the children."</p>
          <p>V. There was also another Anaximander, a historian; and <lb/>
            he too was a Milesian, and wrote in the Ionic dialect.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF ANAXIMENES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. ANAXIMENES, the son of Eurystratus, a Milesian, was a <lb/>
            pupil of Anaximander ; but some say that he was also a pupil <lb/>
            of Parmenides. He said1that the principles of everything <lb/>
             <pb n="58"/>
            were the air, and the Infinite ; and that the stars moved not <lb/>
            under the earth, but around the earth. He wrote in the pure <lb/>
            unmixed Ionian dialect. And he lived, according to the state- <lb/>
            ments of Apollodorus, in the sixty-third Olympiad, and died <lb/>
            about the time of the taking of Sardis.</p>
          <p>II. There were also two other persons of the name of <lb/>
            Anaximenes, both citizens of Lampsacus; one an orator and <lb/>
            the other a historian, who was the son of the sister of the <lb/>
            orator, and who wrote an account of the exploits of Alexander.</p>
          <p>III. And this philosopher wrote the following letters :—</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">ANAXIMENES TO PYTHAGORAS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Thales, the son of Euxamias, has died in his old age, by <lb/>
            an unfortunate accident. In the evening, as he was accus- <lb/>
            tomed to do, he went forth out of the vestibule of his house <lb/>
            with his maid-servant, to observe the stars : and (for he had <lb/>
            forgotten the existence of the place) while he was looking up <lb/>
            towards the skies, he fell down a precipitous place. So now <lb/>
            the astronomer of Miletus has met with this end. But we <lb/>
            who were his pupils cherish the recollection of the man, and <lb/>
            so do our children and our own pupils: and we will lecture on <lb/>
            his principles. At all events, the beginning of all wisdom <lb/>
            ought to be attributed to Thales.</p>
          <p>IV. And again he writes :—</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">ANAXIMENES TO PYTHAGORAS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>You are more prudent than we, in that you have migrated <lb/>
            from Samos to Crotona, and live there in peace. For the <lb/>
            descendants of Æacus commit unheard-of crimes, and tyrants <lb/>
            never cease to oppress the Milesians. The king of the Modes <lb/>
            too is formidable to us : unless, indeed, we choose to become <lb/>
            tributary to him. But the Ionians are on the point of <lb/>
            engaging in war with the Modes in the cause of universal <lb/>
            freedom. For if we remain quiet there is no longer any hope <lb/>
            of safety for us. How then can Anaximenes apply his mind <lb/>
            to the contemplation of the skies, while he is in perpetual <lb/>
            fear of death or slavery ? But you are beloved by the people <lb/>
            of Crotona, and by all the rest of the Italians ; and pupils <lb/>
            flock to you, even from Sicily.</p><pb n="59"/>
            
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF ANAXAGORAS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. ANAXAGORAS, the son of Hegesibulus, or Eubulus, was a <lb/>
            citizen of Clazomenæ. He was a pupil of Anaximenes, and <lb/>
            was the first philosopher who attributed mind to matter, <lb/>
            beginning his treatise on the subject in the following manner <lb/>
            (and the whole treatise is written in a most beautiful and <lb/>
            magnificent style) : " All things were mixed up together ; <lb/>
            then Mind came and arranged them all in distinct order." <lb/>
            On which account he himself got the same name of Mind. <lb/>
            And Timon speaks thus of him in his Silli :— <lb/>
            They say too that wise Anaxagoras <lb/>
            Deserves immortal fame; they call him Mind, <lb/>
            Because, as he doth teach, Mind came in season, <lb/>
            Arranging all which was confus'd before.</p>
          <p>II. He was eminent for his noble birth and for his riches, <lb/>
            and still more so for his magnanimity, inasmuch as he gave up <lb/>
            all his patrimony to his relations ; and being blamed by them <lb/>
            for his neglect of his estate, " Why, then," said he, " do not <lb/>
            you take care of it ?" And at last he abandoned it entirely, <lb/>
            and devoted himself to the contemplation of subjects of natural <lb/>
            philosophy, disregarding politics. So that once when some <lb/>
            said to him, " You have no affection for your country," " Be <lb/>
            silent," said he, " for I have the greatest affection for my <lb/>
            country," pointing up to heaven.</p>
          <p>III. It is said, that at the time of the passage of the <lb/>
            Hellespont by Xerxes, he was twenty years old, and that he <lb/>
            lived to the age of seventy-two. But Apollodorus, in his <lb/>
            Chronicles says that he flourished in the seventieth Olympiad, <lb/>
            and that he died in the first year of the seventy-eighth. And <lb/>
            he began to study philosophy at Athens, in the archonship of <lb/>
            Callias, being twenty years of age, as Demetrius Phalerius <lb/>
            tells us in his Catalogue of the Archons, and they say that he <lb/>
            remained at Athens thirty years.</p>
          <p>IV. He asserted that the sun was a mass of burning iron, <lb/>
            greater than Peloponnesus; (that some attribute this doc- <lb/>
            trine to Tantalus), and that the moon contained houses, and <lb/>
            also hills and ravines : and that the primary elements of <lb/>
            everything were similarities of parts ; for as we say that gold <lb/>
            consists of a quantity of grains combined together, so too <lb/>
            is the universe formed of a number of small bodies of similar <lb/>
             <pb n="60"/>
            parts. He further taught that Mind was the principle of <lb/>
            motion : and that of bodies the heavy ones, such as the earth, <lb/>
            occupied the lower situations ; and the light ones, such as <lb/>
            fire, occupied the higher places, and that the middle spaces <lb/>
            were assigned to water and air. And thus that the sea rested <lb/>
            upon the earth, which was broad, the moisture being all <lb/>
            evaporated by the sun. And he said that the stars originally <lb/>
            moved about in irregular confusion, so that at first the pole <lb/>
            star, which is continually visible, always appeared in the <lb/>
            zenith, but that afterwards it acquired a certain declination. <lb/>
            And that the milky way was a reflection of the light of the <lb/>
            sun when the stars did not appear. The comets he considered <lb/>
            to be a concourse of planets emitting rays : and the shooting <lb/>
            stars he thought were sparks as it were leaping from the <lb/>
            firmament. The winds he thought were caused by the rari- <lb/>
            fication of the atmosphere, which was produced by the sun. <lb/>
            Thunder, he said, was produced by the collision of the clouds ; <lb/>
            and lightning by the rubbing together of the clouds. Earth- <lb/>
            quakes, he said, were produced by the return of the air into <lb/>
            the earth. All animals he considered were originally gene- <lb/>
            rated out of moisture, and heat, and earthy particles: and <lb/>
            subsequently from one another. And males he considered <lb/>
            were derived from those on the right hand, and females from <lb/>
            those on the left.</p>
          <p>V. They say, also, that he predicted a fall of the stones <lb/>
            which fell near Ægospotami, and which be said would fall <lb/>
            from the sun: on which account Euripides, who was a <lb/>
            disciple of his, said in his Phaethon that the sun was a golden <lb/>
            clod of earth. He went once to Olympia wrapped in a <lb/>
            leathern cloak as if it were going to rain; and it did rain. <lb/>
            And they say that he once replied to a man who asked him <lb/>
            whether the mountains at Lampsacus would ever become sea, <lb/>
            " Yes, if time lasts long enough."</p>
          <p>VI. Being once asked for what end he had been born, he <lb/>
            said, " For the contemplation of the sun, and moon, and <lb/>
            heaven." A man once said to him, "You have lost the <lb/>
            Athenians;” “ No," said he, " they have lost me." When he <lb/>
            beheld the tomb of Mausolus, he said, “A costly tomb is an <lb/>
            image of a petrified estate." And he comforted a man who was <lb/>
            grieving because he was dying in a foreign land, by telling <lb/>
            him, " The descent to hell is the same from every place.”</p><pb n="61"/>
            
          <p>VII. He appears to have been the first person (according <lb/>
            to the account given by Pharorinus in his Universal History), <lb/>
            who said that the Poem of Homer was composed in praise of <lb/>
            virtue and justice : and Metro, of Lampsacus, who was a <lb/>
            friend of his, adopted this opinion, and advocated it ener- <lb/>
            getically, and Metrodorus was the first who seriously studied <lb/>
            the natural philosophy developed in the writings of the great <lb/>
            poet.</p>
          <p>VIII. Anaxagoras was also the first man who ever wrote a <lb/>
            work in prose ; and Silenus, in the first book of his Histories, <lb/>
            says, that in the archonship of Lysanias a large stone fell <lb/>
            from heaven ; and that in reference to this event Anaxagoras <lb/>
            said, that the whole heaven was composed of stones, and that <lb/>
            by its rapid revolutions they were all held together ; and when <lb/>
            those revolutions get slower, they fall down.</p>
          <p>IX. Of his trial there are different accounts given. For <lb/>
            Sotion, in his Succession of the Philosophers, says, that he was <lb/>
            persecuted for impiety by Cleon, because he said that the sun <lb/>
            was a fiery ball of iron. And though Pericles, who had been <lb/>
            his pupil, defended him, he was, nevertheless, fined five <lb/>
            talents and banished. But Satyrus, in his Lives, says that it <lb/>
            was Thucydides by whom he was impeached, as Thucydides <lb/>
            was of the opposite party to Pericles; and that he was pro- <lb/>
            secuted not only for impiety, but also for Medison ; and that <lb/>
            he was condemned to death in his absence. And when news <lb/>
            was brought him of two misfortunes-his condemnation, and <lb/>
            the death of his children; concerning the condemnation he <lb/>
            said, " Nature has long since condemned both them and me." <lb/>
            But about his children, he said, " I knew that I had become <lb/>
            the father of mortals." Some, however, attribute this saying <lb/>
            to Solon, and others to Xenophon. And Demetrius Phale- <lb/>
            reus, in his treatise on Old Age, says that Anaxagoras buried <lb/>
            them with his own hands. But Hermippus, in his Lives, says <lb/>
            that he was thrown into prison for the purpose of being put to <lb/>
            death: but that Pericles came forward and inquired if any one <lb/>
            brought any accusation against him respecting his course of <lb/>
            life. And as no one alleged anything against him: " I then," <lb/>
            said he, " am his disciple : do not you then be led away by <lb/>
            calumnies to put this man to death ; but be guided by me, and <lb/>
            release him." And he was -released. But, as be was indignant <lb/>
            at the insult which had been offered to him, he left the city.</p><pb n="62"/>
            
          <p>But Hieronymus, in the second book of his Miscellaneous <lb/>
            Commentaries, says that Pericles produced him before the <lb/>
            court, tottering and emaciated by disease, so that he was <lb/>
            released rather out of pity, than by any deliberate decision on <lb/>
            the merits of his case. And thus much may be said about his <lb/>
            trial. Some people have fancied that he was very hostile to <lb/>
            Democritus, because he did not succeed in getting admission <lb/>
            to him for the purposes of conversation.</p>
          <p>X. And at last, having gone to Lampsacus, he died in that <lb/>
            city. And it is said, that when the governors of the city asked <lb/>
            him what he would ?ike to have done for him, he replied, <lb/>
            “ That they would allow the children to play every year during <lb/>
            the month in which he died." And this custom is kept up <lb/>
            even now. And when he was dead, the citizens of Lampsacus <lb/>
            buried him with great honours, and wrote this epitaph on him :— <lb/>
            Here Anaxagoras lies, who reached of truth <lb/>
            The farthest bounds in heavenly speculations.</p>
          <p>We ourselves also have written an epigram on him:— <lb/>
            Wise Anaxagoras did call the sun <lb/>
            A mass of glowing iron ; and for this <lb/>
            Death was to be his fate. But Pericles <lb/>
            Then saved his friend; but afterwards he died <lb/>
            A victim of a weak philosophy.</p>
          <p>XI. There were also three other people of the name of <lb/>
            Anaxagoras; none of whom combined all kinds of knowledge ; <lb/>
            But one was an orator and a pupil of Isocrates ; another was <lb/>
            a statuary, who is mentioned by Antigonus; another is a <lb/>
            grammarian, a pupil of Zenodotus.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF ARCHELAUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. ARCHRLAUS was a citizen of either Athens or Miletus, and <lb/>
            his father's name was Apollodorus; but, as some say, Mydon. <lb/>
            He was a pupil of Anaxagoras, and the master of Socrates.</p>
          <p>II. He was the first person who imported the study of <lb/>
            natural philosophy from Ionia to Athens, and he was called <lb/>
            the Natural Philosopher, because natural philosophy terminated <lb/>
            with him, as Socrates introduced ethical philosophy. And it <lb/>
            seems probable that Archelaus too meddled in some degree <lb/>
             <pb n="63"/>
            with moral philosophy; for in his philosophical speculations he <lb/>
            discussed laws and what was honourable and just. And Socrates <lb/>
            borrowed from him ; and becaused he enlarged his principles, <lb/>
            he was thought to be the inventor of them.</p>
          <p>III. He used to say that there were two primary causes of <lb/>
            generation, heat and cold ; and that all animals were generated <lb/>
            out of mud : and that what are accounted just and disgraceful <lb/>
            are not so by nature, but only by law. And his reasoning <lb/>
            proceeds in this way. He says, that water being melted by <lb/>
            heat, when it is submitted to the action of fire, by which it is <lb/>
            solidified, becomes earth; and when it is liquefied, becomes <lb/>
            air. And, therefore, the earth is surrounded by air and influ- <lb/>
            enced by it, and so is the air by the revolutions of fire. And <lb/>
            he says that animals are generated out of hot earth, which <lb/>
            sends up a thick mud something like milk for their food. So <lb/>
            too he says that it produced men.</p>
          <p>And he was the first person who said that sound is produced <lb/>
            by the percussion of the air; and that the sea is filtered in <lb/>
            the hollows of the earth in its passage, and so is condensed; <lb/>
            and that the sun is the greatest of the stars, and that the <lb/>
            universe is boundless.</p>
          <p>IV. But there were three other people of the name of <lb/>
            Archelaus : one, a geographer, who described the countries <lb/>
            traversed by Alexander; the second, a man who wrote a poem <lb/>
            on objects which have two natures ; and the third, an orator, <lb/>
            who wrote a book containing the precepts of his art.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF SOCRATES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. SOCRATES was the son of Sophroniscus, a statuary, and of <lb/>
            Phænarete, a midwife ; as Plato records in his Miætetus; he <lb/>
            was a citizen of Athens, of the borough of Alopece.</p>
          <p>II. Some people believed that he assisted Euripides in his <lb/>
            poems ; in reference to which idea, Moresimachus speaks as <lb/>
            follows :— <lb/>
            The Phrygians are a new play of Euripides, <lb/>
            But Socrates has laid the main foundation.* <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">φρύγανα</foreign>, sticks or faggots. </note> <pb n="64"/>
            </p>
          <p>And again he says :— <lb/>
            Euripides : patched up by Socrates.</p>
          <p>And Callias, in his Captives, says :— <lb/>
            A. Are you so proud, giving yourself such airs ? <lb/>
            B. And well I may, for Socrates is the cause.</p>
          <p>And Aristophanes says, in his Clouds :— <lb/>
            This is Euripides, who doth compose <lb/>
            Those argumentative wise tragedies.</p>
          <p>III. But, having been a pupil of Anaxagoras, as some <lb/>
            people say, but of Damon as the other story goes, related <lb/>
            by Alexander in his Successions, after the condemnation of <lb/>
            Anaxagoras, he became a disciple of Archelaus, the natural <lb/>
            philosopher. And, indeed, Aristoxenus says that he was very <lb/>
            intimate with him.</p>
          <p>IV. But Duris says that he was a slave, and employed in <lb/>
            carving stones. And some say that the Graces in the Acropolis <lb/>
            are his work; and they are clothed figures. And that it is in <lb/>
            reference to this that Timon says, in his Silli:— <lb/>
            From them proceeded the stone polisher, <lb/>
            The reasoning legislator, the enchanter <lb/>
            Of all the Greeks, making them subtle arguers, <lb/>
            A cunning pedant, a shrewd Attic quibbler.</p>
          <p>V. For he was very clever in all rhetorical exercises, as <lb/>
            Idomeneus also assures us. But the thirty tyrants forbade <lb/>
            him to give lessons in the art of speaking and arguing, as <lb/>
            Xenophon tells us. And Aristophanes turns him into ridicule <lb/>
            in his Comedies, as making the worse appear the better reason. <lb/>
            For he was the first man, as Pharorinus says in his Universal <lb/>
            History, who, in conjunction with his disciple Æschines, <lb/>
            taught men how to become orators. And Idomeneus makes <lb/>
            the same assertion in his essay on the Socratic School. He, <lb/>
            likewise, was the first person who conversed about human <lb/>
            life; and was also the first philosopher who was condemned <lb/>
            to death and executed. And Aristoxenus, the son of Spin- <lb/>
            tharas, says that he lent money in usury; and that he <lb/>
            collected the interest and principal together, and then, when <lb/>
            he had got the interest, he lent it out again. And Demetrius, <lb/>
            of Byzantium, says that it was Criton who made him leave <lb/>
             <pb n="65"/>
            his workshop and instruct men, out of the admiration which <lb/>
            he conceived for his abilities.</p>
          <p>VI. He then, perceiving that natural philosophy had no <lb/>
            immediate bearing on our interests, began to enter upon <lb/>
            moral speculations, both in his workshop and in the market- <lb/>
            place. And he said that the objects of his search were- <lb/>
            Whatever good or harm can man befall <lb/>
            In his own house.</p>
          <p>And very often, while arguing and discussing points that arose, <lb/>
            he was treated with great violence and beaten, and pulled <lb/>
            about, and laughed at and ridiculed by the multitude. But <lb/>
            he bore all this with great equanimity. So that once, when <lb/>
            he had been kicked and buffeted about, and had borne it all <lb/>
            patiently, and some one expressed his surprise, he said, <lb/>
            " Suppose an ass had kicked me, would you have had me <lb/>
            bring an action against him ?" And this is the account of <lb/>
            Demetrius.</p>
          <p>VII. But he had no need of travelling (though most <lb/>
            philosophers did travel), except when he was bound to serve in <lb/>
            the army. But all the rest of his life he remained in the <lb/>
            same place, and in an argumentative spirit he used to dispute <lb/>
            with all who would converse with him, not with the purpose <lb/>
            of taking away their opinions from them, so much as of learn- <lb/>
            ing the truth, as far as he could do so, himself. And they <lb/>
            say that Euripides gave him a small work of Heraclitus to <lb/>
            read, and asked him afterwards what he thought of it, and he <lb/>
            replied, " What I have understood is good; and so, I think, <lb/>
            what I have not understood is ; only the book requires a <lb/>
            Delian diver to get at the meaning of it." He paid great <lb/>
            attention also to the training of the body, and was always in <lb/>
            excellent condition himself. Accordingly, he joined in the <lb/>
            expedition to Amphipolis, and he it was who took up and <lb/>
            saved Xenophon in the battle of Delian, when he had fallen <lb/>
            from his horse ; for when all the Athenians had fled, he <lb/>
            retreated quietly, turning round slowly, and watching to repel <lb/>
            any one who attacked him. He also joined in the expedition <lb/>
            to Potidæa, which was undertaken by sea; for it was impossible <lb/>
            to get there by land, as the war impeded the communication. <lb/>
            And they say that on this occasion he remained the whole <lb/>
            night in one place; and that though he had deserved the prize <note type="footnote"> F </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="66"/>
            of pre-eminent valour, he yielded it to Alcibiades, to whom <lb/>
            Aristippus, in the fourth book of his treatise on the Luxury <lb/>
            of the Ancients, says that he was greatly attached. But Ion, <lb/>
            of Chios, says, that while he was a very young man he left <lb/>
            Athens, and went to Samos with Archelaus. And Aristotle <lb/>
            says, that he went to Delphi ; and Pharorinus also, in the <lb/>
            first book of his Commentaries, says that he went to the <lb/>
            Isthmus.</p>
          <p>VIlI. He was a man of great firmness of mind, and very <lb/>
            much attached to the democracy, as was plain from his not <lb/>
            submitting to Critias, when he ordered him to bring Leon <lb/>
            of Salamis, a very rich man, before the thirty, for the purpose <lb/>
            of being murdered. And he alone voted for the acquittal of <lb/>
            the ten generals ;* and when it was in his power to escape out <lb/>
            of prison he would not do it; and he reproved those who <lb/>
            bewailed his fate, and even while in prison, he delivered those <lb/>
            beautiful discourses which we still possess.</p>
          <p>IX. He was a contented and venerable man. And once, <lb/>
            as Pamphila says, in the seventh book of her Commen- <lb/>
            taries, when Alcibiades offered him a large piece of ground to <lb/>
            build a house upon, he said, " But if I wanted shoes, and you <lb/>
            had given me a piece of leather to make myself shoes, I should <lb/>
            be laughed at if I took it." And often, when he beheld the <lb/>
            multitude of things which were being sold, he would say to <lb/>
            himself, " How many things are there which I do not want." <lb/>
            And he was continually repeating these iambics :— <lb/>
            For silver plate and purple useful are <lb/>
            For actors on the stage, but not for men.</p>
          <p>And he showed his scorn of Archelaus the Macedonian, and <lb/>
            Scopas the Crononian, and Eurylochus of Larissa, when he <lb/>
            refused to accept their money, and to go and visit them. And <lb/>
            he was so regular in his way of living, that it happened more <lb/>
            than once when there was a plague at Athens, that he was the <lb/>
            only person who did not catch it.</p>
          <p>X. Aristotle says, that he had two wives. The first was <lb/>
            Xanthippe, by whom he had a son named Lamprocles; the <lb/>
            second was Myrto, the daughter of Aristides the Just; and he <lb/>
            took her without any dowry, and by her he had two sons, <lb/>
            Sophroniscus and Menexenus. But some say that Myrto was <note type="footnote"> It After the battle of Arginusæ. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="67"/>
            his first wife. And some, among whom are Satyrus, and <lb/>
            Hieronymus, of Rhodes, say that he had them both at the <lb/>
            same time. For they say that the Athenians, on account of <lb/>
            the scarcity of men, passed a vote, with the view of increasing <lb/>
            the population, that a man might marry one citizen, and <lb/>
            might also have children by another who should be legitimate; <lb/>
            on which account Socrates did so.</p>
          <p>XI. And he was a man able to look down upon any who <lb/>
            mocked him. And he prided himself upon the simplicity of <lb/>
            his way of life; and never exacted any pay from his pupils. <lb/>
            And he used to say, that the man who ate with the greatest <lb/>
            appetite, had the least need of delicacies; and that he who <lb/>
            drank with the greatest appetite, was the least inclined to look <lb/>
            for a draught which is not at hand; and that those who want <lb/>
            fewest things are nearest to the Gods. And thus much, <lb/>
            indeed, one may learn from the comic poets; who, without <lb/>
            perceiving it, praise him in the very matters for which they <lb/>
            ridicule him. Aristophanes speaks thus :— <lb/>
            Prudent man, who thus with justice long for mighty wisdom, <lb/>
            Happiness will be your lot in Athens, and all Greece too; <lb/>
            For you've a noble memory, and plenty of invention, <lb/>
            And patience dwells within your mind, and you are never tired, <lb/>
            Whether you're standing still or walking; and you care not for cold, <lb/>
            Nor do you long for breakfast time, nor e'er give in to hunger; <lb/>
            But wine and gluttony you shun, and and all such kind of follies.</p>
          <p>And Ameipsias introduces him on the stage in a cloak, and <lb/>
            speaks thus of him :— <lb/>
            0 Socrates, among few men the best, <lb/>
            And among many vainest; here at last <lb/>
            You come to us courageously-but where, <lb/>
            Where did you get that cloak ? so strange a garment, <lb/>
            Some leather cutter must have given you <lb/>
            By way of joke : and yet this worthy man, <lb/>
            Though ne'er so hungry, never flatters any one.</p>
          <p>Aristophanes too, exposes his contemptuous and arrogant <lb/>
            disposition, speaking thus :— <lb/>
            You strut along the streets, and look around you proudly, <lb/>
            And barefoot many ills endure, and hold your head above us.</p>
          <p>And yet, sometimes he adapted himself to the occasion and <lb/>
            dressed handsomely. As, for instance, in the banquet of <lb/>
            Plato, where he is represented as going to find Agathon. <note type="footnote"> F 2 </note></p><pb n="68"/>
            
          <p>XII. He was a man of great ability, both in exhorting men <lb/>
            to, and dissuading them from, any course ; as, for instance, <lb/>
            having discoursed with Theætetus on the subject of knowledge, <lb/>
            he sent him away almost inspired, as Plato says. And when <lb/>
            Euthyphron had commenced a prosecution against his father <lb/>
            for having killed a foreigner, he conversed with him on the <lb/>
            subject of piety, and turned him from his purpose: and by his <lb/>
            exhortations he made Lysis a most moral man. For he was <lb/>
            very ingenious at deriving arguments from existing circum- <lb/>
            stances. And so he mollified his son Lamprocles when be <lb/>
            was very angry with his mother, as Xenophon mentions some- <lb/>
            where in his works; and he wrought upon Glauson, the <lb/>
            brother of Plato, who was desirous to meddle with affairs of <lb/>
            state, and induced him to abandon his purpose, because of his <lb/>
            want of experience in such matters, as Xenophon relates. <lb/>
            And, on the contrary, he persuaded Charmidas to devote him- <lb/>
            self to politics, because he was a man very well calculated for <lb/>
            such business. He also inspired Iphicrates, the general, with <lb/>
            courage, by showing him the gamecocks of Midias the barber, <lb/>
            pluming themselves against those of Callias ; and Glauernides <lb/>
            said, that the state ought to keep him carefully, as if he were <lb/>
            a pheasant or a peacock. He used also to say, that it was a <lb/>
            strange thing that every one could easily tell what property <lb/>
            he had, but was not able to name all his friends, or even to <lb/>
            tell their number ; so careless were men on that subject. <lb/>
            Once when he saw Euclid exceedingly anxious about some <lb/>
            dialectic arguments, he said to him, " 0 Euclid, you will <lb/>
            acquire a power of managing sophists, but not of governing <lb/>
            men." For he thought that subtle hair-splitting on those <lb/>
            subjects was quite useless; as Plato also records in the Eu- <lb/>
            thydemus.</p>
          <p>XIII. And when Charmidas offered him some slaves, with <lb/>
            the view to his making a profit of them, he would not have <lb/>
            them; and, as some people say, he paid no regard to the <lb/>
            beauty of Alcibiades.</p>
          <p>XIV. He used to praise leisure as the most valuable of pos- <lb/>
            sessions, as Xenophon tells us in his Banquet. And it was a <lb/>
            saying of his that there was one only good, namely, knowledge ; <lb/>
            and one only evil, namely ignorance; that riches and high <lb/>
            birth had nothing estimable in them, but that, on the contrary, <lb/>
            they were wholly evil. Accordingly, when some one told him <lb/>
             <pb n="69"/>
            that the mother of Antisthenes was a Thracian woman, " Did <lb/>
            you suppose," said he, “ that so noble a man must be born of <lb/>
            two Athenians ?" And when Phædo was reduced to a state <lb/>
            of slavery, he ordered Crito to ransom him, and taught him, <lb/>
            and made him a philosopher.</p>
          <p>XV. And, moreover, he used to learn to play on the lyre <lb/>
            when he had time, saying, that it it was not absurd to learn <lb/>
            anything that one did not know; and further, he used fre- <lb/>
            quently to dance, thinking such an exercise good for the <lb/>
            health of the body, as Xenophon relates in his Banquet.</p>
          <p>XVI. He used also to say that the daemon foretold <lb/>
            the future to him; * and that to begin well was not <lb/>
            a trifling thing, but yet not far from a trifling thing; and <lb/>
            that he knew nothing, except the fact of his ignorance. <lb/>
            Another saying of his was, that those who bought things out of <lb/>
            season, at an extravagant price, expected never to live till the <lb/>
            proper season for them. Once, when he was asked what was <lb/>
            the virtue of a young man, he said, To avoid excess in every- <lb/>
            thing." And he used to say, that it was necessary to learn <lb/>
            geometry only so far as might enable a man to measure land <lb/>
            for the purposes of buying and selling. And when Euripides, <lb/>
            in his Augur, had spoken thus of virtue :— <lb/>
            'Tis best to leave these subjects undisturbed;</p>
          <p>he rose up and left the theatre, saying that it was an absurdity <lb/>
            to think it right to seek for a slave if one could not find him, <lb/>
            but to let virtue be altogether disregarded. The question was <lb/>
            once put to him by a man whether he would advise him to <lb/>
            marry or not ? And he replied, 11 Whichever you do, <lb/>
            you will repent it." He often said, that he wondered <lb/>
            at those who made stone statues, when he saw how careful <lb/>
            they were that the stone should be like the man it was <lb/>
            intended to represent, but how careless they were of them- <lb/>
            selves, as to guarding against being like the stone. He <lb/>
            used also to recommend young men to be constantly looking <lb/>
            in the glass, in order that, if they were handsome, they <lb/>
            might be worthy of their beauty; and if they were ugly, they <note type="footnote"> * " This is not quite correct. Socrates believed that the daemon <lb/>
            which attended him, limited his warnings to his own conduct; pre- <lb/>
            venting him from doing what was wrong, but not prompting him to <lb/>
            do right.”—See Grote's admirable chapter on Socrates. Hist. of Greece, <lb/>
            voL v. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="70"/>
            might conceal their unsightly appearance by their accomplish- <lb/>
            ments. He once invited some rich men to dinner, and when <lb/>
            Xanthippe was ashamed of their insufficient appointments, he <lb/>
            said, "Be of good cheer; for if our guests are sensible men, <lb/>
            they will bear with us ; and if they are not, we need not care <lb/>
            about them." He used to say, " That other men lived to eat, <lb/>
            but that he ate to live." Another saying of his was, " That to <lb/>
            have a regard for the worthless multitude, was like the case of a <lb/>
            man who refused to take one piece of money of four drachmas <lb/>
            as if it were bad, and then took a heap of such coins and ad- <lb/>
            mitted them to be good." When Æschines said, "I am a poor <lb/>
            man, and have nothing else, but I give you myself;” “ Do you <lb/>
            not," he replied, " perceive that you are giving me what is of <lb/>
            the greatest value ?" He said to some one, who was expressing <lb/>
            indignation at being overlooked when the thirty had seized <lb/>
            on the supreme power, " Do you, then, repent of not being a <lb/>
            tyrant too ?" A man said to him, " The Athenians have con- <lb/>
            demned you to death." " And nature," he replied, "has con- <lb/>
            demned them." But some attribute this answer to Anaxagoras. <lb/>
            When his wife said to him, " You die undeservedly." " Would <lb/>
            you, then," he rejoined, " have had me deserve death?" He <lb/>
            thought once that some one appeared to him in a dream, and <lb/>
            said :- <lb/>
            On the third day you'll come to lovely Phthia.</p>
          <p>And so he said to Æschines, " In three days I shall die." And <lb/>
            when he was about to drink the hemlock, Apollodorus <lb/>
            presented him with a handsome robe, that he might expire in <lb/>
            it; and he said, " Why was my own dress good enough to <lb/>
            live in, and not good enough to die in ?" When a person said <lb/>
            to him, “ Such an one speaks ill of you “ To be sure," <lb/>
            said he, “ for he has never learnt to speak well." When An- <lb/>
            tisthenes turned the ragged side of his cloak to the light, he <lb/>
            said, " I see your silly vanity through the holes in your cloak." <lb/>
            When some one said to him, " Does not that man abuse you ?" <lb/>
            " No," said he, " for that does not apply to me." It was a <lb/>
            saying of his, too, " That it is a good thing for a man to offer <lb/>
            himself cheerfully to the attacks of the comic writers ; for <lb/>
            then, if they say anything worth hearing, one will be able to <lb/>
            mend ; and if they do not, then all they say is unimportant."</p>
          <p>XVII. He said once to Xanthippe, who first abused him, <lb/>
             <pb n="71"/>
            and then threw water at him, " Did I not say that Xanthippe <lb/>
            was thundering now, and would soon rain ?" When Alcibiades <lb/>
            said to him, " The abusive temper of Xanthippe is intolerable <lb/>
            " But I," he rejoined, " am used to it, just as I should be if I <lb/>
            were always hearing the noise of a pulley ; and you yourself <lb/>
            endure to hear geese cackling." To which Alcibiades answered, <lb/>
            " Yes, but they bring me eggs and goslings." " Well," rejoined <lb/>
            Socrates, " and Xanthippe brings me children." Once, she <lb/>
            attacked him in the market-place, and tore his cloak off; his <lb/>
            friends advised him to keep her off with his hands ; " Yes, <lb/>
            by Jove," said he, " that while we are boxing you may all cry <lb/>
            out, ‘ Well done, Socrates, well done, Xanthippe.'" And he used <lb/>
            to say, that one ought to live with a restive woman, just as <lb/>
            horsemen manage violent-tempered horses; " and as they," <lb/>
            said he, " when they have once mastered them, are easily able <lb/>
            to manage all others; so I, after managing Xanthippe, can <lb/>
            easily live with any one else whatever."</p>
          <p>XVIII. And it was in consequence of such sayings and <lb/>
            actions as these, that the priestess at Delphi was witness in <lb/>
            his favour, when she gave Chærephon this answer, which is so <lb/>
            universally known :— <lb/>
            Socrates of all mortals is the wisest.</p>
          <p>In consequence of which answer, he incurred great envy ; and <lb/>
            he brought envy also on himself, by convicting men who gave <lb/>
            themselves airs of folly and ignorance, as undoubtedly he did <lb/>
            to Anytus ; and as is shown In Plato's Meno. For he, not <lb/>
            being able to bear Socrates' jesting, first of all set Aristophanes <lb/>
            to attack him, and then persuaded Melitus to institute a pro- <lb/>
            secution against him, on the ground of impiety and of corrupt- <lb/>
            ing the youth of the city. Accordingly Melitus did institute <lb/>
            the prosecution ; and Polyeuctus pronounced the sentence, as <lb/>
            Pharorinus records in his Universal History. And Polycrates, <lb/>
            the sophist, wrote the speech which was delivered, as Her- <lb/>
            mippus says, not Anytus, as others say. And Lycon, the <lb/>
            demagogue, prepared everything necessary to support the im- <lb/>
            peachment ; but Antisthenes in his Successions of the Phi- <lb/>
            losophers, and Plato in his Apology, say that these men <lb/>
            brought the accusation :—Anytus, and Lycon, and Melitus ; <lb/>
            Anytus, acting against him on behalf of the magistrates, and <lb/>
             <pb n="72"/>
            because of his political principles ; Lycon, on behalf of the <lb/>
            orators; and Melitus on behalf of the poets, all of whom <lb/>
            Socrates used to pull to pieces. But Pharorinus, in the first <lb/>
            book of his Commentaries, says, that the speech of Polycrates <lb/>
            against Socrates is not the genuine one ; for in it there is <lb/>
            mention made of the walls having been restored by Conon, <lb/>
            which took place six years after the death of Socrates ; and <lb/>
            certainly this is true.</p>
          <p>XIX. But the sworn informations, on which the trial pro- <lb/>
            ceeded, were drawn up in this fashion ; for they are preserved <lb/>
            to this day, says Pharorinus, in the temple of Cybele:—“Me- <lb/>
            litus, the son of Melitus, of Pittea, impeaches Socrates, the son <lb/>
            of Sophroniscus, of Alopece : Socrates is guilty, inasmuch as he <lb/>
            does not believe in the Gods whom the city worships, but in- <lb/>
            troduces other strange deities ; he is also guilty, inasmuch as he <lb/>
            corrupts the young men, and the punishment he has incurred <lb/>
            is death."</p>
          <p>XX. But the philosopher, after Lysias had prepared a de- <lb/>
            fence for him, read it through, and said—“ It is a very fine <lb/>
            speech, Lysias, but is not suitable for me; for it was manifestly <lb/>
            the speech of a lawyer, rather than of a philosopher." And <lb/>
            when Lysias replied, " How is it possible, that if it is a good <lb/>
            speech, it should not be suitable to you ?’ he said, " Just as <lb/>
            fine clothes and handsome shoes would not be suitable to me." <lb/>
            And when the trial was proceeding, Justus, of Tiberias, in his <lb/>
            Garland, says that Plato ascended the tribune and said, " I, <lb/>
            men of Athens, being the youngest of all those who have mounted <lb/>
            the tribune ... and that he was interrupted by the judges, <lb/>
            who cried out <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰαταβάντων</foreign>, that is to say, ' Come down.'</p>
          <p>XXI. So when he had been condemned by two hundred and <lb/>
            eighty-one votes, being six more than were given in his favour, <lb/>
            and when the judges were making an estimate of what punish- <lb/>
            ment or fine should be inflicted on him, he said that he ought <lb/>
            to be fined five and twenty drachmas ; but Eubulides says that <lb/>
            he admitted that he deserved a fine of one hundred. And <lb/>
            when the judges raised an outcry at this proposition, he said, <lb/>
            " My real opinion is, that as a return for what has been done <lb/>
            by me, I deserve a maintenance in the Prytaneum for the rest <lb/>
            of my life." So they condemned him to death, by eighty votes <lb/>
            more than they had originally found him guilty. And he was <lb/>
            put into prison, and a few days afterwards he drank the hem- <lb/>
             <pb n="73"/>
            lock, having held many admirable conversations in the mean- <lb/>
            time, which Plato has recorded in the Phædo.</p>
          <p>XXII. He also, according to some accounts, composed a <lb/>
            paean, which begins- <lb/>
            Hail Apollo, King of Delos, <lb/>
            Hail Diana, Leto's child.</p>
          <p>But Dionysidorus says that this pæan is not his. He also com- <lb/>
            posed a fable, in the style of Æsop, not very artistically, and <lb/>
            it begins- <lb/>
            Æsop one day did this sage counsel give <lb/>
            To the Corinthian magistrates: not to trust <lb/>
            The cause of virtue to the people's judgment.</p>
          <p>XXIII. So he died; but the Athenians immediately <lb/>
            repented* of their action, so that they closed all the palæstræ <lb/>
            and gymnasia; and they banished his accusers, and condemned <lb/>
            Melitus to death; but they honoured Socrates with a brazen <lb/>
            statue, which they erected in the place where the sacred vessels <lb/>
            are kept; and it was the work of Lysippus. But Anytus had <lb/>
            already left Athens ; and the people of Heraclea banished him <lb/>
            from that city the day of his arrival. But Socrates was not <lb/>
            the only person who met with this treatment at the hands of <lb/>
            the Athenians, but many other men received the same : for, <lb/>
            as Heraclides says, they fined Homer fifty drachmas as a mad- <lb/>
            man, and they said that Iystæus was out of his wits. But they <lb/>
            honoured Astydamas, before Æschylus, with a brazen statue. <lb/>
            And Euripides reproaches them for their conduct in his Pala- <lb/>
            medes, saying- <lb/>
            Ye have slain, ye have slain, <lb/>
            0 Greeks, the all-wise nightingale, <lb/>
            The favourite of the Muses, guiltless all.</p>
          <p>And enough has been said on this head.</p>
          <p>But Philochorus says that Euripides died before Socrates ; <lb/>
            and he was born, as Apollodorus in his Chronicles asserts, in <lb/>
            the archonship of Apsephion, in the fourth year of the seventy- <lb/>
            seventh Olympiad, on the sixth day of the month Thargelion, <lb/>
            when the Athenians purify their city, and when the citizens <lb/>
            of Delos say that Diana was born. And he died in the first <note type="footnote">* Grote gives good reasons for disbelieving this. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="74"/>
            year of the ninety-fifth Olympiad, being seventy years of age. <lb/>
            And this is the calculation of Demetrius Phalereus, for some <lb/>
            say that he was but sixty years old when he died.-</p>
          <p>XXIV. Both he and Euripides were pupils of Anaxagoras ; <lb/>
            and Euripides was born in the first year of the seventy-fifth <lb/>
            Olympiad, in the archonship of Calliades. But Socrates <lb/>
            appears to me to have also discussed occasionally subjects of <lb/>
            natural philosophy, since he very often disputes about prudence <lb/>
            and foresight, as Xenophon tells us; although he at the same <lb/>
            time asserts that all his conversations were about moral phi- <lb/>
            losophy. And Plato, in his Apology, mentions the principles <lb/>
            of Anaxagoras and other natural philosophers, which Socrates <lb/>
            denies ; and he is in reality expressing his own sentiments <lb/>
            about them, though he attributes them all to Socrates. And <lb/>
            Aristotle tells us that a certain one of the Magi came from <lb/>
            Syria to Athens, and blamed Socrates for many parts of his <lb/>
            conduct, and also foretold that he would come to a violent <lb/>
            death. And we ourselves have written this epigram on him— <lb/>
            Drink now, 0 Socrates, in the realms of Jove, <lb/>
            For truly did the God pronounce you wise, <lb/>
            And he who said so is himself all wisdom : <lb/>
            You drank the poison which your country gave, <lb/>
            But they drank wisdom from your godlike voice.</p>
          <p>XXV. He -had, as Aristotle tells us in the third book of his <lb/>
            Poetics, a contest with a man of the name of Antiolochus of <lb/>
            Lemnos, and with Antipho, an interpreter of prodigies, as <lb/>
            Pythagoras had with Cylon of Crotona ; and Homer while <lb/>
            alive with Sagaris, and after his death with Xenophanes the <lb/>
            Colophonian ; and Hesiod, too, in his lifetime with Cereops, <lb/>
            and after his death with the same Xenophanes; and Pindar <lb/>
            with Aphimenes of Cos ; and Thales with Pherecydes; and <lb/>
            Bias with Salamis of Priene ; and Pittacus with Antimenides ; <lb/>
            and Cellæus and Anaxagoras with Sosibrius; and Simonides <lb/>
            with Timocrea.</p>
          <p>XXVI. Of those who succeeded him, and who are called the <lb/>
            Socratic school, the chiefs were Plato, Xenophon, and Antis- <lb/>
            thenes : and of the ten, as they are often called, the four most <lb/>
            eminent were Æschines, Phædo, Euclides, and Aristippus. <lb/>
            But we must first speak of Xenophon, and after him of An- <lb/>
            tisthenes among the Cynics. Then of the Socratic school, and <lb/>
             <pb n="75"/>
            so about Plato, since he is the chief of the ten sects, and the <lb/>
            founder of the first Academy. And the regular series of them <lb/>
            shall proceed in this manner.</p>
          <p>XXVII. There was also another Socrates, a historian, who <lb/>
            wrote a description of Argos ; and another, a peripatetic philo- <lb/>
            sopher, a native of Bithynia; and another a writer of epi- <lb/>
            grams ; and another a native of Cos, who wrote invocations to <lb/>
            the Gods.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF XENOPHON.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. XENOPHON, the son of Gryllus, a citizen of Athens, was of <lb/>
            the borough of Erchia; and he was a man of great modesty, <lb/>
            and as handsome as can be imagined.</p>
          <p>II. They say that Socrates met him in a narrow lane, and <lb/>
            put his stick across it, and prevented him from passing by, <lb/>
            asking him where all kinds of necessary things were sold. And <lb/>
            when he had answered him, he asked him again where men <lb/>
            where made good and virtuous. And as he did dot know, he <lb/>
            said, " Follow me, then, and learn." And from this time <lb/>
            forth, Xenophon became a follower of Socrates.</p>
          <p>III. And he was the first person who took down conversa- <lb/>
            tions as they occurred, and published them among men, <lb/>
            calling them memorabilia. He was also the first man who <lb/>
            wrote a history of philosophers.</p>
          <p>IV. And Aristippus, in the fourth book of his treatise on <lb/>
            Ancient Luxury, says that he loved Clinias ; and that he said to <lb/>
            him, " Now I look upon Clinias with more pleasure than upon all <lb/>
            the other beautiful things which are to be seen among men ; and <lb/>
            I would rather be blind as to all the rest of the world, than as <lb/>
            to Clinias. And I am annoyed even with night and with sleep, <lb/>
            because then I do not see him ; but I am very grateful to the <lb/>
            sun and to daylight, because they show Clinas to me."</p>
          <p>V. He became a friend of Cyrus in this manner He <lb/>
            had an acquaintance, by name Proxenus, a Boeotian by birth, <lb/>
            a pupil of Gorgias of Leontini, and a friend of Cyrus. He being <lb/>
            in Sardis, staying at the court of Cyrus, wrote a letter to Athens <lb/>
             <pb n="76"/>
            to Xenophon, inviting him to come and be afriend of Cyrus. And <lb/>
            Xenophon showed the letter to Socrates, and asked his advice. <lb/>
            And Socrates bade him go to Delphi, and ask counsel of the <lb/>
            God. And Xenophon did so, and went to the God ; but the <lb/>
            question he put was, not whether it was good for him to go to <lb/>
            Cyrus or not, but how he should go ; for which Socrates <lb/>
            blamed him, but still advised him to go. Accordingly he went <lb/>
            to Cyrus, and became no less dear to him than Proxenus. <lb/>
            And all the circumstances of the expedition and the retreat, he <lb/>
            himself has sufficiently related to us.</p>
          <p>VI. But lie was at enmity with Menon the Pharsalian, who <lb/>
            was the commander of the foreign troops at the time of the <lb/>
            expedition ; and amongst other reproaches, he says that he <lb/>
            was much addicted to the worst kind of debauchery. And he <lb/>
            reproaches a man of the name of Apollonides with having his <lb/>
            ears bored.</p>
          <p>VII. But after the expedition, and the disasters which took <lb/>
            place in Pontus, and the violations of the truce by Seuthes, <lb/>
            the king of the Odrysæ, he came into Asia to Agesilaus, the <lb/>
            king of Lacedæmon, bringing with him the soldiers of Cyrus, <lb/>
            to serve for pay; and he became a very great friend of <lb/>
            Agesilaus. And about the same time he was condemned to <lb/>
            banishment by the Athenians, on the charge of being a fa- <lb/>
            vourer of the Lacedæmonians. And being in Ephesus, and <lb/>
            having a sum of money in gold, he gave half of it to Mega- <lb/>
            byzus, the priest of Diana, to keep for him till his return ; and <lb/>
            if he never returned, then he was to expend it upon a statue, <lb/>
            and dedicate that to the Goddess ; and with the other half he <lb/>
            sent offerings to Delphi. From thence he went with Agesilaus <lb/>
            into Greece, as Agesilaus was summoned to take part in the <lb/>
            war against the Thebans. And the Lacedæmonians made him <lb/>
            a friend of their city.</p>
          <p>VIII. After this he left Agesilaus and went to Scillus, which <lb/>
            is a strong place in the district of Elis, at no great distance <lb/>
            from the city. And a woman followed him, whose name was <lb/>
            Philesia, as Demetrius the Magnesian relates; and his sons, <lb/>
            Gryllus and Diodorus, as Dinarchus states in the action against <lb/>
            Xenophon ;* and they were also called Dioscuri. And when <note type="footnote">* The Greek is, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν τῳ̃ πρὸς Ξενοφω̃να ἀποστασίου</foreign>—“ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποστασίου <lb/>

            Megabyzus came into the country, on the occasion of some <lb/>
            public assembly, he took back the money and bought a piece of <lb/>
            ground, and consecrated it to the Goddess ; and a river named <lb/>
            Selinus, which is the same name as that of the river at Ephe- <lb/>
            sus, flows through the land. And there he continued hunting, <lb/>
            and entertaining his friends, and writing histories. But Di- <lb/>
            narchus says that the Lacedaemonians gave him a house and <lb/>
            land, Theysayalso that Philopides,the Spartan, sent him there, <lb/>
            as a present, some slaves, who had been taken prisoners of war, <lb/>
            natives of Dardanus, and that he located them as he pleased. <lb/>
            And that the Eleans, having made an expedition against <lb/>
            Scillus, took the place, as the Lacedæmonians dawdled in <lb/>
            coming to its assistance.</p>
          <p>IX. But then his sons escaped privily to Lepreum, with a <lb/>
            few servants; and Xenophon himself fled to Elis before the <lb/>
            place fell ; and from thence he went to Lepreum to his chil- <lb/>
            dren, and from thence he escaped in safety to Corinth, and <lb/>
            settled in that city.</p>
          <p>X. In the meantime, as the Athenians had passed a vote <lb/>
            to go to the assistance of the Lacedaemonians, he sent his sons <lb/>
            to Athens, to join in the expedition in aid of the Lacedæ- <lb/>
            monians ; for they had been educated in Sparta, as Diodes <lb/>
            relates in his Lives of the Philosophers. Diodorus returned <lb/>
            safe back again, without having at all distinguished himself in <lb/>
            the battle. And he had a son who bore the same name as his <lb/>
            brother Gryllus. But Gryllus, serving in the cavalry, (and <lb/>
            the battle took place at Mantinea,) fought very gallantly, and <lb/>
            was slain, as Ephorus tells us, in his twenty-fifth book; <lb/>
            Cephisodorus being the Captain of the cavalry, and Hegesides <lb/>
            the commander-in-chief. Epaminondas also fell in this <lb/>
            battle. And after the battle, they say that Xenophon offered <lb/>
            sacrifice, wearing a crown on his head; but when the news <lb/>
            of the death of his son arrived, he took off the crown; <lb/>
            but after that, hearing that he had fallen gloriously, he put <lb/>
            the crown on again. And some say that he did not even shed <lb/>
            a tear, but said, " I knew that I was the father of a mortal <lb/>
            man." And Aristotle says, that innumerable writers wrote <lb/>
            panegyrics and epitaphs upon Gryllus, partly out of a wish to <lb/>
            gratify his father. And Hermippus, in his Treatise on Theo- <lb/>
            phrastus, says that Isocrates also composed a panegyric on <lb/>
            Gryllus. But Timon ridicules him in these words :— <lb/>
             <pb n="78"/>
            A silly couplet, or e'en triplet of speeches, <lb/>
            Or longer series still, just such as Xenophon <lb/>
            Might write, or Meagre jEschines.</p>
          <p>Such, then, was the life of Xenophon.</p>
          <p>XI. And he flourished about the fourth year of the ninety- <lb/>
            fourth Olympiad ; and he took part in the expedition of Cyrus, <lb/>
            in the archonship of Xenænetus, the year before the death of <lb/>
            Socrates. And he died, as Stesiclides the Athenian states in <lb/>
            his List of Archons and Conquerors at Olympia, in the first <lb/>
            year of the hundred and fifth Olymiad, in the archonship of <lb/>
            Callidemides ; in which year, Philip the son of Amyntas began <lb/>
            to reign over the Macedonians. And he died at Corinth, as <lb/>
            Demetrius the Magnesian says, being of a very advanced age.</p>
          <p>XII. And he was a man of great distinction in all points, and <lb/>
            very fond of horses and of dogs, and a great tactician, as is <lb/>
            manifest from his writings. And he was a pious man, fond of <lb/>
            sacrificing to the Gods, and a great authority as to what was <lb/>
            due to them, and a very ardent admirer and imitator of <lb/>
            Socrates.</p>
          <p>XLII. He also wrote near forty books ; though different <lb/>
            critics divide them differently. He wrote an account of the <lb/>
            expedition of Cyrus, to each book of which work he prefixed a <lb/>
            summary, though he gave none of the whole history. He also <lb/>
            wrote the Cyropædia, and a history of Greece, and Memorabilia <lb/>
            of Socrates, and a treatise called the Banquet, and an essay on <lb/>
            (Economy, and one on Horsemanship, and one on Breaking <lb/>
            Dogs, and one on Managing Horses, and a Defence of Socrates, <lb/>
            and a Treatise on Revenues, and one called Hiero, or the <lb/>
            Tyrant, and one called Agesilaus ; one on the Constitution of <lb/>
            the Athenians and Lacedæmonians, which, however, Demetrius <lb/>
            the Magnesian says is not the work of Xenophon. It is said, <lb/>
            also, that he secretly got possession of the books of Thucydides, <lb/>
            which were previously unknown, and himself published them.</p>
          <p>XIV. He was also called the Attic Muse, because of the <lb/>
            sweetness of his diction, in respect of which he and Plato felt a <lb/>
            spirit of rivalry towards one another, as we shall relate further <lb/>
            in our life of Plato. And we ourselves have composed an <lb/>
            epigram on him, which runs thus .— <lb/>
            Not only up to Babylon for Cyrus <lb/>
            Did Xenophon go, but now he's mounted up <lb/>
             <pb n="79"/>
            The path which leads to Jove's eternal realms-- <lb/>
            For he, recounting the great deeds of Greece, <lb/>
            Displays his noble genius, and he shows <lb/>
            The depth of wisdom of his master Socrates.</p>
          <p>And another which ends thus :— <lb/>
            0 Xenophon, if th' ungrateful countrymen <lb/>
            Of Cranon and Cecrops, banished you, <lb/>
            Jealous of Cyrus' favour which he show'd you, <lb/>
            Still hospitable Corinth, with glad heart, <lb/>
            Received you, and you lived there happily, <lb/>
            And so resolved to stay in that fair city.</p>
          <p>XV. But I have found it stated in some places that he <lb/>
            flourished about the eighty-ninth Olympiad, at the same time <lb/>
            as the rest of the disciples of Socrates. And Ister says, that <lb/>
            he was banished by a decree of Eubulus, and that he was <lb/>
            recalled by another decree proposed by the same person.</p>
          <p>XVI. But there were seven people of the name of Xenophon. <lb/>
            First of all, this philosopher of ours; secondly, an Athenian, <lb/>
            a brother of Pythostratus, who wrote the poem called the <lb/>
            Theseid, and who wrote other works too, especially the lives <lb/>
            of Epaminondas and Pelopidas ; the third was a physician of <lb/>
            Cos ; the fourth, a man who wrote a history of Alcibiades ; <lb/>
            the fifth, was a writer who composed a book full of fabulous <lb/>
            prodigies ; the sixth, a citizen of Paras, a sculptor; the <lb/>
            seventh, a poet of the Old Comedy.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF ÆSCHINES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. ÆsCHINES was the son of Charinus, the sausage-maker, <lb/>
            but, as some writers say, of Lysanias; he was a citizen of <lb/>
            Athens, of an industrious disposition from his boyhood upwards, <lb/>
            on which account he never quitted Socrates.</p>
          <p>II. And this induced Socrates to say, the only one who <lb/>
            knows how to pay us proper respect is the son of the sausage- <lb/>
            seller. Idomeneus asserts, that it was he who, in the prison, <lb/>
            tried to persuade Socrates to make his escape, and not Crito. <lb/>
            But that Plato, as he was rather inclined to favour Aristippus, <lb/>
            attributed his advice to Crito.</p>
          <p>III. And JEschines was calumniated on more than one occa- <lb/>
             <pb n="80"/>
            sion ; and especially by Menedemus of Eretria, who states that <lb/>
            he appropriated many dialogues of Socrates as his own, having <lb/>
            procured them from Xanthippe. And those of them which are <lb/>
            called " headless," are exceedingly slovenly performances, <lb/>
            showing nothing of the energy of Socrates. And Pisistratus, <lb/>
            of Ephesus, used to say, that they were not the work of <lb/>
            Æschines. There are seven of them, and most of them are <lb/>
            stated by Persæus to be the work of Pasiphon, of Eretria, and <lb/>
            to have been inserted by him among the works of Æschines. <lb/>
            And he plagiarised from the Little Cyrus, and the Lesser <lb/>
            Hercules, of Antisthenes, and from the Alcibiades, and from <lb/>
            the Dialogues of the other philosophers. The Dialogues then <lb/>
            of Æschines, which profess to give an idea of the system of <lb/>
            Socrates are, as I have said, seven in number. First of all, <lb/>
            the Miltiades, which is rather weak; the Callias, the Axio- <lb/>
            chus, the Aspasia, the Alcibiades, the Jelanges, and the Rhino. <lb/>
            And they say that he, being in want, went to Sicily, to Diony- <lb/>
            sius, and was looked down upon by Plato, but supported by <lb/>
            Aristippus, and that he gave Dionysius some of his dialogues, <lb/>
            and received presents for them.</p>
          <p>IV. After that he came to Athens, and there be did not <lb/>
            venture to practise the trade of a sophist, as Plato and Ari- <lb/>
            stippus were in high reputation there. But he gave lectures <lb/>
            for money, and wrote speeches to be delivered in the courts of <lb/>
            law for persons under prosecution. On which account, Timon <lb/>
            said of him, " The speeches of Æschines which do not convince <lb/>
            any one." And they say that when he was in great straights <lb/>
            through poverty, Socrates advised him to borrow of himself, <lb/>
            by deducting some part of his expenditure in his food.</p>
          <p>V. And even Aristippus suspected the genuineness of some <lb/>
            of his Dialogues ; accordingly, they say that when he was <lb/>
            reciting some of them at Megara, he ridiculed him, and said <lb/>
            to him, " Oh ! you thief ; where did you get that ?"</p>
          <p>VI. And Polycritus, of Menda, in the first book of his <lb/>
            History of Dionysius, says that he lived with the tyrant till <lb/>
            he was deposed, and till the return of Dion to Syracuse; and <lb/>
            he says that Caramis, the tragedian, was also with him. And <lb/>
            there is extant a letter of Æschines addressed to Dionysius.</p>
          <p>VII. But he was a man well versed in rhetorical art, as is <lb/>
            plain from the defence of his father Phœax, the general; and <lb/>
            from the works which he wrote in especial imitation of Gorgias, <lb/>
             <pb n="81"/>
            of Leontini. And Lysias wrote an oration against him ; <lb/>
            entitling it, On Sycophancy; from all which circumstances it <lb/>
            is plain that he was a skilful orator. And one man is spoken <lb/>
            of as his especial friend, Aristotle, who was surnamed The <lb/>
            Table.</p>
          <p>VIII. Now Panætius thinks that the Dialogues of the <lb/>
            following disciples of the Socratic school are all genuine,- <lb/>
            Plato, Xenophon, Antisthenes, and Æschines ; but he doubts <lb/>
            about those which go under the names of Phædon, and <lb/>
            Euclides ; and he utterly repudiates all the others.</p>
          <p>IX. And there were eight men of the name of JEschines. <lb/>
            The first, this philosopher of ours ; the second was a man who <lb/>
            wrote a treatise on Oratorical Art; the third was the orator <lb/>
            who spoke against Demosthenes ; the fourth was an Arcadian, <lb/>
            a disciple of Isocrates ; the fifth was a citizen of Mitylene, <lb/>
            whom they used to call the Scourge of the Orators; the sixth <lb/>
            was a Neapolitan, a philosopher of the Academy, a disciple <lb/>
            and favourite, of Melanthius, of Rhode ; the seventh was a <lb/>
            Milesian, a political writer; the eighth was a statuary.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF ARISTIPPUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. ARISTIPPUS was by birth a Cyrenean. but he came to <lb/>
            Athens, as Æschines says, having been attracted thither by <lb/>
            the fame of Socrates.</p>
          <p>II. He, having professed himself a Sophist, as Phanias, of <lb/>
            Eresus, the Peripatetic, informs us, was the first of the pupils <lb/>
            of Socrates who exacted money from his pupils, and who sent <lb/>
            money to his master. And once he sent him twenty drach- <lb/>
            mas, but had them sent back again, as Socrates said that his <lb/>
            daemon would not allow him to accept them ; for, in fact, he <lb/>
            was indignant at having them offered to him. And Xenophon <lb/>
            used to hate him ; on which account he wrote his book against <lb/>
            pleasure as an attack upon Aristippus, and assigned the main <lb/>
            argument to Socrates. Theodorus also, in his Treatise on <lb/>
            Sects, has attacked him severely, and so has Plato in his <lb/>
            book on the Soul, as we have mentioned in another place.</p>
          <p>III. But he was a man very quick at adapting himself to <note type="footnote"> G</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="82"/>
            every kind of place, and time, and person,* and he easily <lb/>
            supported every change of fortune. For which reason he was <lb/>
            in greater favour with Dionysius than any of the others, as he <lb/>
            always made the best of existing circumstances. For he <lb/>
            enjoyed what was before him pleasantly, and he did not toil <lb/>
            to procure himself the enjoyment of what was not present. <lb/>
            On which account Diogenes used to call him the king's dog. <lb/>
            And Timon used to snarl at him as too luxurious, speaking <lb/>
            somewhat in this fashion :— <lb/>
            Like the effeminate mind of Aristippus, <lb/>
            Who, as he said, by touch could judge of falsehood.</p>
          <p>They say that he once ordered a partridge to be bought for <lb/>
            him at the price of fifty drachmas ; and when some one blamed <lb/>
            him, " And would not you," said he, " have bought it if it had <lb/>
            cost an obol ?" And when he said he would, " Well,” replied <lb/>
            Aristippus, "fifty drachmas are no more to me." Dionysius <lb/>
            once bade him select which he pleased of three beautiful <lb/>
            courtesans ; and he carried off all three, saying that even <lb/>
            Paris did not get any good by prefering one beauty to the <lb/>
            rest. However, they say, that when he had carried them as <lb/>
            far as the vestibule, he dismissed them; so easily inclined <lb/>
            was he to select or to disregard things. On which account <lb/>
            Strato, or, as others will have it, Plato, said to him, " You are <lb/>
            the only man to whom it is given to wear both a whole cloak <lb/>
            and rags." Once when Dionysius spit at him, he put up with <lb/>
            it; and when some one found fault with him, he said, " Men <lb/>
            endure being wetted by the sea in order to catch a tench, <lb/>
            and shall not I endure to be sprinkled with wine to catch a <lb/>
            sturgeon ?"</p>
          <p>IV. Once Diogenes, who was washing vegetables, ridiculed <lb/>
            him as he passed by, and said, " If you had learnt to eat these <lb/>
            vegetables, you would not have been a slave in the palace of a <lb/>
            tyrant." But Aristippus replied, " And you, if you had known <lb/>
            how to behave among men, would not have been washing <lb/>
            vegetables." Being asked once what advantage he had derived <lb/>
            from philosophy, he said, " The power of associating confidently <note type="footnote"> * This is exactly the character that Horace gives of him :— <lb/>
             <lb/>
            Omnis Aristippum decuit color et status et res ; <lb/>
            Tentantem majora, fere præsentibus æquum.— <lb/>
            Ep. i. 23, 24. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="83"/>
            with every body." When he was reproached for living extra- <lb/>
            vagantly, he replied, " If extravagance had been a fault, it <lb/>
            would not have had a place in the festivals of the Gods." At <lb/>
            another time he was asked what advantage philosophers had <lb/>
            over other men; and he replied, " If all the laws should be <lb/>
            abrogated, we should still live in the same manner as we do <lb/>
            now." Once, when Dionysius asked him why the philosophers <lb/>
            haunt the doors of the rich, but the rich do not frequent <lb/>
            those of the philosophers, he said, " Because the first know what <lb/>
            they want, but the second do not."</p>
          <p>On one occasion he was reproached by Plato for living in an <lb/>
            expensive way ; and he replied, " Does not Dionysius seem to <lb/>
            you to be a good man ?" And as he said that he did ; " And <lb/>
            yet," said he, " he lives in a more expensive manner than I <lb/>
            do, so that there is no impossibility in a person's living both <lb/>
            expensively and well at the same time." He was asked once <lb/>
            in what educated men are superior to uneducated men ; and <lb/>
            answered, " Just as broken horses are superior to those that <lb/>
            are unbroken." On another occasion he was going into the <lb/>
            house of a courtesan, and when one of the young men who <lb/>
            were with him blushed, he said, " It is not the going into such <lb/>
            a house that is bad, but the not being able to go out." Once a <lb/>
            man proposed a riddle to him, and said, " Solve it." " Why, <lb/>
            you silly fellow," said Aristippus, " do you wish me to loose <lb/>
            what gives us trouble, even while it is in bonds ?" A saying <lb/>
            of his was, " that it was better to be a beggar than an ignorant <lb/>
            person ; for that a beggar only wants money, but an ignorant <lb/>
            person wants humanity." Once when he was abused, he was <lb/>
            going away, and as his adversary pursued him and said, " Why <lb/>
            are you going away ?" " Because," said he, " you have a license <lb/>
            for speaking ill; but I have another for declining to hear ill." <lb/>
            When some one said that he always saw the philosophers at <lb/>
            the doors of the rich men, he said, " And the physicians also <lb/>
            are always seen at the doors of their patients; but still no <lb/>
            one would choose for this reason to be an invalid rather than <lb/>
            a physician."</p>
          <p>Once it happened, that when he was sailing to Corinth, be <lb/>
            was overtaken by a violent storm ; and when somebody said, <lb/>
            " We common individuals are not afraid, but you philosophers <lb/>
            are behaving like, cowards;" he said, " Very likely, for we <lb/>
            have not both of us the same kind of souls at stake." Seeing <note type="footnote"> G 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="84"/>
            a man who prided himself on the variety of his learning and <lb/>
            accomplishments, he said, " Those who eat most, and who <lb/>
            take the most exercise, are not in better health than they who <lb/>
            eat just as much as is good for them ; and in the same way it <lb/>
            is not those who know a great many things, but they who <lb/>
            know what is useful who are valuable men." An orator had <lb/>
            pleaded a cause for him and gained it, and asked him after- <lb/>
            wards, " Now, what good did you ever get from Socrates?'' <lb/>
            " This good," said he, “ that all that you have said in my <lb/>
            behalf is true." He gave admirable advice to his daughter <lb/>
            Aretes, teaching her to despise superfluity. And being asked <lb/>
            by some one in what respect his son would be better if he <lb/>
            received a careful education, he replied, " If he gets no other <lb/>
            good, at all events, when he is at the theatre, he will not be <lb/>
            one stone sitting upon another." Once when some one brought <lb/>
            his son to introduce to him, he demanded five hundred <lb/>
            drachmas ; and when the father said, " Why, for such a price <lb/>
            as that I can buy a slave." " Buy him then," he replied, <lb/>
            " and you will have a pair."</p>
          <p>It was a saying of his that he took money from his acquaint- <lb/>
            ances not in order to use it himself, but to make them aware <lb/>
            in what they ought to spend their money. On one occasion, <lb/>
            being reproached for having employed a hired advocate in a <lb/>
            cause that he had depending : " Why not," said he ; " when <lb/>
            I have a dinner, I hire a cook." Once he was compelled by <lb/>
            Dionysius to repeat some philosophical sentiment; " It is an <lb/>
            absurdity," said he, " for you to learn of me how to speak, and <lb/>
            yet to teach me when I ought to speak:" and as Dionysius was <lb/>
            offended at this, he placed him at the lowest end of the table ; <lb/>
            on which Aristippus said, " You wish to make this place more <lb/>
            respectable." A man was one day boasting of his skill as a <lb/>
            diver; " Are you not ashamed." said Aristippus, " to pride <lb/>
            yourself on your performance of the duty of a dolphin ?" On <lb/>
            one occasion he was asked in what respect a wise man is <lb/>
            superior to one who is not wise; and his answer was, " Send <lb/>
            them both naked among strangers, and you will find out." <lb/>
            A man was boasting of being able to drink a great deal without <lb/>
            being drunk ; and he said, " A mule can do the very same <lb/>
            thing." When a man reproached him for living with a mistress, <lb/>
            he said, " Does it make any difference whether one takes a <lb/>
            house in which many others have lived before one, or one <lb/>
             <pb n="85"/>
            where no one has ever lived?" and his reprover said, “ No.,, <lb/>
            " Well, does it make any difference whether one sails in a ship <lb/>
            in which ten thousand people have sailed before one, or whether <lb/>
            one sails in one in which no one has ever embarked ?" " By <lb/>
            no means," said the other. " Just in the same way," said he, <lb/>
            " it makes no difference whether one lives with a woman with <lb/>
            whom numbers have lived, or with one with whom no one has <lb/>
            lived." When a person once blamed him for taking money from <lb/>
            his pupils, after having been himself a pupil of Socrates: " To <lb/>
            be sure I do," he replied, " for Socrates too, when some friends <lb/>
            sent their corn and wine, accepted a little, and sent the rest <lb/>
            back; for he had the chief men of the Athenians for his <lb/>
            purveyors. But I have only Eutychides, whom I have bought <lb/>
            with money." And he used to live with Lais the courtesan, <lb/>
            as Sotion tells us in the Second Book of his Successions. <lb/>
            Accordingly, when some one reproached him on her account, <lb/>
            he made answer, " I possess her, but I am not possessed by <lb/>
            her; since the best thing is to possess pleasures without being <lb/>
            their slave, not to be devoid of pleasures." When some one <lb/>
            blamed him for the expense he was at about his food, he said, <lb/>
            " Would you not have bought those things yourself if they had <lb/>
            cost three obols ?” And when the other admitted that he <lb/>
            would, " Then," said he, " it is not that I am fond of pleasure, <lb/>
            but that you are fond of money.” On one occasion, when <lb/>
            Simus, the steward of Dionysius, was showing him a magnificent <lb/>
            house, paved with marble (but Simus was a Phrygian, and a <lb/>
            great toper), he hawked up a quantity of saliva and spit in his <lb/>
            face ; and when Simus was indignant at this, he said, “ I could <lb/>
            not find a more suitable place to spit in."</p>
          <p>Charondas, or as some say, Phædon, asked him once, <lb/>
            “ Who are the people who use perfumes ?" " I do," said he, <lb/>
            “ wretched man that I am, and the king of the Persians is <lb/>
            still more wretched than I; but, recollect, that as no animal <lb/>
            is the worse for having a pleasant scent, so neither is a man ; <lb/>
            but plague take those wretches who abuse our beautiful <lb/>
            unguents." On another occasion, he was asked how Socrates <lb/>
            died; and.he made answer, " As I should wish to die myself." <lb/>
            When Polyxenus, the Sophist, came to his house and beheld <lb/>
            his women, and the costly preparation that was made for <lb/>
            dinner, and then blamed him for all this luxury, Aristippus <lb/>
            after a while said, " Can you stay with me to day ?” and when <lb/>
             <pb n="86"/>
            Polyxenus consented, " Why then," said he, " did you blame <lb/>
            me ? it seems that you blame not the luxury, but the expense <lb/>
            of it." When his servant was once carrying some money <lb/>
            along the road, and was oppressed by the weight of it (as <lb/>
            Bion relates in his Dissertations), he said to him, "Drop what <lb/>
            is beyond your strength, and only carry what you can." Once <lb/>
            he was at sea, and seeing a pirate vessel at a distance, he <lb/>
            began to count his money ; and then he let it drop into the <lb/>
            sea, as if unintentionally, and began to bewail his loss; but <lb/>
            others say that he said besides, that it was better for the <lb/>
            money to be lost for the sake of Aristippus, than Aristippus <lb/>
            for the sake of his money. On one occasion, when Dionysius <lb/>
            asked him why he bad come, he said, to give others a share <lb/>
            of what he had, and to receive a share of what he had not; <lb/>
            but some report that his answer was, " When I wanted wisdom, <lb/>
            I went to Socrates; but now that I want money, I have come <lb/>
            to you." He found fault with men, because when they are <lb/>
            at sales, they examine the articles offered very carefully, but <lb/>
            yet they approve of men's lives without any examination. <lb/>
            Though some attribute this speech to Diogenes. They say <lb/>
            that once at a banquet, Dionysius desired all the guests to <lb/>
            dance in purple garments; but Plato refused, saying :— <lb/>
            " I could not wear a woman's robe, when I <lb/>
            Was born a man, and of a manly race."</p>
          <p>But Aristippus took the garment, and when he was about <lb/>
            to dance, he said very wittily:- <lb/>
            " She who is chaste, will not corrupted be <lb/>
            By Bacchanalian revels."</p>
          <p>He was once asking a favour of Dionysius for a friend, and <lb/>
            when he could not prevail, he fell at his feet; and when some <lb/>
            one reproched him for such conduct, he said, “ It is not I who <lb/>
            am to blame, but Dionysius who has his ears in his feet." <lb/>
            When he was staying in Asia, and was taken prisoner by <lb/>
            Artaphernes the Satrap, some one said to him, " Are you still <lb/>
            cheerful and sanguine ?" " When, you silly fellow," he replied, <lb/>
            " can I have more reason to be cheerful than now when I am <lb/>
            on the point of conversing with Artaphernes ?" It used to be a <lb/>
            saying of his, that those who had enjoyed the encyclic course <lb/>
            of education, but who had omitted philosophy, were like the <lb/>
            suitors of Penelope ; for that they gained over Melantho and <lb/>
             <pb n="87"/>
            Polydora and the other maid-servants, and found it easier to <lb/>
            do that than to marry the mistress. And Ariston said in <lb/>
            like manner, that Ulysses when he had gone to the shades <lb/>
            below, saw and conversed with nearly all the dead in those <lb/>
            regions, but could not get a sight of the Queen herself.</p>
          <p>On another occasion, Aristippus being asked what were the <lb/>
            most necessary things for well-born boys to learn, said, " Those <lb/>
            things which they will put in practice when they become men." <lb/>
            And when some one reproached him for having come from <lb/>
            Socrates to Dionysius, his reply was, “ I went to Socrates <lb/>
            because I wanted instruction (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παιδεια̃ς</foreign>), and I have come to <lb/>
            Dionysius because I want diversion (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παιδεια̃ς</foreign>).As he had <lb/>
            made money by having pupils, Socrates once said to him, <lb/>
            " Where did you get so much?" and he answered, “ Where <lb/>
            you got a little." When his mistress said to him, " I am in <lb/>
            the family way by you," he said, " You can no more tell that, <lb/>
            than you could tell, after you had gone through a thicket, <lb/>
            which thorn had scratched you." And when some one blamed <lb/>
            him for repudiating his son, as if he were not really his, he <lb/>
            said, " I know that phlegm, and I know that lice, proceed <lb/>
            from us, but still we cast them away as useless." One day, <lb/>
            when he had received some money from Dionysius, and Plato <lb/>
            had received a book. he said to a man who jeered him, " The <lb/>
            fact is, money is what I want, and books what Plato wants." <lb/>
            When he was asked what it was for which he was reproached <lb/>
            by Dionysius, " The same thing," said he, ., for which others <lb/>
            reproach me." One day he asked Dionysius for some money, <lb/>
            who said, " But you told me that a wise man would never be <lb/>
            in want;” “Give me some," Aristippus rejoined, " and then <lb/>
            we will discuss that point;" Dionysius gave him some, " Now <lb/>
            then," said he, " you see that I do not want money." When <lb/>
            Dionysius said to him ;— <lb/>
            " For he who does frequent a tyrant's court,* <lb/>
            Becomes his slave, though free when first he came</p>
          <p>He took him up, and replied : — <lb/>
            " That man is but a slave who comes as free."</p>
          <p>This story is told by Diodes, in his book on the Lives of the <note type="footnote"> * Plutarch, in his life of Pompey, attributes these lines to Sophocles, <lb/>
            but does not mention the play in which they occurred. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="88"/>
            Philosophers ; but others attribute the rejoinder to Plato. He <lb/>
            once quarrelled with Æschines, and presently afterwards said <lb/>
            to him, " Shall we not make it up of our own accord, and cease <lb/>
            this folly; but will you wait till some blockhead reconciles us <lb/>
            over our cups ? " " With all my heart," said Æschines. <lb/>
            " Recollect, then," said Aristippus, " that I, who am older <lb/>
            than you, have made the first advances." And Æschines <lb/>
            answered, " You say well, by Juno, since you are far better <lb/>
            than I; for I began the quarrel, but you begin the friendship.” <lb/>
            And these are the anecdotes which are told of him.</p>
          <p>V. Now there were four people of the name of Aristippus; <lb/>
            one, the man of whom we are now speaking ; the second, the <lb/>
            man who wrote the history of Arcadia ; the third was one <lb/>
            who, because he had been brought up by his mother, had the <lb/>
            name of <foreign xml:lang="grc">μητϱοδίδανος</foreign> given to him ; and he was the grandson <lb/>
            of the former, being his daughter's son ; the fourth was a phi- <lb/>
            losopher of the New Academy.</p>
          <p>VI. There are three books extant, written by the Cyrenaic <lb/>
            philosopher, which are, a history of Africa, and which were sent <lb/>
            by him to Dionysius; and there is another book containing <lb/>
            twenty-five dialogues, some written in the Attic, and some in <lb/>
            the Doric dialect. And these are the titles of the Dialogues- <lb/>
            Artabazus ; to the Shipwrecked Sailors; to the Exiles ; to a Beg <lb/>
            gar ; to Lais ; to Porus ; to Lais about her Looking-glass ; Mer- <lb/>
            cury ; the Dream ; to the President of the Feast; Philomelus ; <lb/>
            to his Domestics ; to those who reproached him for possessing <lb/>
            old wine and mistresses ; to those who reproached him for <lb/>
            spending much money on his eating ; a Letter to Arete his <lb/>
            daughter; a letter to a man who was training himself for the <lb/>
            Olympic games; a book of Questions; another book of Questions; <lb/>
            a Dissertation addressed to Dionysius ; an Essay on a Statue ; <lb/>
            an Essay on the daughter of Dionysius; a book addressed <lb/>
            to one who thought himself neglected ; another to one who <lb/>
            attempted to give him advice. Some say, also, that he wrote <lb/>
            six books of dissertations; but others, the chief of whom is <lb/>
            Sosicrates of Rhodes, affirm that he never wrote a single thing. <lb/>
            According to the assertions of Sotion in his second book; and <lb/>
            of Panœtius, on the contrary, he composed the following books, <lb/>
            -one concerning Education ; one concerning Virtue ; one called <lb/>
            An Exhortation ; Artabazus ; the Shipwrecked Men ; the <lb/>
            Exiles; six books of Dissertations; three books of Apoph- <lb/>
             <pb n="89"/>
            thegms ; an essay addressed to Lais; one to Porus; one to <lb/>
            Socrates; one on Fortune. And he used to define the chief <lb/>
            good as a gentle motion tending to sensation.</p>
          <p>VII. But since we have written his life, let us now speak <lb/>
            of the Cyrenaics who came after him; some of whom called <lb/>
            themselves Hegesiaci, some Annicerci, others Theodorei. And <lb/>
            let us also enumerate the disciples of Phædo, the chief of whom <lb/>
            were the Eretrians. Now the pupils of Aristippus were his <lb/>
            own daughter Arete, and Æthiops of Ptolemais, and Antipater <lb/>
            of Cyrene. Arete had for her pupil the Aristippus who was <lb/>
            surnamed <foreign xml:lang="grc">μητϱοδίδαντος</foreign>, whose disciple was Theodorus the <lb/>
            atheist, but who was afterwards called <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεὸς</foreign>. Antipater had <lb/>
            for a pupil Epitimedes of Cyrene, who was the master of Pyræ- <lb/>
            bates, who was the master of Hegesias, who was surnamed <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεισιθάνατος</foreign> (persuading to die), and of Anniceris who ransomed <lb/>
            Plato.</p>
          <p>VIII. These men then who continued in the school of Aris- <lb/>
            tippus, and were called Cyrenaics, adopted the following <lb/>
            opinions.- They said that there were two emotions of the <lb/>
            mind, pleasure and pain ; that the one, namely pleasure, was a <lb/>
            moderate emotion ; the other, namely pain, a rough one. And <lb/>
            that no one pleasure was different from or more pleasant than <lb/>
            another; and that pleasure was praised by all animals, but <lb/>
            pain avoided. They said also that pleasure belonged to the <lb/>
            body, and constituted its chief good, as Parætius also tells us <lb/>
            in his book on Sects ; but the pleasure which they call the <lb/>
            chief good, is not that pleasure as a state, which consists in <lb/>
            the absence of all pain, and is a sort of undisturbedness, which <lb/>
            is what Epicurus admits as such ; for the Cyrenaics think that <lb/>
            there is a distinction between the chief good and a life of hap- <lb/>
            piness, for that the chief good is a particular pleasure, but that <lb/>
            happiness is a state consisting of a number of particular <lb/>
            pleasures, among which, both those which are past, and those <lb/>
            which are future, are both enumerated. And they consider <lb/>
            that particular pleasure is desirable for its own sake ; but that <lb/>
            happiness is desirable not for its own sake, but for that of the <lb/>
            particular pleasure. And that the proof that pleasure is the <lb/>
            chief good is that we are from our childhood attracted to it <lb/>
            without any deliberate choice of our own ; and that when we <lb/>
            have obtained it, we do not seek anything further, and also that <lb/>
            there is nothing which we avoid so much as we do its opposite, <lb/>
             <pb n="90"/>
            which is pain. And they assert, too, that pleasure is a good, <lb/>
            even if it arises from the most unbecoming causes, as Hippo- <lb/>
            botus tells us in his Treatise on Sects ; for even if an action be <lb/>
            ever so absurd, still the pleasure which arises out of it is de- <lb/>
            sirable, and a good.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the banishment of pain, as it is called by Epicurus, <lb/>
            appears to the Cyrenaics not to be pleasure ; for neither is the <lb/>
            absence of pleasure pain, for both pleasure and pain consist in <lb/>
            motion ; and neither the absence of pleasure nor the absence <lb/>
            of pain are motion. In fact, absence of pain is a condition <lb/>
            like that of a person asleep. They say also that it is possible <lb/>
            that some persons may not desire pleasure, owing to some per- <lb/>
            versity of mind ; and that all the pleasures and pains of the <lb/>
            mind, do not all originate in pleasures and pains of the body, <lb/>
            for that pleasure often arises from the mere fact of the pros- <lb/>
            perity of one's country, or from one's own ; but they deny that <lb/>
            pleasure is caused by either the recollection or the anticipation <lb/>
            of good fortune-though Epicurus asserted that it was-for the <lb/>
            motion of the mind is put an end to by time. They say, too, <lb/>
            that pleasure is not caused by simple seeing or hearing. Ac- <lb/>
            cordingly we listen with pleasure to those who give a repre- <lb/>
            sentation of lamentations ; but we are pained when we see <lb/>
            men lamenting in reality. And they called the absence of <lb/>
            pleasure and of pain intermediate states; and asserted that <lb/>
            corporeal pleasures were superior to mental ones, and corpo- <lb/>
            real sufferings worse than mental ones. And they argued <lb/>
            that it was on this principle that offenders were punished with <lb/>
            bodily pain ; for they thought that to suffer pain was hard, but <lb/>
            that to be pleased was more in harmony with the nature of <lb/>
            man, on which account also they took more care of the body <lb/>
            than of the mind.</p>
          <p>And although pleasure is desirable for its own sake, still <lb/>
            they admit that some of the efficient causes of it are often <lb/>
            troublesome, and as such opposite to pleasure; so that they <lb/>
            think that an assemblage of all the pleasures which produce <lb/>
            happiness, is the most difficult thing conceivable. But they <lb/>
            admit that every wise man does not live pleasantly, and that <lb/>
            every bad man does not live unpleasantly, but that it is only a <lb/>
            general rule admitting of some exceptions. And they think it <lb/>
            sufficient if a person enjoys a happy time in consequence of <lb/>
            one pleasure which befalls him. They say that prudence is a <lb/>
             <pb n="91"/>
            good, but is not desirable for its own sake, but for the sake <lb/>
            of those things which result from it. That a friend is desirable <lb/>
            for the sake of the use which we can make of him ; for that the <lb/>
            parts of the body also are loved while they are united to the <lb/>
            body ; and that some of the virtues may exist even in the <lb/>
            foolish. They consider that bodily exercise contributes to the <lb/>
            comprehension of virtue; and that the wise man will feel <lb/>
            neither envy, nor love, nor superstition ; for that these things <lb/>
            originate in a fallacious opinion. They admit, at the same <lb/>
            time, that he is liable to grief and fear, for that these are <lb/>
            natural emotions. They said also that wealth is an efficient <lb/>
            cause of pleasure, but that it is not desirable for its own sake. <lb/>
            That the sensations are things which can be comprehended ; <lb/>
            but they limited this assertion to the sensations themselves, and <lb/>
            did not extend it to the causes which produce them. They left <lb/>
            out all investigation of the subjects of natural philosophy, because <lb/>
            of the evident impossibility of comprehending them ; but they <lb/>
            applied themselves to the study of logic, because of its utility.</p>
          <p>Meleager, in the second book of his Treatise on Opinions, and <lb/>
            Clitomachus in the first book of his Essay on Sects says, that <lb/>
            they thought natural philosophy and dialectics useless, for that <lb/>
            the man who had learnt to understand the question of good <lb/>
            and evil could speak with propriety, and was free from super- <lb/>
            stition, and escaped the fear of death, without either. They <lb/>
            also taught that there was nothing naturally and intrinsically <lb/>
            just, or honourable, or disgraceful; but that things were con- <lb/>
            sidered so because of law and fashion. The good man will do <lb/>
            nothing out of the way, because of the punishments which are <lb/>
            imposed on, and the discredit which is attached to, such actions : <lb/>
            and that the good man is a wise man. They admit, too, that <lb/>
            there is such a thing as improvement in philosophy, and in <lb/>
            other good studies. And they say that one man feels grief more <lb/>
            than another; and that the sensations are not always to be <lb/>
            trusted as faithful guides.</p>
          <p>IX. But the philosophers who were called Hegesiaci, adopted <lb/>
            the same chief goods, pleasure and pain; and they denied <lb/>
            that there was any such thing as gratitude, or friendship, or <lb/>
            beneficence, because we do not choose any of those things for <lb/>
            their own sake, but on account of the use of which they are, <lb/>
            and on account of these other things which cannot subsist with- <lb/>
            out them. But they teach that complete happiness cannot <lb/>
             <pb n="92"/>
            possibly exist; for that the body is full of many sensations, and <lb/>
            that the mind sympathizes with the body, and is troubled when <lb/>
            that is troubled, and also that fortune prevents many things <lb/>
            which we cherished in anticipation; so that for all these reasons, <lb/>
            perfect happiness eludes our grasp. Moreover, that both life <lb/>
            and death are desirable. They also say that there is nothing <lb/>
            naturally pleasant or unpleasant, but that owing to want, or <lb/>
            rarity, or satiety, some men are pleased and some vexed ; and <lb/>
            that wealth and poverty have no influence at all on pleasure, for <lb/>
            that rich men are not affected by pleasure in a different manner <lb/>
            from poor men. In the same way they say that slavery and <lb/>
            freedom are things indifferent, if measured by the standard of <lb/>
            pleasure, and nobility and baseness of birth, and glory and <lb/>
            infamy. They add that, for the foolish man it is expedient to <lb/>
            live, but to the wise man it is a matter of indifference; and <lb/>
            that the wise man will do everything for his own sake ; for that <lb/>
            he will not consider any one else of equal importance with <lb/>
            himself; and he will see that if he were to obtain ever such <lb/>
            great advantages from any one else, they would not be equal <lb/>
            to what he could himself bestow. They excluded the sensa- <lb/>
            tions, inasmuch as they had no certain, knowledge about them ; <lb/>
            but they recommended the doing of everything which appeared <lb/>
            consistent with reason.</p>
          <p>They asserted also that errors ought to meet with pardon ; <lb/>
            for that a mail did not err intentionally, but because he was <lb/>
            influenced by some external circumstance ; and that one ought <lb/>
            not to hate a person who has erred, but only to teach him <lb/>
            better. They likewise said that the wise man would not be so <lb/>
            much absorbed in the pursuit of what is good, as in the attempt <lb/>
            to avoid what is bad, considering the chief good to be living <lb/>
            free from all trouble and pain ; and that this end was attained <lb/>
            best by those who looked upon the efficient causes of pleasure <lb/>
            as indifferent.</p>
          <p>X. The Annicgreans, in many respects, agreed with these last; <lb/>
            but they admitted the existence in life of friendship and gratitude <lb/>
            and respect for one's parents, and the principle of endeavouringto <lb/>
            serve one's country. On which principle, even if the wise man <lb/>
            should meet with some annoyance, he would be no less happy, <lb/>
            even though he should have but few actual pleasures. They <lb/>
            thought that the happiness of a friend was not to be desired by <lb/>
            us for its own sake ; for that in fact such happiness was not <lb/>
             <pb n="93"/>
            capable of being felt by the person's neighbour; and that <lb/>
            reason is not sufficient to give one confidence, and to authorise <lb/>
            one to look down upon the opinions of the multitude ; but that <lb/>
            one must learn a deference for the sentiments of others by cus- <lb/>
            tom, because the opposite bad disposition being bred up with <lb/>
            infirm and early age. They also taught that one ought not to <lb/>
            make friends solely on account of the advantage that we may <lb/>
            derive from them, and not discard them when these hopes or <lb/>
            advantages fail; but that we ought rather to cultivate them on <lb/>
            account of one's natural feelings of benevolence, in compliance <lb/>
            with which we ought also to encounter trouble for their sakes, <lb/>
            so that though they consider pleasure the chief good, and <lb/>
            the deprivation of it an evil, still they think that a man ought <lb/>
            voluntarily to submit to this deprivation out of his regard for <lb/>
            his friend,</p>
          <p>XI. The Theodereans, as they are called, derived their <lb/>
            name from the Theodorus who has been already mentioned, <lb/>
            and adopted all his doctrines.</p>
          <p>XII. Now Theodorus utterly discarded all previous opinions <lb/>
            about the Gods : and we have met with a book of his which is <lb/>
            entitled, On Gods, which is not to be despised; and it is <lb/>
            from that that they say that Epicurus derived the principal <lb/>
            portions of his sentiments. But Theodorus had been a pupil <lb/>
            of Anniceris, and of Dionysius the Dialectician, as Antisthenes <lb/>
            tells us in his Successions of Philosophers.</p>
          <p>XIII. He considered joy and grief as the chief goods: <lb/>
            and that the former resulted from knowledge, and the latter <lb/>
            from ignorance. And he called prudence and justice goods : <lb/>
            the contrary qualities evils, and pleasure and pain something <lb/>
            intermediate. He discarded friendship from his system, <lb/>
            because it could not exist either in foolish men or in wise <lb/>
            men. For that, in the case of the former, friendship <lb/>
            was at an end the moment that the advantage to be derived <lb/>
            from it was out of sight. And that wise men were sufficient <lb/>
            for themselves, and so had no need of friends. He used also <lb/>
            to say that it was reasonable for a good man not to expose <lb/>
            himself to danger for the sake of his country, for that he <lb/>
            ought not to discard his own prudence for the sake. of <lb/>
            benefiting those who had none. And he said that a wise <lb/>
            man's country was the World. He allowed that a wise man <lb/>
            might steal, and commit adultery and sacrilege, at proper <lb/>
             <pb n="94"/>
            seasons: for that none of these actions were disgraceful by <lb/>
            nature, if one only put out of sight the common opinion <lb/>
            about them, which owes its existence to the consent of fools. <lb/>
            And he said that the wise man would indulge his passions <lb/>
            openly, without any regard to circumstances: on which <lb/>
            principle he used to ask the following questions : "Is a <lb/>
            woman who is well instructed in literature of use just in pro- <lb/>
            portion to the amount of her literary knowledge ?" " Yes," said <lb/>
            the person questioned. " And is a boy, and is a youth, useful <lb/>
            in proportion to his acquaintance with literature ?" " Yes." <lb/>
            " Is not then, also, a beautiful woman useful in proportion as <lb/>
            she is beautiful; and a boy and a youth useful in proportion <lb/>
            to their beauty ?" " Yes." “ Well, then, a handsome boy <lb/>
            and a handsome youth must be useful exactly in proportion <lb/>
            as they are handsome?” " Yes." "Now the use of beauty <lb/>
            is, to be embraced." And when this was granted he pressed <lb/>
            the argument thus :—If then a man embraces a woman just <lb/>
            as it is useful that he should, he does not do wrong ; nor, <lb/>
            again, will he be doing wrong in employing beauty for the <lb/>
            purposes for which it is useful. And with such questions as <lb/>
            these he appeared to convince his hearers.</p>
          <p>XIV. But he appears to have got the name of <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεὸς</foreign> from <lb/>
            Stilpo one day asking him, 11 Are you, Theodorus, what you. <lb/>
            say you are?" And when he said he was, And you said <lb/>
            that you are <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεὸς</foreign>,” continued his questioner ; he admitted that <lb/>
            also. 11 Then," continued the other, "you are <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεὸς</foreign>.” And as <lb/>
            he willingly received the title, the other laughed and said, <lb/>
            " But you, wretched man, according to this principle, you <lb/>
            would also admit that you were a raven, or a hundred other <lb/>
            things." One day Theodorus sat down by Euryclides the <lb/>
            hierophant, and said to him, " Tell me now, Euryclides, who <lb/>
            are they who behave impiously with respect to the mysteries ?" <lb/>
            And when Euryclides answered, " Those who divulge them to <lb/>
            the uninitiated ; " Then," said he, 11 you also are impious, for <lb/>
            you divulge them to those who are not initiated."</p>
          <p>XV. And indeed he was very near being brought before <lb/>
            the Areopagus if Demetrius of Phalereus had not saved, <lb/>
            him. But Amphicrates in his Essay on Illustrious Men, <lb/>
            says that he was condemned to drink hemlock.</p>
          <p>XVI. While he was staying at the court of Ptolemy, the <lb/>
            son of Lagus, he was sent once by him to Lysimachus as an <lb/>
             <pb n="95"/>
            ambassador. And as he was talking very freely, Lysimachus <lb/>
            said to him, " Tell me, Theodorus, have not you been banished <lb/>
            from Athens?" And he replied, you have been rightly in- <lb/>
            formed ; for the city of the Athenians could not bear me, just <lb/>
            as Semele could not bear Bacchus ; and so we were both cast <lb/>
            out." And when Lysimachus said again, " Take care that you <lb/>
            do not come to me again "I never will," he replied, " un- <lb/>
            less Ptolemy sends me." And as Mythras, the steward of <lb/>
            Lysimachus was present, and said, " You appear to me to be <lb/>
            the only person who ignores both Gods and Sovereigns <lb/>
            " How," rejoined Theodorus, " can you say that I ignore the <lb/>
            Gods, when I look upon you as their enemy ? "</p>
          <p>XVII. They say also that on one occasion he came to <lb/>
            Corinth, bringing with him a great many disciples ; and that <lb/>
            Metrocles the Cynic, who was washing leeks said so him, <lb/>
            " You, who are a Sophist, would not have wanted so many <lb/>
            pupils, if you had washed vegetables." And Theodorus, taking <lb/>
            him up, replied, " And if you had known how to associate <lb/>
            with men, you would not have cared about those vegetables." <lb/>
            But this rejoinder, as I have said already, is attributed both to <lb/>
            Diogenes and Aristippus.</p>
          <p>XVIII. Such was Theodorus, and such were his circum- <lb/>
            stances and opinions. But at last he went away to Cyrene, <lb/>
            and lived there with Megas, being treated by him with the <lb/>
            greatest distinction. And when he was first driven away from <lb/>
            Cyrene, he is reported to have said very pleasantly, " You do <lb/>
            wrong, 0 men of Cyrene, driving me from Africa to Greece."</p>
          <p>XIX. But there were twenty different people of the name <lb/>
            of Theodorus. The first was a Samian, the son of Rhceus ; he <lb/>
            it was who advised the putting of coals under the foundations <lb/>
            of the temple of Diana at Ephesus ; for as the ground was very <lb/>
            swampy, he said that the coals, having got rid of their ligneous <lb/>
            qualities, would retain their solidity in a way that could not be <lb/>
            impaired by water. The second was a Cyrenean, a geome- <lb/>
            trician, and had Plato for one of his pupils. The third was <lb/>
            the philosopher whom we have been describing. The fourth <lb/>
            was an author who wrote a very remarkable treatise on the <lb/>
            art of exercising the voice. The fifth was a man who wrote a <lb/>
            treatise on Musicial' Composers, beginning with Terpander. <lb/>
            The sixth was a Stoic. The seventh was the historian of <lb/>
            Rome. The eighth was a Syracusan, who wrote an Essay on <lb/>
             <pb n="96"/>
            Tactics. The ninth was a citizen of Byzantium, who was a <lb/>
            political orator. The tenth was another orator, who is men- <lb/>
            tioned by Aristotle in his Epitome of the Orators. The eleventh <lb/>
            was a Theban, a statuary. The twelfth was a painter, who is <lb/>
            mentioned by Polemo. The thirteenth was also a painter, who <lb/>
            is spoken of by Menodotus. The fourteenth was an Ephesian <lb/>
            a painter, mentioned by Theophanes in his Essay on Painting. <lb/>
            The fifteenth was an epigrammatic poet. The sixteenth wrote <lb/>
            an essay on Poets. The seventeenth was a physician, a pupil <lb/>
            of Athenæas. The eighteenth was a Chian, a Stoic philo- <lb/>
            sopher. The nineteenth was a citizen of Miletus, another <lb/>
            Stoic. The twentieth was a tragic poet.</p>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF PHŒDO.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. PHŒDO the Elean, one of the Eupatridæ, was taken pri- <lb/>
            soner at the time of the subjugation of his country, and was <lb/>
            compelled to submit to the vilest treatment. But while he <lb/>
            was standing in the street, shutting the door, he met with <lb/>
            Socrates, who desired Alcibiades, or as some say, Crito, to <lb/>
            ransom him. And after that time he studied philosophy as <lb/>
            became a free man. But Hieronymus, in his essay on sus- <lb/>
            pending one's judgment, calls him a slave.</p>
          <p>II. And he wrote dialogues, of which we have genuine <lb/>
            copies ; by name—Zopyrus, Simon, and Nicias (but the gen- <lb/>
            uineness of this one is disputed); Medius, which some people <lb/>
            attribute to Æschines, and others to Polyaenus ; Antimachus, <lb/>
            or the Elders (this too is a disputed one); the Scythian dis- <lb/>
            courses, and these, too, some attribute to Æschines.</p>
          <p>III. But his successor was Phistamus of Elis ; and the next <lb/>
            in succession to him were Menedemus of Eretria, and Asele- <lb/>
            piades of Philias, who came over from Stilpo. And down to <lb/>
            the age of these last, they were called the Eliac school; but <lb/>
            after the time of Menedemus, they were called the Eretrians. <lb/>
            And we will speak of Menedemus hereafter, because he was <lb/>
            the founder of a new sect.</p><pb n="97"/>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF EUCLIDES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. EUCLIDESwas a native of Megara on the Isthmus, or of Gela, <lb/>
            according to some writers, whose statement is mentioned by <lb/>
            Alexander in his Successions. He devoted himself to the <lb/>
            study of the writings of Parmenides ; and his successors were <lb/>
            called the philosophers of the Megaric school; after that they <lb/>
            were called the Contentious school, and still later, the Dialec- <lb/>
            ticians, which name was first given to them by Dionysius the <lb/>
            Carthaginian ; because they carried on their investigations by <lb/>
            question and answer. Hermodorus says that after the death of <lb/>
            Socrates, Plato and the other philosophers came to Euclides, <lb/>
            because they feared the cruelty of the tyrants.</p>
          <p>II. He used to teach that the chief good is unity ; but that <lb/>
            it is known by several names; for at one time people call it <lb/>
            prudence; at another time God ; at another time intellect, and <lb/>
            so on. But everything which was contrary to good, he dis- <lb/>
            carded, denying its existence. And the proofs which he used <lb/>
            to bring forward to support his arguments, were not those which <lb/>
            proceed on assumptions, but on conclusions. He also rejected <lb/>
            all that sort of reasoning which proceeds on comparison, <lb/>
            saying that it must be founded either on things which are like, <lb/>
            or on things which are unlike. If on things which are like, <lb/>
            then it is better to reason about the things themselves, than <lb/>
            about those which resemble them ; and if on things which are <lb/>
            unlike, then the comparison is quite useless. And on this <lb/>
            account Timon uses the following language concerning him, <lb/>
            where he also attacks all the other philosophers of the Socratic <lb/>
            school :- <lb/>
            But I do care for none of all these triflers, <lb/>
            Nor for any one else; not for your Phædon, <lb/>
            Whoever he may be ; not for the quarrelsome <lb/>
            Euclides, who bit all the Megareans <lb/>
            With love of fierce contention.</p>
          <p>III. He wrote six dialogues-the Lamprias, the Æschines, <lb/>
            the Phoenix, the Crito, the Alcibiades, and the Amatory dia- <lb/>
            logue.</p>
          <p>IV. Next in succession to Euclides, came Eubulides of <lb/>
            Miletus, who handed down a great may arguments in dialec- <note type="footnote"> H </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="98"/>
            tics ; such as the Lying one ; the Concealed one ; the Electra ; <lb/>
            the Veiled one ; the Sorites; the Horned one ; the Bald one.* <lb/>
            And one of the Comic poets speaks of him in the following <lb/>
            terms :- <lb/>
            Eubulides, that most contentious sophist, <lb/>
            Asking his horned quibbles, and preplexing <lb/>
            The natives with his false arrogant speeches, <lb/>
            Has gone with all the fluency of Demosthenes.</p>
          <p>For it seems that Demosthenes had been his pupil, and that <lb/>
            being at first unable to pronounce the C, he got rid of that <lb/>
            defect. Eubulides had a quarrel with Aristotle, and was con- <lb/>
            stantly attacking him.</p>
          <p>V. Among the different people who succeeded Eubulides, <lb/>
            was Alexinus of Elis, a man very fond of argument, on which <lb/>
            account he was nicknamed ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ελέγξινος</foreign>.† He had an especial <lb/>
            quarrel with Zeno ; and Hermippus relates of him that he went <lb/>
            from Elis to Olympia, and studied philosophy there ; and that <lb/>
            when his pupils asked him why he lived there, he said that he <lb/>
            wished to establish a school which should be called the Olym- <lb/>
            pic school ; but that his pupils being in distress, through want <lb/>
            of means of support, and finding the situation unhealthy for <lb/>
            them, left him ; and that after that Alexinus lived by himself, <lb/>
            with only one servant. And after that, when swimming in the <note type="footnote"> * The French translator gives the following examples, to show what <lb/>

            Alpheus, he was pricked by a reed, and the injury proved <lb/>
            fatal, and he died. And we have written an epigram on him <lb/>
            which runs thus :— <lb/>
            Then the report, alas ! was true, <lb/>
            That an unhappy man, <lb/>

            For the illustrious sage, <lb/>
            Good Alexinus, swimming in the Alpheus, 1 <lb/>
            Died from a hostile reed.</p>
          <p>And he wrote not only against Zeno, but he composed other <lb/>
            . works also, especially one against Ephorus the historian.</p>
          <p>VI. One of the school of Eubulides was Euphantus of Olyn- <lb/>
            thus, who wrote a history of the events of his own time; he <lb/>
            also composed several tragedies, for which he got great distinc- <lb/>
            tion at the festivals. And he was the preceptor of Antigonus, <lb/>
            the king to whom he dedicated a treatise on Monarchy, which <lb/>
            had an exceedingly high reputation. And at last he died of old <lb/>
            age.</p>
          <p>VII. There are also other pupils of Eubulides, among whom <lb/>
            is Apollonius Cronus, who was the preceptor of Diodorus of <lb/>
            lasos, the son of Aminias ; and he too was surnamed Cronus, <lb/>
            and is thus mentioned by Callimachus in his epigrams :— <lb/>
            Momus himself did carve upon the walls, <lb/>
            Cronus is wise.</p>
          <p>And he was a dialectician, and, as some believe, he was the <lb/>
            first person who invented the Concealed argument, and the <lb/>
            Horned one. When he was staying at the court of Ptolemy <lb/>
            Soter, he had several dialectic questions put to him by Stilpo ; <lb/>
            and as he was not able to solve them at the moment, he was <lb/>
            reproached by the king with many hard words, and among <lb/>
            other things, he was nicknamed Cronus, out of derision. So <lb/>
            he left the banquet, and wrote an essay on the question of <lb/>
            Stilpo, and then died of despondency. And we have written <lb/>
            the following epigram on him:— <lb/>

          <p>VIII. One of the successors of Euclides was Icthyas, the <lb/>
            son of Metellus, a man of great eminence, to whom Diogenes <lb/>
            the Cynic addressed a dialogue. And Clinomachus of Therium, <lb/>
            who was the first person who ever wrote about axioms and <lb/>
            categorems, and things of that kind. And Stilpo the Megarian, <lb/>
            a most illustrious philosopher, whom we must now speak of.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF STILPO.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. STILPO, a native of Megara in Greece, was a pupil of <lb/>
            some of Euclides' school. But some say that he was a pupil <lb/>
            of Euclides himself. And also of Thrasymachus, the Corin- <lb/>
            thian, who was a friend of Icthyas, as Heraclides informs us.</p>
          <p>II. And he was so much superior to all his fellows in com- <lb/>
            mand of words and in acuteness, that it may almost be said <lb/>
            that all Greece fixed its eyes upon him, and joined the <lb/>
            Megaric school. And concerning him Philippus of Megara <lb/>
            speaks thus, word for word:—“ For he carried off from Theo- <lb/>
            phrastus, Metrodorus the speculative philosopher, and Tima- <lb/>
            goras of Gela; and Aristotle the Cyrenaic, he robbed of Clitar- <lb/>
            chus and Simias ; and from the dialecticians' school also he won <lb/>
            men over, carrying off Pceoneius from Aristides, and Dippilus <lb/>
            of the Bosphorus from Euphantus, and also Myrmex of the <lb/>
            Venites, who had both come to him to argue against him, but <lb/>
            they became converts and his disciples." And besides these <lb/>
            men, he attracted to his school Phrasidemus the Peripatetic, a <lb/>
            natural philosopher of great ability; and Alcimus the rheto- <lb/>
            rician, the most eminent orator in all Greece at that time ; and <lb/>
            he won over Crates, and great numbers of others, and among <lb/>
            them Zeno the Phœnician.</p>
          <p>III. And he was very fond of the study of politics. And he <lb/>
            was married. But he lived also with a courtesan, named <lb/>
            Nicarete, as Onetor tells us somewhere. And he had a licentious <lb/>
            daughter, who was married to a friend of his named Simias, a <lb/>
            citizen of Syracuse. And as she would not live in an orderly <lb/>
            manner, some one told Stilpo that she was a disgrace to him. <lb/>
            But he said, " She is not more a disgrace to me than I am an <lb/>
            honour to her."</p><pb n="101"/>
            
          <p>IV. Ptolemy Soter, it is said, received him with great <lb/>
            honour; and when he had made himself master of Megara, he <lb/>
            gave him money, and invited him to sail with him to Egypt. <lb/>
            But he accepted only a moderate sum of money, and declined <lb/>
            the journey proposed to him, but went over to Ægina, until <lb/>
            Ptolemy had sailed. Also when Demetrius, the son of Anti- <lb/>
            gonus had taken Megara, he ordered Stilpo's house to he saved, <lb/>
            and took care that everything that had been plundered from <lb/>
            him should be restored to him. But when he wished Stilpo <lb/>
            to give him in a list of all that he had lost, he said that he <lb/>
            had lost nothing of his own ; for that no one had taken from <lb/>
            him his learning, and that he still had his eloquence and his <lb/>
            knowledge. And he conversed with Demetrius on the subject <lb/>
            of doing good to men with such poster, that he became a <lb/>
            zealous hearer of his.</p>
          <p>V. They say that he once put such a question as this to a <lb/>
            man, about the Minerva of Phidias :-" Is Minerva the Goddess <lb/>
            the daughter of Jupiter?" And when the other said, “ Yes ;" <lb/>
            " But this," said he, " is not the child of Jupiter, but of <lb/>
            Phidias." And when he agreed that it was so—“ This then," <lb/>
            he continued, " is not a God." And when he was brought <lb/>
            before the Areopagus for this speech, he did not deny it, but <lb/>
            maintained that he had spoken correctly; for that she was not <lb/>
            a God (<foreign xml:lang="grc">θεὸς</foreign>) but a Goddess (<foreign xml:lang="grc">θεὰ</foreign>) ; for that Gods were of the <lb/>
            male sex only. However the judges of the Areopagus ordered <lb/>
            him to leave the city ; and on this occasion, Theodorus, who <lb/>
            was nicknamed <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεὸς</foreign>, said in derision, " Whence did Stilpo learn <lb/>
            this ? and how could he tell whether she was a God or a God- <lb/>
            dess ? " But -Theodorus was in truth a most impudent fellow. <lb/>
            But Stilpo was a most witty and elegant-minded man. Accord- <lb/>
            ingly when Crates asked him if the Gods delighted in adoration <lb/>
            and prayer; they say that he answered, ., Do not ask these <lb/>
            questions, you foolish man, in the road, but in private." And <lb/>
            they say too that Bion, when he was asked whether there were <lb/>
            any Gods, answered in the same spirit :- <lb/>
            " Will you not first, 0 ! miserable old man, <lb/>
            Remove the multitude ?"</p>
          <p>VI. But Stilpo was a man of simple character, and free <lb/>
            from all trick and humbug, and universally affable. Accord- <note type="footnote"> * The quibble here is, that <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεὸς</foreign> is properly only masculine, though <lb/>
            it is sometimes used as feminine. <lb/>
            I </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="102"/>
            ingly, when Crates the Cynic once refused to answer a question <lb/>
            that he had put to him, and only insulted his questioner- <lb/>
            " I knew," said Stilpo, " that he would say anything rather <lb/>
            than what he ought. And once he put a question to him, and <lb/>
            offered him a fig at the same time ; so he took the fig and ate <lb/>
            it, on which Crates said, " 0 Hercules, I have lost my fig." <lb/>
            " Not only that," he replied, " but you have lost your question <lb/>
            too, of which the fig was the pledge." At another time, he <lb/>
            saw Crates shivering in the winter, and said to him, " Crates, <lb/>
            you seem to me to want a new dress," meaning, both a new <lb/>
            mind and a new garment ; and Crates, feeling ashamed, <lb/>
            answered him in the following parody :— <lb/>
            " There* Stilpo too, through the Megarian bounds, <lb/>
            Pours out deep groans, where Syphon's voice resounds, <lb/>
            And there he oft doth argue, while a school <lb/>
            Of eager pupils owns his subtle rule, <lb/>
            And virtue's name with eager chase pursues."</p>
          <p>And it is said that at Athens he attracted all the citizens <lb/>
            to such a degree, that they used to run from their workshops <lb/>
            to look at him ; and when some one said to him, " Why, Stilpo, <lb/>
            they wonder at you as if you were a wild beast," he replied, <lb/>
            " Not so ; but as a real genuine man."</p>
          <p>VII. And he was a very clever arguer ; and rejected the <lb/>
            theory of species. And he used to say that a person who spoke <lb/>
            of man in general, was speaking of nobody; for that he was <lb/>
            not speaking of this individual, nor of that one ; for speaking <lb/>
            in general, how can he speak more of this person than of that <lb/>
            person ? therefore he is not speaking of this person at all. <lb/>
            Another of his illustrations was, " That which is shown to me, <lb/>
            is not a vegetable ; for a vegetable existed ten thousand years <lb/>
            ago, therefore this is not a vegetable." And they say that once <lb/>
            when he was conversing with Crates, he interrupted the dis- <lb/>
            course to go off and buy some fish ; and as Crates tried to drag <lb/>
            him back, and said, “ You are leaving the argument; " “ Not <lb/>
            at all," he replied," “ I keep the argument, but I am leaving <lb/>
            you ; for the argument remains, but the fish will be sold to <lb/>
            some one else."</p>
          <p>VIII. There are nine dialogues of his extant, written in a <lb/>
            frigid style: The Moschus ; the Cnistippus or Callias ; the <note type="footnote"> * The Greek is a parody on the descriptions of Tantalus and Sisyphus. <lb/>

            Ptolemy; the Chcerecrates ; theMetrocles ; the Anaximenes; <lb/>
            the Epigenes; the one entitled To my Daughter, and the <lb/>
            Aristotle.</p>
          <p>IX. Heraclides affirms that Zeno, the founder of the Stoic <lb/>
            school, had been one of his pupils.</p>
          <p>X. Hermippus says that he died at a great age, after <lb/>
            drinking some wine, in order to die more rapidly. And we <lb/>
            have written this epigram upon him :— <lb/>
            Stranger, old age at first, and then disease, <lb/>
            A hateful pair, did lay wise Stilpo low. <lb/>
            The pride of Megara : he found good wine <lb/>
            The best of drivers for his mournful coach, <lb/>
            And drinking it, he drove on to the end.</p>
          <p>And he was ridiculed by Sophibus the comic poet, in his play <lb/>
            called Marriages:— <lb/>
            The dregs of Stilpo make the whole dicourse of this Charinus.</p>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF CRITO.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. CRITO was an Athenian. He looked upon Socrates with <lb/>
            the greatest affection ; and paid such great attention to him, <lb/>
            that he took care that he should never be in want of anything.</p>
          <p>II. His sons also were all constant pupils of Socrates, and <lb/>
            their names were Critobulus, Hermogenes, Epigenes, and <lb/>
            Ctesippus.</p>
          <p>III. Crito wrote seventeen dialogues, which were all pub- <lb/>
            lished in one volume; and I subjoin their titles :-That men <lb/>
            are not made good by Teaching; on Superfluity; what is <lb/>
            Suitable, or the Statesman ; on the Honourable ; on doing <lb/>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF SIMON.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. SIMON was an Athenian, a leather-cutter. He, when- <lb/>
            ever Socrates came into his workshop and conversed, used to <lb/>
            make memorandums of all his sayings that he recollected.</p>
          <p>II. And from this circumstance, people have called his <lb/>
            dialogues leathern ones. But he has written thirty-three <lb/>
            which, however, are all combined in one volume :-On the <lb/>
            Gods; on the Good; on the Honourable; what the Honour- <lb/>
            able is; the first Dialogue on Justice; the second Dialogue <lb/>
            on Justice; on Virtue, showing that it is not to be taught; the <lb/>
            first Dialogue on Courage ; the second ; the third ; on Laws ; <lb/>
            on the Art of Guiding the People ; on Honour; on Poetry. <lb/>
            on Good Health ; on Love ; on Philosophy : on Knowledge ; <lb/>

            logues ; on taking Counsel; on Reason or Suitableness ; on <lb/>
            doing Harm.</p>
          <p>III. He is, as some people say, the first writer who reduced <lb/>
            the conversations of Socrates into the form of dialogues. And <lb/>
            when Pericles offered to provide for him, and invited him to <lb/>
            come to him, he said that he would not sell his freedom of <lb/>
            speech.</p>
          <p>IV. There was also another Simon, who wrote a treatise on <lb/>
            Oratorical Art. And another, who was a physician in the <lb/>
            time of Seleucus Nicanor. And another, who was a statuary.</p>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF MENEDEMUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. THIS Menedemus was one of those who belonged to the <lb/>
            school of Phaedo ; and he was one of those who are called <lb/>
            Theoprobidæ, being the soil of Clisthenes, a man of noble family, <lb/>
            but a poor man and a builder. And some say that he was a <lb/>
            tent-maker, and that Menedemus himself learned both trades. <lb/>
            On which account, when he on one occasion brought forward <lb/>
            a motion for some decree, a man of the name of Alexinius <lb/>
            attacked him, saying that a wise man had no need to draw a <lb/>
            tent nor a decree.</p>
          <p>II. But when Menedemus was sent by the Eretrians to <lb/>
            Megara, as one of the garrison, he deserted the rest, and went <lb/>
            to the Academy to Plato; and being charmed by him, he <lb/>
            abandoned the army altogether. And when Asclepiades, the <lb/>
            Phliasian, drew him over to him, he went and lived in Megara, <lb/>
            near Stilpo, and they both became his disciples. And from <lb/>
            thence they sailed to Elis, where they joined Anchipylus and <lb/>
            Moschus, who belonged to Phædo's school. And up to this <lb/>
            time, as I have already mentioned in my account of Phædo, <lb/>
             <pb n="106"/>
            they were called Eleans ; and they were also called Eretrians, <lb/>
            from the native country of Menedemus, of whom I am now <lb/>
            speaking.</p>
          <p>III. Now Menedemus appears to have been a very severe <lb/>
            and rigid man, on which account Crates, parodying a description, <lb/>
            speaks of him thus :— <lb/>
            And Asclepiades the sage of Phlius, <lb/>
            And the Eretrian bull.</p>
          <p>And Timon mentions him thus :— <lb/>
            Rise up, you frowning, bristling, frothy sage.</p>
          <p>And he was a man of such excessive rigour of principle, <lb/>
            that when Eurylochus, of Cassandra, had been invited by <lb/>
            Antigonus, to come to him in company with Cleippides, a <lb/>
            youth of Cyzicus, he refused to go, for he was afraid lest <lb/>
            Menedemus should hear of it; for he was very severe in his <lb/>
            reproofs, and very free spoken. Accordingly, when a young <lb/>
            man behaved with boldness towards him, he did not say a <lb/>
            word, but took a bit of stick and drew on the floor an insulting <lb/>
            picture; until the young man, perceiving the insult that was <lb/>
            meant in the presence of numbers of people, went away. And <lb/>
            when Hierocles, the governor of the Piræus, attacked him in <lb/>
            the temple of Amphiaraus, and said a great deal about the <lb/>
            taking of Eretria, he made no other reply beyond asking him <lb/>
            what Antigonus's object was in treating him as he did.</p>
          <p>On another occasion, he said to a profligate man who was <lb/>
            giving himself airs, " Do not you know that the cabbage is <lb/>
            not the only plant that has a pleasant juice, but that radishes <lb/>
            have it also ?" And once, hearing a young man talk very <lb/>
            loudly, he said, " See whom you have behind you." When <lb/>
            Antigonus consulted him whether he should go to a certain <lb/>
            revel, he made no answer beyond desiring those who brought <lb/>
            him the message, to tell him that he was the son of a king. <lb/>
            When a stupid fellow once said something at random to him, <lb/>
            he asked him whether he had a farm; and when he said that <lb/>
            he had, and a large stock of cattle, he said, " Go then and <lb/>
            look after them ; lest, if you neglect them, you lose them, and <lb/>
            that elegant rusticity of yours with them." He was once asked <lb/>
            whether a good man should marry, and his reply was, " Do I <lb/>
            seem to you to be a good man, or not ?" and when the other <lb/>
             <pb n="107"/>
            said he did ; 11 Well," said he, " and I am married." On one <lb/>
            occasion a person said that there were a great many good <lb/>
            things, so he asked him how many; and whether he thought <lb/>
            that there were more than a hundred. And as he could not <lb/>
            bear the extravagance of one man who used frequently to <lb/>
            invite him to dinner, once when he was invited he did not <lb/>
            say a single word, but admonished him of his extravagance in <lb/>
            silence, by eating nothing but olives.</p>
          <p>IV. On account then of the great freedom of speech in <lb/>
            which he indulged, he was very near while in Cyprus, at the <lb/>
            court of Nicorreon, being in great danger with his friend <lb/>
            Asclepiades. For when the king was celebrating a festival at <lb/>
            the beginning of the month, and had invited them as he did <lb/>
            all the other philosophers; Menedemus said, " If the assem- <lb/>
            blage of such men as are met here to-day is good, a festival <lb/>
            like this ought to be celebrated every day: but if it is not <lb/>
            good, even once is too often." And as the tyrant made answer <lb/>
            to this speech, " that he kept this festival in order to have <lb/>
            leisure in it to listen to the philosophers," he behaved with <lb/>
            even more austerity than usual, arguing, even while the feast <lb/>
            was going on, that it was right on every occasion to <lb/>
            listen to philosophers; and he went on in this way till, if a <lb/>
            flute-player had not interrupted their discussion, they would <lb/>
            have been put to death. In reference to which, when they <lb/>
            were overtaken by a storm in a ship, they say that Asclepiades <lb/>
            said, " that the fine playing of a flute-player had saved them, <lb/>
            but the freedom of speech of Menedemus had ruined them.</p>
          <p>V. But he was, they say, inclined to depart a good deal <lb/>
            from the usual habits and discipline of a school, so that he <lb/>
            never regarded any order, nor were the seats arranged around <lb/>
            properly, but every one listened to him while lecturing, stand- <lb/>
            ing up or sitting down, just as he might chance to be at the <lb/>
            moment, Menedemus himself setting the example of this <lb/>
            irregular conduct.</p>
          <p>VI. But in other respects, it is said that he was a nervous <lb/>
            man, and very fond of glory; so that, as previously he and <lb/>
            Asclepiades had been fellow journeymen of a builder, when <lb/>
            Asclepiades was naked on the roof carrying mortar, Mene- <lb/>
            demus would stand in front of him to screen him when he <lb/>
            saw any one coming.</p>
          <p>VII. When he applied himself to politics he was so nervous, <lb/>
             <pb n="108"/>
            that once, when setting down the incense, he actually missed <lb/>
            the incense burner. Aud on one occasion, when Crates was <lb/>
            standing by him, and reproaching him for meddling with <lb/>
            politics, he ordered some men to put him in prison. But he, <lb/>
            even then, continued not the less to watch him as he passed, <lb/>
            and to stand on tiptoe and call him Agamemnon and Hege- <lb/>
            sipolis.</p>
          <p>VIII. He was also in some degree superstitious. Accord- <lb/>
            ingly, once, when he was at an inn with Asclepiades, and had <lb/>
            unintentionally eaten some meat that had been thrown away, <lb/>
            when he was told of it he became sick, and turned pale, until <lb/>
            Asclepiades rebuked him, telling him that it was not the meat <lb/>
            itself which disturbed him, but only the idea that he had <lb/>
            adopted. But in other respects he was a high minded man, <lb/>
            with notions such as became a gentleman.</p>
          <p>IX. As to his habit of body, even when he was an old man <lb/>
            he retained all the firmness and vigour of an athlete, with <lb/>
            firm flesh, and a ruddy complexion, and very stout and fresh <lb/>
            looking. In stature he was of moderate size ; as is plain from <lb/>
            the statue of him which is at Eretria, in the Old Stadium. <lb/>
            For he is there represented seated almost naked, undoubtedly <lb/>
            for the purpose of displaying the greater part of his body.</p>
          <p>X He was very hospitable and fond of entertaining his <lb/>
            friends; and because Eretria was unhealthy, he used to have <lb/>
            a great many parties, particularly of poets and musicians. <lb/>
            And he was very fond of Aratus and Lycophon the tragic <lb/>
            poet, and Antagoras of Rhodes. And above all he applied <lb/>
            himself to the study of Homer ; and next to him to that of <lb/>
            the Lyric poets ; then to Sophocles, and also to Achæus, to <lb/>
            whom he assigned the second place as a writer of satiric <lb/>
            dramas, giving Æschylus the first. And it is from Achæus <lb/>
            that he quoted these verses against the politicians of the <lb/>
            opposite party :— <lb/>
            A speedy runner once was overtaken <lb/>
            By weaker men than he. An eagle too, <lb/>
            Was beaten by a tortoise in a race.</p>
          <p>And these lines are out of the satiric play of Achseus, <lb/>
            called Omphale ; so that they are mistaken who say that he <lb/>
            had never read anything but the Medea of Euripides, which <lb/>
            is found, they add, in the collection of Neophron, the Sicy- <lb/>
            oman.</p><pb n="109"/>
            
          <p>XI. Of masters of philosophy, he used to despise Plato and <lb/>
            Xenocrates, and Paraebates of Cyrene; and admired no one <lb/>
            but Stilpo. And once, being questioned about him, he said <lb/>
            nothing more of him than that he was a gentleman.</p>
          <p>XII. Menedemus was not easy to be understood, and in his <lb/>
            conversation he was hard to argue against; he spoke on every <lb/>
            subject, and had a great deal of invention and readiness. But <lb/>
            he was very disputatious, as Antisthenes says in his Succes- <lb/>
            sions ; and he used to put questions of this sort, " Is one thing <lb/>
            different from another thing ?” “ Yes." " And is benefiting a <lb/>
            person something different from the good ?” " Yes." “ Then the <lb/>
            good is not benefiting a person." And he, as it is said, discarded <lb/>
            all negative axioms, using none but affirmative ones; and of <lb/>
            these he only approved of the simple ones, and rejected all <lb/>
            that were not simple; saying that they were intricate and <lb/>
            perplexing. But Heraclides says that in his doctrines he was a <lb/>
            thorough disciple of Plato, and that he scorned dialectics; so that <lb/>
            once when Alexinus asked him whether he had left off beating <lb/>
            his father, he said, " I have not beaten him, and I have not <lb/>
            I left off;" and when he said further that he ought to put an <lb/>
            end to the doubt by answering explicitly yes or no, " It would <lb/>
            be absurd," he rejoined, " to comply with your conditions, <lb/>
            when I can stop you at the entrance."</p>
          <p>When Bion was attacking the soothsayers with great <lb/>
            perseverance, he said that he was killing the dead over again. <lb/>
            And once, when he heard some one assert that the greatest <lb/>
            good was to succeed in everything that one desires ; he said, <lb/>
            “ It is a much greater good to desire what is proper." But <lb/>
            Antigonus of Carystus, tells us that he never wrote or com- <lb/>
            posed any work, and never maintained any principle tenaciously. <lb/>
            But in cross-questioning he was so contentious as to get quite <lb/>
            black in the face before he went away. But though he was <lb/>
            so violent in his discourse, he was wonderfully gentle in his <lb/>
            actions. Accordingly, though he used to mock and ridicule <lb/>
            Alexinus very severely, still he conferred great benefits on <lb/>
            him, conducting his wife from Delphi to Chalcis for him, as <lb/>
            she was alarmed about the danger of robbers and banditti in <lb/>
            the road.</p>
          <p>XIII. And he was a very warm friend, as is plain from <lb/>
            his attachment to Asclepiades; which was hardly inferior to <lb/>
            the friendship of Pylades and Orestes. But Asclepiades was <lb/>
             <pb n="110"/>
            the elder of the two, so that it was said that he was the poet, <lb/>
            and Menedemus the actor. And they say that on one occasion, <lb/>
            Archipolis bequeathed them three thousand pieces of money <lb/>
            between them, they had such a vigorous contest as to which <lb/>
            should take the smaller share, that neither of them would <lb/>
            receive any of it.</p>
          <p>XIV. It is said that they were both married ; and that <lb/>
            Asclepiades was married to the mother, and Menedemus to <lb/>
            the daughter ; and when Asclepiades's wife died, he took the <lb/>
            wife of Menedemus; and Menedemus, when he became the <lb/>
            chief man of the state, married another who was rich; and as they <lb/>
            still maintained one house in common, Menedemus entrusted <lb/>
            the whole management of it to his former wife. Asclepiades <lb/>
            died first at Eretria. being of a great age ; having lived with <lb/>
            Menedemus with great economy, though they had ample <lb/>
            means. So that, when on one occasion, after the death of <lb/>
            Asclepiades, a friend of his came to a banquet, and when the <lb/>
            slaves refused him admittance, Menedemus ordered them to <lb/>
            admit him, saying that Asclepiades opened the door for him, <lb/>
            even now that he was under the earth. And the men who <lb/>
            chiefly supported them were Hyporicus the Macedonian, and <lb/>
            Agetor the Lamian. And Agetor gave each of them thirty <lb/>
            minæ, and Hipporicus gave Menedemus two thousand drachmas <lb/>
            to portion his daughters with ; and he had three, as Heraclides <lb/>
            tells us, the children of his wife, who was a native of Oropus.</p>
          <p>XV. And he used to give banquets in this fashion First <lb/>
            of all, he would sit at dinner, with two or three friends, till <lb/>
            late in the day ; and then he would invite in any one who came <lb/>
            to see him, even if they had already dined ; and if any one <lb/>
            came too soon, they would walk up and down, and ask <lb/>
            those who came out of the house what there was on the table, <lb/>
            and what o'clock it was; and then, if there were only <lb/>
            vegetables or salt fish, they would depart; but if they heard <lb/>
            it was meat, they would go in. And during the summer, <lb/>
            mats of rushes were laid upon the couches, and in winter soft <lb/>
            cushions; and each guest was expected to bring a pillow for him- <lb/>
            self. And the cup that was carried round did not hold more than <lb/>
            a cotyla. And the second course consisted of lupins or beans, <lb/>
            and sometimes fruits, such as pears, pomegranates, pulse, <lb/>
            and sometimes, by Jove, dried figs. And all these circum- <lb/>
            stances are detailed by Lycophron, in his satiric dramas, which <lb/>
             <pb n="111"/>
            he inscribed with the name of Menedemus, making his play a <lb/>
            panegyric on the philosopher. And the following are some of <lb/>
            the lines:- <lb/>
            After a temperate feast, a small-sized cup <lb/>
            Is handed round with moderation due ; <lb/>
            And conversation wise makes the dessert.</p>
          <p>XVI. At first, now, he was not thought much of, being <lb/>
            called cynic and trifler by the Eretrians ; but subsequently, he <lb/>
            was so much admired by his countrymen, that they entrusted <lb/>
            him with the chief government of the state. And he was sent <lb/>
            on embassies to Ptolemy and Lysimachus, and was greatly <lb/>
            honoured everywhere. He was sent as envoy to Demetrius ; <lb/>
            and, as the city used to pay him two hundred talents a year, lie <lb/>
            persuaded him to remit fifty. And having been falsely accused <lb/>
            to him, as having betrayed the city to Ptolemy, he defended <lb/>
            himself from the charge, in a letter which begins thus :— <lb/>
            “ Menedemus to king Demetrius.—Health. I hear that <lb/>
            information has been laid before you concerning us.” <lb/>
            And the tradition is, that a man of the name of Æschylus, <lb/>
            who was one of the opposite party in the state, was in the habit <lb/>
            of making these false charges. It is well known too that he <lb/>
            was sent on a most important embassy to Demetrius, on the <lb/>
            subject of Oropus, as Euphantus relates in his History.</p>
          <p>XVII. Antigonus was greatly attached to him, and professed <lb/>
            himself his pupil; and when he defeated the barbarians, near <lb/>
            Lysimachia, Menedemus drew up a decree for him, in simple <lb/>
            terms, free from all flattery, which begins thus :—</p>
          <p>" The generals and councillors have determined, since king <lb/>
            Antigonus has defeated the barbarians in battle, and has re- <lb/>
            turned to his own kingdom, and since he has succeeded in all <lb/>
            his measures according to his wishes, it has seemed good to the <lb/>
            council and to the people." ... And from these circum- <lb/>
            stances, and because of his friendship for him, as shown in <lb/>
            other matters, he was suspected of betraying the city to him ; <lb/>
            and being impeached by Aristodemus, he left the city, and re- <lb/>
            turned to Oropus, and there took up his abode in the temple <lb/>
            of Amphiaraus; and as some golden goblets which were there <lb/>
            were lost, he was ordered to depart by a general vote of the <lb/>
            Boeotians. Leaving Oropus, and being in a state of great <lb/>
            despondency, he entered his country secretly; and taking with <lb/>
             <pb n="112"/>
            him his wife and daughters, be went to the court of Antigonus, <lb/>
            and there died of a broken heart.</p>
          <p>But Heraclides gives an entirely different account of him ; <lb/>
            saying, that while he was the chief councillor of the Eretrians, <lb/>
            he more than once preserved the liberties of the city from those <lb/>
            who would have brought in Demetrius the tyrant; so that he <lb/>
            never could have betrayed the city to Antigonus, and the <lb/>
            accusation must have been false ; and that he went to the <lb/>
            court of Antigonus, and endeavoured to effect the deliverance <lb/>
            of his country; and as he could make no impression on him, <lb/>
            he fell into despondency, and starved himself for seven days, <lb/>
            and so he died. And Antigonus of Carystus gives a similar <lb/>
            account: and Persæus was the only man with whom he had <lb/>
            an implacable quarrel ; for he thought that when Antigonus <lb/>
            himself was willing to re-establish the democracy among the <lb/>
            Eretrians for his sake, Persæus prevented him. And on this <lb/>
            account Menedemus once attacked him at a banquet, saying <lb/>
            many other things, and among them, " He may, indeed, be a <lb/>
            philosopher, but be is the worst man that lives or that ever <lb/>
            will live."</p>
          <p>XVIII. And he died, according to Heraclides, at the age <lb/>
            of seventy-four. And we have written the following epigram <lb/>
            on him :— <lb/>
            I've heard your fate, 0 Menedemus, that of your own accord, <lb/>
            You starved yourself for seven days and died ; <lb/>
            Acting like an Eretrian, but not much like a man, <lb/>
            For spiritless despair appears your guide.</p>
          <p>These men then were the disciples of Socrates, and their <lb/>
            successors ; but we must now proceed to Plato, who founded <lb/>
            the Academy ; and to his successors, or at least to all those of <lb/>
            them who enjoyed any reputation.</p><pb n="113"/>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF PLATO.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. PLATO was the son of Ariston and Perictione ;or Petone, <lb/>
            and a citizen of Athens ; and his mother traced her family back <lb/>
            to Solon; for Solon had a brother named Diopidas, who had <lb/>
            a son named Critias, who was the father of Callœschrus, who <lb/>
            was the father of that Critias who was one of the thirty tyrants, <lb/>
            and also of Glaucon, who was the father of Charmides and <lb/>
            Perictione. And she became the mother of Plato by her <lb/>
            husband Ariston, Plato being the sixth in descent from Solon. <lb/>
            And Solon traced his pedigree up to Neleus and Neptune. <lb/>
            They say too that on the father's side, he was descended from <lb/>
            Codrus, the son of Melanthus, and they too are said by Thra- <lb/>
            sylus to derive their origin from Neptune. And Speusippus, <lb/>
            in his book which is entitled the Funeral Banquet of Plato, <lb/>
            and Clearchus in his Panegyric on Plato, and Anaxilides in <lb/>
            the second book of his History of Philosophers, say that the <lb/>
            report at Athens was that Perictione was very beautiful, and <lb/>
            that Ariston endeavoured to violate her and did not succeed; <lb/>
            and that he, after he had desisted from his violence saw a <lb/>
            vision of Apollo in a dream, in consequence of which he ab- <lb/>
            stained from approaching his wife till after her confinement.</p>
          <p>II. And Plato was born, as Apollodorus says in his <lb/>
            Chronicles, in the eighty-eighth Olympiad, on the seventh day <lb/>
            of the month Thargelion, on which day the people of Delos <lb/>
            say that Apollo also was born. And he died, as Hermippus <lb/>
            says, at a marriage feast, in the first year of the hundred and <lb/>
            eighth Olympiad, having lived eighty-one years. But Ne- <lb/>
            anthes says that he was eighty-four years of age at his death. <lb/>
            He is then younger than Isocrates by six years; for Isocrates <lb/>
            was born in the archonship of Lysimacbus, and Plato in that <lb/>
            of Aminias, in which year Pericles died.</p>
          <p>III. And he was of the borough of Colytus, as Antileon <lb/>
            tells us in his second book on Dates. And he was born, ao- <lb/>
            cording to some writers, in Ægina, in the house of Phidiades <note type="footnote"> I </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="114"/>
            the son of Thales, as Pharorinus affirms in his Universal <lb/>
            History, as his father had been sent thither with several others <lb/>
            as a settler, and returned again to Athens when the settlers <lb/>
            were driven out by the Lacedaemonians, who came to the as- <lb/>
            sistance of the Æginetans. And he served the office of <lb/>
            choregus at Athens, when Dion was at the expense of the <lb/>
            spectacle exhibited, as Theodorus relates in the eighth book <lb/>
            of his Philosophical Conservations.</p>
          <p>IV. And he had brothers, whose names were Adimantus and <lb/>
            Glaucon, and a sister called Petone, who was the mother of <lb/>
            Speusippus.</p>
          <p>V. And he was taught learning in the school of Dionysius, <lb/>
            whom he mentions in his Rival Lovers. And he learnt gym- <lb/>
            nastic exercises under the wrestler Ariston of Argos. And it <lb/>
            was by him that he had the name of Plato given to him in- <lb/>
            stead of his original name, on account of ills robust figure, <lb/>
            as he had previously been called Aristocles, after the name of <lb/>
            his grandfather, as Alexander informs us in his Successions. <lb/>
            But some say that he derived this name from the breadth <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πλατύτης</foreign>) of his eloquence, or else because he was very wide <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πλατὺς</foreign>) across the forehead, as Neanthes affirms There are <lb/>
            some also, among whom is Dicæarchus in the first volume <lb/>
            on Lives, who say that he wrestled at the Isthmian games.</p>
          <p>VI. It is also said that he applied himself to the study of <lb/>
            painting, and that he wrote poems, dithyrambics at first, and <lb/>
            afterwards lyric poems and tragedies.</p>
          <p>VII. But he had a very weak voice, they say ; and the same <lb/>
            fact is stated by Timotheus the Athenian, in his book on <lb/>
            Lives. And it is said that Socrates in a dream saw a cygnet <lb/>
            on his knees, who immediately put forth feathers, and flew up <lb/>
            on high, uttering a sweet note, and that the next day Plato <lb/>
            came to him, and that he pronounced him the bird which he <lb/>
            had seen.</p>
          <p>VIII. And he used to philosophize at first in the Academy, <lb/>
            and afterwards in the garden near Colonus, as Alexander tells <lb/>
            us in his Successions, quoting the testimony of Heraclitus; and <lb/>
            subsequently, though he was about to contend for the prize in <lb/>
            tragedy in the theatre of Bacchus, after he had heard the dis- <lb/>
            course of Socrates, he learnt his poems, saying :— <lb/>
            Vulcan, come here; for Plato wants your aid.</p><pb n="115"/>
            
          <p>And from henceforth, as they say, being now twenty years old, <lb/>
            he became a pupil of Socrates. And when he was gone, he <lb/>
            attached himself to Cratylus, the disciple of Heraclitus, and <lb/>
            to Hermogenes, who had adopted the principles of Parmenides. <lb/>
            Afterwards, when he was eight and twenty years of age, as <lb/>
            Hermodorus tells us, he withdrew to Megara to Euclid, with <lb/>
            certain others of the pupils of Socrates ; and subsequently, he <lb/>
            went to Cyrene to Theodorus the mathematician; and from <lb/>
            thence he proceeded to Italy to the Pythagoreans, Philolaus <lb/>
            and Eurytus, and from thence he went to Eurvtus to the <lb/>
            priests there ; and having fallen sick at that place, he was <lb/>
            cured by the priests by the application of sea water, in re- <lb/>
            ference to which he said :- <lb/>
            The sea doth wash away all human evils.</p>
          <p>And he said too, that, according to Homer, all the Egyptians <lb/>
            were physicians. Plato had also formed the idea of making <lb/>
            the acquaintance of the Magi; but he abandoned it on account <lb/>
            of the wars in Asia.</p>
          <p>IX. And when he returned to Athens, he settled in the <lb/>
            Academy, and that is a suburban place of exercise planted like <lb/>
            a grove, so named from an ancient hero named Hecademus, as <lb/>
            Eupolis tells us in his Discharged Soldiers.</p>
          <p>In the well-shaded walks, protected well <lb/>
            By Godlike Academus.</p>
          <p>And Timon, with reference to Plato, says :— <lb/>
            A man did lead them on, a strong stout man, <lb/>
            A honeyed speaker, sweet as melody <lb/>
            Of tuneful grasshopper, who, seated high <lb/>
            On Hecademus' tree, unwearied sings.</p>
          <p>For the word academy was formerly spelt with E. Now our <lb/>
            philosopher was a friend of Isocrates ; and Praxiphanes com- <lb/>
            posed an account of a conversation which took place between <lb/>
            them, on the subject of poets, when Isocrates was staying with <lb/>
            Plato in the country.</p>
          <p>X. And Aristoxenus says that he was three times engaged <lb/>
            in military expeditions; once against Tanagra; the second <lb/>
            time against Corinth, and the third time at Delium ; and that <lb/>
            in the battle of Delium he obtained the prize of pre-eminent <lb/>
            valour. He combined the principles of the schools of Hera- <note type="footnote"> i 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="116"/>
            clitus, and Pythagoras and Socrates ; for he used to philosophize <lb/>
            on those things which are the subjects of sensation, accord- <lb/>
            ing to the system of Heraclitus; on those with which intellect <lb/>
            is conversant, according to that of Pythagoras ; and on politics, <lb/>
            according to that of Socrates.</p>
          <p>XI. And some people, (of whom Satyrus is one,) say that <lb/>
            he sent a commission to Sicily to Dion, to buy him three books <lb/>
            of Pythagoras from Philolaus for a hundred minæ; for they <lb/>
            say that he was in very easy circumstances, having received <lb/>
            from Dionysius more than eighty talents, as Onetor also asserts <lb/>
            in his treatise which is entitled, Whether a wise Man ought to <lb/>
            acquire Gains.</p>
          <p>XII. And he was much assisted by Epicharmus the comic <lb/>
            poet, a great part of whose works he transcribed, as Alcinus <lb/>
            says in his essays addressed to Amyntas, of which there are <lb/>
            four. And in the first of them he speaks as follows :—" And <lb/>
            Plato appears to utter a great many of the sentiments of Epi- <lb/>
            charmus. Let us just examine. Plato says that that is an <lb/>
            object of sensation, which is never stationary either as to its <lb/>
            quality or its quantity, but which is always flowing and <lb/>
            changing; as, for instance, if one take from any objects all <lb/>
            number, then one cannot affirm that they are either equal, <lb/>
            or of any particular things, or of what quality or quantity they <lb/>
            are. And these things are of such a kind that they are always <lb/>
            being produced, but that they never have any invariable sub- <lb/>
            stances."</p>
          <p>But that is a subject for intellect from which nothing is <lb/>
            taken, and to which nothing is added. And this is the nature <lb/>
            of things eternal, which is always similar and the same. And, <lb/>
            indeed, Epicharmus speaks intelligibly on the subject of what <lb/>
            is perceived by the senses and by the intellect:- <lb/>
            A. But the great Gods were always present, nor <lb/>
            Did they at any moment cease to be ; <lb/>
            And their peculiar likeness at all times <lb/>
            Do they retain, by the same principles. <lb/>
            A Yet chaos is asserted to have been <lb/>
            The first existent Deity. <lb/>
            A. How can that be ? <lb/>
            For 'tis impossible that we should find <lb/>
            Any first principle arise from anything. <lb/>
            B. Is there then no first principle at all ? <lb/>
            A. Nor second either in the things we speak of; <lb/>
             <pb n="117"/>
            But thus it is-if to an even number, <lb/>
            Or e'en an odd one, if you so prefer it, <lb/>
            You add a unit, or if you deduct one, <lb/>
            Say will the number still remain the same ? <lb/>
            A Certainly not. <lb/>
            A. So, if you take a measure <lb/>
            A cubit long, and add another cubit, <lb/>
            Or cut a portion off, the measure then <lb/>
            No longer is the same ? <lb/>
            B. Of course it is not. <lb/>
            A. Now turn your eyes and thoughts upon mankind— <lb/>
            We see one grows, another perishes : <lb/>
            So that they all exist perpetually <lb/>
            In a condition of transition. That <lb/>
            Whose nature changes must be different <lb/>
            At each successive moment, from the thing <lb/>
            It was before. So also, you and I <lb/>
            Are different people now from what we were <lb/>
            But yesterday ; and then, again, to-morrow <lb/>
            We shall be different from what we're now ; <lb/>
            So that, by the same rule, we're always different.</p>
          <p>And Alcinus speaks as follows : — “ The wise men say <lb/>
            that the soul perceives some things by means of the body, as <lb/>
            for instance, when it hears and sees ; but that it also per- <lb/>
            ceives something by its own power, without availing itself at <lb/>
            all of the assistance of the body. On which account existent <lb/>
            things are divisible into objects of sensation and objects of <lb/>
            understanding. On account of which Plato used to say, that <lb/>
            those who wished to become acquainted with the principles of <lb/>
            everything, ought first of all to divide the ideas as he calls <lb/>
            them, separately, such as similarity, and unity, and multitude, <lb/>
            and magnitude, and stationariness, and motion. And secondly, <lb/>
            that they ought to form a notion of the honourable and the <lb/>
            good, and the just, and things of that sort, by themselves, <lb/>
            apart from other considerations. And thirdly, that they <lb/>
            ought to ascertain the character of such ideas as are relative <lb/>
            to one another, such as knowledge, or magnitude, or au- <lb/>
            thority; considering that the things which come under our <lb/>
            notice from partaking of their nature, have the same names <lb/>
            that they have. I mean that one calls that just which <lb/>
            partakes of the just; and that beautiful which partakes of <lb/>
            the beautiful. And each of these primary species is eternal, <lb/>
            and is to be understood by the intellect, and is not subject to <lb/>
            the influence of external circumstances. On which account <lb/>
             <pb n="118"/>
            he says, that ideas exist in nature as models; and that all <lb/>
            other things are like them, and, as it were, copies of them. <lb/>
            Accordingly Epicharmus speaks thus about the good, and <lb/>
            about the ideas.</p>
          <p>A. Tell me, is flute-playing now a thing at all ? <lb/>
            B. Of course it is. <lb/>
            A. Is man then flute-playing ? <lb/>
            B. No, nothing of the sort. <lb/>
            A. Well, let us see- <lb/>
            What is a flute-player ? what think you now <lb/>
            Of him—is he a man, or is he not ? <lb/>
            B. Of course he is a man. <lb/>
            A. Think you not then <lb/>
            The case is just the same about the good. <lb/>
            That the good is something by itself, intrinsic, <lb/>
            And he who's learnt, does at once become , <lb/>
            Himself a good man ? just as he who's learnt <lb/>
            Flute-playing is a flute-player; or dancing, <lb/>
            A dancer; weaving, a weaver. And in short, <lb/>
            Whoever learns an art, does not become <lb/>
            The art itself, but just an artist in it.</p>
          <p>Plato, in his theory of Ideas, says, " That since there is <lb/>
            such a thing as memory, the ideas are in existent things, <lb/>
            because memory is only conversant about what is stable and <lb/>
            enduring; and that no other thing is durable except ideas, for in <lb/>
            what way," he continues, " could animals be preserved, if they <lb/>
            had no ideas to guide them, and if, in addition to them, they <lb/>
            had not an intellect given to them by nature ?" But as it is <lb/>
            they recollect similitudes, and also their food, so as to know <lb/>
            what kind of food is fit for them ; which they learn because <lb/>
            the notion of similarity is implanted naturally in every <lb/>
            animal; owing to which notion they recognize those of the <lb/>
            same species as themselves. What is it then that Epicharmus <lb/>
            says?</p>
          <p>Eumæus’ wisdom ?-not a scanty gift <lb/>
            Appropriated to one single being; <lb/>
            But every animal that breathes and lives, <lb/>
            Has mind and intellect.-So if you will <lb/>
            Survey the facts attentively, you'll find, <lb/>
            E'en in the common poultry yard, the hen <lb/>
            Brings not her offspring forth at first alive, <lb/>
            But sits upon her eggs, and by her warmth, <lb/>
            Cherishes them into life. And all this wisdom <lb/>
            She does derive from nature's gift alone, <lb/>
            For nature is her only guide and teacher.</p><pb n="119"/>
            
          <p>And in a subsequent passage he says :— <lb/>
            There is no wonder in my teaching this, <lb/>
            That citizens please citizens, and seem <lb/>
            To one another to be beautiful: <lb/>
            For so one dog seems to another dog <lb/>
            The fairest object in the world; and so <lb/>
            One ox seems to another, ass to ass, <lb/>
            And swine to swine.</p>
          <p>And these and similar speculations are examined and com- <lb/>
            pared by Alcinus through four books, where he shows how <lb/>
            much assistance Plato has derived from Epicharmus. And <lb/>
            that Epicharmus himself was not indisposed to appreciate his <lb/>
            own wisdom, one may learn from these lines, in which he <lb/>
            predicts that there will arise some one to imitate him:— <lb/>
            But as I think, I surely foresee this, <lb/>
            That these my words will be preserved* hereafter <lb/>
            In many people's recollection. And <lb/>
            Another man will come, who'll strip my reasons <lb/>
            Of their poetic dress, and, clothing them <lb/>
            In other garments and with purple broidery <lb/>
            Will show them off; and being invincible, <lb/>
            Will make all rivals bow the knee to him.</p>
          <p>XIII. Plato also appears to have brought the books of <lb/>
            Sophron. the farce-writer, to Athens, which were previously <lb/>
            neglected; and to have availed himself of them in his <lb/>
            Speculations on Morals : and a copy of them was found <lb/>
            under his head.</p>
          <p>XIV. And Plato made three voyages to Sicily, first of <lb/>
            all for the purpose of seeing the island and the craters of <lb/>
            volcanoes, when Dionysius, the son of Hermocrates, being the <lb/>
            tyrant of Sicily, pressed him earnestly to come and see him; <lb/>
            and he, conversing about tyranny, and saying that that is not <lb/>
            the best government which is advantageous for one individual <lb/>
            alone, unless that individual is pre-eminent in virtue, had a <lb/>
            quarrel with Dionysius, who got angry, and said, " Your <lb/>
            words are those of an old dotard." And Plato replied, <note type="footnote"> * The Greek is rov <foreign xml:lang="grc">μιμογράφον</foreign>. " A mime was a kind of prose <lb/>
            drama, intended as a familiar representation of life and character, <lb/>
            , without any distinct plot. It was divided into <foreign xml:lang="grc">μι̃μιοι ὰνδρει̃οι</foreign> and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυναικει̃οι</foreign>, also into <foreign xml:lang="grc">μι̃μοι σπουδαίων</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">γελοίων</foreign>.”—L, &amp;. S. in voc. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μι̃μος</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="120"/>
            " And your language is that of a tyrant." And on this the <lb/>
            tyrant became very indignant, and at first was inclined to put <lb/>
            him to death; but afterwards, being appeased by Deni and <lb/>
            Aristimenes, he forebore to do that, but gave him to Pollis, <lb/>
            the Lacedaemonian, who happened to have come to him on <lb/>
            an embassy just at that time, to sell as a slave. And he <lb/>
            took him to Ægina and sold him; and Charmander, the son <lb/>
            of Charmandrides, instituted a capital prosecution against <lb/>
            him, in accordance with the law which was in force, in the <lb/>
            island of Ægina, that the first Athenian who landed on the <lb/>
            island should be put to death without a trial; and he himself <lb/>
            was the person who had originally proposed that law, as <lb/>
            Pharorinus says, in his Universal History. But when some <lb/>
            one said, though he said it only in joke, that it was a phi- <lb/>
            losopher who had landed, the people released him. But some <lb/>
            say that he was brought into the assembly and watched ; and <lb/>
            that he did not say a word, but stood prepared to submit to <lb/>
            whatever might befall him ; and that they determined not to <lb/>
            put him to death, but to sell him after the fashion of <lb/>
            prisoners of war. And it happened by chance that Anniceris, <lb/>
            the Cyrenean, was present, who ransomed him for twenty <lb/>
            minæ, or, as others say, for thirty, and sent him to Athens, <lb/>
            to his companions, and they immediately sent Anniceris his <lb/>
            money: but he refused to receive it, saying that they were <lb/>
            not the only people in the world who were entitled to have a <lb/>
            regard for Plato. Some writers again say, that it was Deni <lb/>
            who sent the money, and that he did not refuse it, but bought <lb/>
            him the garden in the Academy. And with respect to Pollis <lb/>
            it is said that he was defeated by Chabrias, and that he was <lb/>
            afterwards drowned in Helia, in consequence of the anger of <lb/>
            the deity at his treatment of this philosopher. And this is the <lb/>
            story told by Pharorinus in the first book of his Commentaries. <lb/>
            Dionysius, however, did not remain quiet; but when he had <lb/>
            heard what had happened he wrote to Plato not to speak ill of <lb/>
            him, and he wrote back in reply that he had not leisure <lb/>
            enough to think at all of Dionysius.</p>
          <p>XV. But he went a second time to Sicily to the younger <lb/>
            Dionysius, and asked him for some land and for some men <lb/>
            whom he might make live according to his own theory of <lb/>
            a constitution. And Dionysius promised to give him some, <lb/>
            but never did it. And some say that he was in danger. <lb/>
             <pb n="121"/>
            himself, having been suspected of exciting Dion and Thetas <lb/>
            to attempt the deliverance of the island ; but that Archytas, <lb/>
            the Pythagorean, wrote a letter to Dionvsius, and begged <lb/>
            Plato off and sent him back safe to Athens. And the letter <lb/>
            is as follows :—</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">ARCHYTAS TO DIONYSIUS, GREETING.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>" All of us who are the friends of Plato, have sent to you <lb/>
            Lamiscus and Photidas, to claim of you this philosopher in <lb/>
            accordance with the agreement which you made with us. <lb/>
            And it is right that you should recollect the eagerness which <lb/>
            you had to see him, when you pressed us all to secure Plato's <lb/>
            visit to you, promising to provide for him, and to treat him <lb/>
            hospitably in every respect, and to ensure his safety both <lb/>
            while he remained with you, and when he departed. <lb/>
            Remember this too that you were very delighted indeed at his <lb/>
            arrival, and that you expressed great pleasure at the time, <lb/>
            such as you never did on anyother occasion. And if any <lb/>
            unpleasantness has arisen between you, you ought to behave <lb/>
            with humanity, and restore the man unhurt; for by so doing <lb/>
            you will act justly, and do us a favour."</p>
          <p>XVI. The third time that he went to Sicily was for the <lb/>
            purpose of reconciling Dion to Dionysius. And as he could <lb/>
            not succeed he returned back to his own country, having lost <lb/>
            his labour.</p>
          <p>XVII. And in his own country he did not meddle with <lb/>
            state affairs, although he was a politician as far as his writings <lb/>
            went. And the reason was, that the people were accustomed <lb/>
            to a form of government and constitution different from what <lb/>
            he approved of. And Pamphile, in the twenty-fifth book of his <lb/>
            Commentaries, says that the Arcadians and Thebans, when <lb/>
            they were founding a great city, appointed him its lawgiver; <lb/>
            but that he, when he had ascertained that they would not con- <lb/>
            sent to an equality of rights, refused to go thither.</p>
          <p>XVIII. It is said also, that he defended Chabrias the <lb/>
            general, when he was impeached in a capital charge; when no <lb/>
            one else of the citizens would undertake the task : and as he <lb/>
            was going up towards the Acropolis with his client, Crobylus <lb/>
            the sycophant met him and said, “Are you come to plead for <lb/>
            another, not knowing that the hemlock of Socrates is waiting <lb/>
             <pb n="122"/>
            also for you ?" But he replied, " And also, when I fought for <lb/>
            my country I encountered dangers ; and now too I encounter <lb/>
            them in the cause of justice and for the defence of a friend."</p>
          <p>XIX. He was the first author who wrote treatises in the <lb/>
            form of dialogues, as Pharorinus tells us in the eighth book of <lb/>
            his Universal History. And he was also the first person who <lb/>
            introduced the analytical method of investigation, which he <lb/>
            taught to Leodamus of Thasos. He was also the first person <lb/>
            in philosophy who spoke of antipodes, and elements, and dia- <lb/>
            lectics, and actions (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ποιήματα</foreign>), and oblong numbers, and plane <lb/>
            surfaces, and the providence of God. He was likewise the <lb/>
            first of the philosophers who contradicted the assertion of Ly- <lb/>
            sias, the son of Cephalus, setting it out word for word in his <lb/>
            Phædrus. And he was also the first person who examined the <lb/>
            subject of grammatical knowledge scientifically. And as he <lb/>
            argued against almost every one who had lived before his time, <lb/>
            it is often asked why he has never mentioned Democritus.</p>
          <p>XX. Neanthes of Cyzicus says, that when he came to the <lb/>
            Olympic games all the Greeks who were present turned to look <lb/>
            at him : and that it was on that occasion that he held a con- <lb/>
            versation with Dion, who was on the point of attacking Diony- <lb/>
            sius. Moreover, in the first book of the Commentaries of <lb/>
            Pharorinus, it is related that Mithridates, the Persian, erected <lb/>
            a statue of Plato in the Academy, and put on it this inscription, <lb/>
            " Mithridates, the son of Rhodobates, a Persian, consecrated <lb/>
            an image of Plato to the Muses, which was made by Sila- <lb/>
            nion."</p>
          <p>XXI. And Heraclides says, that even while a young man, <lb/>
            he was so modest and well regulated, that he was never once <lb/>
            seen to laugh excessively.</p>
          <p>XXII. But though he was of such a grave character him- <lb/>
            self, he was nevertheless ridiculed by the comic poets. Ac- <lb/>
            cordingly, Theopompus, in his Pleasure-seeker, says :— <lb/>
            For one thing is no longer only one, <lb/>
            But two things now are scarcely one ; as says <lb/>
            The solemn Plato.</p>
          <p>And Anaxandrides in his Theseus, says :— <lb/>
            When he ate olives like our worthy Plato.</p>
          <p>And Timon speaks of him in this way, punning on his <lb/>
            name :- <lb/>
             <pb n="123"/>
            As Plato placed strange platitudes on paper.*</p>
          <p>Alexis says in his Mesopis :— <lb/>
            You've come in time : since I've been doubting long, <lb/>
            And walking up and down some time, like Plato; <lb/>
            And yet have hit upon no crafty plan, <lb/>
            But only tir'd my legs.</p>
          <p>And in his Analion, he says:- <lb/>
            You speak of what you do not understand, <lb/>
            Running about like Plato : hoping thus, <lb/>
            To learn the nature of saltpetre and onions.</p>
          <p>Amphis says in his Amphicrates :— <lb/>
            A. But what the good is, which you hope to get <lb/>
            By means of her, my master, I no more <lb/>
            Can form a notion of, than of the good <lb/>
            Of Plato. <lb/>
            B. Listen now..</p>
          <p>And in his Dexidemides he speaks thus :- <lb/>
            0 Plato ! how your learning is confined <lb/>
            To gloomy looks, and wrinkling up your brows, <lb/>
            Like any cockle.</p>
          <p>Cratinas in his Pseudripobolimæus, says :— <lb/>
            You clearly are a man, endued with sense, <lb/>
            And so, as Plato says, I do not know; <lb/>
            But I suspect.</p>
          <p>Alexis, in his Olympiodorus speaks thus :— <lb/>
            My mortal body became dry and withered : <lb/>
            But my immortal part rose to the sky. <lb/>
            Is not this Plato's doctrine ?</p>
          <p>And in his Parasite he says :— <lb/>
            Or to converse alone, like Plato.</p>
          <p>Anaxilas also laughs at him in his Botrylion, and Circe, <lb/>
            and his Rich Women.</p>
          <p>XXIII. And Aristippus, in the fourth book of his treatise <lb/>
            upon Ancient Luxury, says that he was much attached to a <lb/>
            youth of the name of Aster, who used to study astronomy <lb/>
            with him; and also to Dion, whom we have already men- <note type="footnote"> * The Greek is, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὧς ἀνέπλαττε Πλάτων πεπλασμένα θαύματα εἰδὠς</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="124"/>
            tioned. And some say that he was also attached to Phædrus, <lb/>
            and that the following epigrams which ho wrote upon them are <lb/>
            evidences of the love he felt for them :— <lb/>
            My Aster, you're gazing on the stars (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀστέρες</foreign>), <lb/>
            Would that I were the heavens, that so I might <lb/>
            Gaze in return with many eyes on thee.</p>
          <p>Another of his epigrams is :- <lb/>
            Aster, you while among the living shone, <lb/>
            The morning star. But now that you are dead, <lb/>
            You beam like Hesperus in the shades below.</p>
          <p>And he wrote thus on Dion :— <lb/>
            Once, at their birth, the fates did destine tears <lb/>
            To be the lot of all the Trojan women, <lb/>
            And Hecuba, their Queen-to you, 0 Dion, <lb/>
            As the deserved reward for glorious deeds, <lb/>
            They gave extensive and illustrious hopes. <lb/>
            And now you lie beneath your native soil; <lb/>
            Honoured by all your countrymen, 0 Dion, <lb/>
            And loved by me with ardent, lasting love.</p>
          <p>And they say that this epigram is inscribed upon his tomb <lb/>
            at Syracuse. They say, also, that he was in love with Alexis, <lb/>
            and with Phædrus, as I have already mentioned, and that he <lb/>
            wrote an epigram on them both, which runs thus :— <lb/>
            Now when Alexis is no longer aught, <lb/>
            Say only how beloved, how fair he was, <lb/>
            And every one does turn his eyes at once. <lb/>
            Why, my mind, do you show the dogs a bone ? <lb/>
            You're but preparing trouble for yourself: <lb/>
            Have we not also lost the lovely Phædrus !</p>
          <p>There is also a tradition that he had a mistress named Ar- <lb/>
            chianassa, on whom he wrote the following lines :— <lb/>
            I have a mistress fair from Colophon, <lb/>
            Archianassa, on whose very wrinkles <lb/>
            Sits genial love : hard must have been the fate, <lb/>
            Of him who met her earliest blaze of beauty, <lb/>
            Surely he must have been completely scorched.</p>
          <p>He also wrote this epigram on Agathon :— <lb/>
            While kissing Agathon, my soul did rise, <lb/>
            And hover'd o'er my lips ; wishing perchance, <lb/>
            O'er anxious that it was, to migrate to him.</p><pb n="125"/>
            
          <p>Another of his epigrams is :— <lb/>
            I throw this apple to you. And if you <lb/>
            Love me who love you so, receive it gladly, <lb/>
            And let me taste your lovely virgin charms. <lb/>
            Or if that may not be, still take the fruit, <lb/>
            And in your bosom cherish it, and learn <lb/>
            How fleeting is all gracefulness and beauty.</p>
          <p>And another ;- <lb/>
            I am an apple, and am thrown to you, <lb/>
            By one who loves you : but consent, Xanthippe; <lb/>
            For you and I shall both with time decay.</p>
          <p>They also attribute to him the following epigram on the <lb/>
            Eretrians who had been surprised in an ambuscade :— <lb/>
            We were Eretrians, of Eubæan race ? <lb/>
            And now we lie near Susa, here entomb d, <lb/>
            Far from my native land.</p>
          <p>And this one also :— <lb/>
            Thus Venus to the muses spoke : <lb/>
            Damsels submit to Venus' yoke, <lb/>
            Or dread my Cupid's arms. <lb/>
            Those threats, the Virgins nine replied, <lb/>
            May weigh with Mars, but we deride <lb/>
            Love's wrongs, or darts, or charms.</p>
          <p>Another is: — <lb/>
            A certain person found some gold. <lb/>
            Carried it off, and in its stead <lb/>
            Left a strong hatter neatly roll'd. <lb/>
            The owner found his treasure fled ; <lb/>
            And powerless to endure his fortune's wreck, <lb/>
            Fitted the halter to his hapless neck.</p>
          <p>XXIV. But Melon, who had a great dislike to Plato, says, <lb/>
            " There is not so much to wonder at in Dionysius being at <lb/>
            Corinth, as in Plato's being in Sicily. Xenophon, too, does <lb/>
            not appear to have been very friendlily disposed towards him: <lb/>
            and accordingly they have, as if in rivalry of one another, both <lb/>
            written books with the same title, the Banquet, the Defence of <lb/>
            Socrates, Moral Reminiscences. Then, too, the one wrote the <lb/>
            Cyropædia and the other a book on Politics ; and Plato in his <lb/>
            Laws says, that the Cyropædia is a mere romance, for that <lb/>
            Cyrus was not such a person as he is described in that book. <lb/>
            And though they both speak so much of Socrates, neither of <lb/>
             <pb n="126"/>
            them ever mentions the other, except that Xenophon once <lb/>
            speaks of Plato in the third book of his Reminiscences. It is <lb/>
            said also, that Antisthenes, being about to recite something <lb/>
            that he had written, invited him to be present; and that Plato <lb/>
            having asked what he was going to recite, he said it was an <lb/>
            essay on the impropriety of contradicting. " How then," said <lb/>
            Plato, " can you write on this subject ?" and then he showed <lb/>
            him that he was arguing in a circle. But Antisthenes was <lb/>
            annoyed, and composed a dialogue against Plato, which he en- <lb/>
            titled Sothon; after which they were always enemies to one <lb/>
            another; and they say that Socrates having heard Plato read <lb/>
            the Lysis, said, " 0 Hercules! what a number of lies the <lb/>
            young man has told about me." For he had set down a great <lb/>
            many things as sayings of Socrates which he never said.</p>
          <p>Plato also was a great enemy of Aristippus ; accordingly, he <lb/>
            speaks ill of him in his book on the Soul, and says that he was <lb/>
            not with Socrates when he died, though he was in Ægina, at <lb/>
            no great distance. He also had a great rivalry with Æschi- <lb/>
            nes, for that he had been held in great esteem by Dionysius, <lb/>
            and afterwards came to want, and was despised by Plato, but <lb/>
            supported by Aristippus. And Idomeneus says, that the speech <lb/>
            which Plato attributes to Crito in the prison, when he coun- <lb/>
            selled Socrates to make his escape, was really delivered by <lb/>
            Æschines, but that Plato attributed it to Crito because of his <lb/>
            dislike to the other. And Plato never makes the slightest <lb/>
            mention of him in any of his books, except in the treatise on <lb/>
            the Soul, and the Defence of Socrates.</p>
          <p>XXV. Aristotle says, that the treatises of Plato are some- <lb/>
            thing between poems and prose ; and Pharorinus says, when <lb/>
            Plato read his treatise on the Soul, Aristotle was the only <lb/>
            person who sat it out, and that all the rest rose up and went <lb/>
            away. And some say that Philip the Opuntian copied out the <lb/>
            whole of his books upon Laws, which were written on waxen <lb/>
            tablets only. Some people also attribute the Epinomis to him. <lb/>
            Euphorion and Panætius have stated that the beginning of the <lb/>
            treatise on the Republic was often altered and re-written; and <lb/>
            that very treatise, Aristoxenus affirms, was found almost entire <lb/>
            in the Contradictions of Protagoras; and that the first book <lb/>
            he wrote at all was the Phædrus; and indeed that composition <lb/>
            has a good many indications of a young composer. But Dicæ- <lb/>
            archus blames the whole style of that work as vulgar.</p><pb n="127"/>
            
          <p>XXVI. A story is told, that Plato, having seen a man play- <lb/>
            ing at dice, reproached him for it, and that he said he was playing <lb/>
            for a trifle ; " But the habit," rejoined Plato, " is not a trifle." <lb/>
            On one occasion he was asked whether there would be any <lb/>
            monument of him, as of his predecessors in philosophy ? and <lb/>
            he answered, " A man must first make a name, and the monu- <lb/>
            ment will follow." Once, when Xenocrates came into his house, <lb/>
            he desired him to scourge one of his slaves for him, for that <lb/>
            he himself could not do it because he was in a passion ; and <lb/>
            that at another time he said to one of his slaves, " I should beat <lb/>
            you if I were not in a passion." Having got on horseback he <lb/>
            dismounted again immediately, saying that he was afraid that <lb/>
            he should be infected with horse-pride. He used to advise <lb/>
            people who got drunk to look in the glass, and then they would <lb/>
            abandon their unseemly habit; and he said that it was never <lb/>
            decorous to drink to the degree of drunkenness, except at the <lb/>
            festivals of the God who had given men wine. He also dis- <lb/>
            approved of much sleeping : accordingly in his Laws he says, <lb/>
            “ No one while sleeping is good for anything." Another say- <lb/>
            ing of his was, " That the pleasantest of all things to hear was <lb/>
            the truth; but others report this saying thus, " That the sweetest <lb/>
            of all things was to speak truth." And of truth he speaks <lb/>
            thus in his Laws, " Truth, my friend, is a beautiful and a <lb/>
            durable thing; but it is not easy to persuade men of this <lb/>
            fact. ”</p>
          <p>XXVII. He used also to wish to leave a memorial of <lb/>
            himself behind, either in the hearts of his friends, or in his <lb/>
            books.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. He also used to travel a good deal as some <lb/>
            authors inform us.</p>
          <p>XXIX. And he died in the manner we have already <lb/>
            mentioned, in the thirteenth year of the reign of Philip of <lb/>
            Macedon, as Pharorinus mentions in the third book of his <lb/>
            Commentaries; and Theopompus relates that Philip on one <lb/>
            occasion reproached him. But Mysonianus, in his Resem- <lb/>
            blances, says that Philo mentions some proverbs that were in <lb/>
            circulation about Plato's lice; implying that he had died of <lb/>
            that disease.</p>
          <p>XXX. He was buried in the Academy, where he spent <lb/>
            the greater part of his time in the practice of philosophy, <lb/>
            from which his was called the Academic school; and his <lb/>
             <pb n="128"/>
            funeral was attended by all the pupils of that sect. And he <lb/>
            made his will in the following terms :—" Plato left these things, <lb/>
            and has bequeathed them as follows :- The farm in the district <lb/>
            of the Hephæstiades, bounded on the north by the road from <lb/>
            the temple of the Cephiciades, and on the south by the temple <lb/>
            of Hercules, which is in the district of the Hephæstiades; <lb/>
            and on the east by the estate of Archestratus the Phreanian, <lb/>
            and on the west by the farm of Philip the Challidian, shall <lb/>
            be incapable of being sold or alienated, but shall belong to my <lb/>
            son Ademantus as far as possible. And so likewise shall my <lb/>
            farm in the district of the Eiresides, which I bought of Calli- <lb/>
            machus, which is bounded on the north by the property of <lb/>
            Eurymedon the Myrrhinusian, on the south by that of <lb/>
            Demostratus of Xypeta, on the east by that of Eurymedcn <lb/>
            the Myrrhinusian, and on the west by the Cephisus ;— I also <lb/>
            leave him three mince of silver, a silver goblet weighing a <lb/>
            hundred and sixty-five drachms, a cup weighing forty-five <lb/>
            drachms, a golden ring, and a golden ear-ring, weighing <lb/>
            together four drachms and three obols. Euclides the stone- <lb/>
            cutter owes me three mime. I leave Diana her liberty. My <lb/>
            slaves Sychon, Bictas, Apolloniades, and Dionysius, I bequeath <lb/>
            to my son ; and I also give him all my furniture, of which <lb/>
            Demetrius has a catalogue. I owe no one anything. My <lb/>
            executors shall be Tozthenes, Speusippus, Demetrius, Hegias, <lb/>
            Eurymedon, Callimachus, and Thrasippus." This was his <lb/>
            will. And on his tomb the following epigrams were inscribed. <lb/>
            First of all :- <lb/>
            Here, first of all men for pure justice famed, <lb/>
            And moral virtue, Aristocles lies ; <lb/>
            And if there e'er has lived one truly wise, <lb/>
            This man was wiser still; too great for envy.</p>
          <p>A second is:- <lb/>
            Here in her bosom does the tender earth' <lb/>
            Embrace great Plato's corpse.-His soul aloft <lb/>
            Has ta'en its place among the immortal Gods. <lb/>
            Ariston's glorious son-whom all good men, <lb/>
            Though in far countries, held in love and honour, <lb/>
            Remembering his pure and god-like life.</p>
          <p>There is another which is more modern :- <lb/>
             <pb n="129"/>
            A. Eagle, why fly you o'er this holy tomb ? <lb/>
            Or are you on your way, with lofty wing, <lb/>
            To some bright starry domicile of the Gods ? <lb/>
            B. I am the image of the soul of Plato, <lb/>
            And to Olympus now am borne on high; <lb/>
            His body lies in his own native Attica.</p>
          <p>We ourselves also have written one epigram on him, which <lb/>
            is as follows :— <lb/>
            If fav'ring Phœbus had not Plato given <lb/>
            To Grecian lands, how would the learned God <lb/>
            Have e'er instructed mortal minds in learning ? <lb/>
            But he did send him, that as Æsculapius <lb/>
            His son's the best physician of the body, <lb/>
            So Plato should be of the immortal soul.</p>
          <p>And others, alluding to his death :— <lb/>
            Phœbus, to bless mankind, became the father <lb/>
            Of Æsculapius, and of god-like Plato ; <lb/>
            That one to heal the body, this the mind. <lb/>
            Now, from a marriage feast he's gone to heaven. <lb/>
            To realize the happy city there, <lb/>
            Which he has planned fit for the realms of Jove.</p>
          <p>These then are the epigrams on him.</p>
          <p>XXXI. His disciples were, Speusippus the Athenian, <lb/>
            Zenocrates of Chalcedon, Aristotle the Stagirite, Philip of <lb/>
            Opus, Histiæus of Perinthus, Dion of Syracuse, Amyclus of <lb/>
            Heraclea, Erastus and Coriscus of Sceptos, Timolaus of <lb/>
            Cyzicus, Eudon of Lampsacus, Pithon and Heraclides of <lb/>
            Æmus, Hippothales and Callippus, Athenians, Demetrius of <lb/>
            Amphipolis, Heraclides of Pontus, and numbers of others, <lb/>
            among whom there were also two women, Lasthenea of <lb/>
            Mantinea, and Axiothea of Phlius, who used even to wear <lb/>
            man's clothes, as we are told by Dicsearchus. Some say that <lb/>
            Theophrastus also was a pupil of his; and Chamælion says <lb/>
            that Hyperides the orator, and Lycurgus, were so likewise. <lb/>
            Polemo also asserts that Demosthenes was. Sabinus adds <lb/>
            Mnesistratus of Thasos to the number, quoting authority for <lb/>
            the statement in the fourth book of his Meditative Matter; <lb/>
            and it is not improbable.</p>
          <p>XXXII. But as you, 0 lady, are rightly very much attached <lb/>
            to Plato, and as you are very fond of hunting out in every <lb/>
            quarter all the doctrines of the philosopher with great eager- <note type="footnote"> K </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="130"/>
            ness, I have thought it necessary to subjoin an account of the <lb/>
            general character of his lectures, and of the arrangement of <lb/>
            his dialogues, and of the method of his inductive argument; <lb/>
            going back to their elements and first principles as far as I <lb/>
            could, so that the collection of anecdotes concerning his life <lb/>
            which I have been able to make, may not be curtailed by the <lb/>
            omission of any statement as to his doctrines. For it would <lb/>
            be like sending owls to Athens, as the proverb is, if I were to <lb/>
            descend to particular details.</p>
          <p>They say now, that Zeno, the Eleatic, was the first person <lb/>
            who composed essays in the form of dialogue. But Aristotle, <lb/>
            in the first book of his treatise on Poets, says that Alexander, <lb/>
            a native of Styra, or Teos, did so before him, as Phavorinus <lb/>
            also says in his Commentaries. But it seems to me that Plato <lb/>
            gave this kind of writing the last polish, and that he has <lb/>
            therefore, a just right to the first honour, not only as the <lb/>
            improver, but also as inventor of that kind of writing, Now, <lb/>
            the dialogue is a discourse carried on by way of question and <lb/>
            answer, on some one of the subjects with which philosophy is <lb/>
            conversant, or with which statesmanship is concerned, with a <lb/>
            becoming attention to the characters of the persons who are <lb/>
            introduced as speakers, and with a careful selection of language <lb/>
            governed by the same consideration. And dialectics is the <lb/>
            art of conversing, by means of which we either overturn or <lb/>
            establish the proposition contended for, by means of the ques- <lb/>
            tions and answers which are put in the mouths of the parties <lb/>
            conversing. Now, of the Platonic discourse there are two <lb/>
            characteristics discernible on the very surface; one fitted for <lb/>
            guiding, the other for investigating.</p>
          <p>The first of these has two subordinate species, one specula- <lb/>
            tive, the other practical; and of these two again, the speculative <lb/>
            is divided into the natural and the logical, and the practical <lb/>
            into the ethical and the political. Again, the kind fitted <lb/>
            for investigating has also two primary divisions with their <lb/>
            separate characteristics, one object of which is simply practice, <lb/>
            the other being also disputatious : and the first of these two is <lb/>
            again subdivided into two; one of which may be compared to <lb/>
            the art of the midwife, and the other is at it were tentative ; <lb/>
            the disputatious one is also divided into the demonstrative and <lb/>
            the distinctive.</p>
          <p>But we are not unaware that some writers distinguish the <lb/>
             <pb n="131"/>
            various dialogues in a different manner from what we do. For <lb/>
            they say that some of them are dramatic, and others narrative, <lb/>
            and others of a mixed nature. But they, in this division, are <lb/>
            classifying the dialogues in a theatrical rather than in a philo- <lb/>
            sophical manner. Some of the dialogues also refer to subjects <lb/>
            of natural philosophy, such as the Timæus. Of the logical <lb/>
            class, there are the Politics, the Cratylus, the Parmenides, and <lb/>
            the Sophist. Of the ethical kind there is the defence of <lb/>
            Socrates, the Crito, the Phædo, the Phsedrus, the Banquet, <lb/>
            the Menexenus, the Clitiphon, the Epistles, the Philebus, the <lb/>
            Hipparchus. and the Rival Lovers. Of the political class there <lb/>
            is the Republic, the Laws, the Minos, the Epinomis, and the <lb/>
            Atlanticus. Of the midwife description we have the two <lb/>
            Alcibiades's, the Theages, the Lysis, the Laches. Of the <lb/>
            tentative kind, there is the Euthyphro, the Meno, the Ion, <lb/>
            the Charmides, and the Theætetus. Of the demonstrative <lb/>
            description, we have the Protagoras, and of the distinctive <lb/>
            class the Euthydemus, the two Hippias's, and the Gorgias. <lb/>
            And this is enough to say about the dialogues as to what they <lb/>
            are, and what their different kinds are.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. But since there is also a great division of opinion <lb/>
            respecting them, from some people asserting that in them <lb/>
            Plato dogmatizes in a positive manner, while others deny this, <lb/>
            we had better also touch upon this part of the question. <lb/>
            Now, dogmatizing is laying down dogmas, just as legislating <lb/>
            is making laws. But the word dogma is used in two senses; <lb/>
            to mean both that which we think, and opinion itself. Now <lb/>
            of these, that which we think is the proposition, and opinion <lb/>
            is the conception by which we entertain it in our minds. Plato <lb/>
            then explains the opinions which he entertains himself, and <lb/>
            refutes false ones; and about doubtful matters he suspends <lb/>
            his judgment. His opinions of matters as they appear to him <lb/>
            he puts into the mouth of four persons, Socrates, Timæus, an <lb/>
            Athenian poet, and an Eleatic stranger. But the strangers <lb/>
            are not, as some people have supposed, Plato and Parmenides, <lb/>
            but certain nameless imaginary characters. Since Plato asserts <lb/>
            as undeniable axioms all the opinions which he puts into the <lb/>
            mouth of Socrates or Timseus. But when he is refuting false <lb/>
            propositions, he introduces such characters as Thrasymachus, <lb/>
            and Callicles, and Polus, and Gorgias, and Protagoras, Hippi- <lb/>
            astro, and Euthydemus, and men of that stamp. But when <note type="footnote"> K 2</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="132"/>
            he is demonstrating anything, then he chiefly uses the indue- <lb/>
            tive form of argument, and that too not of one kind only, but <lb/>
            of two. For induction is an argument, which by means of <lb/>
            some admitted truths establishes naturally other truths which <lb/>
            resemble them. But there are two kinds of induction ; the <lb/>
            one proceeding from contraries, the other from consequents. <lb/>
            Now, the one which proceeds from contraries, is one in which <lb/>
            from the answer given, whatever that answer may be, the con- <lb/>
            trary of the principle indicated in the question must follow. <lb/>
            As for instance. My father is either a different person from <lb/>
            your father, or he is the same person. If now your father is <lb/>
            a different person from my father, then as he is a different <lb/>
            person from a father, he cannot be a father. If, on the other <lb/>
            hand, he is the same person as my father, then, since he is <lb/>
            the same person as my father, he must be my father. And <lb/>
            again, if man be not an animal, he must be either a stone or <lb/>
            a piece of wood ; but he is not a stone or a piece of wood, for <lb/>
            he is a living animal, and capable of independent motion. <lb/>
            Therefore, he is an animal. But, if he is an animal, and a <lb/>
            dog or an ox is likewise an animal, then man must be an <lb/>
            animal, and a dog, and an ox. — This then is the method of <lb/>
            induction in contradiction and contention, which Plato was <lb/>
            accustomed to employ, not for the purpose of establishing <lb/>
            principles of his own, but with the object of refuting the <lb/>
            arguments of others.</p>
          <p>Now, the inductive kind of argument drawn from conse- <lb/>
            quents is of a twofold character. The one proving a particular <lb/>
            opinion by an admitted fact of an equally particular nature; <lb/>
            or else going from particulars to generals. And the first of <lb/>
            these two divisions is the oratorical one, the second the <lb/>
            dialectic one. As for instance, in the former kind the ques- <lb/>
            tion is whether this person has committed a murder; the <lb/>
            proof is that he was found at the time covered with blood. <lb/>
            But this is the oratorical method of employing the induction ; <lb/>
            since oratory is conversant about particulars, and does not <lb/>
            concern itself about generals. For its object is not to ascer- <lb/>
            tain abstract justice, but only particular justice. The other <lb/>
            is the dialectic kind, the general proposition having been <lb/>
            established by particular ones. As for instance, the question <lb/>
            is whether the soul is immortal, and whether the living con- <lb/>
            sist of those who have once been dead; and this proposition <lb/>
             <pb n="133"/>
            Plato establishes in his book on the Soul, by a certain general <lb/>
            proposition, that contraries arise out of contraries ; and this <lb/>
            identical general proposition is established by certain particular <lb/>
            ones. As, for instance, that sleep follows on waking, and <lb/>
            waking from sleeping, and the greater from the less, and <lb/>
            reversely the less from the greater. And this kind of <lb/>
            induction he used to employ for the establishment of his own <lb/>
            opinions.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. Anciently, in tragedy, it was only the chorus <lb/>
            who did the whole work of the play; but subsequently, <lb/>
            Thespis introduced one actor for the sake of giving the chorus <lb/>
            some rest, and Æschylus added a second, and Sophocles a <lb/>
            third, and so they made tragedy complete. So in the same <lb/>
            manner, philosophical discourse was originally uniform, con- <lb/>
            cerning itself solely about natural philosophy; then Socrates <lb/>
            added to it a second character, the ethical: and Plato a third, <lb/>
            the dialectic: and so he brought philosophy to perfection.</p>
          <p>XXXV. But Thrasybulus says that he published his dia- <lb/>
            logues as the dramatic poets published their tetralogies. For, <lb/>
            they contended with four plays, (and at four festivals, the <lb/>
            Dionysiac, the Lenæau, the Panathenæan, and the Chytri), <lb/>
            one of which was a satiric drama, and the whole four plays <lb/>
            were called a tetralogy. Now, people say, the whole of his <lb/>
            genuine dialogues amount to fifty-six; the treatise on the <lb/>
            Republic being divided into ten books, (which Phavorinus, in <lb/>
            the second book of his Universal History, says may be found <lb/>
            almost entire in the Contradictions of Protagoras), and that <lb/>
            on Laws into twelve. And there are nine tetralogies, if we <lb/>
            consider the Republic as occupying the place of one book, and <lb/>
            the Laws of another. He arranges, therefore, the first tetra- <lb/>
            logy of these dialogues which have a common subject, wishing <lb/>
            to show what sort of life that of the philosopher may have <lb/>
            been. And he uses two titles for each separate book, taking <lb/>
            one from the name of the principal speaker, and the other <lb/>
            from the subject.</p>
          <p>This tetralogy then, which is the first, is commenced by <lb/>
            the Euthyphron, or what is Holy; and that dialogue is a <lb/>
            tentative one. The second is the Defence of Socrates, a moral <lb/>
            one. The third is the Criton, or What is to be done, a moral <lb/>
            one. The fourth is the Phædo, or the Dialogue on the Soul, <lb/>
            a moral one.</p><pb n="134"/>
            
          <p>The second tetralogy is that of which the first piece is the <lb/>
            Cratylus, or the correctness of names, a logical one. The <lb/>
            Mesetetus, or Knowledge, a tentative one. The Sophist, or a <lb/>
            dialogue on the Existent, a logical one. The Statesman, or <lb/>
            a dialogue of Monarchy, a logical one.</p>
          <p>The first dialogue in the third tetralogy is the Parmenides, <lb/>
            or a dialogue of Ideas, a logical one. The second is the <lb/>
            Philelus, or on Pleasure, a moral one. The Banquet, or on <lb/>
            the Good, a moral one. The Phædrus, or on Love, a moral <lb/>
            one.</p>
          <p>The fourth tetralogy opens with the Alcibiades, or a <lb/>
            treatise on the Nature of Man, a midwife-like work. The <lb/>
            second Alcibiades, or on Prayer, a piece of the same charac- <lb/>
            ter. The Hipparchus, or on the Love of Gain, a moral one. <lb/>
            The Rival Lovers, or a treatise on Philosophy, a moral one.</p>
          <p>The first dialogue in the fifth is the Theages, or another <lb/>
            treatise on Philosophy, another midwife-like work. The <lb/>
            Charmides, or on Temperance, a tentative esssay. The <lb/>
            Laches, or on Manly Courage, midwife-like. The Lysis, or a <lb/>
            dissertation on Friendship, also midwife-like.</p>
          <p>The sixth tetralogy commences with the Euthydemus, or <lb/>
            the Disputatious Man, a distinctive dialogue. Then comes the <lb/>
            Protagoras, or the Sophists, a demonstrative one. The Gorgias, <lb/>
            or a dissertation on Rhetoric, another distinctive one. And <lb/>
            the Mono, or on Virtue, a tentative dialogue.</p>
          <p>The seventh begins with the two Hippias's. The first being <lb/>
            a dissertation on the Beautiful, the second one on Falsehood, <lb/>
            both distinctive. The third is the Ion, or a dissertation on <lb/>
            the Iliad, a tentative one. The fourth is the Menexenus, or <lb/>
            the Funeral Oration, a moral one.</p>
          <p>The first dialogue in the eighth is the Clitophon, or the <lb/>
            Exhortation, a moral piece. Then comes the Republic, or the <lb/>
            treatise on Justice, a political one. The Timæus, or a dis- <lb/>
            sertation on Nature, a dialogue on Natural Philosophy. And <lb/>
            the Critias, or Atlanticus, a moral one</p>
          <p>The ninth begins with the Minos, or a treatise on Law, a <lb/>
            political work. The Laws, or a dissertation on Legislation, <lb/>
            another political work. The Epinomis, or the Nocturnal <lb/>
            Conversation, or the Philosopher, a third political one.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. And this last tetralogy is completed by thirteen <lb/>
            epistles, all moral; to which is prefixed as a motto, <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὖ πϱάττειν</foreign>, <lb/>
             <pb n="135"/>
            just as Epicurus inscribed on his <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὖ διάγειν</foreign>, and Cleon on his <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαιϱειν</foreign>. They are, one letter to Aristodemns, two to Archytas, <lb/>
            four to Dionysius, one to Hermeias, Erastus, and Coriscus, <lb/>
            one to Leodamas, one to Dion, one to Perdiccas, and two to <lb/>
            the friends of Dion.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. And this is the way in which some people <lb/>
            divide his works. But others, among whom is Aristophanes, <lb/>
            the grammarian, arrange his dialogues in trilogies ; and they <lb/>
            make the first to consist of the Republic, the Timæus and the <lb/>
            Critias.</p>
          <p>The second of the Sophist, the Statesman, the Cratylus. <lb/>
            The third of the Laws, the Minos, the Epinomis.</p>
          <p>The fourth of the Theætetus, the Euthypbro, the Defence <lb/>
            of Socrates.</p>
          <p>The fifth of the Crito, the Phædo, the Epistles.</p>
          <p>And the rest they arrange singly and independently, without <lb/>
            any regular order. And some authors, as has been said <lb/>
            already, place the Republic at the head of his works : others <lb/>
            begin with the Greater Alcibiades : others with the Theages; <lb/>
            some with the Euthyphro, others with the Clitophon ; some <lb/>
            with the Timæus, some with the Phædrus, others again with <lb/>
            the Theætetus. Many make the Defence of Socrates the first <lb/>
            piece.</p>
          <p>There are some dialogues attributed to him which are <lb/>
            confessedly spurious. The Midon, or the Horse-breeder ; the <lb/>
            Eryxias, or Erasistratus; the Alcyon; the Acephali, or <lb/>
            Sisyphi ; the Axiochus ; the Phaeacians ; the Demodorus ; <lb/>
            The Chilidon ; the Seventh ; the Epimenides. Of which the <lb/>
            Alcyon is believed to be the work of a man named Leon ; as <lb/>
            Phavorinus tells us in the seventh book of his Commentaries.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. But he employs a great variety of terms in <lb/>
            order to render his philosophical system unintelligible to the <lb/>
            ignorant. In his phraseology he considers wisdom as the <lb/>
            knowledge of things which can be understood by the intellect, <lb/>
            and which have a real existence : which has the Gods for its <lb/>
            object, and the soul as unconnected with the body. He also, <lb/>
            with a peculiarity of expression, calls wisdom also philosophy, <lb/>
            which he explains as a desire for divine wisdom. But wisdom <lb/>
            and experience are also used by him in their common accepta- <lb/>
            tion ; as, for instance, when he calls an artisan wise (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σοϕὸς</foreign>). <lb/>
            He also uses the same words in different senses at different <lb/>
             <pb n="136"/>
            times. Accordingly he uses <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϕαυ̃λος</foreign> in the sense of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁπλου̃ς</foreign>, <lb/>
            simple, in which meaning also the word occurs in Euripides, <lb/>
            in the Licymonius, where the poet speaks of Hercules in the <lb/>
            following terms :- <lb/>
            Mean looking (<foreign xml:lang="grc">φαυ̃λος</foreign>), rude, virtuous in great affairs, <lb/>
            Measuring all wisdom by its last results, <lb/>
            A hero unrefined in speech.</p>
          <p>But Plato uses the word sometimes even for what is <lb/>
            beautiful; and sometimes for small and insignificant; and <lb/>
            very often he uses different words to express the same idea. <lb/>
            Accordingly, besides the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰδέα</foreign>, for a class, he uses also <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶδος</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">γένος</foreign>, and and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀϱχὴ</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἴτιον</foreign>. Sometimes <lb/>
            he uses opposite expressions for the same thing; accordingly, <lb/>
            he says that it is an object of sensation that exists, while at <lb/>
            other times he says it is that which does not exist; speaking <lb/>
            of it as existing because of its origin, and as non-existent with <lb/>
            reference to its continual changes. Then again, he defines <lb/>
            his <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰδέα</foreign>, as something which is neither moving nor stationary, <lb/>
            at one time calling the same thing, at another time one thing, <lb/>
            at a third time many things, And he is in the habit of doing <lb/>
            this in many instances.</p>
          <p>And the explanation of his arguments is three-fold. For <lb/>
            first of all, it is necessary to explain what each thing that is <lb/>
            said is; secondly, on what account it is said, whether because <lb/>
            of its bearing on the principal point, or figuratively, and <lb/>
            whether it is said for the purpose of establishing an opinion of <lb/>
            his own, or of refuting the arguments brought forward by the <lb/>
            other party to the conversation ; and thirdly, whether it has <lb/>
            been said truly.</p>
          <p>XXXIX. But since there are some particular marks put in <lb/>
            his books, we must also say something about them. x <lb/>
            indicates peculiar expressions and figures of speech, and <lb/>
            generally any peculiarities of Plato's style. When doubled it <lb/>
            points to the doctrines and peculiar opinions of Plato; ※ <lb/>
            when dotted all round, points to some select bits of beautiful <lb/>
            writing. When doubled and dotted it indicates corrections of <lb/>
            some passages. A dotted obelus indicates hasty disapprovals. <lb/>
            An inverted sigma dotted all round points out passages which <lb/>
            may be taken in a double sense, and transpositions of words. <lb/>
             <pb n="137"/>
            The Ceraunium* indicates a connection of philosophical ideas. <lb/>
            An asterisk points out an agreement in doctrine. And an <lb/>
            obelus marks the rejection of the expression or of the passage. <lb/>
            These then are the marginal marks which occur, and the <lb/>
            writings of which Plato was the author :-which, as Antigonus <lb/>
            the Carystian says, in his treatise on Zeno, when they had <lb/>
            been but lately published, brought in some gain to the posses- <lb/>
            sors, if any one else was desirous of reading them.</p>
          <p>XL. These now were his chief opinions. He affirmed that <lb/>
            the soul was immortal and clothed in many bodies successively, <lb/>
            and that its first principle was number, and that the first <lb/>
            principle of the body was geometry. And he defined it as an <lb/>
            abstract idea of spirit diffused in every direction. He said <lb/>
            also, that it was self-moving and threefold. For that that <lb/>
            part of it which was capable of reasoning was situated in the <lb/>
            head, that that portion which was affected by passion was <lb/>
            seated around the heart, and that which was appetitive was <lb/>
            placed around the navel and the liver. And that it is placed <lb/>
            in the middle of the body, and embraces it at the same time <lb/>
            in all its parts, and that it consists of elements ; and that <lb/>
            when it is divided according to harmonic intervals it forms <lb/>
            two connected circles ; of which the inner circle is divided <lb/>
            into six portions, and makes in all seven circles ; and that <lb/>
            this is placed on the left hand of the diameter, and situated <lb/>
            in the interior. But the other is on the right hand of the <lb/>
            same line ; on which account, and because it is one only, it is <lb/>
            the superior of the two. For the other is divided internally; <lb/>
            and this too, is the circle of that which is always the same ; <lb/>
            the other, the circle of that which is changeable and different. <lb/>
            And the one he says is the motion of the soul, but the other <lb/>
            is the motion of the universe and of the planets.</p>
          <p>On the other side, the division of the circles from the centre <lb/>
            to the extremities, being harmoniously appropriated to the <lb/>
            essence of the soul, the one knows existing things and esta- <lb/>
            blishes harmony between them, because it is itself composed <lb/>
            of harmonious elements. The circle of what is changeable, <lb/>
            engenders opinion by its regular movements; but the circle <lb/>
            of that which is always the same produces knowledge.</p>
          <p>XLI. Plato lays down two primary causes or principles <lb/>
            of all things, God and matter, which he also calls mind, <note type="footnote"> * This figure was like a barbed arrow, according to Zevort. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="138"/>
            and the cause. And he defines matter as something without <lb/>
            shape and without limitation, and says that from it all concre- <lb/>
            tions arise. He affirms also that as it was moving about at <lb/>
            random, it was brought by God into one settled place, as God <lb/>
            thought order better than disorder; and that this nature is <lb/>
            divided into four elements, fire, water, air, and earth, of which <lb/>
            the world itself and everything in it was made. But he says <lb/>
            that the earth is the only thing that is unchangeable, as he <lb/>
            considers the cause to be the difference of the figures of which <lb/>
            it is composed; for he says that the figures of the others are <lb/>
            homogeneous ; for that they are all composed equally of scalene <lb/>
            triangles. The figure of the earth, however, is peculiar to <lb/>
            itself; for the element of fire is a pyramid ; of air, an octagon ; <lb/>
            of water, aneicosagon; and of the earth, a cube; owing to which <lb/>
            these things cannot be changed into earth, nor earth into them. <lb/>
            He teaches also that these elements are not separated so as to <lb/>
            occupy each a peculiar and distinct place; for the spherical <lb/>
            motion collects and compresses all the small things towards the <lb/>
            centre, and the small things separate the great ones, on which ac- <lb/>
            count the species, as they change, do also change their positions.</p>
          <p>Moreover he asserts that the world is one, and has been pro- <lb/>
            duced, since it has been made by God, in such a manner as to <lb/>
            be an object of sensation. And he considers it endowed with <lb/>
            life, because that which is so endowed, is superior to that which <lb/>
            is not, and it must be the production of the most excellent pro- <lb/>
            ducer. It is also one, and illimitable; because the model <lb/>
            after which it was made was one ; and it is spherical, because <lb/>
            its creator was of that form; for it also contains all other <lb/>
            animals, and God who made it comprises all forms. And it <lb/>
            is smooth, and has no instruments whatever all round it, <lb/>
            because it has no need of any. But the whole world remains <lb/>
            imperishable, because it cannot be resolved into God ; and God <lb/>
            is the cause of universal production, because it is the nature of <lb/>
            the good to be productive of good; and the best is the cause of <lb/>
            the production of the heaven; for the best of all productions <lb/>
            can have no other cause than the best of all intelligible <lb/>
            existences. And since God is of that character, and since <lb/>
            heaven resembles the best, inasmuch as it is at least the most <lb/>
            beautiful of all things, it cannot be like anything else that is <lb/>
            produced, except God.</p>
          <p>He also teaches that the world consists of fire, water, air, <lb/>
             <pb n="139"/>
            and earth ; of fire, in order that it may be visible; of earth, in <lb/>
            order that it may be firm ; of water and air, that it may not be <lb/>
            destitute of proportion; for two middle terms are indispensable <lb/>
            to keep the solid bodies in clue proportion to one another, and <lb/>
            to realize the unity of the whole. In short, the world is formed <lb/>
            of all the elements together, in order that it may be perfect <lb/>
            and imperishable.</p>
          <p>Again, time is the image of eternity; eternity subsists for <lb/>
            ever; but the motion of the heaven is time; for day, and <lb/>
            night, and the months, and all such divisions, are parts of time, <lb/>
            on which account there could be no such thing as time apart <lb/>
            from the nature of the world ; for time existed contempo- <lb/>
            raucously and simultaneously with the world. And it was with <lb/>
            reference to time that the sun, and the moon, and the planets <lb/>
            were made ; and it was in order that the number of the seasons <lb/>
            might be manifest, and that the animals might partake of num- <lb/>
            ber, that God kindled the light of the sun; and that the moon <lb/>
            was above the circle of the earth, and that the sun was next to <lb/>
            it, and in the still higher circles were the planets. And that <lb/>
            the universe was animated, because it was altogether bound up <lb/>
            in animated motion, and that the race of all other animals was <lb/>
            produced in order that the world might be made perfect, and re- <lb/>
            sembling an animal such as could be comprehended by intellect. <lb/>
            Since then God had life, the heaven also must have life; and the <lb/>
            Gods are to a great extent composed of fire. And there are <lb/>
            three other races of animals, those which fly in the air; those <lb/>
            which lives in the water; those which walk in the earth. The <lb/>
            oldest of all the deities in heaven is the Earth; she was formed in <lb/>
            order to be the dispenser of night and day; and as she is placed <lb/>
            in the centre, she is constantly in motion around the .centre.</p>
          <p>And since there are two efficient causes, some things must, <lb/>
            he says, be affirmed to exist in consequence of intellect, and <lb/>
            some from some necessary cause. Now necessary causes are <lb/>
            the air, fire, earth, and water, these not being real elements, <lb/>
            but rather receptacles; and they too are formed of triangles <lb/>
            in combination, and are resolvable into triangles; and their <lb/>
            elements are the scalene triangle and the isosceles. These two <lb/>
            before mentioned elements are the principles and causes of <lb/>
            things, of which the models are God and matter, which last <lb/>
            must necessarily be destitute of form, as is the case of other <lb/>
            receptacles. And that the cause of these things was a necessary <lb/>
             <pb n="140"/>
            cause, -which, receiving the ideas, produced the substances; and <lb/>
            was moved by the dissimilarity of its own power, and again by <lb/>
            its motion compelled those things which were moved by it to <lb/>
            move other things in their turn.</p>
          <p>But all these things were formerly moved without any reason <lb/>
            or order; but after they began to form the world by their com- <lb/>
            bination, they then received symmetry and regularity from God, <lb/>
            according to the principles applicable to them; for the efficient <lb/>
            causes, even before the creation of the heaven, were two in <lb/>
            number. There was also a third, namely production; but <lb/>
            these were not very evident, but rather traces than actual <lb/>
            things, and quite devoid of regularity. But after the world <lb/>
            was made, then they too assumed a regular form and arrange- <lb/>
            ment ; but the heaven was made of all existing bodies. And <lb/>
            Plato considers that God is incorporeal just as the soul is, and <lb/>
            that it is owing to that that he is not affected by any destruction <lb/>
            or external circumstances. And ideas, as we have said before, <lb/>
            he defines as certain causes and principles, owing to which it <lb/>
            is that such and such things are by nature what they are.</p>
          <p>XLII. On the subject of good and evil, these were his sen- <lb/>
            timents : that the end was to become like God ; and that <lb/>
            virtue was sufficient of herself for happiness, but nevertheless <lb/>
            required the advantages of the body as instruments to work <lb/>
            with; such as health, strength, the integrity of the senses, and <lb/>
            things of that kind ; and also external advantages, such as <lb/>
            riches, and noble birth, and glory. Still that the wise man <lb/>
            would be not the less happy, even if destitute of these auxiliary <lb/>
            circumstances; for he would enjoy the constitution of his <lb/>
            country, and would marry, and would not transgress the es- <lb/>
            tablished laws, and that he would legislate for his country, as <lb/>
            well as he could under existing circumstances, unless he saw <lb/>
            affairs in an unmanageable condition, in consequence of the <lb/>
            excessive factiousness of the people. He thinks too that the <lb/>
            Gods superintend all the affairs of men, and that there are such <lb/>
            beings as daemons. And he was the first person who defined the <lb/>
            notion of the honourable, as that which borders on the praise- <lb/>
            worthy, and the logical, and the useful, and the becoming, and <lb/>
            the expedient, all which things are combined with that which <lb/>
            is suitable to, and in accordance with, nature.</p>
          <p>XLIII. He also discussed in his dialogues the correctness of <lb/>
            terms, so that he was the first person who reduced the science <lb/>
             <pb n="141"/>
            of giving correct answers, and putting correct questions to a <lb/>
            system, which he himself used to satiety.</p>
          <p>XLI V. In his dialogues he used to speak of justice as a kind <lb/>
            of law of God, as being of influence sufficient to excite men to <lb/>
            act justly, in order to avoid suffering punishment as malefac- <lb/>
            tors after death. Owing to which he appeared to some people <lb/>
            rather fond of mythical stories, as he mingled stories of this <lb/>
            kind with his writings, in order by the uncertainty of all the <lb/>
            circumstances that affect men after their death, to induce them <lb/>
            to abstain from evil actions. And these were his opinions.</p>
          <p>XLV. He used too, says Aristotle, to divide things in this <lb/>
            manner :-Of good, some have their place in the mind, some <lb/>
            in the body, and some are wholly external. As, for instance, <lb/>
            justice, and prudence, and manly courage, and temperance, <lb/>
            and qualities of that sort exist in the soul. Beauty, and a <lb/>
            good constitution, and health, and strength exist in the body. <lb/>
            But friends, and the prosperity of one's country, and wealth, <lb/>
            are external goods. There are then three species of goods, <lb/>
            some in the soul, some in the body, and some external <lb/>
            to either.</p>
          <p>XLVI. There are also three species of friendship. For one <lb/>
            kind is natural, another that which arises from companionship ; <lb/>
            and the third is that which is produced by ties of hospitality. <lb/>
            We call that natural friendship which parents feel towards <lb/>
            their offspring, and relations towards one another; and this <lb/>
            is partaken of by other animals besides men. We call that <lb/>
            the friendship of companionship which arises from a habit of <lb/>
            association, and which has no reference to ties of blood, such <lb/>
            as the friendship of Pylades for Orestes. That which arises <lb/>
            from ties of hospitality is one which owes its origin to agree <lb/>
            ments, and which is carried on by means of letters between <lb/>
            strangers. There is, therefore, natural friendship, and friend- <lb/>
            ship between companions, and between strangers. Some <lb/>
            also add a fourth kind, namely, the friendship of love.</p>
          <p>XLVII. Of political constitutions there are five species. <lb/>
            There is one kind which is democratical, a second which is <lb/>
            aristocratical, a third is oligarchical, a fourth monarchical, and <lb/>
            the fifth is tyrannical. Now, the democratical form of con- <lb/>
            stitution exists in those cities in which the multitude has the <lb/>
            chief power, and elects magistrates, and passes laws at its own <lb/>
            pleasure. But an aristocracy is that form in which neither <lb/>
             <pb n="142"/>
            the rich, nor the poor, nor the most illustrious men of the city <lb/>
            rule, but the most nobly born have the chief sway. And <lb/>
            oligarchy is that constitution in which the magistracies are <lb/>
            distributed according to some sort of rating : for the rich are <lb/>
            fewer in number than the poor. The monarchical constitution <lb/>
            is either dependent on law or on family. That in Carthage <lb/>
            depends on law; that in Lacædemon and Macedonia on <lb/>
            family ; for they select their sovereign out of some particular <lb/>
            family. But a tyranny is that kind of government in which <lb/>
            the people are either cajoled or constrained into being governed <lb/>
            by a single individual. Forms of government then, are <lb/>
            divided into democracy, aristocracy, oligarchy, monarchy, and <lb/>
            tyranny.</p>
          <p>XLVIII. Again, of justice there are three species. For <lb/>
            there is one kind which is conversant with the gods ; a second <lb/>
            which has reference to men ; and a third, which concerns the <lb/>
            dead. For they who sacrifice according to the laws, and who <lb/>
            pay due respect to the temples, are manifestly pious to the <lb/>
            gods. And those who repay what has been lent to them, and <lb/>
            restore what has been deposited with them, act justly as to <lb/>
            men. And those who pay due respect to the tombs, clearly <lb/>
            are pious towards the dead. There is, therefore, one justice <lb/>
            towards the Gods, a second towards men, and a third towards <lb/>
            the dead.</p>
          <p>XLIX. In the same way. there are also three species of <lb/>
            knowledge. There is one kind which is practical, a second <lb/>
            which is productive, a third which is theoretical. For the <lb/>
            science of building houses or ships, is production, For one <lb/>
            can see the work which is produced by it. Political science, <lb/>
            and the science of playing the flute, or the harp, or such <lb/>
            things as that, is practical; for one cannot see any visible re- <lb/>
            sult which has been produced by them, and yet they are doing <lb/>
            something. For one man plays the flute or plays the harp, <lb/>
            and another occupies himself with state affairs. Again, geo- <lb/>
            metrical, and harmonic, and astronomical science are all <lb/>
            theoretical, for they do nothing, and produce nothing. But <lb/>
            the geometrician theorizes as to what relation lines bear to <lb/>
            one another ; and the harmonist speculates about sounds, and <lb/>
            the astronomer about stars and about the world. Accordingly, <lb/>
            of sciences some are theoretical, others productive, and a third <lb/>
            species is practical..</p><pb n="143"/>
            
          <p><unclear>L</unclear>. Of medical science there are five species : one, pharma- <lb/>
            ceutical ; a second, manual; a third, conversant about the <lb/>
            regulation of the manner of life, and the diet; a fourth, the <lb/>
            business of which is to detect diseases; and the fifth is re- <lb/>
            medial. The pharmaceutical relieves infirmities by means of <lb/>
            medicines ; the manual heals men by cutting and cauterizing; <lb/>
            the one which attends to the diet, gets rid of diseases by <lb/>
            altering and regulating the diet; the fourth produces its effects <lb/>
            by a thorough comprehension of the nature of the disease; and <lb/>
            the last relieves men from suffering by bringing prompt as- <lb/>
            sistance at the moment. Medical science, then, is divided <lb/>
            into the pharmaceutical, the manual, the dietetic, the diagnos- <lb/>
            tic, and the remedial.</p>
          <p>LI. Of law there are two divisions. For there is a written <lb/>
            and an unwritten law. The one by which we regulate our <lb/>
            'constitutions in our cities, is the written law; that which <lb/>
            arises from custom, is the unwritten law. As, for instance, <lb/>
            for a man to come naked into the market place, or to wear <lb/>
            woman's clothes, are actions which are not prohibited by any <lb/>
            law, and yet we never do them because they are forbidden by <lb/>
            the unwritten law. Law, therefore, is divided into the written <lb/>
            and the unwritten law.</p>
          <p>LII. Discourse is divided into five heads; one of which <lb/>
            heads is that which statesmen employ when they speak in the <lb/>
            public assemblies; and this is called political. Another <lb/>
            division is that which orators use in their written harangues, <lb/>
            and bring forward for the sake of display in panegyrics or <lb/>
            reproaches, or impeachments. And such a description of <lb/>
            discourse as this is the rhetorical. A third class is that which <lb/>
            private individuals use when conversing with one another. <lb/>
            This is called private discourse. Another kind is that which <lb/>
            is employed when men converse by means of putting short <lb/>
            questions and giving brief answers to those who question <lb/>
            them. This is called the dialectic kind of discourse. The <lb/>
            fifth division is that which artists adopt when conversing on <lb/>
            their own particular art, and this is called professional dis- <lb/>
            course. Thus discourse, then, is divided into political, <lb/>
            rhetorical, private, dialectic, and professional.</p>
          <p>LIII. Music again is divided into three species. For <lb/>
            there is the music of the mouth alone, such as song; se- <lb/>
            condly, there is the music which is performed by the hands and <lb/>
             <pb n="144"/>
            mouth together, such as singing to the harp; thirdly, there <lb/>
            is that which is executed by the hands alone, such as harp <lb/>
            playing. Music, therefore, is divided into music of the <lb/>
            mouth, music of the mouth and hands, and music of the <lb/>
            hands.</p>
          <p>LIV. Nobleness of birth is divided into four species ; the <lb/>
            first is when one's ancestors are noble, and valiant, and just; <lb/>
            in which case they say that their posterity are nobly born. <lb/>
            The second kind is when one's ancestors have been princes <lb/>
            and rulers of nations, and their posterity also we call noble. <lb/>
            Another kind is when one's ancestors have been distinguished <lb/>
            for personal renown, such, for instance, as is gained by <lb/>
            generalship or by victory at the games. For their offspring <lb/>
            also we address as nobly born. And the last kind is when <lb/>
            a man is himself noble in his spirit, and magnanimous. For <lb/>
            that man also we call noble, and this is the last kind of <lb/>
            nobility. There is, therefore, nobility arising from virtuous <lb/>
            ancestors, from royal ancestors, from illustrious ancestors, and <lb/>
            from one's own excellent qualities.</p>
          <p>LV. Beauty also is divided into three kinds. For there is <lb/>
            one kind which is praiseworthy, as that of a beautiful face. <lb/>
            Another which is useful, as an instrument or a house, and <lb/>
            things of that kind which are beautiful, with reference to our <lb/>
            use of them. There is also a beauty with reference to laws, <lb/>
            and habits, and things of that kind, which is likewise beautiful, <lb/>
            because of its utility. So that beauty again is looked at in <lb/>
            three ways, with reference to its praise, its utility, and to our <lb/>
            use of it.</p>
          <p>LVI. The soul is divided into three parts; for one part of <lb/>
            it is capable of reason, another is influenced by appetite, the <lb/>
            third part is liable to passion. Of these the reasoning part <lb/>
            is the cause of deliberating, and reasoning, and understanding, <lb/>
            and everything of that kind. The appetite part is that portion <lb/>
            of the soul which is the cause of desiring to eat, and to em- <lb/>
            brace, and things of that kind. The passionate part is the <lb/>
            cause of men feeling confidence and delight, and grief and <lb/>
            anger. The soul therefore is divided into the reasoning part, <lb/>
            the appetitive part, and the passionate part.</p>
          <p>LVII. Of perfect virtue there are four species. One is <lb/>
            prudence, one is justice, the third is manly gallantry, and the <lb/>
            fourth is temperance. Of these, prudence is the cause of a <lb/>
             <pb n="145"/>
            man acting rightly in affairs; justice is the cause of his <lb/>
            acting justly in partnerships and bargains ; manly gallantry is <lb/>
            the cause of a man's not being alarmed amid dangers and for- <lb/>
            midable circumstances, but standing firm ; and temperance is <lb/>
            the cause of his subduing his appetites, and being enslaved by <lb/>
            no pleasure, but living decorously. So that virtue is divided <lb/>
            into prudence, justice, manly gallantry, and temperance.</p>
          <p>LVIII. Rule is divided into five parts. One is rule ac- <lb/>
            cording to law; another is rule according to nature; a third <lb/>
            kind is rule according to custom; a fourth division is rule <lb/>
            with reference to family; the fifth is rule by force. Now <lb/>
            when the rulers in cities are elected by the citizens, then they <lb/>
            rule according to law; those who rule according to nature are <lb/>
            the males, not only among men, but also among all other <lb/>
            animals; for everywhere we shall find it as a general rule that <lb/>
            the male rules the female; the rule of him who rules according <lb/>
            to custom is such as this, when schoolmasters rule their pupils, <lb/>
            and teachers their disciples. Rule according to family is that <lb/>
            which prevails in places like Lacedæmon, where hereditary <lb/>
            sovereigns reign. For the kingdom there belongs to a certain <lb/>
            family; and in Macedonia they rule on the same principle. <lb/>
            For there, too, the kingdom depends on family. But those <lb/>
            who rule by force, only cajoling the citizens, rule in spite of <lb/>
            ;hem; and such a sway is called rule by force. So that there <lb/>
            s rule by law, and by nature, and by custom, and by family, <lb/>
            and by force.</p>
          <p>LIX. Of rhetoric he speaks of six species. For when <lb/>
            )rators exhort the people to make war upon or to form alliances <lb/>
            against any one, this species of oratory is called exhortation. <lb/>
            When they persuade the people not to make war, or to form <lb/>
            fiances, but to keep quiet, this kind of rhetoric is called <lb/>
            lissuasion. The third species of rhetoric, is when any one <lb/>
            ays that he has been injured by some one else, and impeaches <lb/>
            hat person as guilty of many crimes ; for this species is <lb/>
            ailed accusation. The fourth kind of rhetoric is called <lb/>
            defence, when a man shows that he has done no wrong, and <lb/>
            hat he is not guilty of anything out of the way. Such a kind of <lb/>
            peech they call a defence. The fifth species of rhetoric, is <lb/>
            when any one speaks well of another, and shows him to be <lb/>
            irtuous and honourable; and this kind is called encomium. <lb/>
            'he sixth species, is when any one shows that another person <note type="footnote"> L </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="146"/>
            is worthless ; and this kind is called blame. So that rhetoric <lb/>
            is divided into encomium and blame, exhortation and dis- <lb/>
            suasion, accusation and defence.</p>
          <p>Speaking correctly is divided under four" heads. One, the <lb/>
            saying what is right; one, the saying as much as is right; <lb/>
            thirdly, the saying it to the proper people; and fourthly, the <lb/>
            saying it at the proper time. Now as to the saying what is <lb/>
            right, that is the saying what will be advantageous both to the <lb/>
            speaker and to the hearer. The saying as much as is right, <lb/>
            is saying neither more nor less than what is sufficient. The <lb/>
            saying it to the proper people, is supposing one is speaking tc <lb/>
            one's elders who are mistaken in any point, the using expres- <lb/>
            sions proper to be addressed to those older than one's self; or <lb/>
            on the other hand, if one is addressing those younger, then the <lb/>
            using language such as is suitable to young people. ThE <lb/>
            saying it at the proper time, is speaking neither too soon no: <lb/>
            too late; for if one does, one will err and speak improperly.</p>
          <p>LX. Beneficence is divided under four heads. For it may <lb/>
            be exerted either in money, or by personal exertion, or b; <lb/>
            knowledge, or by words. In money when any one assist <lb/>
            those who are in want, so as to put them at ease with respec <lb/>
            to money. And men benefit one another by personal ex <lb/>
            ertion when they come upon those who are being beaten an&lt; <lb/>
            assist them. Again, those who instruct, or heal, or who teacl <lb/>
            any good thing, benefit others by their knowledge ; and whei <lb/>
            one person comes down to the court of justice as an advocat <lb/>
            for another, and delivers some speech full of sense and goos <lb/>
            feeling in his behalf, that man assists his friend by words <lb/>
            So that there is one beneficence which is displayed in money <lb/>
            another in personal exertion, a third by means of knowledge <lb/>
            and the fourth kind by words.</p>
          <p>LXI. Again, Plato divides the end of all affairs into fou <lb/>
            species. An affair has one end in accordance with law, whe <lb/>
            a decree is passed, and when the law establishes it: it ha <lb/>
            an end in accordance with nature, when it is such a thing as <lb/>
            day, or a year, or the seasons. It has an end according to ar <lb/>
            when it is architecture for instance, for a man builds a house <lb/>
            or when it is ship-building, for it makes a ship. And affair <lb/>
            also come to an end by chance, when they turn out differentl <lb/>
            from what any one expected. So that an end of an affair i <lb/>
            regulated either by law, or by nature, or by art, or by chance</p><pb n="147"/>
            
          <p>LXII. Power again is divided into four species. There is <lb/>
            one power which we possess by our ability to reason and form <lb/>
            conceptions by means of our intellect. There is another <lb/>
            power which we owe to the body, such as the power of walking, <lb/>
            or giving, or taking, and such like. There is a third which <lb/>
            we possess through the multitude of soldiers or riches, on <lb/>
            which account a king is said to have great power. And the <lb/>
            fourth division of power consists in the being well or ill treated, <lb/>
            and treating others well or ill; as, for instance, we may be <lb/>
            sick, or we may be taught, or we may be in vigorous health, <lb/>
            and many more cases of that sort. So that one kind of power <lb/>
            dwells in the intellect, another in the body, another in an <lb/>
            army and riches, and another in our capacity as agents or <lb/>
            patients.</p>
          <p>LXIII. Of philanthropy there are three sorts. One which <lb/>
            is displayed in addressing people, when some persons address <lb/>
            every one whom they meet, and give them their right hand, and <lb/>
            greet them heartily; another species is when one is disposed <lb/>
            to assist every one who is unfortunate. The last kind is that <lb/>
            sort of philanthropy which makes men pleasant boon com- <lb/>
            panions. So that there is one kind of philanthropy dis- <lb/>
            played in addressing people, another in benefiting them, and <lb/>
            a third in feasting and making merry with them.</p>
          <p>LXIV. Happiness is divided into five parts. For one part <lb/>
            of it is wisdom in counsel; another is a healthy condition of <lb/>
            the sensations and general health of body; a third is good <lb/>
            fortune in one's affairs; a fourth kind is good reputation <lb/>
            among men ; a fifth is abundance of riches and of all those <lb/>
            things which are useful in life. Now wisdom in counsel arises <lb/>
            from good instruction, and from a person's having experience <lb/>
            of many things. A healthy condition of the sensations de- <lb/>
            pends on the limbs of the body ; as, for instance, when one <lb/>
            sees with one's eyes, and hears with one's ears, and smells <lb/>
            with one's nose, and feels with one's body, just what one ought <lb/>
            to see, and hear, and smell, and feel. Such a condition as <lb/>
            this is a healthy condition. And good fortune is when a man <lb/>
            does rightly and successfully what a good and energetic man <lb/>
            ought to do. And good reputation is when a man is well <lb/>
            spoken of. And abundance of riches is when a man has such <lb/>
            a sufficiency of everything which relates to the uses of life, <lb/>
            that he is able to benefit his friends, and to discharge all <note type="footnote"> L 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="148"/>
            public obligations in a splendid and liberal manner. And the <lb/>
            man who has all these different parts of happiness, is a per- <lb/>
            fectly happy man. So that happiness is made up of wisdom <lb/>
            in counsel, a good condition of the sensations and health of <lb/>
            body, good fortune, good reputation, and riches.</p>
          <p>LXV. The arts are divided into three kinds. The first, <lb/>
            the second, and the third. The first are those of working <lb/>
            mines and cutting wood, for these are preparatory arts. The <lb/>
            second are such as working metals and carpentry, for they are <lb/>
            alterative arts. For working in metals makes arms out of <lb/>
            iron; and carpentry makes flutes and lyres out of wood. The <lb/>
            third is the art which makes use of instruments; such as <lb/>
            horsemanship, which uses bridles; the military art, which uses <lb/>
            arms ; music, which uses flutes and lyres. So that there are <lb/>
            three species of art; one of which is the first, another the <lb/>
            second, and another the third.</p>
          <p>LXVI. Good is divided into four kinds. One of which we <lb/>
            mean when we speak of a man endowed with private virtue, <lb/>
            as good; another kind is that which we indicate, when we <lb/>
            call virtue and justice, good. A third kind is that which we <lb/>
            attribute to suitable food, and exercise, and medicine. The <lb/>
            fourth good, is that which we mean, when we speak of good <lb/>
            flute playing, good acting, and things of that sort. There are <lb/>
            therefore four kinds of good. One the having virtue; another, <lb/>
            virtue itself; a third, useful food and exercise ; and fourthly, <lb/>
            we call skill in flute playing and acting, good.</p>
          <p>LXVII. Of things existing, some are bad, some good, <lb/>
            and some neither one thing nor the other. Of these, we <lb/>
            call those things bad, which are invariably capable of doing <lb/>
            injury, such as intemperance, folly, injustice, and things of <lb/>
            that sort. And the opposites to these qualities are good. <lb/>
            But those things, which may at times be beneficial, and at <lb/>
            times injurious, such as walking, sitting down, and eating; or <lb/>
            which have absolutely no power in any case to benefit or <lb/>
            injure any one ; these are neither bad nor good. Of things <lb/>
            existing then, there are some bad, and some good, and some <lb/>
            of a neutral character, neither bad nor good. i</p>
          <p>LXVIII. A good state of affairs with reference to the laws, <lb/>
            is divided under three heads. One when the laws are good, for <lb/>
            that is a good state of affairs; so too is it, when the citizens <lb/>
            abide by the existing laws ; and the third case is, when al- <lb/>
             <pb n="149"/>
            though there are no positive laws, still men are good citizens <lb/>
            in deference to custom and to established institutions; and <lb/>
            this is also called a good state of affairs. So that of these <lb/>
            three heads, one depends on the laws being good, another on <lb/>
            obedience to existing laws, and the third on men yielding to <lb/>
            good customs and institutions.</p>
          <p>So again, lawlessness is divided into three heads. One of <lb/>
            which is, when the laws are bad, both as concerns strangers, <lb/>
            and the citizens; another, when the citizens do not obey the <lb/>
            laws that are established; and the third is when there is <lb/>
            actually no law at all. So that one kind of lawlessness arises <lb/>
            from bad laws, another from disobedience to existing laws, <lb/>
            and the third from the absence of laws.</p>
          <p>LXIX. Contraries are of three sorts; for instance, we say <lb/>
            that good is contrary to evil, as justice to injustice, wisdom to <lb/>
            folly, and so on. Again, some evils are contrary to others, as <lb/>
            extravagance is to stinginess, and the being tortured with <lb/>
            justice to the being tortured with injustice. And such evils <lb/>
            as these are the contraries of other evils. Again, the heavy <lb/>
            is contrary to the light, the swift to the slow, the black to the <lb/>
            white ; so that some things which are of a neutral character, <lb/>
            neither good nor evil, are contrary to other things of a neu- <lb/>
            tral character. Of contraries then, there are some which are <lb/>
            so, as what is good is contrary to what is evil; others, as one <lb/>
            evil is contrary to another; and others again, as neutral things <lb/>
            are contrary to other things of a neutral character.</p>
          <p>LXX. Of good things there are three kinds; for there are <lb/>
            some which can be possessed; others, which can be shared; <lb/>
            others, which one realizes in one's self. Those which can be <lb/>
            possessed, are those which it is possible for a person to have, <lb/>
            such as justice, or good health ; those can be shared, which it <lb/>
            is not possible for a person to have entirely to himself, but <lb/>
            which he may participate in ; as for instance, a person cannot <lb/>
            be the sole possessor of abstract good, but he may participate <lb/>
            in it. Those again a person realizes in himself, when they <lb/>
            are such, that he cannot possess them himself, or share them <lb/>
            with others, and yet they ought to exist; as for instance, it <lb/>
            is good to be virtuous and just, but yet a man does not pos- <lb/>
            sess the being virtuous, or participate in it; but the being <lb/>
            virtuous and just ought to exist in him. Of good things. <lb/>
            therefore, there are those which are possessed, those which are <lb/>
            shared, and those which ought to exist in a man.</p><pb n="150"/>
            
          <p>LXXI. In the same manner, good counsel is divisible into <lb/>
            three kinds. For there is one kind which is derived from <lb/>
            past time, another from the future, another from the present. <lb/>
            That which is derived from past time is made up of instances, <lb/>
            as for instance what the Lacedaemonians suffered by trusting to <lb/>
            such and such people. That which relates to the present, is when <lb/>
            what is wanted, is to show that the fortifications are weak, the <lb/>
            men cowardly, or the provisions scanty. That which concerns <lb/>
            the future, is when the speaker urges that no injury ought to <lb/>
            be offered to ambassadors, in order that Greece may not get an <lb/>
            evil reputation; and supports his argument by instances. So <lb/>
            that good counsel has reference, firstly to what is past, secondly <lb/>
            to what is present, and thirdly to the future.</p>
          <p>LXXII. Voice is divided into two parts, one of which is <lb/>
            animated, and the other inanimate. That is animated, which <lb/>
            proceeds from living animals, while sounds and echoes are <lb/>
            inanimate. Again, animated voice may be divided into that <lb/>
            which can be indicated by letters, and that which cannot; <lb/>
            that which can be so indicated being the voice of men, and <lb/>
            that which cannot being the voice of animals; so that one <lb/>
            kind of voice is animated, the other inanimate.</p>
          <p>LXXIII. Of existing things, some are divisible and some <lb/>
            indivisible. Again, those which are divisible, consist either <lb/>
            of similar or of dissimilar parts. Those which are indivisible <lb/>
            are such as have no separate parts, and are not formed by any <lb/>
            combination, such as unity, a point, or a sound. But those are <lb/>
            divisible which are formed by some combination; as, for <lb/>
            instance, syllables, and symphonies, and animals, and water, <lb/>
            and gold. These too consist of similar parts, which are <lb/>
            made up of particles resembling one another, and of which <lb/>
            the whole does not differ from any part, except in number. <lb/>
            As for instance, water and gold, and everything which is <lb/>
            fusible, and so on. And these consist of dissimilar parts, <lb/>
            which are made up of various things not resembling one <lb/>
            another; as for instance, a house, and things of that sort; so <lb/>
            that of existing things, some are divisible and others indi- <lb/>
            visible. And of those which are divisible, some consist of <lb/>
            similar and others of dissimilar parts.</p>
          <p>LXXIV. Again, of existing things, some are spoken of as <lb/>
            having an independent, and some only a relative existence. <lb/>
            Those which are spoken of as having an independent exist- <lb/>
             <pb n="151"/>
            ence, are those which require nothing else to be added to <lb/>
            them, when we are explaining their nature ; as man, a horse, <lb/>
            and the other animals; for these have no need of any <lb/>
            additional explanation. But those things are said to have a <lb/>
            relative existence which do require some additional explana- <lb/>
            tion. As for instance, that which is greater than something <lb/>
            else, or less, or swifter, or more beautiful, and so on. For <lb/>
            that which is greater, is greater than something which is less; <lb/>
            and that which is swifter, is swifter than something else. So <lb/>
            that, of existing things, some are spoken of as independently, <lb/>
            and others relatively. And thus he divided them at first, <lb/>
            according to Aristotle.</p>
          <p>LXXV. There was also another man of the name of Plato, <lb/>
            a philosopher of Rhodes, a disciple of Panætius, as Seleucus, the <lb/>
            grammarian says in the first book of his treatise on Philo- <lb/>
            sophy ; and another was a Peripatetic, a pupil of Aristotle; <lb/>
            and there was a third, a pupil of Praxiphanes ; and there was <lb/>
            besides all these, the poet of the Old Comedy.</p><pb n="152"/>

          </ab>
          <p>I. THE long account which I have given of Plato was <lb/>
            compiled to the best of my power, and in it I collected with <lb/>
            great zeal and industry all that was reported of the man.</p>
          <p>II. And he was succeeded by Speusippus, the son of <lb/>
            Eurymedon, and a citizen of Athens, of the Myrrhinusian <lb/>
            burgh, and he was the son of Plato's sister Potone.</p>
          <p>III. He presided over his school for eight years, beginning <lb/>
            to do so in the hundred and eighth olympiad. And he set <lb/>
            up images of the Graces in the temple of the Muses, which <lb/>
            had been built in the Academy by Plato.</p>
          <p>IV. And he always adhered to the doctrines which had <lb/>
            been adopted by Plato, though he was not of the same dis- <lb/>
            position as he. For he was a passionate man, and a slave to <lb/>
            pleasure. Accordingly, they say that he once in a rage threw <lb/>
            a puppy into a well; and that for the sake of amusement, he <lb/>
            went all the way to Macedonia to the marriage of Cassander.</p>
          <p>V. The female pupils of Plato, Lasthenea of Mantinea, <lb/>
            and Axiothea of Phlius, are said to have become disciples of <lb/>
            Speusippus also. And Dionysius, writing to him in a petulant <lb/>
            manner, says, " And one may learn philosophy too from your <lb/>
            female disciple from Arcadia; moreover, Plato used to take <lb/>
            his pupils without exacting any fee from them ; but you collect <lb/>
            tribute from yours, whether willing or unwilling.”</p>
          <p>VI. He was the first man, as Diodorus relates in the first <lb/>
            book of his Commentaries, who investigated in his school <lb/>
            what was common to the several sciences; and who endeavoured, <lb/>
            as far as possible, to maintain their connection with each other. <lb/>
            He was also the first who published those things which <lb/>
            Isocrates called secrets, as Cæneus tells us. And the first too <lb/>
            who found out how to make light baskets of bundles of twigs.</p>
          <p>VII. But he became afflicted with paralysis, aud sent to <lb/>
             <pb n="153"/>
            Xenocrates inviting him to come to him, and to become his <lb/>
            successor in his school.</p>
          <p>VIII. And they say that once, when he was being borne <lb/>
            in a carriage into the Academy, he met Diogenes, and said, <lb/>
            " Hail;" and Diogenes replied, " I will not say hail to you, <lb/>
            who, though in such a state as you are, endure to live."</p>
          <p>IX. And at last in despair he put an end to his life, being <lb/>
            a man of a great age. And we have written this epigram on <lb/>
            him :— <lb/>
            Had I not known Speusippus thus had died, <lb/>
            No one would have persuaded me that he <lb/>
            Was e'er akin to Plato ; who would never <lb/>
            Have died desponding for so slight a grief.</p>
          <p>But Plutarch, in his Life of Lysander, and again in his <lb/>
            Life of Sylla, says that he was kept in a state of constant <lb/>
            inflammation by lice. For he was of a weak habit of body, as <lb/>
            Timotheus relates in his treatise on Lives.</p>
          <p>X. Speusippus said to a rich man who was in love with <lb/>
            an ugly woman, " What do you want with her? I will find you <lb/>
            a much prettier woman for ten talents."</p>
          <p>XI. He left behind him a great number of commentaries, <lb/>
            and many dialogues; among which was one on Aristippus; <lb/>
            one on Riches ; one on Pleasure; one on Justice ; one on <lb/>

            book of his Commentaries, Pharorinus states that Aristotle <lb/>

          <p>XII. There was also another person of the name of Speu- <lb/>
            sippus, a physician of the school of Herophilus,* a native of <lb/>
            Alexandria.</p>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF XENOCRATES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. XENOCRATES was the son of Agathenor, and a native of <lb/>
            Chalcedon. From his early youth he was a pupil of Plato, <lb/>
            and also accompanied him in his voyages to Sicily.</p>
          <p>II. He was by nature of a lazy disposition, so that they say <lb/>
            that Plato said once, when comparing him to Aristotle,- <lb/>
            " The one requires the spur, and the other the bridle." And <lb/>
            on another occasion, he said, " What a horse and what an ass <lb/>
            am I dressing opposite to one another! ”</p>
          <p>III. In other respects Xenocrates was always of a solemn <lb/>
            and grave character, so that Plato was continually saying to <lb/>
            him,—“ Xenocrates, sacrifice to the Graces." And he spent <lb/>
            the greater part of his time in the Academy, and whenever he <lb/>
            was about to go into the city, they say all the turbulent and <lb/>
            quarrelsome rabble in the city used to make way for him to <lb/>
            pass by. And once, Phryne the courtesan wished to try him <lb/>
            and pretending that she was pursued by some people, she <lb/>
            fled and took refuge in his house; and he admitted her indeed, <lb/>
            because of what was due to humanity ; and as there was but <lb/>
            one bed in the room, he, at her entreaty, allowed her to share <lb/>
            it with him; but at last, in spite of all her entreaties, she got up <lb/>
            and went away, without having been able to succeed in her <lb/>
            purpose ; and told those who asked her, that she had quitted <lb/>
            a statue and not a man. But some say that the real story is, <lb/>
            that his pupils put Lais into his bed, and that he was so con- <lb/>
            tinent, that he submitted to some severe operations of excision <lb/>
            and cautery. <note type="footnote"> * Herophilus was one of the most celebrated physicians of antiquity, <lb/>
            who founded the Medical School at Alexandria, in the time of the first <lb/>
            Ptolemy. </note></p><pb n="155"/>
            
          <p>IV. And he was a very trustworthy man ; so that, though <lb/>
            it was not lawful for men to give evidence except on oath, <lb/>
            the Athenians made an exception in his favour alone.</p>
          <p>V. He was also a man of the most contented disposition ; <lb/>
            accordingly they say that when Alexander sent him a large <lb/>
            sum of money, he took three thousand Attic drachmas, and <lb/>
            sent back the rest, saying, that Alexander wanted most, as he <lb/>
            had the greatest number of mouths to feed. And when some <lb/>
            was sent him by Antipater, he would not accept any of it, as <lb/>
            Myornianus tells us in his Similitudes. And once, when he <lb/>
            gained a golden crown, in a contest as to who could drink <lb/>
            most, which was offered in the yearly festival of the Choes <lb/>
            by Dionysius, he went out and placed the crown at the feet of <lb/>
            the statue of Mercury, which was at the gate, where he was <lb/>
            also accustomed to deposit his garlands of flowers. It is said <lb/>
            also, that he was once sent with some colleagues as an ambas- <lb/>
            sador to Philip; and that they were won over by gifts, and <lb/>
            went to his banquets and conversed with Philip ; but that he <lb/>
            would do none of these things, nor could Philip propitiate <lb/>
            him by these means ; on which account, when the other am- <lb/>
            bassadors arrived in Athens, they said that Xenocrates had <lb/>
            gone with them to no purpose ; and the people were ready to <lb/>
            punish him; but when they had learnt from him that they <lb/>
            had now more need than ever to look to the welfare of their <lb/>
            city, for that Philip had already bribed all their counsellors, <lb/>
            but that he had been unable to win him over by any means, then <lb/>
            they say that the people honoured him with redoubled honour. <lb/>
            They add also, that Philip said afterwards, that Xenocrates <lb/>
            was the only one of those who had come to him who was in- <lb/>
            corruptible. And when he went as ambassador to Antipater <lb/>
            on the subject of the Athenian captives at the time of the <lb/>
            Samian war, and was invited by him to a banquet, he addressed <lb/>
            him in the following lines :— <lb/>
            I answer, Goddess human, is thy breast <lb/>
            By justice sway'd, by tender pity prest ? <lb/>
            Ill fits it me, whose friends are sunk to beasts, <lb/>
            To quaff thy bowls, or riot in thy feasts : <lb/>
            Me would'st thou please, for them thy cares employ, <lb/>
            And them to me restore, and me to joy ?* <note type="footnote"> it Horn. Od. x. 387. Pope's Version, 450. </note></p><pb n="156"/>
            
          <p>And Antipater, admiring the appropriateness of the quotation, <lb/>
            immediately released them.</p>
          <p>VI. On one occasion, when a sparrow was pursued by a <lb/>
            hawk, and flew into his bosom, he caressed it, and let it go <lb/>
            again, saying that we ought not to betray a suppliant. And <lb/>
            being ridiculed by Bion, he said that he would not answer <lb/>
            him, for that tragedy, when ridiculed by comedy, did not con- <lb/>
            descend to make a reply. To one who had never learnt music, <lb/>
            or geometry, or astronomy, but who wished to become his dis- <lb/>
            ciple, he said, 11 Be gone, for you have not yet the handles of <lb/>
            philosophy." But some say that he said, " Be gone, for I do not <lb/>
            card wool here." And when Dionysius said to Plato that some <lb/>
            one would cut off his head, he, being present, showed his <lb/>
            own, and said, " Not before they have cut off mine."</p>
          <p>VII. They say too that once, when Antipater had come to <lb/>
            Athens and saluted him, he would not make him any reply <lb/>
            before he had finished quietly the discourse which he was <lb/>
            delivering.</p>
          <p>VIlI. Being exceedingly devoid of every kind of pride, he <lb/>
            often used to meditate with himself several times a day ; and <lb/>
            always allotted one hour of each day, it is said, to silence.</p>
          <p>IX. And he left behind him a great number of writings, <lb/>
            and books of recommendation, and verses, which are these,- <lb/>
            six books on Natural Philosophy; six on Wisdom; one on <lb/>
            Riches, the Arcadian; one volume on the Indefinite; one on <lb/>
            a Child ; one on Temperance ; one on the Useful; one on the <lb/>
            Free; one on Death; one on the Voluntary ; two on Friend- <lb/>
            ship ; one on Courtesy; two on Contraries; two on Happi- <lb/>
            ness; one on Writing; one on Memory ; one on Falsehood; <lb/>
            the Callicles one ; two on Prudence ; one on (Economy; one <lb/>
            on Temperance ; one on the Power of Law; one on Political <lb/>
            Constitutions ; one on Piety ; one to show that Virtue may be <lb/>
            transmitted; one about the Existent; one on Fate; one on <lb/>
            the' Passions; one on Lives; one on Unanimity; two on <lb/>
            Pupils; one on Justice; two on Virtue; one on Species; two <lb/>
            on Pleasure; one on Life; one on Manly Courage; one on <lb/>
            The One; one on Ideas; one on Art; two on the Gods; two on <lb/>
            the Soul; one on Knowledge ; one on the Statesman ; one on <lb/>
            Science; one on Philosophy; one on the School of Parme- <lb/>
            nides; one the Archidemus, or an essay on Justice ; one on <lb/>
            the Good ; eight of those things which concern the Intellect; <lb/>
             <pb n="157"/>
            ten essays in solution of the difficulties which occur respecting <lb/>
            Orations; six books on the study of Natural Philosophy ; the <lb/>
            Principal, one; one treatise on Genus and Species; one on <lb/>
            the doctrines of the Pythagoreans; two books of Solutions; <lb/>
            seven of Divisions; several volumes of Propositions ; several <lb/>
            also about the method of conducting Discussions. Besides all <lb/>
            this, there are one set of fifteen volumes, and another of sixteen, <lb/>
            on the subject of those studies which relate to Speaking; <lb/>
            nine more which treat of Ratiocination ; six books on Mathe- <lb/>
            matics ; two more books on subjects connected with the Intel- <lb/>
            lect ; five books on Geometry; one book of Reminiscences; <lb/>
            one of Contraries; one on Arithmetic; one on the Contem- <lb/>
            plation of Numbers; one on Intervals; six on Astronomy; <lb/>
            four of elementary suggestions to Alexander, on the subject of <lb/>
            Royal Power; one addressed to Arybas ; one addressed to <lb/>
            Hephsestion; two on Geometry; seven books of Verses.</p>
          <p>X. But the Athenians, though he was such a great man, <lb/>
            once sold him, because he was unable to pay the tax to which <lb/>
            the metics were liable. And Demetrius Phalereus purchased <lb/>
            him, and so assisted both parties, Xenocrates by giving him his <lb/>
            freedom, and the Athenians in respect of the tax upon <lb/>
            metics. This circumstance is mentioned by Myronianus of <lb/>
            Amastra, in the first book of his chapters of Historical <lb/>
            Coincidences.</p>
          <p>XI. He succeeded Spuesippus, and presided over the school <lb/>
            for twenty-five years, beginning at the archonship of Lysi- <lb/>
            machides, in the second year of the hundred and tenth olympiad.</p>
          <p>XII. And he died in consequence of stumbling by night <lb/>
            against a dish, being more than eighty-two years of age. <lb/>
            And in one of our epigrams we speak thus of him:- <lb/>
            He struck against a brazen pot, <lb/>
            And cut his forehead deep, <lb/>
            And crying cruel is my lot, <lb/>
            In death he fell asleep. <lb/>
            So thus Xenocrates did fall, <lb/>
            The universal friend of all.</p>
          <p>XIII. And there were five other people of the name of <lb/>
            Xenocrates. One was an ancient tactician, a fellow citizen, and <lb/>
            very near relation of the philosopher of whom we have been <lb/>
            speaking; and there is extant an oration of his which is <lb/>
            scribed, On Arsinoe, and which was written on the death of <lb/>
             <pb n="158"/>
            Arsinoe. A third was a philosopher who wrote some very in- <lb/>
            different elegiac poetry ; and that is not strange, for when <lb/>
            poets take to writing in prose, they succeed pretty well ; but <lb/>
            when prose writers try their hand at poetry, they fail; from <lb/>
            which it is plain, that the one is a gift of nature, and the other <lb/>
            a work of art. The fourth was a statuary ; the fifth a writer <lb/>
            of songs, as we are told by Aristoxenus.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF POLEMO.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. POLEMO was the son of Philostratus, an Athenian, of <lb/>
            the burgh of Æa. And when he was young, he was so very in- <lb/>
            temperate and profligate, that he used always to carry money <lb/>
            about with him, to procure the instant gratification of his <lb/>
            passions ; and he used also to hide money in the narrow alleys, <lb/>
            for this purpose. And once there was found in the Academy a <lb/>
            piece of three obols, hidden against one of the columns, which <lb/>
            he had put there for some purpose like that which I have indi- <lb/>
            cated ; and on one occasion he arranged beforehand with some <lb/>
            young men, and rushed, adorned with a garland, and drunk, <lb/>
            into the school of Xenocrates. But he took no notice of him, <lb/>
            and continued his discourse as he had begun it, and it was in <lb/>
            praise of temperance; and the young man, hearing it, was <lb/>
            gradually charmed, and became so industrious, that he sur- <lb/>
            passed all the rest of the disciples, and himself became the <lb/>
            successor of Xenocrates, in his school beginning in the hundred <lb/>
            and sixteenth olympiad.</p>
          <p>II. And Antigonus, of Carystus, says in his Lives, that his <lb/>
            father had been the chief man of the city, and had kept chariots <lb/>
            for the Olympic games.</p>
          <p>III. He also asserts that Polemo was prosecuted by his <lb/>
            wife, on the charge of ill-treatment, because he indulged in <lb/>
            illicit pleasures, and despised her.</p>
          <p>IV. But that when he began to devote himself to philo- <lb/>
            sophy, he adopted such a rigorous system of morals, that he for <lb/>
            the future always continued the same in appearance, and never <lb/>
            even changed his voice, on which account Crantor was charmed <lb/>
            by him. Accordingly, on one occasion, when a dog was mad <lb/>
            and had bitten his leg, he was the only person who did not turn <lb/>
             <pb n="159"/>
            pale; and once, when there was a great confusion in the city, <lb/>
            he, having heard the cause, remained where he was without <lb/>
            fleeing. In the theatres too he was quite immoveable ; accord- <lb/>
            ingly, when Nicostratus the poet, who was surnamed Clytæm- <lb/>
            nestra, was once reading something to him and Crates, the <lb/>
            latter was excited to sympathy, he behaved as though he <lb/>
            heard nothing. And altogether, he was such as Melanthius, <lb/>
            the painter, describes in his treatise on Painting ; for he says <lb/>
            that some kind of obstinacy and harshness ought to exist in <lb/>
            works of art as in morals.</p>
          <p>And Polemo used to say that a man ought to exercise him- <lb/>
            self in action, and not in dialectic speculations, as if one had <lb/>
            drunk in and dwelt upon a harmonious kind of system of art, <lb/>
            so as to be admired for one's shrewdness, in putting questions; <lb/>
            but to be inconsistent with one's self in character. He was, then, <lb/>
            a well-bred and high-spirited man, avoiding what Aristophanes <lb/>
            says of Euripides, speeches of vinegar and assafœtida, such as <lb/>
            he says himself:- <lb/>
            Are base delights compared with better things ?</p>
          <p>V. And he did not use to lecture on the propositions before <lb/>
            him while sitting down; but he would walk about, it is said, <lb/>
            and so discuss them. And he was much honoured in the city <lb/>
            because of his noble sentiments; and after he had been walking <lb/>
            about, he would rest in his garden; and his pupils erected little <lb/>
            cabins near it, and dwelt near his school and corridor.</p>
          <p>VI. And as it seems, Polemo imitated Xenocrates in every- <lb/>
            thing ; and Aristippus, in the fourth book of his treatise on <lb/>
            Ancient Luxury, says that Xenocrates loved him; at all events, <lb/>
            Polemo used to be always speaking of him, and praising his <lb/>
            guileless nature, and his rigorous virtues, and his chaste <lb/>
            severity, like that of a Doric building.</p>
          <p>VII. He wasalso very fond of Sophocles, and especially of <lb/>
            those passages where, according to one of the comic poets, he <lb/>
            seemed to have had a Molossian hound for his colleague in <lb/>
            composing his poems; and when there was, to use the expression <lb/>
            of Phrynichus:— <lb/>
            No sweet or washy liquor, but purest Pramnian wine.</p>
          <p>And he used to say that Homer was an epic Sophocles, and <lb/>
            Sophocles a tragic Homer.</p>
          <p>VIII. And he died when he was very old, of decline, having <lb/>
             <pb n="160"/>
            left behind him a great number of writings. And there is this <lb/>
            epigram of ours upon him:— <lb/>
            Do you not hear, we've buried Polemo, <lb/>
            Whom sickness, worst affliction of mankind <lb/>
            Attacked, and bore off to the shades below; <lb/>
            Yet Polemo lies not here, but Polemo's body, <lb/>
            And that he did himself place here on earth, <lb/>
            Prepared in soul to mount up to the skies.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF CRATES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. CRATES was the son of Antigenes, and of the Thriasian <lb/>
            burgh, and a pupil and attached friend of Polemo. He was <lb/>
            also his successor as president of his school.</p>
          <p>II. And they benefited one another so much, that not only <lb/>
            did they delight while alive in the same pursuits, but almost <lb/>
            to their latest breath did they resemble one another, and even <lb/>
            after they were both dead they shared the same tomb. In <lb/>
            reference to which circumstance Antagoras has written an <lb/>
            epigram on the pair, in which he expresses himself thus :— <lb/>
            Stranger, who passest by, relate that here <lb/>
            The God-like Crates lies, and Polemo; <lb/>
            Two men of kindred nobleness of mind ; <lb/>
            Out of whose holy mouths pure wisdom flowed, <lb/>
            And they with upright lives did well display, <lb/>
            The strength of all their principles and teaching.</p>
          <p>And they say too that it was in reference to this that Arcesi- <lb/>
            laus, when he came over to them from Theophrastus, said that <lb/>
            they were some gods, or else a remnant of the golden race ; <lb/>
            for they were not very fond of courting the people, but had <lb/>
            a disposition in accordance with the saying of Dionysodorus <lb/>
            the flute player, who is reported to have said, with great exulta- <lb/>
            tion and pride, that no one had ever heard his music in a <lb/>
            trireme or at a fountain as they had heard Ismenius.</p>
          <p>III. Antigonus relates that he used to be a messmate of <lb/>
            Crantor, and that these philosophers and Arcesilaus lived to- <lb/>
            gether ; and that Arcesilaus lived in Crantor's house, but that <lb/>
            Polemo and Crates lived in the house of one of the citizens, <lb/>
             <pb n="161"/>
            named Lysicles; and he says that Crates was, as I have already <lb/>
            mentioned, greatly attached to Polemo, and so was Arcesilaus <lb/>
            to Crantor.</p>
          <p>IV. But when Crates died, as Apollodorus relates in the <lb/>
            third book of his Chronicles, he left behind him compositions, <lb/>
            some on philosophical subjects and some on comedy, and some <lb/>
            which were speeches addressed to assemblies of the people, or <lb/>
            delivered on the occasion of embassies.</p>
          <p>V. He also left behind him some eminent disciples, among <lb/>
            whom were Arcesilaus, about whom we shall speak presently, <lb/>
            for he too was a pupil of his, and Bion of the Borysthenes, <lb/>
            who was afterwards called a Theodorean. from the sect which <lb/>
            he espoused, and we shall speak of him immediately after <lb/>
            Arcesilaus.</p>
          <p>VI. But there were ten people of the name of Crates. The <lb/>
            first was a poet of the old comedy; the second was an orator <lb/>
            of Tralles, a pupil of Isocrates ; the third was an engineer who <lb/>
            served under Alexander; the fourth a Cynic, whom we shall <lb/>
            mention hereafter; the fifth a Peripatetic philosopher; the <lb/>
            sixth the Academic philosopher, of whom we are speaking; the <lb/>
            seventh a grammarian of Males ; the eighth a writer in geo- <lb/>
            metry ; the ninth an epigrammatic poet; the tenth was an <lb/>
            Academic philosopher, a native of Tarsus.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF CRANTOR.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. CRANTOR, a native of Soli, being admired very greatly in <lb/>
            his own country, came to Athens and became a pupil of Xeno- <lb/>
            crates at the same time with Polemo.</p>
          <p>II. And he left behind him memorials, in the shape of <lb/>
            writings, to the number of 30,000 lines, some of which, how- <lb/>
            ever, are by some writers attributed to Arcesilaus.</p>
          <p>III. They say of him that when he was asked what it was <lb/>
            that he was so charmed with in Polemo, he replied, " That he <lb/>
            had never heard him speak in too high or too low a key."</p>
          <p>IV. When he was ill he retired to the temple of Æscula- <lb/>
            pius, and there walked about, and people came to him from all <lb/>
            quarters, thinkng that he had gone thither, not on account of <note type="footnote"> M </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="162"/>
            any disease, but because he wished to establish a school <lb/>
            there.</p>
          <p>V. And among those who came to him was Arcesilaus, wish- <lb/>
            ing to be recommended by him to Polemo, although he was <lb/>
            much attached to him, as we shall mention in the life of Arce- <lb/>
            silaus. But when he got well he became a pupil of Polemo, <lb/>
            and was excessively admired on that account. It is said, also, <lb/>
            that he left his property to Arcesilaus, to the amount of twelve <lb/>
            talents ; and that, being asked by him where he would like to <lb/>
            be buried, he said :— <lb/>
            It is a happy fate to lie entombed <lb/>
            In the recesses of a well-Iov'd land.</p>
          <p>VI. It is said also that he wrote poems, and that he sealed <lb/>
            them up in the temple of Minerva, in his own country; and <lb/>
            Meætetus the poet wrote thus about him:— <lb/>
            Crantor pleased men ; but greater pleasure still <lb/>
            He to the Muses gave, ere he aged grew. <lb/>
            Earth, tenderly embrace the holy man, <lb/>
            And let him lie in quiet undisturb'd.</p>
          <p>And of all writers, Crantor admired Homer and Euripides <lb/>
            most; saying that the hardest thing possible was to write tra- <lb/>
            gically and in a manner to excite sympathy, without departing <lb/>
            from nature ; and he used to quote this line out of the Belle- <lb/>
            rophon :— <lb/>
            Alas ! why should I say alas ! for we <lb/>
            Have only borne the usual fate of man.</p>
          <p>The following verses of Antagoras the poet are also attri- <lb/>
            buted to Crantor; the subject is love, and they run thus :— <lb/>
            My mind is much perplexed ; for what, 0 Love, <lb/>
            Dare I pronounce your origin ? May I <lb/>
            Call you chiefest of the immortal Gods, <lb/>
            Of all the children whom dark Erebus <lb/>
            And Royal Night bore on the billowy waves <lb/>
            Of widest Ocean ? Or shall I bid you hail, <lb/>
            As son of proudest Venus ? or of Earth ? <lb/>
            Or of the untamed winds ? so fierce you rove, <lb/>
            Bringing mankind sad cares, yet not unmixed <lb/>
            With happy good, so two-fold is your nature.</p>
          <p>And he was very ingenious at devising new words and ex- <lb/>
            pressions ; accordingly, he said that one tragedian had an un- <lb/>
            hewn (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπελέϰητος</foreign>) voice, all over bark; and he said that the <lb/>
             <pb n="163"/>
            verses of a certain poet were full of moths; and that the pro- <lb/>
            positions of Theophrastus had been written on an oyster shell. <lb/>
            But the work of his which is most admired is his book on <lb/>
            Mourning.</p>
          <p>VII. And he died before Polemo and Crates, having been <lb/>
            attacked by the dropsy; and we have written this epigram on <lb/>
            him :— <lb/>
            The worst of sicknesses has overwhelmed you, <lb/>
            O Crantor, and you thus did quit the earth, <lb/>
            Descending to the dark abyss of Hell. <lb/>
            Now you are happy there ; but all the while <lb/>
            The sad Academy, and your native land <lb/>
            Of Soli mourn, bereaved of your eloquence.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF ARCESILAUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. ARCESILAUS was the son of Seuthesor Scythes, as Apollo- <lb/>
            dorus states in the third book of his Chronicles, and a native <lb/>
            of Pitane in Æolia.</p>
          <p>II. He was the original founder of the Middle Academy, and <lb/>
            the first man who professed to suspend the declaration of his <lb/>
            judgment, because of the contrarieties of the reasons alleged <lb/>
            on either side. He was likewise the first who attempted to <lb/>
            argue on both sides of a question, and who also made the <lb/>
            method of discussion, which had been handed down by Plato, <lb/>
            by means of question and answer, more contentious than <lb/>
            before.</p>
          <p>III. He met with Crantor in the following manner. He <lb/>
            was one of four brothers, two by the same father and two by <lb/>
            the same mother. Of those who were by the same mother the <lb/>
            eldest was Pylades, and of those by the same father the eldest <lb/>
            was Mæreas, who was his guardian; and at first he was a pupil <lb/>
            of Autolycus the mathematician, who happened to be a fellow <lb/>
            citizen of his before he went to Athens ; and with Autolycus <lb/>
            he travelled as far as Sardis. After that he became a pupil of <lb/>
            Xanthus the musician, and after that attended the lectures of <lb/>
            Theophrastus, and subsequently came over to the Academy to <lb/>
            Grantor. For Mæreas his brother, whom I have mentioned <note type="footnote"> M 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="164"/>
            before, urged him to apply himself to rhetoric; but he himself <lb/>
            had a preference for philosophy, and when he became much <lb/>
            attached to him Crantor asked him, quoting a line out of the <lb/>
            Andromeda of Euripides:— <lb/>
            0 virgin, if I save you, will you thank me ?</p>
          <p>And he replied by quoting the next line to it: — <lb/>
            0 take me to you, stranger, as your slave, <lb/>
            Or wife, or what you please.</p>
          <p>And ever after that they became very intimate, so that they <lb/>
            say Theophrastus was much annoyed, and said, " That a most <lb/>
            ingenious and well-disposed young man had deserted his <lb/>
            school."</p>
          <p>IV. For he was not only very impressive in his discourse, <lb/>
            and displayed a great deal of learning in it, but he also tried <lb/>
            his hand at poetry, and there is extant an epigram which is <lb/>
            attributed to him, addressed to Attalus, which is as follows :— <lb/>
            Pergamus is not famed for arms alone, <lb/>
            But often hears its praise resound <lb/>
            For its fine horses, at the holy Pisa. <lb/>
            Yet, if a mortal may declare, <lb/>
            Its fate as hidden in the breast of Jove, <lb/>
            It will be famous for its woes.</p>
          <p>There is another addressed to Menodorus the son of Euda- <lb/>
            mus, who was attached to one of his fellow pupils :— <lb/>
            Phrygia is a distant land, and so <lb/>
            Is sacred Thyatira, and Cadanade, <lb/>
            Your country Menodorus. But from all, <lb/>
            As the unvaried song of bards relates, <lb/>
            An equal road does lie - to Acheron, <lb/>
            That dark unmentioned river; so you lie <lb/>
            Here far from home; and here Eudamus raises' <lb/>
            This tomb above your bones, for he did love you, <lb/>
            Though you were poor, with an undying love.</p>
          <p>But he admired Homer above all poets, and always used to <lb/>
            read a portion of his works before going to sleep ; and in the <lb/>
            morning he would say that he was going to the object of his <lb/>
            love, when he was going to read him. He said, too, that <lb/>
            Pindar was a wonderful man for filling the voice, and pouring <lb/>
             <pb n="165"/>
            forth an abundant variety of words and expressions. He also, <lb/>
            when he was a young man, wrote a criticism on Ion.</p>
          <p>V. And he was a pupil likewise of Hipponicus, the geome- <lb/>
            trican, whom he used to ridicule on other points as being lazy <lb/>
            and gaping; but he admitted that in his own profession he was <lb/>
            clear sighted enough, and said that geometry had flown into <lb/>
            his mouth while he was yawning. And when he went out of <lb/>
            his mind, he took him to his own house, and took care of him <lb/>
            till he recovered his senses.</p>
          <p>VI. And when Crates died, he succeeded him in the presi- <lb/>
            dency of his schools, a man of the name of Socrates willingly <lb/>
            yielding to him.</p>
          <p>VII. And as he suspended his judgment on every point, he <lb/>
            never, as it is said, wrote one single book. But others say that <lb/>
            he was once detected correcting some passages in a work of <lb/>
            his; and some assert that he published it, while others deny it, <lb/>
            and affirm that he threw it into the fire.</p>
          <p>VIII. He seems to have been a great admirer of Plato, and <lb/>
            he possessed all his writings. He also, according to some <lb/>
            authorities, had a very high opinion of Pyrrho.</p>
          <p>IX. He also studied dialectics, and the discussions of the <lb/>
            Eretrian school; on which account Ariston said of him :— <lb/>
            First Plato comes, and Pyrrho last, <lb/>
            And in the middle Diodorus.</p>
          <p>And Timon speaks thus of him :— <lb/>
            For having on this side the heavy load <lb/>
            Of Menedemus plac'd beneath his breast, <lb/>
            He'll to stout Pyrrho run, or Diodorus.</p>
          <p>And presently afterwards he represents him as saying:- <lb/>
            I'll swim to Pyrrho, or that crooked sophist <lb/>
            Called Diodorus.</p>
          <p>X. He was exceedingly fond of employing axioms, very <lb/>
            concise in his diction, and when speaking he laid an emphasis <lb/>
            on each separate word.</p>
          <p>XI. He was also very fond of attacking others, and very <lb/>
            free spoken, on which account Timon in another passage speaks <lb/>
            of him thus :- <lb/>
            You'll not escape all notice while you thus <lb/>
            Attack the young man with your biting sarcasm.</p><pb n="166"/>
            
          <p>Once, when a young man was arguing against him with more <lb/>
            boldness than usual, he said, " Will no one stop his mouth <lb/>
            with the knout ?"* And to a man who lay under the general <lb/>
            imputation of low debauchery, and who argued with him that <lb/>
            one thing was not greater than another, he asked him whether <lb/>
            a cup holding two pints was not larger than one which held <lb/>
            only one. There was a certain Chian named Hemon, ex- <lb/>
            ceedingly ugly, but who fancied himself good looking, and <lb/>
            always went about in fine clothes; this man asked him one <lb/>
            day, “ If be thought that a wise man could feel attachment to <lb/>
            him; ” " Why should he not," said he, " when they love even <lb/>
            those who are less handsome than you, and not so well-dressed <lb/>
            either?" and when the man, though one of the vilest charac- <lb/>
            ters possible, said to Arcesilaus as if he were addressing a very <lb/>
            rigid man :— <lb/>
            0, noble man, may I a question put, <lb/>
            Or must I hold my tongue ?</p>
          <p>Arcesilaus replied :— <lb/>
            0 wretched woman, why do you thus roughen <lb/>
            Your voice, not speaking in your usual manner?</p>
          <p>And once, when he was plagued by a chattering fellow of low <lb/>
            extraction, he said :— <lb/>
            The sons of slaves are always talking vilely. t</p>
          <p>Another time, when a talkative mail was giving utterance to <lb/>
            a great deal of nonsense, he said, that " He had not had a <lb/>
            nurse who was severe enough." And to some people he never <lb/>
            gave any answer at all. On one occasion a usurer, who made <lb/>
            pretence to some learning, said in his hearing that he did not <lb/>
            know something or other, on which he rejoined :— <lb/>
            For often times the passing winds do fill <lb/>
            The female bird, except when big with young. J <note type="footnote"> * Perhaps there is a pun here ; <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀστράγαλος</foreign> means not only a knout <lb/>
            composed of small bones strung together, but also a die. </note><note type="footnote"> t This is a quotation from some lost play of Euripides, slightly <lb/>

          <p>And the lines come out of the Ænomaus of Sophocles. He <lb/>
            once reminded a certain dialectician, a pupil of Aleximes, who <lb/>
            was unable to explain correctly some saying of his master, of <lb/>
            what had been done by Philoxenus to some brick-makers. For <lb/>
            when they were singing some of his songs very badly he came <lb/>
            upon them, and trampled their bricks under foot, saying, " As <lb/>
            you spoil my works so will I spoil yours."</p>
          <p>XII. And he used to be very indignant with those who <lb/>
            neglected proper opportunities of applying themselves to learn- <lb/>
            ing ; and he had a peculiar habit, while conversing, of using <lb/>
            the expression, " I think," and " So and so," naming the per- <lb/>
            son, " will not agree to this." And this was imitated by several <lb/>
            of his pupils, who copied also his style of expression and every- <lb/>
            thing about him. He was a man very ready at inventing new <lb/>
            words, and very quick at meeting objections, and at bringing <lb/>
            round the conversation to the subject before him, and at adapt- <lb/>
            ing it to every occasion, and he was the most convincing <lb/>
            speaker that could be found, on which account numbers of <lb/>
            people flocked to his school, in spite of being somewhat alarmed <lb/>
            at his severity, which however they bore with complacency, <lb/>
            for he was a very kind man, and one who inspired his hearers <lb/>
            with abundant hope, and in his manner of life he was very <lb/>
            affable and liberal, always ready to do any one a service with- <lb/>
            out any parade, and shrinking from any expression of gratitude <lb/>
            on the part of those whom he had obliged. Accordingly once. <lb/>
            when he had gone to visit Ctesibius who was ill, seeing him in <lb/>
            great distress from want, he secretly slipped his purse under <lb/>
            his pillow ; and when Ctesibius found it, " This," said he, " is <lb/>
            the amusement of Arcesilaus." And at another time he sent <lb/>
            him a thousand drachmas. He it was also who introduced <lb/>
            Archias the Arcadian to Eumenes, and who procured him many <lb/>
            favours from him.</p>
          <p>XIII. And being a very liberal man and utterly regardless <lb/>
            of money, he made the most splendid display of silver plate, <lb/>
            and in his exhibition of gold plate he vied with that of Arche- <lb/>
            crates and Callecrates ; and he was constantly assisting and <lb/>
            contributing to the wants of others with money; and once, <lb/>
            when some one had borrowed from him some articles cf silver <lb/>
            plate to help him entertain his friends, and did not offer to re- <lb/>
            turn them, he never asked for them back or reclaimed them; <lb/>
            but some say that he lent them with the purpose that they <lb/>
             <pb n="168"/>
            should be kept, and that when the man returned them, he <lb/>
            made him a present of them as he was a poor man. He had <lb/>
            also property in Pitana, the revenues from which were trans- <lb/>
            mitted to him by his brother Pylades.</p>
          <p>XIV. Moreover, Eumenes, the son of Philetærus, supplied <lb/>
            him with many things, on which account he was the only <lb/>
            king to whom he addressed any of his discourses. And when <lb/>
            many philosophers paid court to Antigonus and went out to <lb/>
            meet him when he arrived, he himself kept quiet, not wishing <lb/>
            to make his acquaintance. But he was a great friend of <lb/>
            Hierocles, the governor of the harbours of Munychia and the <lb/>
            Piræus; and at festivals he always paid him a visit. And <lb/>
            when he constantly endeavoured to persuade him to pay his <lb/>
            respects to Antigonus, he would not; but though he accom- <lb/>
            panied him as far as his gates, he turned back himself. <lb/>
            And after the sea-fight of Antigonus, when many people <lb/>
            went to him and wrote him letters to comfort him for his <lb/>
            defeat, he neither went nor wrote ; but still in the service of <lb/>
            his country, he went to Demetrias as ambassador to Anti- <lb/>
            gonus, and succeeded in the object of his mission.</p>
          <p>XV. And he spent all his time in the Academy, and avoided <lb/>
            meddling with public affairs, but at times he would spend <lb/>
            some days in the Piraeus of Athens, discoursing on philo- <lb/>
            sophical subjects, from his friendship for Hierocles, which <lb/>
            conduct of his gave rise to unfavourable reports being raised <lb/>
            against him by some people.</p>
          <p>XVI. Being a man of very expensive habits, for he was in <lb/>
            this respect a sort of second Aristippus, he often went to dine <lb/>
            with his friends. He also lived openly with Theodote and <lb/>
            Philæte, two courtesans of Elis ; and to those who reproached <lb/>
            him for this conduct, he used to quote the opinions of Aris- <lb/>
            tippus. He was also very fond of the society of young men, <lb/>
            and of a very affectionate disposition, on which account Aristi, <lb/>
            the Chian, a Stoic philosopher, used to accuse him of being a <lb/>
            corrupter of the youth of the city, and a profligate man. He <lb/>
            is said also to have been greatly attached to Demetrius, who <lb/>
            sailed to Cyrene, and to Cleochares of Mydea, of whom he <lb/>
            said to his messmates, that he wished to open the door to him, <lb/>
            but that he prevented him.</p>
          <p>XVII. Demochares the son of Laches, and Pythocles the <lb/>
            son of Bugelus, were also among his friends, and he said that <lb/>
             <pb n="169"/>
            he humoured them in all their wishes because of his great <lb/>
            patience. And, on this account, those people to whom I <lb/>
            have before alluded, used to attack him and ridicule him as a <lb/>
            popularity hunter and vain-glorious man. And they set upon <lb/>
            him very violently at an entertainment given by Hieronymus, <lb/>
            the Peripatetic, when he invited his friends on the birthday <lb/>
            of Alcymeus, the son of Antigonus, on which occasion Anti- <lb/>
            gonus sent him a large sum of money to promote the con- <lb/>
            viviality. On this occasion, as he avoided all discussion <lb/>
            during the continuance of the banquet, when Aridelus pro- <lb/>
            posed to him a question which required some deliberation, and <lb/>
            entreated him to discourse upon it, it is said that he replied, <lb/>
            " But this is more especially the business of philosophy, to <lb/>
            know the proper time for everything." With reference to the <lb/>
            charge that was brought against him of being a popularity <lb/>
            hunter, Timon speaks, among other matters, mentioning it <lb/>
            in the following manner :- <lb/>
            He spoke and glided quick among the crowd, <lb/>
            They gazed on him as finches who behold <lb/>
            An owl among them. You then please the people ! <lb/>
            Alas, poor fool, 'tis no great matter that ; <lb/>
            Why give yourself such airs for such a trifle ?</p>
          <p>XVIII. However, in all other respects he was so free from <lb/>
            vanity, that he used to advise his pupils to become the dis- <lb/>
            ciples of other men ; and once, when a young man from Chios <lb/>
            was not satisfied with his school, but preferred that of Hiero- <lb/>
            nymus, whom I have mentioned before, he himself took him <lb/>
            and introduced him to that philosopher, recommending him <lb/>
            to preserve his regularity of conduct. And there is a very <lb/>
            witty saying of his recorded. For when some one asked him <lb/>
            once, why people left other schools to go to the Epicureans, <lb/>
            but no one left the Epicureans to join other sects, he replied, <lb/>
            " People sometimes make eunuchs of men, but no one can ever <lb/>
            make a man out of an eunuch."</p>
          <p>XIX. At last, when he was near his end, he left all his <lb/>
            property to his brother Pylades, because he, without the <lb/>
            knowledge of Mæreas, had taken him to Chios and had <lb/>
            brought him from thence to Athens. He never married a <lb/>
            wife, and never had any children. He made three copies of <lb/>
            his will, and deposited one in Eretria with Amphicritus, and <lb/>
             <pb n="170"/>
            one at Athens with some of his friends, and the third he sent <lb/>
            to his own home to Thaumasias, one of his relations, en- <lb/>
            treating him to keep it. And he also wrote him the following <lb/>
            letter :-</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">ARCESILAUS TO THAUMASIAS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>“ I have given Diogenes a copy of my will to convey to you. <lb/>
            For, because I am frequently unwell and have got very in- <lb/>
            firm, I have thought it right to make a will, that, if anything <lb/>
            should happen to me I might not depart with the feelings of <lb/>
            having done you any injury, who have been so constantly af- <lb/>
            fectionate to me. And as you have been at all times the most <lb/>
            faithful to me of all my friends, I entreat you to preserve this <lb/>
            for me out of regard for my old age and your regard for me. <lb/>
            Take care then to behave justly towards me, remembering <lb/>
            how much I entrust to your integrity, so that I may appear to <lb/>
            have managed my affairs well, as far as depends on you; and <lb/>
            there is another copy of this will at Athens, in the care of <lb/>
            some of my friends, and another at Eretria, in the hands of <lb/>
            Amphicritus."</p>
          <p>XX. He died, as Hermippus relates, after having drunk an <lb/>
            excessive quantity of wine, and then became delirious, when <lb/>
            he was seventy-five years old ; and he was more beloved by <lb/>
            the Athenians than any one else had ever been. And we have <lb/>
            written the following epigram on him :— <lb/>
            0 wise Arcesilaus, why didst thou drink <lb/>
            So vast a quantity of unmixed wine, <lb/>
            As to lose all your senses, and then die ? <lb/>
            I pity you not so much for your death, <lb/>
            As for the insult that you thus did offer <lb/>
            The Muses, by your sad excess in wine.</p>
          <p>XXI. There were also three other persons of the name of <lb/>
            Arcesilaus ; one a poet of the old Comedy ; another an elegiac <lb/>
            poet; the third a sculptor, on whom Simonides wrote the <lb/>
            following epigram :- <lb/>
            This is a statue of chaste Dian's self <lb/>
            The price two hundred Parian drachmas fine, <lb/>
            Stamp'd with the image of the wanton goat. <lb/>
            It is the work of wise Arcesilaus, <lb/>
            The son of Aristodicus : a man, <lb/>
            Whose hands Minerva guided in his art.</p><pb n="171"/>
            
          <p>The philosopher of whom we have been speaking flourished, <lb/>
            as Apollodorus tells us in his Chronicles, about the hundred <lb/>
            and twentieth olympiad.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF BION.'</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. BION was a native of the country around the Borysthenes; <lb/>
            but as to who his parents were, and to what circumstances it <lb/>
            was owing that he applied himself to the study of philosophy, <lb/>
            we know no more than what he himself told Antigonus. For <lb/>
            when Antigonus asked him:- <lb/>
            What art thou, say ! from whence, from whom you came, <lb/>
            Who are your parents ? tell thy race, thy name ;*</p>
          <p>He,'knowing that he had been misrepresented to the king, said <lb/>
            to him, " My father was a freedman, who used to wipe his mouth <lb/>
            with his sleeve," (by which he meant that he used to sell salt <lb/>
            fish). " As to his race, he was a native of the district of the <lb/>
            Borysthenes; having no countenance, but only a brand in his <lb/>
            face, a token of the bitter cruelty of his master. My mother <lb/>
            was such a woman as a man of that condition might marry, <lb/>
            taken out of a brothel. Then, my father being in arrears to <lb/>
            the tax-gatherers, was sold with all his family, and with me <lb/>
            among them; and as I was young and good looking, a certain <lb/>
            orator purchased me, and when he died he left me everything. <lb/>
            And I, having burnt all his books, and torn up all his papers, <lb/>
            came to Athens and applied myself to the study of Philo- <lb/>
            sophy :— <lb/>
            Such was my father, and from him I came, <lb/>
            The honoured author of my birth and name.t</p>
          <p>This is all that I can tell you of myself: so that Persæus <lb/>
            and Philonides may give up telling these stories about me : <lb/>
            and you may judge of me on my own merits." <note type="footnote"> * Horn. Od. x. 335. Pope's Version, 387. </note><note type="footnote"> † Horn. Il. vi. 211. Pope's Version, 254. </note></p><pb n="172"/>
            
          <p>II. And Bion was truly a man of great versatility, and a <lb/>
            very subtle philosopher, and a man who gave all who chose <lb/>
            great opportunities of practising philosophy. In some respects <lb/>
            he was of a gentle disposition, and very much inclined to <lb/>
            indulge in vanity.</p>
          <p>III. And he left behind him many memorials of himself in <lb/>
            the way of writings, and also many apophthegms full of useful <lb/>
            sentiments. As for instance, once when he was reproved for <lb/>
            having failed to charm a young man, he replied, " You cannot <lb/>
            possibly draw up cheese with a hook before it has got hard." <lb/>
            On another occasion he was asked who was the most miserable <lb/>
            of men, and replied, " He who has set his heart on the greatest <lb/>
            prosperity." When he was asked whether it was advisable to <lb/>
            marry (for this answer also is attributed to him), he replied, <lb/>
            " If you marry an ugly woman you will have a punishment <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ποινὴ</foreign>), and if a handsome woman you will have one who is <lb/>
            common" (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰοινή</foreign>). He called old age a port to shelter one <lb/>
            from misfortune ; and accordingly, he said that every one fled <lb/>
            to it. He said that glory was the mother of years ; that beauty <lb/>
            was a good which concerned others rather than one's self; that <lb/>
            riches were the sinews of business. To a man who had <lb/>
            squandered his estate he said, " The earth swallowed up <lb/>
            Amphiaraus, but you have swallowed up the earth." Another <lb/>
            saying of his was that it was a great evil not to be able to bear <lb/>
            evil. And he condemned those who burnt the dead as though <lb/>
            they felt nothing, and then mocked them as though they did <lb/>
            feel. And he was always saying that it was better to put one's <lb/>
            own beauty at the disposal of another, than to covet the beauty <lb/>
            of others ; for that one who did so was injuring both his body <lb/>
            and his soul. And he used to blame Socrates saying, that if <lb/>
            he derived no advantage from Alcibiades he was foolish, and if <lb/>
            he never derived any advantage from him he then deserved <lb/>
            no credit. He used to say that the way to the shades below <lb/>
            was easy; and accordingly, that people went there with their <lb/>
            eyes shut. He used to blame Alcibiades, saying that while <lb/>
            he was a boy he seduced husbands from their wives, and <lb/>
            when he had become a young man he seduced the wives from <lb/>
            their husbands. While most of the Athenians at Rhodes <lb/>
            practised rhetoric, he himself used to give lectures on philoso- <lb/>
            phical subjects; and to one who blamed him for this he said, <lb/>
            " I have bought wheat, and I sell barley."</p><pb n="173"/>
            
          <p>It was a saying of his that the inhabitants of the shades <lb/>
            below would be more punished if they carried water in buckets <lb/>
            that were whole, than in such as were bored. To a chattering <lb/>
            fellow who was soliciting him for aid, he said, " I will do what <lb/>
            is sufficient for you, if you will send deputies to me, and <lb/>
            forbear to come yourself." Once when he was at sea in the <lb/>
            company of some wicked men, he fell into the hands of pirates; <lb/>
            and when the rest said, " We are undone, if we are known." <lb/>
            " But I," said he, "am undone if we are not known." He <lb/>
            used to say that self-conceit was the enemy of progress. Of a <lb/>
            rich man who was mean and niggardly, he said, " That man <lb/>
            does not possess his estate, but his estate possesses him." He <lb/>
            used to say that stingy men took care of their property as if <lb/>
            it was their own, but derived no advantage from it as if it <lb/>
            belonged to other people. Another of his sayings was, that <lb/>
            young men ought to display courage, but that old men ought <lb/>
            to be distinguished for prudence. And that prudence was as <lb/>
            much superior to the other virtues as sight was to the other <lb/>
            senses. And that it was not right to speak of old age, <lb/>
            at which every one is desirous to arrive. To an envious <lb/>
            man who was looking gloomy, he said, " I know not whether it <lb/>
            is because some misfortune has happened to you, or some <lb/>
            good fortune to some one else." One thing that he used to <lb/>
            say was, that a mean extraction was a bad companion to <lb/>
            freedom of speech. For :- <lb/>
            It does enslave a man, however bold <lb/>
            His speech may be.*</p>
          <p>And another was that we ought to keep our friends, what- <lb/>
            ever sort of people they may be, so that we may not seem <lb/>
            to have been intimate with wicked men, or to have abandoned <lb/>
            good men.</p>
          <p>IV. Very early in his career he abandoned the school of the <lb/>
            Academy, and at the same time became a disciple of Crates. <lb/>
            Then he passed over to the sect of the Cynics, taking their <lb/>
            coarse cloak and wallet. For what else could ever have <lb/>
            changed his nature into one of such apathy ? After that he <lb/>
            adopted the Theodorean principles, having become a disciple <lb/>
            of Theodorus the Atheist, who was used to employ every kind <lb/>
            of reasoning in support of his system of philosophy. After <note type="footnote"> * This is a quotation from the Hippolytus of Euripides, v. 424. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="174"/>
            leaving him, he became a pupil of Theophrastus, the Peripa. <lb/>
            tetic.</p>
          <p>V. He was very fond of theatrical entertainments, and very <lb/>
            skilful in distracting his hearers by exciting a laugh, giving <lb/>
            things disparaging names. And because he used to avail <lb/>
            himself of every species of reasoning, they relate that Eretos- <lb/>
            thenes said that Bion was the first person who had clothed <lb/>
            philosophy in a flowery robe.</p>
          <p>VI. He was also very ingenious in parodying passages, and <lb/>
            adapting them to circumstances as they arose. As for instance, <lb/>
            I may cite the following :- <lb/>
            Tender Archytas, born of tuneful lyre, <lb/>
            Whom thoughts of happy vanity inspire; <lb/>
            Most skilled of mortals in appeasing ire.*</p>
          <p>And he jested on every part of music and geometry.</p>
          <p>VII. He was a man of very expensive habits, and on this <lb/>
            account he used to go from city to city, and at times he would <lb/>
            contrive the most amazing devices.</p>
          <p>VIII. Accordingly, in Rhodes, he persuaded the sailors to <lb/>
            put on the habiliments of philosophical students and follow <lb/>
            him about; and then he made himself conspicuous by entering <lb/>
            the gymnasium with this train of followers.</p>
          <p>IX. He was accustomed also to adopt young men as his <lb/>
            sons, in order to derive assistance from them in his pleasures, <lb/>
            and to be protected by their affection for him. But he was a <lb/>
            very selfish man, and very fond of quoting the saying, " The <lb/>
            property of friends is common ;” owing to which it is that no <lb/>
            one is spoken of as a disciple of his, though so many men <note type="footnote"> * I doubt if the wit of these parodies will be appreciated by the <lb/>

              attended his school. And he made some very shameless ; <lb/>
              accordingly, Betion, one of his intimate acquaintances, is <lb/>
              reported to have said once to Menedemus, " So Menedemus <lb/>
              constantly spends the evening with Bion, and I see no harm <lb/>
              in it." He used also to talk with great impiety to those who <lb/>
              conversed with him, having derived his opinions on this <lb/>
              subject from Theodorus.</p>
          <p>X. And when at a later period he became afflicted with <lb/>
            disease, as the people of Chalets said, for he died there, he was <lb/>
            persuaded to wear amulets and charms, and to show his <lb/>
            repentance for the insults that he had offered to the Gods. <lb/>
            But he suffered fearfully for want of proper people to attend <lb/>
            him, until Antigonus sent him two servants. And he followed <lb/>
            him in a litter, as Pharorinus relates in his Universal History. <lb/>
            And the circumstances of his death we have ourselves spoken <lb/>
            of in the following lines :— <lb/>
            We hear that Bion the Borysthenite, <lb/>
            Whom the ferocious Scythian land brought forth, <lb/>
            Used to deny that there were Gods at all. <lb/>
            Now, if he'd persevered in this opinion, <lb/>
            One would have said he speaks just as he thinks ; <lb/>
            Though certainly his thoughts are quite mistaken. <lb/>
            But when a lengthened sickness overtook him, <lb/>
            And he began to fear lest he should die ; <lb/>
            This man who heretofore denied the Gods, <lb/>
            And would not even look upon a temple, <lb/>
            And mocked all those who e'er approached the Gods <lb/>
            With prayer or sacrifice ; who ne'er, not even <lb/>
            For his own hearth, and home, and household table, <lb/>
            Regaled the Gods with savoury fat and incense, <lb/>
            Who never once said, “ I have sinned, but spare me." <lb/>
            Then did this atheist shrink, and give his neck <lb/>
            To an old woman to hang charms upon, <lb/>
            And bound his arms with magic amulets, <lb/>
            With laurel branches blocked his doors and windows, <lb/>
            Ready to do and venture anything <lb/>
            Rather than die. Fool that he was, who thought <lb/>
            To win the Gods to come into existence, <lb/>
            Whenever he might think he wanted them. <lb/>
            So wise too late, when now mere dust and ashes, <lb/>
            He put his hand forth, Hail, great Pluto, Hail!</p>
          <p>XI. There were ten people of the name of Bion. First of <lb/>
            all, the one who flourished at the same time with Pherecydes <lb/>
            of Syros, and who has left two books behind him, which are <lb/>
             <pb n="176"/>
            still extant; he was a native of Proconnesas. The second <lb/>
            was a Syracusan, the author of a system of rhetoric. The <lb/>
            third was the man of whom we have been speaking. The <lb/>
            fourth was a pupil of Democritus, and a mathematician, a <lb/>
            native of Abdera, who wrote in both the Attic and Ionic <lb/>
            dialect. He was the person who first asserted that there <lb/>
            were countries where there was night for six months, and day <lb/>
            for six months. The fifth was a native of Soli; who wrote a <lb/>
            history of Æthiopia. The sixth was a rhetorician, who has <lb/>
            left behind him nine books, inscribed with the names of the <lb/>
            Muses, which are still extant. The eighth was a Milesian <lb/>
            statuary, who is mentioned by Polemo. The ninth was a <lb/>
            tragic poet of the number of those who are called Tarsicans. <lb/>
            The tenth was a statuary, a native of Clazomenæ or Chios, who <lb/>
            is mentioned by Hipponax.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF LACYDES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. LACYDES, the sen of Alexander, was a native of Cvrene. <lb/>
            He it is who was the founder of the New Academy, having <lb/>
            succeeded Arcesilaus; and he was a man of great gravity of <lb/>
            character and demeanour, and one who had many imitators.</p>
          <p>II. He was industrious from his very childhood, and poor, <lb/>
            but very pleasing and sociable in his manners.</p>
          <p>III. They say that he had a pleasant way of managing his <lb/>
            house-keeping affairs. For when he had taken anything out <lb/>
            of his store-chest, he would seal it up again, and throw in his <lb/>
            seal through the hole, so that it should be impossible for any- <lb/>
            thing of what he had laid up there to be stolen from him, or <lb/>
            carried off. But his servants learning this contrivance of <lb/>
            his, broke the seal, and carried off as much as they pleased, <lb/>
            and then they put the ring back through the hole in the same <lb/>
            manner as before ; and though they did this repeatedly, they <lb/>
            were never detected.</p>
          <p>IV. Lacydes now used to hold his school in the Academy in <lb/>
            the garden which had been laid out by Attains the king, <lb/>
            and it was called, the Lacydeum, after him. And he was the <lb/>
             <pb n="177"/>
            only man, who, while alive, resigned his school to a successor ; <lb/>
            but he resigned this to Telicles and Evander, of Phocis ; and <lb/>
            Hegesinus, of Pergamus, succeeded Evander; and he himself <lb/>
            was in his turn succeeded by Carneades.</p>
          <p>V. There is a witty saying, which is attributed to Lacydes. <lb/>
            For they say that when Attalus sent for him, he answered <lb/>
            that statues ought to be seen at a distance. On another <lb/>
            occasion, as it is reported, he was studying geometry very late <lb/>
            in life, and some said to him, " Is it then a time for you to be <lb/>
            learning now ?" " If it is not, he replied, " when will it be ?"</p>
          <p>VI. And he died in the fourth year of the hundred and <lb/>
            thirty-fourth Olympiad, when he had presided over his school <lb/>
            twenty-six years. And his death was caused by paralysis, <lb/>
            which was brought on by drinking. And we ourselves have <lb/>
            jested upon him in the following language. <lb/>
            'Tis an odd story that I heard of you— <lb/>
            Lacydes, that you went with hasty steps, <lb/>
            Spurred on by Bacchus, to the shades below. <lb/>
            How then, if this be true, can it be said, <lb/>
            That Bacchus e'er trips up his votaries' feet <lb/>
            'Tis a mistake his being named Lyæus.*</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF CARNEADES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. CARNEADES was the son of Epicomus, or Philocomus, as <lb/>
            Alexander states in his Successions ; and a native of Cyrene.</p>
          <p>II. He read all the books of the Stoics with great care, <lb/>
            and especially those of Chrysippus ; and then he wrote replies <lb/>
            to them, but did it at the same time with such modesty that <lb/>
            he used to say, " If Chrysippus had not lived, I should never <lb/>
            have existed."</p>
          <p>III. He was a man of as great industry as ever existed : <lb/>
            not, however, very much devoted to the investigation of subjects <lb/>
            of natural philosophy, but more fond of the discussion of ethical <lb/>
            topics, on which account he used to let his hair and his nails <lb/>
            grow, from his entire devotion of all his time to philosophical <note type="footnote"> * From <foreign xml:lang="grc">λύω</foreign>, solvo, to relax or weaken the limbs. </note> <note type="footnote"> N </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="178"/>
            discussion. And he was so eminent as a philosopher, that <lb/>
            the orators would quit their own schools and come and listen <lb/>
            to his lectures.</p>
          <p>IV. He was also a man of a very powerful voice, so that <lb/>
            the president of the Gymnasium sent to him once, to desire he <lb/>
            would not shout so loudly. And he replied, " Give me then, <lb/>
            measure for my voice." And the gymnasiarch again rejoined <lb/>
            with great wit, for he said, "You have a measure in your pupils."</p>
          <p>V. He was a very vehement speaker, and one difficult to <lb/>
            contend with in the investigation of a point. And he used to <lb/>
            decline all invitations to entertainments, for the reasons I <lb/>
            have already mentioned.</p>
          <p>VI. On one occasion, when Mentor, the Bithynian, one <lb/>
            of his pupils, came to him to attend his school, observing <lb/>
            that he was trying to seduce his mistress (as Phavorinus <lb/>
            relates in his Universal History), while he was in the middle <lb/>
            of his lecture, he made the following parody in allusion to <lb/>
            him:— <lb/>
            A weak old man comes hither, like in voice, <lb/>
            And gait, and figure, to the prudent Mentor <lb/>
            I order him to be expelled this school.</p>
          <p>And Mentor rising up, replied:- <lb/>
            Thus did they speak, and straight the others rose.</p>
          <p>VII. He appears to have been beset with fears of death; <lb/>
            as he was continually saying, " Nature, who has put this frame <lb/>
            together, will also dissolve it." And learning that Antipater had <lb/>
            died after having taken poison, he felt a desire to imitate the <lb/>
            boldness of his departure, and said, " Give me some too." <lb/>
            And when they asked “What?” "Some mead," said he. <lb/>
            And it is said that an eclipse of the moon happened when he <lb/>
            died, the most beautiful of all the stars, next to the sun, in- <lb/>
            dicating (as any one might say) its sympathy with the philo- <lb/>
            sopher. And Apollodorus, in his Chronicles, says that he <lb/>
            died in the fourth year of the hundred and sixty-second olym- <lb/>
            piad, being eighty-five years old.</p>
          <p>VIlI. There are some letters extant addressed by him to <lb/>
            Ariarathes, the king of the Cappadocians. All- the other <lb/>
            writings which are attributed to him were written by his <lb/>
            disciples, for he himself left nothing behind him. And I <lb/>
             <pb n="179"/>
            have written on him the following lines in logoaedical Arche- <lb/>
            bulian metre.</p>
          <p>Why now, 0 Muse, do you wish me Carneades to confute ? <lb/>
            He was an ignoramus, as he did not understand <lb/>
            Why he should stand in fear of death : so once, when he'd a cough, <lb/>
            The worst of all diseases that affect the human frame, <lb/>
            He cared not for a remedy ; but when the news did reach him, <lb/>
            That brave Antipater had ta'en some poison, and so died, <lb/>
            “ Give me, said he, some stuff to drink." " Some what ?”—“ Some lus- <lb/>
            cious mead." <lb/>
            Moreover, he'd this saying at all times upon his lips : <lb/>
            " Nature did make me, and she does together keep me still; <lb/>
            But soon the time will come when she will pull me all to pieces." <lb/>
            But still at last he yielded up the ghost: though long ago <lb/>
            He might have died, and so escaped the evils that befell him.</p>
          <p>IX. It is said that at night he was not aware when lights were <lb/>
            brought in ; and that once he ordered his servant to light the <lb/>
            candles, and when he had brought them in and told him, " I <lb/>
            have brought them;" "Well then," said he, "read by the <lb/>
            light of them."</p>
          <p>X. He had a great many other disciples; but the most <lb/>
            eminent of them was Clitomachus, whom we must mention <lb/>
            presently.</p>
          <p>XI. There was also another man of the name of Carneades, <lb/>
            a very indifferent elegiac poet.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF CLITOMACHUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. CLITOMACHUS was a Carthaginian. He was called <lb/>
            Asdrubal, and used to lecture on philosophy in his own country <lb/>
            in his native language.</p>
          <p>II. But when he came to Athens, at the age of forty years, <lb/>
            he became a pupil of Carneades ; and, as he was pleased with <lb/>
            his industry, he caused him to be instructed in literature, <lb/>
            and himself educated the man carefully. And he carried his <lb/>
            diligence to such a degree, that he composed more than four <lb/>
            hundred books.</p>
          <p>III. And he succeeded Carneades in his schools; and he <lb/>
            illustrated his principles a great deal by his writings: as he <note type="footnote"> N 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="180"/>
            himself had studied the doctrines of their sects, the Academic, <lb/>
            the Peripatetic, and the Stoic. Timon attacks the whole school- <lb/>
            of Academics, as a body, in these lines;- <lb/>
            Nor the unprofitable chattering <lb/>
            Of all the Academies.</p>
          <p>But now that we have gone through the philosophers of <lb/>
            Plato's school, let us go to the Peripatetics, who also derived <lb/>
            their doctrines from Plato ; and the founder of their sect was <lb/>
            Aristotle.</p><pb n="181"/>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF ARISTOTLE.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. ARISTOTLE was the son of Nicomachus and Phæstias, a <lb/>
            citizen of Stagira; and Nicomachus was descended from <lb/>
            Nicomachus, the son of Machaon, the son of Æsculapius, as <lb/>
            Hermippus tells us in his treatise on Aristotle ; and he lived <lb/>
            with Amyntas, the king of the Macedonians, as both a <lb/>
            physician and a friend.</p>
          <p>II. He was the most eminent of all the pupils of Plato ; he <lb/>
            had a lisping voice, as is asserted by Timotheus the Athenian, <lb/>
            in his work on Lives. He had also very thin legs, they say, <lb/>
            and small eyes; but he used to indulge in very conspicuous. <lb/>
            dress, and rings, and used to dress his hair carefully.</p>
          <p>III. He had also a son named Nicomachus, by Herpyllis <lb/>
            his concubine, as we are told by Timotheus.</p>
          <p>IV. He seceded from Plato while he was still alive ; so <lb/>
            that they tell a story that he said, " Aristotle has kicked us off <lb/>
            just as chickens do their mother after they have been hatched." <lb/>
            But Hermippus says in his Lives, that while he was absent on <lb/>
            an embassy to Philip, on behalf of the Athenians, Xenocrates <lb/>
            became the president of the school in the Academy ; and that <lb/>
            when he returned and saw the school under the presidency of <lb/>
            some one else, he selected a promenade in the Lyceum, in <lb/>
            which he used to walk up and down with his disciples, dis- <lb/>
            cussing subjects of philosophy till the time for anointing <lb/>
            themselves came ; on which account he was called a Peripa- <lb/>
            tetic.* But others say that he got this name because once <lb/>
            when Alexander was walking about after recovering from a <lb/>
            sickness, he accompanied him and kept conversing with him. <lb/>
            But when his pupils became numerous, he then gave them <lb/>
            seats, saying: — <lb/>
            It would be shame for me to hold my peace, <lb/>
            And for Isocrates to keep on talking. <note type="footnote"> * From <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεϱιπατέω</foreign>, " to walk about.” </note></p><pb n="182"/>
            
          <p>And lie used to accustom his disciples to discuss any <lb/>
            question which might be proposed, training them just as an <lb/>
            orator might.</p>
          <p>V. After that he went to Hermias the Eunuch, the tyrant <lb/>
            of Atarneus, who, as it is said, allowed him all kinds of <lb/>
            liberties ; and some say that he formed a matrimonial connec- <lb/>
            tion with him, giving him either his daughter or his niece in <lb/>
            marriage, as is recorded by Demetrius of Magnesia,? in his <lb/>
            essay on Poets and Prose-writers of the same name. And the <lb/>
            same authority says that Hermias had been the slave of <lb/>
            Eubulus, and a Bithynian by descent, and that he slew his <lb/>
            master. But Aristippus, in the first book of his treatise on <lb/>
            Ancient Luxury, says that Aristotle was enamoured of the <lb/>
            concubine of Hermias, and that, as Hermias gave his consent, <lb/>
            he married her; and was so overjoyed that he sacrificed to <lb/>
            her, as the Athenians do to the Eleusinian Ceres. And he <lb/>
            wrote a hymn to Hermias, which is given at length below.</p>
          <p>VI. After that he lived in Macedonia, at the court of <lb/>
            Philip, and was entrusted by, him with his son Alexander as a <lb/>
            pupil; and he entreated him to restore his native city which <lb/>
            had been destroyed by Philip, and had his request granted ; <lb/>
            and he also made laws for the citizens. And also he used to <lb/>
            make laws in his schools, doing this in imitation of Xeno- <lb/>
            crates, so that he appointed a president every ten days. And <lb/>
            when he thought that he had spent time enough with Alex- <lb/>
            ander, he departed for Athens, having recommended to him <lb/>
            his relation Callisthenes, a native of Olynthus ; but as he <lb/>
            spoke too freely to the king, and would not take Aristotle's <lb/>
            advice, he reproached him and said:- <lb/>
            Alas ! my child, in life's primeval bloom, <lb/>
            Such hasty words will bring thee to thy doom.*</p>
          <p>And his prophecy was fulfilled, for as he was believed by <lb/>
            Hermolaus to have been privy to the plot against Alexander, <lb/>
            he was shut up in an iron cage, covered with lice, and untended ; <lb/>
            and at last he was given to a lion, and so died,</p>
          <p>VII. Aristotle then having come to Athens, and having <lb/>
            presided over his school there for thirteen years, retired <lb/>
            secretly to Chalets, as Eurymedon, the hierophant had im- <lb/>
            peached him on an indictment for impiety, though Pharorinus, <note type="footnote"> * IL 18, 95. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="183"/>
            in his Universal History, says that his prosecutor was Demo- <lb/>
            phelus, on the ground of having written the hymn to the <lb/>
            beforementioned Hermias, and also the following epigram <lb/>
            which was engraven on his statue at Delphi ;- <lb/>
            The tyrant of the Persian archer race, <lb/>
            Broke through the laws of God to slay this man; <lb/>
            Not by the manly spear in open fight, <lb/>
            But by the treachery of a faithless friend.</p>
          <p>And after that he died of taking a draught of aconite, as <lb/>
            Eumelus says in the fifth book of his Histories, at the age of <lb/>
            seventy years. And the same author says that he was thirty <lb/>
            years old when he first became acquainted with Plato. But <lb/>
            this is a mistake of his, for he did only live in reality sixty- <lb/>
            three years, and he was seventeen years old when he first <lb/>
            attached himself to Plato. And the hymn in honour of <lb/>
            Hermias is as follows :— <lb/>
            0 Virtue, won by earnest strife, <lb/>
            And holding out the noblest prize <lb/>
            That ever gilded earthly life, <lb/>
            Or drew it on to seek the skies; <lb/>
            For thee what son of Greece would not <lb/>
            Deem it an enviable lot, <lb/>
            To live the life, to die the death, <lb/>
            That fears no weary hour, shrinks from no fiery breath ? <lb/>
            Such fruit hast thou of heavenly bloom, <lb/>
            A lure more rich than golden heap, <lb/>
            More tempting than the joys of home, <lb/>
            More bland than spell of soft-eyed sleep. <lb/>
            For thee Alcides, son of Jove, <lb/>
            And the twin boys of Leda strove, <lb/>
            With patient toil and sinewy might, <lb/>
            Thy glorious prize to grasp, to reach thy lofty height. <lb/>
            Achilles, Ajax, for thy love <lb/>
            Descended to the realms of night; <lb/>
            Atarneus' King thy vision drove, <lb/>
            To quit for aye the glad sun-light, <lb/>
            Therefore, to memory's daughters dear, <lb/>
            His deathless name, his pure career, <lb/>
            Live shrined in song, and link'd with awe, <lb/>
            The awe of Xenian Jove, and faithful friendship's law.* <note type="footnote"> * This very spirited version I owe to the kindness of my brother, <lb/>

          <p>There is also an epigram of ours upon him, which runs <lb/>
            thus :- <lb/>
            Eurymedon, the faithful minister <lb/>
            Of the mysterious Eleusinian Queen, <lb/>
            Was once about t' impeach the Stagirite <lb/>
            Of impious guilt. But he escaped his hands <lb/>
            By mighty draught of friendly aconite, <lb/>
            And thus defeated all his wicked arts.</p>
          <p>Pharorinus, in his Universal History, says that Aristotle was <lb/>
            the first person who ever composed a speech to be delivered <lb/>
            in his own defence in a court of justice, and that he did so on <lb/>
            the occasion of this prosecution, and said that at Athens :— <lb/>
            Pears upon pear-trees grow; on fig-trees, figs.</p>
          <p>Apollodorus, in his Chronicles, says that he was born in the <lb/>
            first year of the ninety-ninth olympiad, and that he attached <lb/>
            himself to Plato, and remained with him for twenty years, <lb/>
            having been seventeen years of age when he originally joined <lb/>
            him. And he went to Mitylene in the archonsbip of Eubulus, <lb/>
            in the fourth year of the hundred and eighth olympiad. But <lb/>
            as Plato had died in the first year of this same olympiad, in <lb/>
            the archonship of Theophilus, he departed for the court of <lb/>
            Hermias, and remained there three years. And in the archon- <lb/>
            ship of Pythodotus he went to the court of Philip, in the <lb/>
            second year of the hundred and ninth olympiad, when <lb/>
            Alexander was fifteen years old ; and he came to Athens in <lb/>
            the second year of the hundred and eleventh olympiad, and <lb/>
            presided over his school in the Lyceum for thirteen years: <lb/>
            after that he departed to Chalcis, in the third year of the <lb/>
            hundred and fourteenth olympiad, and died, at about the age <lb/>
            of sixty-three years, of disease, the same year that Demosthenes <lb/>
            died in Calumia, in the archonship of Philocles.</p>
          <p>VIlI. It is said also that he was offended with the king. <lb/>
            because of the result of the conspiracy of Calisthenes against <lb/>
            Alexander; and that the king, for the sake of annoying him, <lb/>
            promoted Anaximenes to honour, and sent presents to Xeno- <lb/>
            crates. And Theocritus, of Chios, wrote an epigram upon him <lb/>
            to ridicule him, in the following terms, as it is quoted by <lb/>
            Ambryon in his account of Theocritus :— <lb/>
            The empty-headed Aristotle rais'd <lb/>
            This empty tomb to Hermias the Eunuch, <lb/>
             <pb n="185"/>
            The ancient slave of the ill-us'd Eubulus. <lb/>
            [Who, for his monstrous appetite, preferred <lb/>
            The Bosphorus to Academia's groves.]</p>
          <p>And Timon attacked him too, saying of him :— <lb/>
            Nor the sad chattering of the empty Aristotle.</p>
          <p>Such was the life of the philosopher.</p>
          <p>IX. We have also met with his will, which is couched in <lb/>
            the following terms :—" May things turn out well ; but if any <lb/>
            thing happens to him, in that case Aristotle has made the <lb/>
            following disposition of his affairs. That Antipater shall be <lb/>
            the general and universal executor. And until Nicanor marries <lb/>
            my daughter, I appoint Aristomedes, Timarchus, Hipparchus, <lb/>
            Dioteles, and Theophrastus, if he will consent and accept the <lb/>
            charge, to be the guardians of my children and of Herpyllis, <lb/>
            and the trustees of all the property I leave behind me ; and I <lb/>
            desire them, when my daughter is old enough, to give her in <lb/>
            marriage to Nicanor; but if any thing should happen to the <lb/>
            girl, which may God forbid, either before or after she is mar- <lb/>
            ried, but before she has any children, then I will that Nicanor <lb/>
            shall have the absolute disposal of my son, and of all other <lb/>
            things, in the full confidence that he will arrange them in a <lb/>
            manner worthy of me and of himself. Let him also be the <lb/>
            guardian of my daughter and son Nicomachus, to act as he <lb/>
            pleases with respect to them, as if he were their father or <lb/>
            brother. But if anything should happen to Nicanor, which <lb/>
            may God forbid, either before he receives my daughter in <lb/>
            marriage, or after he is married to her, or before he has any <lb/>
            children by her, then any arrangements which he may make <lb/>
            by will shall stand. But, if Theophrastus, in this case, should <lb/>
            choose to take my daughter in marriage, then he is to stand <lb/>
            exactly in the same position as Nicanor. And if not, then I <lb/>
            will, that my trustees, consulting with Antipater concerning <lb/>
            both the boy and girl, shall arrange everything respecting them <lb/>
            as they shall think fit; and that my trustees and Nicanor, <lb/>
            remembering both me and Herpyllis, and how well she has <lb/>
            behaved to me, shall take care, if she be inclined to take a <lb/>
            husband, that one be found for her who shall not be unworthy <lb/>
            of us; and shall give her, in addition to all that has been <lb/>
            already given her, a talent of silver, and three maidservants <lb/>
            if she please to accept them, and the handmaid whom she has <lb/>
             <pb n="186"/>
            • <lb/>
            now, and the boy Pyrrhæus. And if she likes to dwell at <lb/>
            Chalets, she shall have the house which joins the garden ; but <lb/>
            if she likes to dwell in Stagira, then she shall have my father's <lb/>
            house. And whichever of these houses she elects to take, I <lb/>
            will that my executors do furnish it with all necessary furniture, <lb/>
            in such manner as shall seem to them and to Herpyllis to be <lb/>
            sufficient. And let Nicanor be the guardian of the child <lb/>
            Myrmex, so that he shall be conducted to his friends in a <lb/>
            manner worthy of us, with all his property which I received. <lb/>
            I also will that Aubracis shall have her liberty, and that there <lb/>
            shall be given to her when her daughter is married, five <lb/>
            hundred drachmas, and the handmaid whom she now has. <lb/>
            And I will that there be given to Thales, besides the hand- <lb/>
            maiden whom she now has, who was bought for her, a <lb/>
            thousand drachmas and another handmaid. And to Timon, in <lb/>
            addition to the money that has been given to him before for <lb/>
            another boy, an additional slave, or a sum of money which shall <lb/>
            be equivalent. I also will that Tychon shall have his liberty <lb/>
            when his daughter is married, and Philon, and Olympius, and <lb/>
            his son. Moreover, of those boys who wait upon me, I will <lb/>
            that none shall be sold, but my executors may use them, and <lb/>
            when they are grown up then they shall emancipate them if <lb/>
            they deserve it. I desire too, that my executors will take <lb/>
            under their care the statues which it has been entrusted to <lb/>
            Gryllion to make, that when they are made they may be <lb/>
            erected in their proper places ; and so too shall the statues of <lb/>
            Nicanor, and of Proxenus, which I was intending to give him <lb/>
            a commission for, and also that of the mother of Nicanor. I <lb/>
            wish them also to erect in its proper place the statue of <lb/>
            Arimnestus which is already made, that it may be a memorial <lb/>
            of her, since she has died childless. I wish them also to <lb/>
            dedicate a statue of my mother to Ceres at Nemea, or where- <lb/>
            ever else they think fit. And wherever they bury me, there <lb/>
            I desire that they shall also place the bones of Pythias, having <lb/>
            taken them up from the place where they now lie, as she <lb/>
            herself enjoined. And I desire that Nicanor, as he has been <lb/>
            preserved, will perform the vow which I made on his behalf, <lb/>
            and dedicate some figures of animals in stone, four cubits high, <lb/>
            to Jupiter the saviour, and Minerva the saviour, in Stagira."</p>
          <p>These are the provisions of his will.</p>
          <p>X. And it is said that a great many dishes were found in <lb/>
             <pb n="187"/>
            his house ; and that Lycon stated that he used to bathe in a <lb/>
            bath of warm oil, and afterwards to sell the oil. But some <lb/>
            say that he used to place a leather bag of warm oil on his <lb/>
            stomach. And whenever he went to bed, he used to take a <lb/>
            brazen ball in his hand, having arranged a brazen dish below <lb/>
            it; so that, when the ball fell into the dish, he might be awakened <lb/>
            by the noise.</p>
          <p>XI. The following admirable apophthegms are attributed to <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>He was once asked, what those who tell lies gain by it; <lb/>
            " They gain this," said he, " that when they speak truth they <lb/>
            are not believed."</p>
          <p>On one occasion he was blamed for giving alms to a worth- <lb/>
            less man, and he replied, " I did not pity the man, but his <lb/>
            condition."</p>
          <p>He was accustomed continually to say to his friends and <lb/>
            pupils wherever he happened to be, " That sight receives the <lb/>
            light from the air which surrounds it, and in like manner the <lb/>
            soul receives the light from the science."</p>
          <p>Very often, when he was inveighing against the Athenians, <lb/>
            he would say that they had invented both wheat and laws, but <lb/>
            that they used only the wheat and neglected the laws.</p>
          <p>It was a saying of his that the roots of education were bitter, <lb/>
            but the fruit sweet.</p>
          <p>Once he was asked what grew old most speedily, and he re- <lb/>
            plied, " Gratitude."</p>
          <p>On another occasion the question was put to him, what <lb/>
            hope is ? and his answer was, " The dream of a waking man."</p>
          <p>Diogenes once offered him a dry fig, and as he conjectured <lb/>
            that if he did not take it the cynic had a witticism ready pre- <lb/>
            pared, he accepted it, and then said that Diogenes had lost his <lb/>
            joke and his fig too ; and another time when he took one from <lb/>
            him as he offered it, he held it up as a child does, and said, <lb/>
            " 0 great Diogenes ; " and then he gave it to him back again.</p>
          <p>He used to say that there were three things necessary to <lb/>
            education ; natural qualifications, instruction, and practice.</p>
          <p>Having heard that he was abused by some one, he said, <lb/>
            " He may beat me too, if he likes, in my absence." '</p>
          <p>' He used to say that beauty is the best of all recommenda- <lb/>
            tions, but others say that it was Diogenes who gave this de- <lb/>
            scription of it; and that Aristotle called beauty, " The gift of <lb/>
             <pb n="188"/>
            a fair appearance;" that Socrates called it "A short-lived <lb/>
            tyranny ; " Plato, " The privilege of nature; " Theophrastus, <lb/>
            " A silent deceit; Theocritus, " An ivory mischief; " Car- <lb/>
            neades, " A sovereignty which stood in need of no guards."</p>
          <p>On one occasion he was asked how much educated men <lb/>
            were superior to those uneducated ; " As much," said he, " as <lb/>
            the living are to the dead."</p>
          <p>It was a saying of his that education was an ornament in <lb/>
            prosperity, and a refuge in adversity. And that those parents <lb/>
            who gave their children a good education deserved more honour <lb/>
            than those who merely beget them: for that the latter only <lb/>
            enabled their children to live, but the former gave them the <lb/>
            power of living well.</p>
          <p>When a man boasted in his presence that he was a native <lb/>
            of an illustrious city, he said, " That is not what one ought to <lb/>
            look at, but whether one is worthy of a great city."</p>
          <p>He was once asked what a friend is ; and is answer was, <lb/>
            " One soul abiding in two bodies."</p>
          <p>It was a saying of his that some men were as stingy as if <lb/>
            they expected to live for ever, and some as extravagant as if <lb/>
            they expected to die immediately.</p>
          <p>When he was asked why people like to spend a great deal <lb/>
            of their time with 'handsome people, " That," said he, " is a <lb/>
            question fit for a blind man to ask."</p>
          <p>The question was once put to him, what he had gained by <lb/>
            philosophy ; and the answer he made was this, " That I do <lb/>
            without being commanded, what others do from fear of the <lb/>
            laws."</p>
          <p>He was once asked what his disciples ought to do to get on ; <lb/>
            and he replied, " Press on upon those who are in front of <lb/>
            them, and not wait for those who are behind to catch them."</p>
          <p>A chattering fellow, who had been abusing him, said to <lb/>
            him, " Have not I been jeering you properly ? " Not that I <lb/>
            know of," said he, " for I have not been listening to you."</p>
          <p>A man on one occasion reproached him for having given a <lb/>
            contribution to one who was not a good man (for the story <lb/>
            which I have mentioned before is also quoted in this way), <lb/>
            and his answer was, " I gave not to the man, but to humanity."</p>
          <p>The question was once put to him, how we ought to behave <lb/>
            to our friends; and the answer he gave was, " As we should <lb/>
            wish our friends to behave to us."</p><pb n="189"/>
            
          <p>He used to define justice as " A virtue of the soul distribu- <lb/>
            five of what each person deserved."</p>
          <p>Another of his sayings was, that education was the best <lb/>
            viaticum for old age.</p>
          <p>Pharorinus, in the second book of his Commentaries, says <lb/>
            that he was constantly repeating, " The man who has friends <lb/>
            has no friend." And this sentiment is to be found also in the <lb/>
            seventh book of the Ethics.</p>
          <p>These apophthegms then are attributed to him.</p>
          <p>XII. He also wrote a great number of works ; and I have <lb/>
            thought it worth while to give a list of them, on account <lb/>
            of the eminence of their author in every branch of philo- <lb/>
            sophy. Four books on Justice ; three books on Poets ; three <lb/>

            two hundred and seventy lines.</p>
          <p>XIII. These then are the books which were written by him. <lb/>
            And in them he expresses the following opinions :-that there <lb/>
            is in philosophy a two-fold division; one practical, and the other <lb/>
            theoretical. Again, the practical is divided into ethical and <lb/>
            political, under which last head are comprised considerations <lb/>
            affecting not only the state, but also the management, of a <lb/>
            single house. The theoretical part, too, is subdivided into <lb/>
            physics and logic; the latter forming not a single division, <lb/>
            turning on one special point, but being rather an instrument <lb/>
            for every art brought to a high degree of accuracy. And he <lb/>
            has laid down two separate objects as what it is conversant <lb/>
            about, the persuasive and the true. And he has used two <lb/>
            means with reference to each end; dialectics and rhetoric, with <lb/>
            reference to persuasion; analytical examination and philosophy, <lb/>
            with reference to truth; omitting nothing which can bear <lb/>
            upon discovery, or judgment, or use. Accordingly, with re- <lb/>
            ference to discovery, he has furnished us with topics and <lb/>
            works on method, which form a complete armoury of propo- <lb/>
            sitions, from which it is easy to provide one's self with an <lb/>
            abundance of probable arguments for every kind of question. <lb/>
            And with reference to judgment, he has given us the former <lb/>
            and posterior analytics; and by means of the former ana- <lb/>
            lytics, we may arrive at a critical examination of principles; <lb/>
            by means of the posterior, we may examine the conclusions <lb/>
            which are deduced from them. With reference to the use or <lb/>
            application of his rules, he has given us works on discussion, <lb/>
             <pb n="192"/>
            on question, on disputation, on sophistical refutation, on <lb/>
            syllogism, and on things of that sort.</p>
          <p>He has also furnished us with a double criterion of truth. <lb/>
            One, on the perception of those effects, which are according <lb/>
            to imagination ; the other, the intelligence of those things <lb/>
            which are ethical, and which concern politics, and economy, <lb/>
            and laws. The chief good he has defined to be the exercise <lb/>
            of virtue in a perfect life. He used also to say, that happi- <lb/>
            ness was a thing made up of three kinds of goods. First of <lb/>
            all, the goods of the soul, which he also calls the principal <lb/>
            goods in respect of their power; secondly, the goods of the <lb/>
            body, such as health, strength, beauty, and things of <lb/>
            that sort; thirdly, external goods, such as wealth, nobility of <lb/>
            birth, glory, and things like those. And he taught that virtue <lb/>
            was not sufficient of itself to confer happiness; for that it <lb/>
            had need besides of the goods of the body, and of the <lb/>
            external goods, for that a wise mail would be miserable if he <lb/>
            were surrounded by distress, and poverty, and circumstances <lb/>
            of that kind. But, on the other hand, he said, that vice was <lb/>
            sufficient of itself to cause unhappiness, even if the goods of <lb/>
            the body and the external goods were present in the greatest <lb/>
            possible degree. He also asserted that the virtues did not <lb/>
            reciprocally follow one another, for that it was possible for a <lb/>
            prudent, and just, and impartial man, to be incontinent and <lb/>
            intemperate ; and he said, that the wise man was not des- <lb/>
            titute of passions, but endowed with moderate passions.</p>
          <p>He also used to define friendship as an equality of mutual <lb/>
            benevolence. And he divided it into the friendship of kindred, <lb/>
            and of love, and of those connected by ties of hospitality. <lb/>
            And he said, that love was divided into sensual and philo- <lb/>
            sophical love. And that the wise man would feel the influence <lb/>
            of love, and would occupy himself in affairs of state, and <lb/>
            would marry a wife, and would live with a king. And as <lb/>
            there were three kinds of life, the speculative, the practical, <lb/>
            and the voluptuous, he preferred the speculative. He also <lb/>
            considered the acquisition of general knowledge serviceable to <lb/>
            the acquisition of virtue. As a natural philosopher, he was <lb/>
            the most ingenious man that ever lived in tracing effects back <lb/>
            to, their causes, so that he could explain the principles of the <lb/>
            most trifling circumstances ; on which account he wrote a great <lb/>
            many books of commentaries on physical questions.</p><pb n="193"/>
            
          <p>He used to teach that God was incorporeal, as Plato also <lb/>
            asserted, and that his providence extends over all the heavenly <lb/>
            bodies; also, that he is incapable of motion. And that he <lb/>
            governs all things upon earth with reference to their sympathy <lb/>
            with the heavenly bodies. Another of his doctrines was, that <lb/>
            besides the four elements there is one other, making the fifth, <lb/>
            of which all the heavenly bodies are composed ; and that this <lb/>
            one possesses a motion peculiar to itself, for it is a circular <lb/>
            one. That the soul is incorporeal, being the first <foreign xml:lang="grc">έντελἐχεια</foreign>; <lb/>
            for it is the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐντελέχεια</foreign>, of a physical and organic body, having <lb/>
            an existence in consequence of a capacity for existence. And <lb/>
            this is, according to him, of a twofold nature. By the word <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐντελέχεια</foreign>, he means something which has an incoporeal species, <lb/>
            either in capacity, as a figure of Mercury in wax, which has a <lb/>
            capacity for assuming any shape; or a statue in brass; and so the <lb/>
            perfection of the Mercury or of the statue is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐντελέχεια</foreign>, <lb/>
            with reference to its habit. But when he speaks of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">έντε- <lb/>
            λέχεια</foreign>* of a natural body, he does so because, of bodies some are <lb/>
            wrought by the hands, as for instance, those which are made by <lb/>
            artists, for instance, a tower, or a ship ; and some exist by <lb/>
            nature, as the bodies of plants and animals. He has also <lb/>
            used the term with reference to an organic body, that is to <lb/>
            say, with reference to something that is made, as the faculty <lb/>
            of sight for seeing, or the faculty of hearing for the purpose of <lb/>
            hearing. The capacity of having life must exist in the thing <lb/>
            itself. But the capacity is twofold, either in habit or in <lb/>
            operation. In operation, as a man, when awake, is said to have <lb/>
            a soul; in habit, as the same is said of a man when asleep. <lb/>
            That, therefore, he may come under his definition, he has <lb/>
            added the word capacity.</p>
          <p>He has also given other definitions on a great many sub- <lb/>
            jects, which it would be tedious to enumerate here. For he <lb/>
            was in every thing a man of the greatest industry and inge- <lb/>
            nuity, as is plain from all his works which I have lately <lb/>
            given a list of; which are in number nearly four hundred, the <lb/>
            genuineness of which is undoubted. There are, also, a great <note type="footnote">* " <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐντελέχεια</foreign>, the actuality of a thing, as opposed to simple capability <lb/>
            or potentiality (ÔVVOJ-LU;); a philosophic word invented by Aristotle.- <lb/>
            .... quite distinct from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνδελέχεια</foreign>, though Cicero (Tusc. i. 10,) <lb/>
            confounded them."—L. &amp; S. in voc. </note> <note type="footnote"> 0 </note> <lb/>

            many other works attributed to him, and a number of apoph- <lb/>
            thegms which he never committed to paper.</p>
          <p>XIV. There were eight persons of the name of Aristotle. <lb/>
            First of all, the philosopher of whom we have been speaking; <lb/>
            the second was an Athenian statesman, some of whose forensic <lb/>
            orations, of great elegance, are still extant; the third was a <lb/>
            man who wrote a treatise on the Iliad ; the fourth, a Siciliot <lb/>
            orator, who wrote a reply to the Panegyric of Isocrates; the <lb/>
            fifth was the man who was surnamed Myth, a friend of <lb/>
            iEschines, the pupil of Socrates ; the sixth was a Cyrenean, <lb/>
            who wrote a treatise on Poetry; the seventh was a school- <lb/>
            master, who is mentioned by Aristoxenus in his Life of Plato ; <lb/>
            the eighth, was an obscure grammarian, to whom a treatise on <lb/>
            Pleonasm is attributed.</p>
          <p>XV. And the Stagirite had many friends, the most emi- <lb/>
            nent of whom was Theophrastus, whom we must proceed to <lb/>
            speak of.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF THEOPHRASTUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. THEOPHRASTUS was a native of Eresus, the son of Me. <lb/>
            lantas, a fuller, as we are told by Athenodorus in the eighth <lb/>
            book of his Philosophical Conversations.</p>
          <p>IT. He was originally a pupil of Leucippus, his fellow <lb/>
            citizen, in his own country; and subsequently, after having <lb/>
            attended the lectures of Plato, he went over to Aristotle. And <lb/>
            when he withdrew to Chalcis, he succeeded him as president <lb/>
            of his school, in the hundred and fourteenth olympiad.</p>
          <p>III. It is also said that a slave of his, by name Pomphylus, <lb/>
            was a philosopher, as we are told by Myronianus of Amastra, <lb/>
            in the first book of Similar Historical Chapters.</p>
          <p>IV. Theophrastus was a mail of great acuteness and in- <lb/>
            dustry, and, as Pamphila asserts in the thirty-second book of <lb/>
            his Commentaries, he was the tutor of Menandar, the comic <lb/>
            poet. He was also a most benevolent mail, and very affable.</p>
          <p>V. Accordingly, Cassander received him as a friend ; and <lb/>
            Ptolemy sent to invite him to his court. And he was thought <lb/>
            so very highly of at Athens, that when Agonides ventured to <lb/>
             <pb n="195"/>
            impeach him on a charge of impiety, he was very nearly fined <lb/>
            for his hardihood. And there thronged to his school a crowd <lb/>
            of disciples to the number of two thousand. In his letter to <lb/>
            Phanias, the Peripatetic, among other subjects he speaks of <lb/>
            the court of justice in the following terms : " It is not only <lb/>
            out of the question to find an assembly (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πανήγυϱις</foreign>), but it is <lb/>
            not easy to find even a company (&lt;rtjvtdg/ov) such as one would <lb/>
            like ; but yet recitations produce corrections of the judgment. <lb/>
            And my age does not allow me to put off everything and to feel <lb/>
            indifference on such a subject." In this letter he speaks of <lb/>
            himself as one who devotes his whole leisure to learning.</p>
          <p>And though he was of this disposition, he nevertheless went <lb/>
            away for a short time, both he and all the rest of the philo- <lb/>
            sophers, in consequence of Sophocles, the SOIl of Ampbi- <lb/>
            elides, having brought forward and carried a law that no one <lb/>
            of the philosophers should preside over a school unless the <lb/>
            council and the people had passed a resolution to sanction their <lb/>
            doing so, if they did, death was to be the penalty. But they <lb/>
            returned again the next year, when Philion had impeached <lb/>
            Sophocles for illegal conduct; when the Athenians abrogated <lb/>
            his law, and fined Sophocles five talents, and voted that the <lb/>
            philosophers should have leave to return, that Theophrastus <lb/>
            might return and preside over his school as before.</p>
          <p>VI. His name had originally been Tyrtanius, but Aristotle <lb/>
            changed it to Theophrastus, from the divine character of his <lb/>
            eloquence....</p>
          <p>VII. He is said also to have been very much attached to <lb/>
            Aristotle's son, Nicomachus, although he was his master; at <lb/>
            least, this is stated by Aristippus in the fourth book of his <lb/>
            treatise on the Ancient Luxury.</p>
          <p>VIII. It is also related that Aristotle used the same <lb/>
            expression about him and Callisthenes, which Plato, as I <lb/>
            have previously mentioned, employed about Xenocrates and <lb/>
            Aristotle himself. For he is reported to have said, since <lb/>
            Theophrastus was a mail of extraordinary acuteness, who <lb/>
            could both comprehend and explain everything, and as the <lb/>
            other was somewhat slow in his natural character, that Theo- <lb/>
            phrastus required a bridle, and Callisthenes a spur.</p>
          <p>IX. It is said, too, that he had a garden of his own after <note type="footnote"> * From <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεῖος</foreign> divine, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">θράσις</foreign> diction. </note> <note type="footnote"> o 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="196"/>
            the death of Aristotle, by the assistance of Demetrius Phale- <lb/>
            rius, who was an intimate friend of his.</p>
          <p>X. The following very practical apophthegms of his are <lb/>
            quoted. He used to say that it was better to trust to a horse <lb/>
            without a bridle than to a discourse without arrangement. <lb/>
            And once, when a man preserved a strict silence during the <lb/>
            whole of a banquet, he said to him, " If you are an ignorant <lb/>
            man. you are acting wisely ; but if you have had any education, <lb/>
            you are behaving like a fool." And a very favourite expression <lb/>
            of his was, that time was the most valuable thing that a man <lb/>
            could spend.</p>
          <p>XI. He died when he was of a great age, having lived <lb/>
            eighty-five years, when he had only rested from his labours a <lb/>
            short time. And we have composed the following epigram <lb/>
            on him:— <lb/>
            The proverb then is not completely false, <lb/>
            That wisdom's bow unbent is quickly broken ; <lb/>
            While Theophrastus laboured, he kept sound, <lb/>
            When he relaxed, he lost his strength and died.</p>
          <p>They say that on one occasion, when dying, he was asked by <lb/>
            his disciples whether he had any charge to give them ; and he <lb/>
            replied, that he had none but that they should " remember <lb/>
            that life holds out many pleasing deceits to us by the vanity <lb/>
            of glory; for that when we are beginning to live, then we are <lb/>
            dying. There is, therefore, nothing more profitless than am- <lb/>
            bition. But may you all be fortunate, and either abandon <lb/>
            philosophy (for it is a great labour), or else cling to it dili- <lb/>
            gently, for then the credit of it is great; but the vanities of <lb/>
            life exceed the advantage of it. However, it is not requisite <lb/>
            for me now to advise you what you should do; but do you <lb/>
            yourselves consider what line of conduct to adopt." And <lb/>
            when he had said this, as report goes, he expired. And the <lb/>
            Athenians accompanied him to the grave, on foot, with the <lb/>

            used to go about in a litter ; and that Hermippus states this, <lb/>

          <p>XIV. I have also found his will, which is drawn up in the <lb/>
            following terms :- <lb/>
            May things turn out well, but if anything should happen to <lb/>
            me, I make the following disposition of my property. I give <lb/>
            everything that I have in my house to Melantes and Pan- <lb/>
            creon, the sons of Leon. And those things which have been <lb/>
            given to me by Hipparchus, I wish to be disposed of in the <lb/>
            following manner :-First of all, I wish everything about the <lb/>
            Museum* and the statue of the goddesses to be made perfect, <lb/>
            and to be adorned in a still more beautiful manner than at <lb/>
            present, wherein there is room for improvement. Then I <lb/>
            desire the statue of Aristotle to be placed in the temple, and <lb/>
            all the other offerings which were in the temple before. Then <lb/>
            I desire the colonnade which used to be near the Museum to <lb/>
            be rebuilt in a manner not inferior to the previous one. I <lb/>
            also enjoin my executors to put up the tablets on which the <lb/>
            maps of the earth are drawn, in the lower colonnade, and to <lb/>
            take care that an altar is finished in such a manner that <lb/>
            nothing may be wanting to its perfectness or its beauty. I <lb/>
            also direct a statue of Nicomacbus, of equal size, to be erected <lb/>
            at the same time; and the price for making the statue has <lb/>
            been already paid to Praxiteles ; and he is to contribute what <lb/>
            is wanting for the expense. And I desire that it shall be placed <lb/>
            wherever it shall seem best to those who have the charge of pro- <lb/>
            viding for the execution of the other injunctions contained in <lb/>
            this will. And these are my orders respecting the temple <lb/>
            and the offerings. The estate which I have at Stagira, I give <lb/>
            to Callinus, and all my books I bequeath to Neleus. My <lb/>
            garden, and my promenade, and my houses which join the <lb/>
            garden, I give all of them to any of the friends whose names I <lb/>
            set down below, who choose to hold a school in them and to <lb/>
            devote themselves to the study of philosophy, since it is not <lb/>
            possible for any one to be always travelling, but I give them <lb/>
            on condition that they are not to alienate them, and that no <lb/>
            one is to claim them as his own private property ; but they <lb/>
            are to use them in common as if they were sacred ground, <lb/>
            sharing them with one another in a kindred and friendly <lb/>
            spirit, as is reasonable and just. And those who are to have <lb/>
            this joint property in them are Hipparchus, Neleus, Strato, Cal- <lb/>
            lenus, Demotimus, Demaratus, Callisthenes, Melantes, Pan- <note type="footnote"> * This waa a temple of the Muses which he had built for a school. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="201"/>
            creon, and Nicippus. And Aristotle, the son of Metrodorus <lb/>
            and Pythias, shall also be entitled to a share in this property, <lb/>
            if he likes to join these men in the study of philosophy. And <lb/>
            I beg the older men to pay great attention to his education <lb/>
            that he may be led on to philosophy as much as possible. I <lb/>
            also desire my executors to bury me in whatever part of the <lb/>
            garden shall appear most suitable, incurring no superfluous <lb/>
            expense about my funeral or monument. And, as has been <lb/>
            said before, after the proper honours have been paid to me, <lb/>
            and after provision has been made for the execution of my <lb/>
            will as far as relates to the temple, and the monument, and <lb/>
            the garden, and the promenade, then I enjoin that Pam- <lb/>
            phylus, who dwells in the garden, shall keep it and everything <lb/>
            else in the same condition as it has been in hitherto. And <lb/>
            those who are in possession of these things are to take care of <lb/>
            his interests. I further bequeath to Pamphylus and Threptes, <lb/>
            who have been some time emancipated, and who have been of <lb/>
            great service to me, besides all that they have previously re- <lb/>
            ceived from me, and all that they may have earned for them- <lb/>
            selves, and all that I have provided for being given them by <lb/>
            Hipparchus, two thousand drachmas, and I enjoin that they <lb/>
            should have them in firm and secure possession, as I have <lb/>
            often said to them, and to Melantes and Pancreon, and they <lb/>
            have agreed to provide for this my will taking effect. I also <lb/>
            give them the little handmaid Somatale ; and of my slaves, I <lb/>
            ratify the emancipation of Melon, and Cimon, and Parmenon <lb/>
            which I have already given them. And I hereby give their <lb/>
            liberty to Manes and Callias, who have remained four years <lb/>
            in the garden, and have worked in it, and have conducted <lb/>
            themselves in an unimpeachable manner. And I direct that <lb/>
            my executors shall give Pamphylus as much of my household <lb/>
            furniture as may seem to them to be proper, and shall sell the <lb/>
            rest. And I give Carton to Demotimus, and Donar to Neleus. <lb/>
            I order Eulius to be sold, and I request Hipparchus to give <lb/>
            Callinus three thousand drachmas. And if I had not seen <lb/>
            the great service that Hipparchus has been to me in former <lb/>
            times, and the embarrassed state of his affairs at present, I <lb/>
            should have associated Melantes and Pancreon with him in <lb/>
            these gifts. But as I see that it would not be easy for them <lb/>
            to arrange to manage the property together, I have thought <lb/>
            it likely to be more advantageous for them to receive a fixed <lb/>
             <pb n="202"/>
            sum from Hipparchus. Therefore, let Hipparchus pay to <lb/>
            Melantes and to Pancreon a talent a-piece; and let him <lb/>
            also pay to my executors the money necessary for the expenses <lb/>
            which I have here set down in my will, as it shall require <lb/>
            to be expended. And when he has done this, then I will <lb/>
            that he shall be discharged of all debts due from him to me <lb/>
            or to my estate. And if any profit shall accrue to him in <lb/>
            Chalcis, from property belonging to me, it shall be all his <lb/>
            own. My executors, for all the duties provided for in this <lb/>
            will, shall be Hipparchus, Neleus, Strato, Callinus, Demo- <lb/>
            timus, Callisthenes, and Ctesarchus. And this my will is <lb/>
            copied out, and all the copies are sealed with the seal-ring of <lb/>
            me, Theophrastus; one copy is in the hands of Hegesias the <lb/>
            son of Hipparchus; the witnesses thereto are Callippus of <lb/>
            Pallene, Philomelus of Euonymus, Lysander of Hybas, and <lb/>
            Philion of Alopece. Another copy is deposited with Olym- <lb/>
            piodorus, and the witnesses are the same. A third copy is <lb/>
            under the care of Adimantus, and it was conveyed to him by <lb/>
            Androsthenes, his son. The witnesses to that copy are Arim- <lb/>
            nestus the son of Cleobulus, Lysistratus of Thrasos, the son of <lb/>
            Phidon ; Strato of Lampsacus, the son of Arcesilaus; Thesip- <lb/>
            pus of Cerami, the son of Thesippus ; Dioscorides of the banks <lb/>
            of the Cephisus, the son of Dionysius.—This was his will.</p>
          <p>XV. Some writers have stated that Erasistratus, the phy- <lb/>
            sician, was a pupil of his ; and it is very likely.</p>

          <p>I. THEOPHRASTUS was succeeded in the presidency of his <lb/>
            school by Strato of Lampsacus, the son of Arcesilaus, of whom <lb/>
            he had made mention in his will.</p>
          <p>II. He was a man of great eminence, surnamed the Natural <lb/>
            Philosopher, from his surpassing all men in the dilligence <lb/>
            with which he applied himself to the investigation of matters <lb/>
            of that nature. i</p>
          <p>III. He was also the preceptor of Ptolemy Philadelphus, <lb/>
            and received from him, as it is said, eighty talents ; and he <lb/>
             <pb n="203"/>
            began to preside over the school, as Apollodorus tells us in <lb/>
            his Chronicles, in the hundred and twenty-third olympiad, <lb/>
            and continued in that post for eighteen years.</p>
          <p>IV. There are extant three books of his on Kingly Power; <lb/>
            three on Justice; three on the Gods ; three on Beginnings; <lb/>
            and one on each of the subjects of Happiness, Philosophy, <lb/>

            More and Less, on Injustice, on Former and Later, on the <lb/>
            Prior Genus, on Property, on the Future. There are, also, <lb/>
            two books called the Examination of Inventions; the Genu- <lb/>
            ineness of the Commentaries attributed to him, is doubted. <lb/>
            There is a volume of Epistles, which begins thus: " Strato <lb/>
            wishes Arsinoe prosperity."</p>
          <p>V. They say that he became so thin and weak, that he <lb/>
            died without its being perceived. And there is an epigram <lb/>
            of ours upon him in the following terms :— <lb/>
            The man was thin, believe me, from the use <lb/>
            Of frequent unguents; Strato was his name, <lb/>
            A citizen of Lampsaeus ; he struggled long <lb/>
            With fell disease, and died at last unnoticed.</p>
          <p>VI. There were eight people of the name of Strato. The <lb/>
            first was a pupil of Isocrates; the second was the man of <lb/>
            whom we have been speaking; the third was a physician, a <lb/>
            pupil of Erasistratus, or, as some assert, a foster-child of <lb/>
            his; the fourth was an historian, who wrote a history of the <lb/>
            Achievements of Philip and Perses in their wars against the <lb/>
            Romans The sixth was an epigrammatic poet; <lb/>
            the seventh was an ancient physician, as Aristotle tells us; <lb/>
            the eighth was a Peripatetic philosopher, who lived in Alex- <lb/>
            andria.</p>
          <p>VII. But the will, too, of this natural philosopher is extant, <lb/>
            and it is couched in the following language :—" If anything <lb/>
            happens to me, I make this disposition of my property. I <lb/>
             <pb n="204"/>
            leave all my property in my house to Lampyrion and Arce- <lb/>
            silaus; and with the money which I have at Athens, in the <lb/>
            first place, let my executors provide for my funeral and for all <lb/>
            other customary expenses ; without doing anything extravagant, <lb/>
            or, on the other hand, anything mean. And the following <lb/>
            shall be my executors, according to this my will: Olympichus, <lb/>
            Aristides. Innesigenes, Hippocrates, Epicrates, Gorgylus, <lb/>
            Diodes, Lycon, and Athanes, And my school I leave to <lb/>
            Lycon, since of the others some are too old, and others too <lb/>
            busy. And the rest will do well, if they ratify this arrange- <lb/>
            ment of mine. I also bequeath to him all my books, except <lb/>
            such as we have written ourselves; and all my furniture in <lb/>
            the dining-room, and the couches, and the drinking cups. <lb/>
            And let my executors give Epicrates five hundred drachmas, <lb/>
            and one of my slaves, according to the choice made by <lb/>
            Arcesilaus. And first of all, let Lampyrion and Arcesilaus <lb/>
            cancel the engagements which Daippus has entered into for <lb/>
            Iræus. And let him be acquitted of all obligation to Lampy- <lb/>
            rion or the heirs of Lampyrion; and let him also be dis- <lb/>
            charged from any bond or note of hand he may have given. <lb/>
            And let my executors give him five hundred drachmas of silver, <lb/>
            and one of my slaves, whichever Arcesilaus may approve, in <lb/>
            order that, as he has done me great service, and co-operated <lb/>
            with me in many things, he may have a competency, and be <lb/>
            enabled to live decently. And I give their freedom to Dio- <lb/>
            phantus, and Diodes, and Abus. Simias I give to Arcesilaus. <lb/>
            I also give his freedom to Dromo. And when Arcesilaus <lb/>
            arrives, let Iræus calculate with Olympicus and Epicrates, <lb/>
            and the rest of my executors, the amount that has been ex- <lb/>
            pended on my funeral and on other customary expenses. And <lb/>
            let the money that remains, be paid over to Arcesilaus by <lb/>
            Olympichus, who shall give him no trouble, as to the time or <lb/>
            manner of payment. And Arcesilaus shall discharge the <lb/>
            engagements which Strato has entered into with Olympichus <lb/>
            and Ausinias, which are preserved in writing in the care of <lb/>
            Philoreatos, the son of Tisamenus. And with respect to my <lb/>
            monument, let them do whatever seems good to Arcesilaus, <lb/>
            and Olympichus, and Lycon.</p>
          <p>This is his will, which is still extant, as Aristo, the Chian, <lb/>
            has collected and published it.</p>
          <p>VIII. And this Strato was a man, as has been shown above, <lb/>
             <pb n="205"/>
            of deservedly great popularity; having devoted himself to the <lb/>
            study of every kind of philosophy, and especially of that <lb/>
            branch of it called natural philosophy, which is one of the <lb/>
            most ancient and important branches of the whole.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF LYCON.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. HE was succeeded by Lycon, a native of the Troas, the <lb/>
            son of Astyanax, a man of great eloquence, and of especial <lb/>
            ability in the education of youth. For he used to say that <lb/>
            it was fit for boys to be harnessed with modesty and rivalry, <lb/>
            as much as for horses to be equipped with a spur and a bridle. <lb/>
            And his eloquence and energy in speaking is apparent, from <lb/>
            this instance. For he speaks of a virgin who was poor in the <lb/>
            following manner :—" A damsel, who, for want of a dowry, <lb/>
            goes beyond the seasonable age, is a heavy burden to her <lb/>
            father ; " on which acccount they say that Antigonus said with <lb/>
            reference to him, that the sweetness and beauty of an apple <lb/>
            could not be transferred to anything else, but that one might <lb/>
            see, in the case of this man, all these excellencies, in as great <lb/>
            perfection as on a tree; and he said this, because he was a <lb/>
            surpassingly sweet speaker. On which account, some people <lb/>
            prefixed a r to his name.* But as a writer, he was very <lb/>
            unequal to his reputation. And he used to jest in a <lb/>
            careless way, upon those who repented that they had not <lb/>
            learnt when they had the opportunity, and who now wished <lb/>
            that they had done so, saying, said that they were accusing <lb/>
            themselves, showing by a prayer which could not possibly be <lb/>
            accomplished, their misplaced repentance for their idleness. <lb/>
            He used also to say, that those who deliberated without coming <lb/>
            to a right conclusion, erred in their calculations, like men <lb/>
            who investigate a correct nature by an incorrect standard, or <lb/>
            who look at a face in disturbed water, or a distorted mirror. <lb/>
            Another of his saying was, that many men go in pursuit of <lb/>
            the crown to be won in the forum, but few or none seek to attain <lb/>
            the one to be gained at the Olympic games.</p>
          <p>II. And as he in many instances gave much advice to the <lb/>
            Athenians, he was of exceedingly great service to them. <note type="footnote"> * So as to make it appear connected with <foreign xml:lang="grc">γλυκὺς</foreign>, sweet. </note></p><pb n="206"/>
            
          <p>III. He was also a person of great neatness in his dress, <lb/>
            wearing garments of an unsurpassable delicacy, as we are <lb/>
            told by Hermippus. He was at the same time exceedingly <lb/>
            devoted to the exercises of the Gymnasium, and a man who <lb/>
            was always in excellent condition as to his body, displaying <lb/>
            every quality of an athlete (though Antigonus of Carystus, <lb/>
            pretends that he was bruised about the ears and dirty); and in <lb/>
            his own country he is said to have wrestled and played at ball <lb/>
            at the Iliæan games.</p>
          <p>IV. And he was exceedingly beloved by Eumenes and <lb/>
            Attalus, who made him great presents ; and Antigonus also <lb/>
            tried to seduce him to his court, but was disappointed. And <lb/>
            he was so great an enemy to Hieronymus the Peripatetic, <lb/>
            that he was the only person who would not go to see him on <lb/>
            the anniversary festival which he used to celebrate, and which <lb/>
            we have mentioned in our life of Arcesilaus.</p>
          <p>V. And he presided over his school forty-four years, as <lb/>
            Strato had left it to him in his will, in the hundred and <lb/>
            twenty-seventh olympiad.</p>
          <p>VI. He was also a pupil of Panthoides, the dialectician.</p>
          <p>VII. He died when he was seventy-four years of age, <lb/>
            having been a great sufferer with the gout, and there is an <lb/>
            epigram of ours upon him :- <lb/>
            Nor shall wise Lycon be forgotten, who <lb/>
            Died of the gout, and much I wonder at it. <lb/>
            For he who ne'er before could walk alone, <lb/>
            Went the long road to hell in a single night.</p>
          <p>VIII. There were several people of the name of Lycon. <lb/>
            The first was a Pythagorean ; the second was this mail of <lb/>
            whom we are speaking; the third was an epic poet; the <lb/>
            fourth was an epigrammatic poet.</p>
          <p>IX. I have fallen in with the following will of this philo- <lb/>
            sopher. " I make the following disposition of my property ; <lb/>
            if I am unable to withstand this disease :-All the property in <lb/>
            my house I leave to my brothers Astyanax and Lycon; and <lb/>
            I think that they ought to pay all that I owe at Athens, and <lb/>
            that I may have borrowed from any one, and also all the <lb/>
            expenses that may be incurred for my funeral, and for other <lb/>
            customary solemnities. And all that I have in in the city, or <lb/>
            in Ægina, I give to Lycon because he bears the same name <lb/>
             <pb n="207"/>
            that I do, and because he has spent the greater part of his <lb/>
            life with me, showing me the greatest affection, as it was fitting <lb/>
            that he should do, since he was in the place of a son to me. <lb/>
            And I leave my garden walk to those of my friends who like <lb/>
            to use it; to Bulon, and Callinus, and Ariston, and Amplicon, <lb/>
            and Lycon, and Python, and Aristomachus, and Heracleus, <lb/>
            and Lycomedes, and Lycon my nephew. And I desire that <lb/>
            they will elect as president him whom they think most likely <lb/>
            to remain attached to the pursuit of philosophy, and most <lb/>
            capable of holding the school together. And I entreat the <lb/>
            rest of my friends to acquiesce in their election, for my sake <lb/>
            and that of the place. And I desire that Bulon, and Callinus, <lb/>
            and the rest of my friends will manage my funeral and the <lb/>
            burning of my body, so that my obsequies may not be either <lb/>
            mean or extravagant. And the property which I have in <lb/>
            Ægina shall be divided by Lycon after my decease among the <lb/>
            young men there, for the purpose of anointing themselves, in <lb/>
            order that the memory of me and of him who honoured me, <lb/>
            and who showed his affection by useful presents, may be long <lb/>
            preserved. And let him erect a statue of me ; and as for the <lb/>
            place for it, I desire that Diophantus and Heraclides the soil <lb/>
            of Demetrius, shall select that, and take care that it be suitable <lb/>
            for the proposed erection. With the property that I have in the <lb/>
            city let Lycon pay all the people of whom I have borrowed any- <lb/>
            thing since his departure; and let Bulon and Callinus join him <lb/>
            in this, and also in discharging all the expenses incurred for <lb/>
            my funeral, and for all other customary solemnities, and let <lb/>
            him deduct the amount from the funds which I have left in <lb/>
            my house, and bequeathed to them both in common. Let him <lb/>
            also pay the physicians, Pasithemis and Medias, men who, <lb/>
            for their attention to me and for their skill, are very deserving <lb/>
            of still greater honour. And I give to the son of Callinus my <lb/>
            pair of Thericlean cups ; and to his wife I give my pair of <lb/>
            Rhodian cups, and my smooth carpet, and my double carpet, <lb/>
            and my curtains, and the two best pillows of all that I leave <lb/>
            behind me; so that as far as the compliment goes, I may be <lb/>
            seen not to have forgotten them. And with respect to those <lb/>
            who have been my servants, I make the following disposition : <lb/>
            -To Demetrius who has long been freed, I remit the price <lb/>
            of his freedom, and I further give five minæ, and a cloak, and <lb/>
            a tunic, that as he has a great deal of trouble about me, he <lb/>
             <pb n="208"/>
            may pass the rest of his life comfortably. To Criton, the <lb/>
            Chalcedonian, I also remit the price of his freedom, and I <lb/>
            further give him four minæ. Micras I hereby present with <lb/>
            his freedom ; and I desire Lycon to maintain him, and <lb/>
            instruct him for six years from the present time. I also give <lb/>
            his freedom to Chares, and desire Lycon to maintain him. <lb/>
            And I further give him two minæ, and all my books that are <lb/>
            published; but those which are not published, I give to <lb/>
            Callinus, that he may publish them with due care. I also <lb/>
            give to Syrus, whom I have already emancipated, four minæ, <lb/>
            and Menedora; and if he owes me anything I acquit him of <lb/>
            the debt. And I give to Hilaras four minæ, and a double <lb/>
            carpet, and two pillows, and a curtain, and any couch which <lb/>
            he chooses to select. I also hereby emancipate the mother of <lb/>
            Micras, and Noemon, and Dion, and Theon, and Euphranor, <lb/>
            and Hermeas; and I desire that Agathon shall have his <lb/>
            freedom when he has served two years longer; and that <lb/>
            Ophelion, and Poseideon, my litter-bearers, shall have theirs <lb/>
            when they have waited four years more. I also give to <lb/>
            Demetrius, and Criton, and Syrus, a couch a piece, and <lb/>
            coverlets from those which I leave behind me, according <lb/>
            to the selection which Lycon is hereby authorised to make. <lb/>
            And these are to be their rewards for having performed the <lb/>
            duties to which they were appointed well. Concerning my <lb/>
            burial, let Lycon do as he pleases, and bury me here or at <lb/>
            home, just as he likes ; for I am sure that he has the same <lb/>
            regard for propriety that I myself have. And I give all the <lb/>
            things herein mentioned, in the confidence that he will arrange <lb/>
            everything properly. The witnesses to this my will are <lb/>
            Callinus of Hermione, Ariston of Ceos, and Euphronius of <lb/>
            Pæania."</p>
          <p>As he then was thoroughly wise in everything relating to <lb/>
            education, and every branch of philosophy, he was no less <lb/>
            prudent and careful in the framing of his will. So that in <lb/>
            this respect to he deserves to be admired and imitated.</p><pb n="209"/>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF DEMETRIUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. DEMETRIUS was a native of Phalerus, and the son of <lb/>
            Phanostratus. He was a pupil of Theophrastus.</p>
          <p>II. And as a leader of the people at Athens he governed <lb/>
            the city for ten years, and was honoured with. three hundred <lb/>
            and sixty brazen statues, the greater part of which were <lb/>
            equestrian: and some were placed in carriages or in pair- <lb/>
            horse chariots, and the entire number were finished within <lb/>
            three hundred days, so great was the zeal with which they <lb/>
            were worked at. And Demetrius, the Magnesian, in his <lb/>
            treatise on People of the same Name, says that he began to be <lb/>
            the leader of the commonwealth, when Harpalus arrived in <lb/>
            i Athens, having fled from Alexander. And he governed his <lb/>
            country for a long time in a most admirable manner. For he <lb/>
            aggrandised the city by increased revenues and by new build- <lb/>
            ings, although he was a person of no distinction by birth.</p>
          <p>III. Though Pharorinus, in the first book of his Commen- <lb/>
            taries, asserts that he was of the family of Conon.</p>
          <p>IV. He lived with a citizen of noble birth, named Lamia, <lb/>
            as his mistress, as the same author tells us in his first book.</p>
          <p>V. Again, in his second book he tells us that Demetrius <lb/>
            was the slave of the debaucheries of Cleon.</p>
          <p>VI. Didymus, in his Banquets, says that he was called <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">χαϱιτοβλέφαϱος</foreign>, or Beautiful Eyed, and Lampeto, by some <lb/>
            courtesan.</p>
          <p>VII. It is said that he lost his eye-sight in Alexandria, and <lb/>
            recovered it again by the favour of Serapis; on which account <lb/>
            he composed the paeans which are sung and spoken of as his <lb/>
            composition to this day.</p>
          <p>VIII. He was held in the greatest honour among the Athe- <lb/>
            nians, but nevertheless, he found his fame darkened by envy, <lb/>
            which attacks every thing; for he was impeached by some <lb/>
            one on a capital charge, and as he did not appear, he was con <lb/>
            demned. His accusers, however, did not become masters of <lb/>
            his person, but expended their venom on the brass, tearing <lb/>
            down his statues and selling some and throwing others into <lb/>
            the sea, and some they cut up into chamber-pots. For even <lb/>
            this is stated. And one statue alone of him is preserved <note type="footnote">p </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="210"/>
            which is in the Acropolis. But Pharorinus in his Universal <lb/>
            History, says that the Athenians treated Demetrius in this <lb/>
            manner at the command of the king; and they also impeached <lb/>
            him as guilty of illegality in his administration, as Pharorinus <lb/>
            says. But Hermippus says, that after the death of Cassander, <lb/>
            he feared the enmity of Antigonus, and on that account fled <lb/>
            to Ptolemy Soter; and that he remained at his court for a <lb/>
            long time, and, among other pieces of advice, counselled the <lb/>
            king to make over the kingdom to his sons by Eurydice. <lb/>
            And as he would not agree to this measure, but gave the <lb/>
            crown to his son by Berenice, this latter, after the death of <lb/>
            his father, commanded Demetrius to be kept in prison until <lb/>
            he should come to some determination about him. And there <lb/>
            he remained in great despondency; and while asleep on one <lb/>
            occasion, he was bitten by an asp in the hand, and so he died. <lb/>
            And he is buried in the district of Busiris, near Diospolis, and <lb/>
            we have written the following epigram on him :— <lb/>
            An asp, whose tooth of venom dire was full, <lb/>
            Did kill the wise Demetrius. <lb/>
            The serpent beamed not light from out his eyes, " <lb/>
            But dark and lurid hell.</p>
          <p>But Heraclides, in his Epitome of the Successions of Sotion, <lb/>
            says that Ptolemy wished to transmit the kingdom to Phila- <lb/>
            delphus, and that Demetrius dissuaded him from doing so by <lb/>
            the argument, " If you give it to another, you will not have it <lb/>
            yourself." And when Menander, the comic poet, had an <lb/>
            information laid against him at Athens (for this is a state- <lb/>
            ment which I have heard), he was very nearly convicted, for <lb/>
            no other reason but that he was a friend of Demetrius. He <lb/>
            was, however, successfully defended by Telesphorus, the son- <lb/>
            in-law of Demetrius.</p>
          <p>IX. In the multitude of his writings and the number of <lb/>
            lines which they amount to, he exceeded nearly all the Peri- <lb/>
            patetics of his day, being a man of great learning and expe- <lb/>
            rience on every subject. And some of his writings are his- <lb/>
            torical, some political, some on poets, some rhetorical, some <lb/>
            also are speeches delivered in public assemblies or on em- <lb/>
            bassies ; there are also collections of Æsop's Fables, and many <lb/>
            other books. There are five volumes on the Legislation of, <lb/>
            Athens; two on Citizens of Athens; two on the Manage- <lb/>
             <pb n="211"/>
            ment of the People; two on Political Science; one on Laws; <lb/>
            two on Rhetoric; two on Military Affairs; two on the Iliad ; <lb/>
            four on the Odyssey ; one called the Ptolemy; one on Love ; <lb/>
            the Phaedondas, one; the Mædon, one; the Cleon, one; the <lb/>
            Socrates, one; the Artaxerxes, one; the Homeric, one; the <lb/>
            Aristides, one ; the Aristomachus, one ; the Exhortatory, one ; <lb/>
            one on the Constitution ; one on his Ten Years' Government; <lb/>
            one on the Ionians; one on Ambassadors; one on Good <lb/>
            Faith ; one on Gratitude ; one on Futurity; one on Greatness <lb/>
            of Soul; one on Marriage ; one on Opinion ; one on Peace; <lb/>
            one on Laws; one on Studies; one on Opportunity; the <lb/>
            Dionysius, one; the Chalcidean, one; the Maxims of the <lb/>
            Athenians, one; on'Antiphones, one ; a Historic Preface, one ; <lb/>
            one Volume of Letters ; one called an Assembly on Oath ; one <lb/>
            on Old Age; one on Justice ; one volume of Æsop's Fables ; <lb/>
            one of Apophthegms. His style is philosophical, combined <lb/>
            with the energy and impressiveness of an orator.</p>
          <p>X. When he was told that the Athenians had thrown down <lb/>
            his statues, he said, " But they have not thrown down my <lb/>
            virtues, on account of which they erected them." He used to <lb/>
            say that the eyebrows were not an insignificant part of a <lb/>
            man, for that they were able to overshadow the whole life. <lb/>
            Another of his sayings was that it was not Plutus alone who <lb/>
            was blind, but Fortune also, who acted as his guide. Another, <lb/>
            that reason had as much influence on government, as steel <lb/>
            had in war. On one occasion, when he saw a debauched young <lb/>
            man, he said, " There is a square Mercury with a long robe, <lb/>
            a belly, and a beard." It was a favourite saying of his, that <lb/>
            in the case of men elated with pride one ought to cut some- <lb/>
            thing off their height, and leave them their spirit. Another <lb/>
            of his apophthegms was, that at home young men ought to <lb/>
            show respect to their parents, and in the streets to every one <lb/>
            whom they met, and in solitary places to themselves. Another, <lb/>
            that friends ought to come to others in good fortune only <lb/>
            when invited, but to those in distress of their own accord.</p>
          <p>These are the chief sayings attributed to him.</p>
          <p>XI. There were twenty persons of the name of Demetrius, <lb/>
            of sufficient consideration to be entitled to mention. First, <lb/>
            a Chalcedonian, an orator, older than Thrasymachus; the <lb/>
            second, this person of whom we are speaking ; the third was a <lb/>
            Byzantine, a Peripatetic philosopher; the fourth was a man <note type="footnote"> p 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="212"/>
            surnamed Graphicus, a very eloquent lecturer, and also a <lb/>
            painter; the fifth was a native of Aspendus, a disciple of <lb/>
            Apollonius, of Soli; the sixth was a native of Colatia, who wrote <lb/>
            twenty books about Asia and Europe; the seventh was a <lb/>
            Byzantine, who wrote an account of the crossing of the Gauls <lb/>
            from Europe into Asia, in thirteen books, and the History of <lb/>
            Antiochus and Ptolemy, and their Administration of the <lb/>
            Affairs of Africa, in eight more; the eighth was a Sophist <lb/>
            who lived in Alexandria, and who wrote a treatise on Rheto- <lb/>
            rical Art; the ninth was a native of Adramyttium, a gram- <lb/>
            marian, who was nick-named Ixion, in allusion to some crime <lb/>
            he had committed against Juno; the tenth was a Cyrenean, <lb/>
            a grammarian, who was surnamed Stamnus,* a very distin- <lb/>
            guished man ; the eleventh was a Scepsian, a rich man of noble <lb/>
            birth, and of great eminence for learning. He it was who <lb/>
            advanced the fortunes of Metrodorus his fellow citizen ; the <lb/>
            twelfth was a grammarian of Euthyræ, who was made a citizen <lb/>
            of Lemnos ; the thirteenth was a Bythinian, a son of Diphilus <lb/>
            the Stoic, and a disciple of Pamotus of Rhodes ; the fourteenth <lb/>
            was an orator of Smyrna. All of these were prose writers. <lb/>
            The following were poets : -The first a poet of the Old <lb/>
            Comedy. The second an Epic poet, who has left nothing <lb/>
            behind him that has come down to us, except these lines <lb/>
            which he wrote against some envious people :— <lb/>
            -They disregard a man while still alive, <lb/>
            Whom, when he's dead, they honour ; cities proud, <lb/>
            And powerful nations, have with contest fierce, <lb/>
            Fought o'er a tomb and unsubtantial shade.</p>
          <p>The third was a native of Tarsus; a writer of Satires. The <lb/>
            fourth was a composer of Iambics, a bitter man. The fifth <lb/>
            was a statuary, who is mentioned by Polemo. The sixth was <lb/>
            a native of Erythræ, a man who wrote on various subjects, <lb/>
            and who composed volumes of histories and relations. <note type="footnote">* <foreign xml:lang="grc">σταμνος</foreign>, means an earthenware jar for wine. </note><note type="footnote"> t The foregoing account hardly does justice to Demetrius, who was <lb/>
            a man of real ability, and of a very different class to the generality of <lb/>
            those whom the ancients dignified with the title of philosophers. <lb/>
            was called Phalereus, to distinguish him from his contemporary Dem, <lb/>
            trius Poliorcetes. His administration of the affairs of Athens was <lb/>
            successful, that Cicero gives him the praise of having re-estahlished <lb/>
            the sinking and almost prostrate power of the republic. </note></p><pb n="213"/>
            
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF HERACLIDES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. HERACLIDES was the son of Euthyphron, and was born <lb/>
            at Heraclea, in Pontus; he was also a wealthy man.</p>
          <p>II. After he came to Athens, he was at first a disciple of <lb/>
            Speusippus, but he also attended the schools of the Pythago- <lb/>
            rean philosophers, and he adopted the principles of Plato ; <lb/>
            last of all he became a pupil of Aristotle, as we are told by <lb/>
            Sotion in his book entitled the Successions.</p>
          <p>III. He used to wear delicate garments, and was a man <lb/>
            of great size, so that he was nicknamed by the Athenians <lb/>
            Pompicus* instead of Ponticus. But he was of quiet manners <lb/>
            and noble aspect.</p>
          <p>IV. There are several books extant by him, which are <lb/>
            exceedingly good and admirable. They are in the form of <lb/>
            dialogue ; some being Ethical dialogues; three on the subject <lb/>
            of Justice ; one on Temperance ; five on Piety; one on Manly <lb/>
            Courage; one, and a second which is distinct from it, on <lb/>
            Virtue ; one on Happiness ; one on Supremacy ; one on Laws <lb/>
            and questions connected with them; one on Names; one <lb/>
            called Covenants ; one called The Unwilling Lover ; and the <lb/>
            Clinias. <note type="footnote"> (Cic. de Rep. ii. 1.) As an orator, he is spoken of by the same great <lb/>
            authority with the highest admiration. Cicero calls him " a subtle <lb/>
            disputer, not vehement, but very sweet, as a pupil of Theophrastus <lb/>
            might be expected to be." (de Off. i. 3). In another place he praises <lb/>
            him as possessed of great learning, and as one who " rather delighted <lb/>
            than inflamed the Athenians." (de Clay. Orat. § 37.) And says, <lb/>
            " that he was the first person who endeavoured to soften eloquence, <lb/>
            and who made it tender and gentle; preferring to appear sweet, as <lb/>
            indeed he was, rather than vehement." (Ibid § 38.) In another place <lb/>
            he says, " Demetrius Phalereus the most polished of all those orators " <lb/>
            (he has been mentioning Demosthenes, Hyperides, Lycurgus, AEschines, <lb/>
            and Dinarchus) " in my opinion." (de Orat. ii. 23.) And he praises <lb/>
            him for not confining his learning to the schools, but for bringing it <lb/>
            into daily use, and employing it as one of his ordinary weapons, (de Leg. <lb/>
            iii. 14.) And asks who can be found besides him who excelled in <lb/>
            both ways, so as to be pre-eminent at the same time as a scholar, and <lb/>
            a governor of a state. (Ibid.) He mentions his death in the oration <lb/>
            for Rabirius Postumus, § 9. He appears to have died about B.C. 282. </note> <note type="footnote"> * From <foreign xml:lang="grc">πομπὴ</foreign>, a procession. </note></p><pb n="214"/>
            
          <p>Of the physical dialogues, one is on the Mind ; one on <lb/>
            the Soul; one on the Soul, and Nature and Appearances; <lb/>
            one addressed to Democritus ; one on the Heavenly Bodies ; <lb/>
            one on the State of Things in the Shades below; two on <lb/>
            Lives ; one on the Causes of Diseases; one on the Good ; one <lb/>
            on the doctrines of Zeno ; one on the Doctrines of Metron.</p>
          <p>Of his grammatical dialogues, there are two on the Age of <lb/>
            Homer and Hesiod; two on Archilochus and Homer.</p>
          <p>There are some on Music too ; three on Euripides and <lb/>
            Sophocles, and two on Music. There are also two volumes, <lb/>
            Solutions of Questions concerning Homer; one on Specula- <lb/>
            tions ; one, the Three Tragedians ; one volume of Characters ; <lb/>
            one dialogue on Poetry and the Poets ; one on Conjecture ; <lb/>
            one on Foresight; four, being Explanations of Heraclitus ; one. <lb/>
            Explanations with reference to Democritus; two books of <lb/>
            Solutions of Disputed Points; one, the Axiom; one on <lb/>
            Species ; one book of Solutions; one of Suppositions ; one <lb/>
            addressed to Dionysius.</p>
          <p>Of rhetorical works, there is the dialogue on the being an <lb/>
            Orator, or the Protagoras.</p>
          <p>Of historical dialogues, there are some on the Pythagoreans, <lb/>
            and on Inventions. Of these, some he has drawn up after the <lb/>
            manner of Comic writers; as, for instance, the one about <lb/>
            Pleasure, and that about Temperance. And some in the style <lb/>
            of the Tragedians, as, for instance, the dialogues on the State <lb/>
            of Things in the Shades below; and one on Piety, and that <lb/>
            on Supremacy. And his style is a conversational and moderate <lb/>
            one, suited to the characters of philosophers and men occupied <lb/>
            in the military, or political affairs conversing together. Some <lb/>
            of his works also are on Geometry, and on Dialectics ; and in <lb/>
            all of them he displays a very varied and elevated style; and <lb/>
            he has great powers of persuasion.</p>
          <p>V. He appears to have delivered his country when it was <lb/>
            under the yoke of tyrants, by slaying the monarch, as Deme- <lb/>
            trius of Magnesia tells us, in his treatise on People of the <lb/>
            Same Name.</p>
          <p>VI. And he gives the following account of him. That he <lb/>
            brought up a young serpent, and kept it till it grew large; <lb/>
            and that when he was at the point of death, he desired one of <lb/>
            his faithful friends to hide his body, and to place the serpent <lb/>
            in" his bed, that he might appear to have migrated to the <lb/>
             <pb n="215"/>
            Gods. And all this was done ; and while the citizens were <lb/>
            all attending his funeral and extolling his character, the. <lb/>
            serpent hearing the noise, crept out of his clothes and threw <lb/>
            the multitude into confusion. And afterwards everything was <lb/>
            revealed, and Heraclides was seen, not as he hoped to have <lb/>
            been, but as he really was. And we have written an epigram <lb/>
            on him which runs thus :— <lb/>
            You wish'd, 0 Heraclide.?, when you died, <lb/>
            To leave a strange belief among mankind, <lb/>
            That you, when dead, a serpent had become. <lb/>
            But all your calculations were deceived, <lb/>
            For this your serpent was indeed a beast, <lb/>
            And you were thus discovered and pronounced another.</p>
          <p>And Hippobotus gives the same account.</p>
          <p>But Hermippus says that once, when a famine oppressed <lb/>
            the land, the people of Heraclea consulted the Pythian oracle <lb/>
            for the way to get rid of it; and that Heraclides corrupted <lb/>
            the ambassadors who were sent to consult the oracle, and also <lb/>
            the priestess, with bribes; and that she answered that they <lb/>
            would obtain a deliverance from their distresses, if Heraclides, <lb/>
            the son of Euthyphron, was presented by them with a golden <lb/>
            crown, and if when he was dead they paid him honours as a <lb/>
            hero. Accordingly, this answer was brought back from the <lb/>
            oracle to Heraclea, but they who brought it got no advantage <lb/>
            from it ; for as soon as Heraclides had been crowned in the <lb/>
            theatre, he was seized with apoplexy, and the ambassadors <lb/>
            who had been sent to consult the oracle were stoned, and so <lb/>
            put to death; and at the very same moment the Pythian <lb/>
            priestess was going down to the inner shrine, and while <lb/>
            standing there was bitten by a serpent, and died immediately. <lb/>
            This then is the account given of his death.</p>
          <p>VII. And Aristoxenus the musician says, that he composed <lb/>
            tragedies, and inscribed them with the name of Thespis. And <lb/>
            Chameleon says, that he stole essays from him on the subject <lb/>
            of Homer and Hesiod, and published them as his own. And <lb/>
            Aretodorus the Epicurean reproaches him, and contradicts <lb/>
            all the arguments which he advanced in his treatise on <lb/>
            Justice. Moreover, Dionysius. called the Deserter, or as some <lb/>
            say Spentharus, wrote a tragedy called Parthenopæus, and <lb/>
            forged the name of Sophocles to it. And Heraclides was so <lb/>
            much deceived that he took some passages out of one of, his <lb/>
             <pb n="216"/>
            works, and cited them as the words of Sophocles; and Diony- <lb/>
            sius, when he perceived it, gave him notice of the real truth ; <lb/>
            and as he would not believe it, and denied it, he sent him <lb/>
            word to examine the first letters of the first verses of the <lb/>
            book, and they formed the name of Panculus, who was a friend <lb/>
            of Dionysius. And as Heraclides still refused to believe it, <lb/>
            and said that it was possible that such a thing might happen <lb/>
            by chance, Dionysius sent him back word once more, " You <lb/>
            will find this passage too :— <lb/>
            " An aged monkey is not easily caught; <lb/>
            He's caught indeed, but only after a time."</p>
          <p>And he added, " Heraclides knows nothing of letters, and has <lb/>
            no shame."</p>
          <p>VIII. And there were fourteen persons of the name of <lb/>
            Heraclides. First, this man of whom we are speaking ; the <lb/>
            second was a fellow citizen of his, who composed songs for <lb/>
            Pyrrhic dances, and other trifles; the third was a native of <lb/>
            Cumæ, who wrote a history of the Persian war in five books ; <lb/>
            the fourth was also a citizen of Cumæ, who was an orator, and <lb/>
            wrote a treatise on his art; the fifth was a native of Calatia <lb/>
            or Alexandria, who wrote a Succession in six books, and a <lb/>
            treatise on Ships, from which he was called Lembos ; the <lb/>
            sixth was an Alexandrian, who wrote an account of the <lb/>
            peculiar habits of the Persians ; the seventh was a dialectician <lb/>
            of Bargyleia, who wrote against Epicurus; the eighth was a <lb/>
            physician, a pupil of Nisius; the ninth was a physician of <lb/>
            Tarentum, a man of great skill; the tenth was a poet, who <lb/>
            wrote Precepts ; the eleventh was a sculptor of Phocæa; the <lb/>
            twelfth was an Epigrammatic poet of considerable beauty; the <lb/>
            thirteenth was a Magnesian, who wrote a history of the reign <lb/>
            of Mithridates; the fourteenth was an astronomer, who wrote <lb/>
            a treatise on Astronomy. '</p><pb n="217"/>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF ANTISTHENES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. ANTISTHENES was an Athenian, the son of Antisthenes. <lb/>
            And he was said not to be a legitimate Athenian; in reference <lb/>
            to which he said to some one who was reproaching him with <lb/>
            the circumstance, " The mother of the Gods too is a Phry- <lb/>
            gian ;" for he was thought to have had a Thracian mother. <lb/>
            On which account, as he had borne himself bravely in the battle <lb/>
            of Tanagra, he gave occasion to Socrates to say that the son of <lb/>
            two Athenians could not have been so brave. And he himself, <lb/>
            when disparaging the Athenians who gave themselves great <lb/>
            airs as having been born out of the earth itself, said that <lb/>
            they were not more noble as far as that went than snails and <lb/>
            locusts.</p>
          <p>II. Originally he was a pupil of Gorgias the rhetorician ; <lb/>
            owing to which circumstance he employs the rhetorical style <lb/>
            of language in his Dialogues, especially in his Truth and in <lb/>
            his. Exhortations. And Hermippus says, that he had origi- <lb/>
            nally intended in his address at the assembly, on account of the <lb/>
            Isthmian games, to attack and also to praise the Athenians, <lb/>
            and Thebans, and Lacedsemonians ; but that he afterwards <lb/>
            abandoned the design, when he saw that there were a great <lb/>
            many spectators come from those cities. Afterwards, he <lb/>
            attached himself to Socrates, and made such progress in <lb/>
            philosophy while with him, that he advised all his own pupils <lb/>
            to become his fellow pupils in the school of Socrates. And as <lb/>
            he lived in the Piræus, he went up forty furlongs to the city <lb/>
            every day, in order to hear Socrates, from whom he learnt the <lb/>
            art of enduring, and of being indifferent to external circum- <lb/>
            stances, and so became the original founder of the Cynic <lb/>
            school.</p>
          <p>III. And he used to argue that labour was a good thing, by <lb/>
            adducing the examples of the great Hercules, and of Cyrus, <lb/>
            one of which he derived from the Greeks and the other from <lb/>
            the barbarians.</p>
          <p>IV. He was also the first person who ever gave a definition <lb/>
            of discourse, saying, " Discourse is that which shows what <lb/>
             <pb n="218"/>
            anything is or was." And he used continually to say, " I <lb/>
            would rather go mad than feel pleasure." And, " One ought <lb/>
            to attach one's self to such women as will thank one for it." <lb/>
            He said once to a youth from Pontus, who was on the point <lb/>
            of coming to him to be his pupil, and was asking him what <lb/>
            things he wanted, " You want a new book, and a new pen, <lb/>
            and a new tablet;"—meaning a new mind. And to a person <lb/>
            who asked him from what country he had better marry a <lb/>
            wife, he said, " If you marry a handsome woman, she will be <lb/>
            common ;* if an ugly woman, she will he a punishment to you." <lb/>
            He was told once that Plato spoke ill of him, and he replied, <lb/>
            " It is a royal privilege to do well, and to be evil spoken of." <lb/>
            When he was being initiated into the mysteries of Orpheus, <lb/>
            and the priest said that those who were initiated enjoyed <lb/>
            many good things in the shades below, " Why, then," said he <lb/>
            " do not you die ?" Being once reproached as not being the <lb/>
            son of two free citizens, he said, " And I am not the son of <lb/>
            two people skilled in wrestling; nevertheless, I am a skilful <lb/>
            wrestler." On one occasion he was asked why he had but few <lb/>
            disciples, and said, " Because I drove them away with a silver <lb/>
            rod." When he was asked why he reproved his pupils <lb/>
            with bitter language, he said, " Physicians too use severe <lb/>
            remedies for their patients." Once he saw an adulterer run- <lb/>
            ning away, and said, " 0 unhappy man ! how much danger <lb/>
            could you have avoided for one obol!" He used to say, as <lb/>
            Hecaton tells us in his Apophthegms, " That it was better to <lb/>
            fall among crows,† than among flatterers ; for that they only <lb/>
            devour the dead, but the others devour the living." When <lb/>
            he was asked what was the most happy event that could take <lb/>
            place in human life, he said, " To die while prosperous."</p>
          <p>On one occasion one of his friends was lamenting to him <lb/>
            that he had lost his memoranda, and he said to him, " You <lb/>
            ought to have written them on your mind, and not on paper." <lb/>
            A favourite saying of his was, " That envious people were <lb/>
            devoured by their own disposition, just as iron is by rust." <lb/>
            Another was, " That those who wish to be immortal ought to <lb/>
            live piously and justly." He used to say too, " That cities <note type="footnote"> * There is a play on the similarity of the two sounds, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κοινὴ</foreign>, common, <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποίνη</foreign>, punishment. </note><note type="footnote"> t The Greek is, if; <foreign xml:lang="grc">κόϱακας</foreign>, which was a proverb for utter destruc- <lb/>
            tion. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="219"/>
            were ruined when they were unable to distinguish worthless <lb/>
            citizens from virtuous ones."</p>
          <p>On one occasion he was being praised by some wicked men, <lb/>
            and said, " I am sadly afraid that I must have done some wicked <lb/>
            thing." One of his favourite sayings was, " That the fellow- <lb/>
            ship of brothers of one mind was stronger than any fortified <lb/>
            city." He used to say, " That those things were the best for <lb/>
            a man to take on a journey, which would float with him if he <lb/>
            were shipwrecked." He was once reproached for being <lb/>
            intimate with wicked men, and said, " Physicians also live <lb/>
            with those who are sick ; and yet they do not catch fevers." <lb/>
            He used to say, " that it was an absurd thing to clean a corn- <lb/>
            field of tares, and in war to get rid of bad soldiers, and yet not <lb/>
            to rid one's self in a city of the wicked citizens." When he <lb/>
            was asked what advantage he had ever derived from philo- <lb/>
            sophy, he replied, " The advantage of being able to converse <lb/>
            with myself." At a drinking party, a man once said to him, <lb/>
            " Give us a song," and he replied, " Do you play us a tune <lb/>
            on the flute." When Diogenes asked him for a tunic, he <lb/>
            bade him fold his cloak. He was asked on one occasion what <lb/>
            learning was the most necessary, and he replied, " To unlearn <lb/>
            one's bad habits." And he used to exhort those who found <lb/>
            themselves ill spoken of, to endure it more than they would <lb/>
            any one's throwing stones at them. He used to laugh at Plato <lb/>
            as conceited ; accordingly, once when there was a fine proces- <lb/>
            sion, seeing a horse neighing, he said to Plato, " I think you <lb/>
            too would be a very frisky horse :" and he said this all the <lb/>
            more, because Plato kept continually praising the horse. At <lb/>
            another time, he had gone to see him when he was ill, and <lb/>
            when he saw there a dish in which Plato had been sick, he <lb/>
            said, " I see your bile there, but I do not see your conceit." <lb/>
            He used to advise the Athenians to pass a vote that asses <lb/>
            were horses ; and, as they thought that irrational, he said, <lb/>
            " Why, those whom you make generals have never learnt to be <lb/>
            really generals, they have only been voted such."</p>
          <p>A man said to him one day, " Many people praise you." <lb/>
            " Why, what evil," said he, " have I done ?" When he turned <lb/>
            the rent in his cloak outside, Socrates seeing it, said to him, <lb/>
            " I see your vanity through the hole in your cloak." On <lb/>
            another occasion, the question was put to him by some one, <lb/>
            as Phanias relates, in his treatise on the Philosphers of the, <lb/>
             <pb n="220"/>
            Socratic school, what a man could do to show himself an <lb/>
            honourable and a virtuous man; and he replied, " If you <lb/>
            atttend to those who understand the subject, and learn from <lb/>
            them that you ought to shun the bad habits which you have." <lb/>
            Some one was praising luxury in his hearing, and he said, <lb/>
            " May the children of my enemies be luxurious." Seeing a <lb/>
            young man place himself in a carefully studied attitude <lb/>
            before a modeller, he said, "Tell me, if the brass could speak, <lb/>
            on what would it pride itself?" And when the young man <lb/>
            replied, " On its beauty." " Are you not then," said he, <lb/>
            " ashamed to rejoice in the same thing as an inanimate piece <lb/>
            of brass?" A young man from Pontus once promised to <lb/>
            recollect him, if a vessel of salt fish arrived ; and so he took <lb/>
            him with him, and also an empty bag, and went to a woman <lb/>
            who sold meal, and filled his sack and went away; and when <lb/>
            the woman asked him to pay for it, he said, "The young man <lb/>
            will pay you, when the vessel of salt fish comes home."</p>
          <p>He it was who appears to have been the cause of Anytus's <lb/>
            banishment, and of Meletus's death. For having met with <lb/>
            some young men of Pontus, who had come to Athens, on <lb/>
            account of the reputation of Socrates, he took them to <lb/>
            Anytus, telling them, that in moral philosophy he was <lb/>
            wiser than Socrates; and they who stood by were indignant <lb/>
            at this, and drove him away. And whenever he saw a <lb/>
            woman beautifully adorned, he would go off to her house, <lb/>
            and desire her husband to bring forth his horse and his arms; <lb/>
            and then if he had such things, he would give him leave to <lb/>
            indulge in luxury, for that he had the means of defending <lb/>
            himself; but if he had them not, then he would bid him strip <lb/>
            his wife of her ornaments.</p>
          <p>V. And the doctrines he adopted were these. He used to <lb/>
            insist that virtue was a thing which might be taught; also. <lb/>
            that the nobly born and virtuously disposed, were the same <lb/>
            people ; for that virtue was of itself sufficient for happiness. <lb/>
            and was in need of nothing, except the strength of Socrates. <lb/>
            He also looked upon virtue as a species of work, not wanting <lb/>
            many arguments, or much instruction; and he taught that <lb/>
            the wise man was sufficient for himself; for that everything <lb/>
            that belonged to any one else belonged to him. He con- <lb/>
            sidered obscurity of fame a good thing, and equally good with <lb/>
            labour. And he used to say that the wise man would regu- <lb/>
             <pb n="221"/>
            late his conduct as a citizen, not according to the established <lb/>
            laws of the state, but according to the law of virtue. And <lb/>
            that he would marry for the sake of having children, selecting <lb/>
            the most beautiful woman for his wife. And that he would <lb/>
            love her; for that the wise man alone knew what objects <lb/>
            deserved love.</p>
          <p>Diodes also attributes the following apophthegms to him. <lb/>
            To the wise man, nothing is strange and nothing remote. <lb/>
            The virtuous man is worthy to be loved. Good men are <lb/>
            friends. It is right to make the brave and just one's allies. <lb/>
            Virtue is a weapon of which a man cannot be deprived. It <lb/>
            is better to fight with a few good men against all the wicked, <lb/>
            than with many wicked men against a few good men. One <lb/>
            should attend to one's enemies, for they are the first persons <lb/>
            to detect one's errors. One should consider a just man as <lb/>
            of more value than a relation. Virtue is the same in a man <lb/>
            as in a woman. What is good is honourable, and what is <lb/>
            bad is disgraceful. Think everything that is wicked, foreign. <lb/>
            Prudence is the safest fortification; for it can neither fall <lb/>
            to pieces nor be betrayed. One must prepare one's self a <lb/>
            fortress in one's own impregnable thoughts.</p>
          <p>VI. He used to lecture in the Gymnasium, called Cyno- <lb/>
            sarges, not far from the gates; and some people say that it <lb/>
            is from that place that the sect got the name of Cynics. <lb/>
            And he himself was called Haplocyon (downright dog).</p>
          <p>VII. He was the first person to set the fashion of doubling <lb/>
            his cloak, as Diodes says, and he wore no other garment. <lb/>
            And he used to carry a stick and a wallet; but Neanthes says <lb/>
            that he was the first person who wore a cloak without <lb/>
            folding it. But Sosicrates, in the third book of his Succes- <lb/>
            sions, says that Diodorus, of Aspendos, let his beard grow, <lb/>
            and used to carry a stick and a wallet.</p>
          <p>VIII. He is the only one of all the pupils of Socrates, <lb/>
            whom Theopompus praises and speaks of as clever, and able <lb/>
            to persuade whomsoever he pleased by the sweetness of his <lb/>
            conversation. And this is plain, both from his own writings, <lb/>
            and from the Banquet of Xenophon. He appears to have <lb/>
            been the founder of the more manly Stoic school; on which <lb/>
            account Athenæus, the epigrammatist, speaks thus of them :- <lb/>
            0 ye, who learned are in Stoic fables, <lb/>
            Ye who consign the wisest of all doctrines <lb/>
             <pb n="222"/>
            To your most sacred books; you say that virtue <lb/>
            Is the sole good; for that alone can save <lb/>
            The life of man, and strongly fenced cities. <lb/>
            But if some fancy pleasure their best aim, <lb/>
            One of the Muses 'tis who has convinc'd them.</p>
          <p>He was the original cause of the apathy of Diogenes, and <lb/>
            the temperance of Crates, and the patience of Zeno, having <lb/>
            himself, as it were, laid the foundations of the city which they <lb/>
            afterwards built. And Xenophon says, that in his conver- <lb/>
            sation and society, he was the most delightful of men, and <lb/>
            in every respect the most temperate.</p>
          <p>IX. There are ten volumes of his writings extant. The first <lb/>
            volume is that in which there is the essay on Style, or on Figures <lb/>
            of Speech; the Ajax, or speech of Ajax; the Defence, of Orestes <lb/>
            or the treatise on Lawyers; the Isographe, or the Lysias <lb/>
            and Isocrates ; the reply to the work of Isocrates, entitled <lb/>
            the Absence of Witnesses. The second volume is that in <lb/>
            which we have the treatise on the Nature of Animals; on <lb/>
            the Pro-creation of Children, or on Marriage, an essay of an <lb/>
            amatory character; on the Sophists, an essay of a physiogno- <lb/>
            mical character; on Justice, and Manly Virtue, being three <lb/>
            essays of an hortatory character ; two treatises on Theognis. <lb/>
            The third volume contains a treatise on the Good ; on Manly <lb/>
            Courage; on Law, or Political Constitutions; on Law, or <lb/>
            what is Honourable and Just; on Freedom and Slavery; <lb/>
            on Good Faith; on a Guardian, or on Persuasion; on Victory, <lb/>
            an economical essay. The fourth volume contains the Cyrus ; <lb/>
            the Greater Heracles, or a treatise on Strength. The fifth <lb/>
            volume contains the Cyrus, or a treatise on Kingly Power; <lb/>
            the Aspasia.</p>
          <p>The sixth volume is that in which there is the treatise <lb/>
            Truth; another (a disputatious one) concerning Arguing; <lb/>
            the Sathon, or on Contradiction, in three parts; and an <lb/>
            essay on Dialect. The seventh contains a treatise on Educa- <lb/>
            tion, or Names, in five books ; one on the Use of Names, or <lb/>
            the Contentious Man; one on Questions and Answers ; one <lb/>
            on Opinion and Knowledge, in four books; one on Dying; <lb/>
            one on Life and Death ; one on those who are in the Shades <lb/>
            below; one on Nature, in two books; two books of Questions <lb/>
            in Natural Philosophy; one essay, called Opinions on the <lb/>
            Contentious Man; one book of Problems, on the subject of <lb/>
             <pb n="223"/>
            Learning. The eighth volume is that in which we find a <lb/>
            treatise on Music; one on Interpreters; one on Homer; one <lb/>
            on Injustice and Impiety; one on Calchas; one on a Spy; <lb/>
            one on Pleasure. The ninth book contains an essay on the <lb/>
            Odyssey; one on the Magic Wand ; the Minerva, or an essay <lb/>
            on Telemachus; an essay on Helen and Penelope; one on <lb/>
            Proteus; the Cyclops, being an essay on Ulysses ; an essay <lb/>
            on the Use of Wine, or Oil Drunkenness, or on the Cyclops; one <lb/>
            on Circe ; one on Amphiaraus ; one on Ulysses and Penelope, <lb/>
            and also on Ulysses' Dog. The tenth volume is occupied by <lb/>
            the Heracles, or Medas; the Hercules, or an Essay on <lb/>
            Prudence or Strength; the Lord or the Lover; the Lord or <lb/>
            the Spies; the Menexenus, or an essay on Governing; the <lb/>
            Alcibiades ; the Archelaus, or an essay on Kingly Power.</p>
          <p>These then are the names of his works. And Timon, <lb/>
            rebuking him because of their great number, called him a <lb/>
            universal chatterer.</p>
          <p>X. He died of some disease ; and while he was ill Diogenes <lb/>
            came to visit him, and said to him, "Have you no need of a <lb/>
            friend ?" Once too he came to see him with a sword in his <lb/>
            hand ; and when Antisthenes said, " Who can deliver me <lb/>
            from this suffering?" he, pointing to the sword, said, "This <lb/>
            can;" But he rejoined, " I said from suffering,, but not from <lb/>
            life ;" for he seemed to bear his disease the more calmly <lb/>
            from his love of life. And there is an epigram on him written <lb/>
            by ourselves, which runs thus :— <lb/>
            In life you were a bitter dog, Antisthenes, <lb/>
            Born to bite people's minds with sayings sharp, <lb/>
            Not with your actual teeth. Now you are slain <lb/>
            By fell consumption, passers by may say, <lb/>
            Why should he not; one wants a guide to Hell.</p>
          <p>There were also three other people of the name of <lb/>
            Antisthenes. One, a disciple of Heraclitus; the second, an <lb/>
            Ephesian; the third, a historian of Rhodes. And since we <lb/>
            have spoken of those who proceeded from the school of <lb/>
            Aristippus and Phædon, we may now go on to the Cynics <lb/>
            and Stoics, who derived their origin from Antisthenes. And <lb/>
            we will take them in the following order.</p><pb n="224"/>
            
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF DIOGENES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. DIOGENES was a native of Sinope, the son of Tresius, a <lb/>
            money-changer. And Diodes says that he was forced to <lb/>
            flee from his native city, as his father kept the public bank <lb/>
            there, and had adulterated the coinage. But Eubulides, in his <lb/>
            essay on Diogenes, says, that it was Diogenes himself who <lb/>
            did this. and that he was banished with his father. And, <lb/>
            indeed, he himself, in his Perdalus, says of himself that he <lb/>
            had adulterated the public money. Others say that he was one <lb/>
            of the curators, and was persuaded by the artisans employed, <lb/>
            and that he went to Delphi, or else to the oracle at Delos, <lb/>
            and there consulted Apollo as to whether he should do what <lb/>
            people were trying to persuade him to do ; and that, as the <lb/>
            God gave him permission to do so, Diogenes, not comprehend- <lb/>
            ing that the God meant that he might change the political <lb/>
            customs* of his country if he could, adulterated the coinage; <lb/>
            and being detected, was banished, as some people say, but as <lb/>
            other accounts have it, took the alarm and fled away of his own. <lb/>
            accord. Some again, say that he adulterated the money which <lb/>
            he had received from his father ; and that his father was <lb/>
            thrown into prison and died there ; but that Diogenes escaped <lb/>
            and went to Delphi, and asked, not whether he might tamper <lb/>
            with the coinage, but what he could do to become very <lb/>
            celebrated, and that in consequence he received the oracular <lb/>
            answer which I have mentioned.</p>
          <p>II. And when he came to Athens he attached himself to <lb/>
            Antisthenes ; but as he repelled him, because he admitted no <lb/>
            one ; he at last forced his way to him by his pertinacity. And <lb/>
            once, when he raised his stick at him, he put his head under <lb/>
            it, and said, " Strike, for you will not find any stick hard <lb/>
            enough to drive me away as long as you continue to speak." <lb/>
            And from this time forth he was one of his pupils; and being <lb/>
            an exile, he naturally betook himself to a simple mode of life.</p>
          <p>III. And when, as Theopbrastus tells us, in his Megaric <lb/>
            Philosopher, he saw a mouse running about and not seeking <note type="footnote"> * Tie passage is not free from difficulty; but the thing which misled <lb/>
            Diogenes appears to have been that <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμισμα</foreign>, the word here used, meant <lb/>
            both " a coin, or coinage," and " a custom." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="225"/>
            for a bed, nor taking care to keep in the dark, nor looking for <lb/>
            any of those things which appear enjoyable to such an animal, <lb/>
            he found a remedy for his own poverty. He was, according -to <lb/>
            the account of some people, the first person who doubled up <lb/>
            his cloak out of necessity, and who slept in it; and who carried <lb/>
            a wallet, in which he kept his food ; and who used whatever <lb/>
            place was near for all sorts of purposes, eating, and sleeping, <lb/>
            and conversing in it. In reference to which habit he used to <lb/>
            say, pointing to the Colonnade of Jupiter, and to the Public <lb/>
            Magazine, 11 that the Athenians had built him places to live <lb/>
            in." Being attacked with illness, he supported himself with <lb/>
            a staff; and after that he carried it continually, not indeed in <lb/>
            the city, but whenever he was walking in the roads, together <lb/>
            with his wallet, as Olympiodorus, the chief man of the <lb/>
            Athenians tells us; and Polymeter, the orator, and Lysanias, <lb/>
            the son of Æschorion, tell the same story.</p>
          <p>When he had written to some one to look out and get <lb/>
            ready a small house for him, as he delayed to do it, he took a <lb/>
            cask which he found in the Temple of Cybele, for his house, <lb/>
            as he himself tells us in his letters. And during the summer <lb/>
            he used to roll himself in the warm sand, but in winter he <lb/>
            would embrace statues all covered with snow, practising him- <lb/>
            self, on every occasion, to endure anything.</p>
          <p>IV. He was very violent in expressing his haughty disdain <lb/>
            of others. He said that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">σχολὴ</foreign> (school) of Euclides was <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">χολὴ</foreign> (gall). And he used to call Plato's <foreign xml:lang="grc">διατϱιβὴ</foreign> (discussions) <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰατατϱιβὴ</foreign> (disguise). It was also a saying of his that the <lb/>
            Dionysian games were a great marvel to fools ; and that the <lb/>
            demagogues were the ministers of the multitude. He used <lb/>
            likewise to say, " that when in the course of his life he beheld <lb/>
            pilots, and physicians, and philosophers, he thought man the <lb/>
            wisest of all animals ; but when again he beheld interpreters <lb/>
            of dreams, and soothsayers, and those who listened to them. <lb/>
            and men puffed up with glory or riches, then he thought <lb/>
            that there was not a more foolish animal than man." Another <lb/>
            of his sayings was, " that he thought a man ought oftener to <lb/>
            provide himself with a reason than with a halter." On one <lb/>
            occasion, when he noticed Plato at a very costly entertainment <lb/>
            tasting some olives, he said, " 0 you wise man ! why, after <lb/>
            having sailed to Sicily for the sake of such a feast, do you not <lb/>
            now enjoy what you have before you?" And Plato replied, <note type="footnote"> Q </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="226"/>
            " By the Gods, Diogenes, while I was there I ate olives and <lb/>
            all such things a great deal." Diogenes rejoined, " What then <lb/>
            did you want to sail to Syracuse for ? Did not Attica at that <lb/>
            time produce any olives ?" But Phavorinus, in his Universal <lb/>
            History, tells this story of Aristippus. At another time he <lb/>
            was eating dried figs, when Plato met him, and he said to him, <lb/>
            " You may have a share of these and as he took some and <lb/>
            ate them, he said, " I said that you might have a share of <lb/>
            them, not that you might eat them all." On one occasion <lb/>
            Plato had invited some friends who had come to him from <lb/>
            Dionysius to a banquet, and Diogenes trampled on his carpets, <lb/>
            and said, " Thus I trample on the empty pride of Plato <lb/>
            and Plato made him answer, " How much arrogance are you <lb/>
            displaying, 0 Diogenes ! when you think that you are not <lb/>
            arrogant at all." But, as others tell the story, Diogenes said, <lb/>
            " Thus I trample on the pride of Plato;" and that Plato <lb/>
            rejoined, 11 With quite as much pride yourself, 0 Diogenes." <lb/>
            Sotion too, in his fourth book, states, that the Cynic made the <lb/>
            following speech to Plato : Diogenes once asked him for some <lb/>
            wine, and then for some dried figs; so he sent him an entire <lb/>
            jar full ; and Diogenes said to him, " Will you, if you are <lb/>
            asked how many two and two make, answer twenty ? In this <lb/>
            way, you neither give with any reference to what you are asked <lb/>
            for, nor do you answer with reference to the question put to <lb/>
            you." He used also to ridicule him as an interminable talker. <lb/>
            When he was asked where in Greece he saw virtuous men ; <lb/>
            "Men," said lie, "nowhere ; but I see good boys in Lacedæ- <lb/>
            mon." On one occasion, when no one came to listen to him <lb/>
            while he was discoursing seriously, he began to whistle. And <lb/>
            then when people flocked round him, he reproached them for <lb/>
            coming with eagerness to folly, but being lazy and indiffer- <lb/>
            ent about good things. One of his frequent sayings was, <lb/>
            " That men contended with one another in punching and <lb/>
            kicking, but that no one showed any emulation in the <lb/>
            pursuit of virtue." He used to express his astonishment at the <lb/>
            grammarians for being desirous to learn everything about the <lb/>
            misfortunes of Ulysses, and being ignorant of their own. He <lb/>
            used also to say, " That the musicians fitted the strings to the <lb/>
            lyre properly, but left all the habits of their soul ill-arranged." <lb/>
            And, " That mathematicians kept their eyes fixed on the sun <lb/>
            and moon, and overlooked what was under their feet." "That <lb/>
             <pb n="227"/>
            orators were anxious to speak justly, but not at all about <lb/>
            acting so." Also, " That misers blamed money. but were <lb/>
            preposterously fond of it." He often condemned those who <lb/>
            praise the just for being superior to money, but who at the <lb/>
            same time are eager themselves for great riches. He was also <lb/>
            very indignant at seeing men sacrifice to the Gods to procure <lb/>
            good health, and yet at the sacrifice eating in a manner <lb/>
            injurious to health. He often expressed his surprise at slaves, <lb/>
            who, seeing their masters eating in a gluttonous manner, still <lb/>
            do not themselves lay hands on any of the eatables. He <lb/>
            would frequently praise those who were about to marry, and <lb/>
            yet did not marry ; or who were about to take a voyage, and <lb/>
            yet did not take a voyage; or who were about to engage in <lb/>
            affairs of state, and did not do so; and those who were <lb/>
            about to rear children, yet did not rear any; and those who <lb/>
            were preparing to take up their abode with princes, and <lb/>
            yet did not take it up. One of his sayings was, ' That one <lb/>
            ought to hold out one's hand to a friend without closing the <lb/>
            fingers. "</p>
          <p>Hermippus, in his Sale of Diogenes, says that he was <lb/>
            taken prisoner and put up to be sold, and asked what he <lb/>
            could do; and he answered, " Govern men." And so he <lb/>
            bade the crier " give notice that if any one wants to purchase <lb/>
            a master, there is one here for him." When he was ordered <lb/>
            not to sit down ; " It makes no difference," said he, " for fish <lb/>
            are sold, be where they may." He used to say, that he <lb/>
            wondered at men always ringing a dish or jar before buying <lb/>
            it, but being content to judge of a man by his look alone. <lb/>
            When Xeniades bought him, he said to him that he ought to <lb/>
            obey him even though he was his slave; for that a physician <lb/>
            or a pilot would find men to obey them even though they <lb/>
            might be slaves.</p>
          <p>V. And Eubulus says, in his essay entitled, The Sale of <lb/>
            Diogenes, that he taught the children of Xeniades, after <lb/>
            their other lessons, to ride, and shoot, and sling, and dart. And <lb/>
            then in the Gymnasium he did not permit the trainer to exer- <lb/>
            cise them after the fashion of athletes, but exercised them him- <lb/>
            self to just the degree sufficient to give them a good colour and <lb/>
            good health. And the boys retained in their memory many <lb/>
            sentences of poets and prose writers, and of Diogenes himself; <lb/>
            and he used to give them a concise statement of everything <note type="footnote"> Q 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="228"/>
            in order to strengthen their memory; and at home he used to <lb/>
            teach them to wait upon themselves, contenting themselves <lb/>
            with plain food, and drinking water. And he accustomed <lb/>
            them to cut their hair close, and to eschew ornament, and to <lb/>
            go without tunics or shoes, and to keep silent, looking at <lb/>
            nothing except themselves as they walked along. He used, <lb/>
            also to take them out hunting; and they paid the greatest <lb/>
            attention and respect to Diogenes himself, and spoke well of <lb/>
            him to their parents.</p>
          <p>VI. And the same author affirms, that he grew old in the <lb/>
            household of Xeniades, and that when he died he was buried <lb/>
            by his sons. And that while he was living with him. <lb/>
            Xeniades once asked him how he should bury him; and he <lb/>
            said, " On my face and when he was asked why, he said, <lb/>
            " Because, in a little while, everything will be turned upside <lb/>
            down." And he said this because the Macedonians were <lb/>
            already attaining power, and becoming a mighty people from <lb/>
            having been very inconsiderable. Once, when a man had <lb/>
            conducted him into a magnificent house, and had told him <lb/>
            that he must not spit, after hawking a little, he spit in his <lb/>
            face, saying that he could not find a worse place. But some <lb/>
            tell this story of Aristippus. Once, he called out, " Holloa, <lb/>
            men." And when some people gathered round him in con- <lb/>
            sequence, he drove them away with his stick, saying, " I called <lb/>
            men, and not dregs." This anecdote I have derived -from <lb/>
            Hecaton, in the first book of his Apophthegms. They also <lb/>
            relate that Alexander said that if he had not been Alexander, <lb/>
            he should have liked to be Diogenes. He used to call <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνάπηϱοι</foreign> (cripples), not those who were dumb and blind, but <lb/>
            those who had no wallet (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πήϱα</foreign>). On one occasion he went <lb/>
            half shaved into an entertainment of young men, as Metrocles <lb/>
            tells us in his Apophthegms, and so was beaten by them. And <lb/>
            afterwards he wrote the names of all those who had beaten <lb/>
            him, on a white tablet, and went about with the tablet round <lb/>
            his neck, so as to expose them to insult, as they were <lb/>
            generally condemned and reproached for their conduct.</p>
          <p>He used to say that he was the hound of those who were <lb/>
            praised ; but that none of those who praised them dared to <lb/>
            go out hunting with him. A man once said to him, " I <lb/>
            conquered men at the Pythian games on which he said, " I <lb/>
            conquer men, but you only conquer slaves." When some <lb/>
             <pb n="229"/>
            people said to him, " You are an old man, and should rest for <lb/>
            the remainder of your life ;" " Why so?" replied he, " suppose <lb/>
            I had run a long distance, ought I to stop when I was near <lb/>
            the end, and not rather press on ? " Once, when he was in- <lb/>
            vited to a banquet, he said that he would not come : for that the <lb/>
            day before no one had thanked him for coming. He used to <lb/>
            go bare foot through the snow, and to do a number of other <lb/>
            things which have been already mentioned. Once he at- <lb/>
            tempted to eat raw meat, but he could not digest it. On one <lb/>
            occasion he found Demosthenes, the orator, dining in an inn ; <lb/>
            and as he was slipping away, he said to him, "You will now <lb/>
            be ever so much more in an inn."* Once, when some strangers <lb/>
            wished to see Demosthenes, he stretched out his middle <lb/>
            finger, and said, " This is the great demagogue of the Athenian <lb/>
            people." When some one had dropped a loaf, and was <lb/>
            ashamed to pick it up again, he, wishing to give him a lesson, <lb/>
            tied a cord round the neck of a bottle and dragged it all <lb/>
            through the Ceramicus. He used to say, that lie imitated <lb/>
            the teachers of choruses, for that they spoke too loud, in order <lb/>
            that the rest might catch the proper tone. Another of his <lb/>
            sayings, was that most men were within a finger's breadth of <lb/>
            being mad. If, then, any one were to walk along, stretching <lb/>
            out his middle finger, he will seem to be mad ; but if he puts <lb/>
            out his fore finger, he will not be thought so. Another of <lb/>
            his sayings was, that things of great value were often sold for <lb/>
            nothing, and vice versâ. Accordingly, that a statue would <lb/>
            fetch three thousand drachmas, and a bushel of meal only <lb/>
            two obols; and when Xeniades had bought him, he said to <lb/>
            him, " Come, do what you are ordered to." And when he <lb/>
            said- <lb/>
            " The streams of sacred rivers now <lb/>
            Run backwards to their source !"</p>
          <p>" Suppose," rejoined Diogenes, " you had been sick, and <lb/>
            had bought a physician, could you refuse to be guided by <lb/>
            him, and tell him— <lb/>
            " The streams of sacred rivers now <lb/>
            Run backwards to their source ?"</p>
          <p>Once a man came to him, and wished to study philosophy <note type="footnote"> * This line is from Euripides, Medea, 411. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="230"/>
            as his pupil ; and he gave him a saperda *and made him <lb/>
            follow him. And as he from shame threw it away and <lb/>
            departed, he soon afterwards met him and, laughing, said to <lb/>
            him, " A saperda has dissolved your friendship for me." But <lb/>
            Diodes tells this story in the following manner; that when <lb/>
            some one said to him, " Give me a commission, Diogenes," he <lb/>
            carried him off, and gave him a halfpenny worth of cheese to* <lb/>
            carry. And as he refused to carry it, " See," said Diogenes. <lb/>
            " a halfpenny worth of cheese has broken off our friendship."</p>
          <p>On one occasion he saw a child drinking out of its hands, <lb/>
            and so he threw away the cup which belonged to his wallet, <lb/>
            saying, " That child has beaten me in simplicity." He also <lb/>
            threw away his spoon, after seeing a boy, when he had broken <lb/>
            his vessel, take up his lentils with a crust of bread. And he <lb/>
            used to argue thus,—" Everything belongs to the gods ; and <lb/>
            wise men are the friends of the gods. All things are in <lb/>
            common among friends; therefore everything belongs to wise <lb/>
            men." Once he saw a woman falling down before the Gods in <lb/>
            an unbecoming attitude ; he, wishing to cure her of her super- <lb/>
            stition, as Zoilus of Perga tells us, came up to her, and said, <lb/>
            " Are you not afraid, 0 woman, to be in such an indecent atti- <lb/>
            tude, when some God may be behind you, for every place is <lb/>
            full of him?" He consecrated a man to AEsculapius, who was to <lb/>
            run up and beat all these who prostrated themselves with their <lb/>
            faces to the ground ; and he was in the habit of saying that <lb/>
            the tragic curse had come upon him, for that he was- <lb/>
            Houseless and citiless, a piteous exile <lb/>
            From his dear native land ; a wandering beggar, <lb/>
            Scraping a pittance poor from day to day.</p>
          <p>And another of his sayings was that he opposed confidence <lb/>
            to fortune, nature to law, and reason to suffering. Once, <lb/>
            while he was sitting in the sun in the Craneum, Alexander <lb/>
            was standing by, and said to him, "Ask any favour you choose <lb/>
            of me." And he replied, " Cease to shade me from the sun." <lb/>
            On one occasion a man was reading some long passages, and <lb/>
            when he came to the end of the book and showed that there <lb/>
            was nothing more written, " Be of good cheer, my friends," <lb/>
            exclaimed Diogenes, " I see land." A man once proved to <note type="footnote"> * The saperda was the coracinus (a kind of fish) when salted. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="231"/>
            him syllogistically that he had horns, so he put his hand to <lb/>
            his forehead and said, " I do not see them." And in a <lb/>
            similar manner he replied to one who had been asserting that <lb/>
            there was no such thing as motion, by getting up and walking <lb/>
            away. When a man was talking about the heavenly bodies <lb/>
            and meteors, " Pray how many days," said he to him, " is it <lb/>
            since you came down from heaven ?"</p>
          <p>A profligate eunuch had written on his house, " Let no evil <lb/>
            thing enter in." "Where," said Diogenes, "is the master of <lb/>
            the house going After having anointed his feet with per- <lb/>
            fume, he said that the ointment from his head mounted up <lb/>
            to heaven, and that from his feet up to his nose. When the <lb/>
            Athenians entreated him to be initiated in the Eleusinian <lb/>
            mysteries, and said that in the shades below the initiated had <lb/>
            the best seats ; " It will," he replied, " be an absurd thing if <lb/>
            Ægesilaus and Epaminondas are to live in the mud, and <lb/>
            some miserable wretches, who have been initiated, are to be in <lb/>
            the islands of the blest." Some mice crept up to his table, <lb/>
            and he said, " See, even Diogenes maintains his favourites." <lb/>
            Once, when he was leaving the bath, and a man asked him <lb/>
            whether many men were bathing, he said, " No;" but when a <lb/>
            number of people came out, he confessed that there were a <lb/>
            great many. When Plato called him a dog, he said, " Un- <lb/>
            doubtedly, for I have come back to those who sold me."</p>
          <p>Plato defined man thus : " Man is a two-footed, featherless <lb/>
            animal," and was much praised for the definition; so <lb/>
            Diogenes plucked a cock and brought it into his school, and <lb/>
            said, " This is Plato's man." On which account this addition <lb/>
            was made to the definition, " With broad flat nails." A man <lb/>
            once asked him what was the proper time for supper, and he <lb/>
            made answer, "If you are a rich man, whenever you please; <lb/>
            and if you are a poor man, whenever you can." When he <lb/>
            was at Megara he saw some sheep carefully covered over with <lb/>
            skins, and the children running about naked; and so he <lb/>
            said, " It is better at Megara to be a man's ram, than his son." <lb/>
            A man once struck him with a beam, and then said, " Take <lb/>
            care." "What," said he, "are you going to strike me <lb/>
            again?" He used to say that the demagogues were the ser- <lb/>
            vants of the people; and garlands the blossoms of glory. <lb/>
            Having lighted a candle in the day time, he said, " I am <lb/>
            looking for a man." On one occasion he stood under a foun. <lb/>
             <pb n="232"/>
            tain, and as the bystanders were pitying him, Plato, who was <lb/>
            present, said to them, " If you wish really to show your pity for <lb/>
            him, come away;" intimating that he was only acting thus out <lb/>
            of a desire for notoriety. Once, when a man had struck him <lb/>
            with his fist, he said," " 0 Hercules, what a strange thing that <lb/>
            I should be walking about with a helmet on without know- <lb/>
            ing it!"</p>
          <p>When Midias struck him with his fist and said, " There are <lb/>
            three thousand drachmas for you;" the next day Diogenes took <lb/>
            the cestus of a boxer and beat him soundly, and said, " There <lb/>
            are three thousand drachmas for you." * When Lysias, the <lb/>
            drug-seller, asked him whether he thought that there were <lb/>
            any Gods : " How," said he, " can I help thinking so, when I <lb/>
            consider you to be hated by them?" but some attribute this <lb/>
            reply to Theodorus. Once he saw a man purifying himself <lb/>
            by washing, and said to him, " Oh, wretched man, do not you <lb/>
            know that as you cannot wash away blunders in grammar by <lb/>
            purification, so, too, you can no more efface the errors of a life <lb/>
            in that same manner ? "</p>
          <p>He used to say that men were wrong for complaining of <lb/>
            fortune; for that they ask of the Gods what appear to be good <lb/>
            things, not what are really so. And to those who were <lb/>
            alarmed at dreams he said, that they did not regard what they <lb/>
            do while they are awake, but make a great fuss about what <lb/>
            they fancy they see while they are asleep. Once, at the <lb/>
            Olympic games, when the herald proclaimed, " Dioxippus is <lb/>
            the conqueror of men;" he said, " He is the conqueror of <lb/>
            slaves, I am the conqueror of men."</p>
          <p>He was greatly beloved by the Athenians; accordingly, <lb/>
            when a youth had broken his cask they beat him, and gave <lb/>
            Diogenes another. And Dionysius, the Stoic, says that after <lb/>
            the battle of Chæronea he was taken prisoner and brought <lb/>
            to Philip ; and being asked who he was, replied, " A spy, to <lb/>
            spy upon your insatiability." And Philip marvelled at him <lb/>
            and let him go. Once, when Alexander had sent a letter to <lb/>
            Athens to Antipater, by the hands of a man named Athlias, <lb/>
            he, being present, said, " Athlias from Athlius, by means of <note type="footnote"> * This is probably an allusion to a prosecution instituted by Demos- <lb/>
            thenes against Midias, which was afterwards compromised by Midias <lb/>
            paying Demosthenes thirty minæ, or three thousand drachmae. See <lb/>
            Dem. Or. cont. Midias. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="233"/>
            Athlias to Athlius.* When Perdiccas threatened that he <lb/>
            would put him to death if he did not come to him, he replied, <lb/>
            "That is nothing strange, for a scorpion or a tarantula could <lb/>
            do as much: you had better threaten me that, if I kept away, <lb/>
            you should be very happy." He used constantly to repeat <lb/>
            with emphasis that an easy life had been given to man by <lb/>
            the Gods, but that it had been overlaid by their seeking for <lb/>
            honey, cheese-cakes, and unguents, and things of that sort. <lb/>
            On which account he said to a mail, who had his shoes put on <lb/>
            by his servant, " You are not thoroughly happy, unless he <lb/>
            also wipes your nose for you; and he will do this, if you are <lb/>
            crippled in your hands." On one occasion, when he had seen <lb/>
            the hieromnemones t leading off one of the stewards who had <lb/>
            stolen a goblet, he said, " The great thieves are carrying off <lb/>
            the little thief." At another time, seeing a young man throw <lb/>
            ing stones at a cross, he said, "Well done, you will be sure to <lb/>
            reach the mark." Once, too, some boys got round him and <lb/>
            said, " We are taking care that you do not bite us but he said, <lb/>
            " Be of good cheer, my boys, a dog does not eat beef." He <lb/>
            saw a man giving himself airs because he was clad in a lion's <lb/>
            skin, and said to him, " Do not go on disgracing the garb of <lb/>
            nature." When people were speaking of the happiness of <lb/>
            Calisthenes, and saying what splendid treatment he received <lb/>
            from Alexander, he replied, " The man then is wretched, for <lb/>
            he is forced to breakfast and dine whenever Alexander chooses." <lb/>
            When he was in want of money, he said that he reclaimed it <lb/>
            from his friends and did not beg for it.</p>
          <p>On one occasion he was working with his hands in the <lb/>
            market-place, and said, " I wish I could rub my stomach in <lb/>
            the same way, and so avoid hunger." When he saw a young <lb/>
            man going with some satraps to supper, he dragged him away <lb/>
            and led him off to his relations, and bade them take care of <lb/>
            him. He was once addressed by a youth beautifully adorned, <lb/>
            who asked him some question; and he refused to give him <lb/>
            any answer, till he satisfied him whether he was a man or a <lb/>
            woman. And on one occasion, when a youth was playing the <note type="footnote"> * This is a pun upon the similarity of Athlias's name to the Greek <lb/>

            cottabus in the bath, he said to him, " The better you do it, the <lb/>
            worse you do it." Once at a banquet, some of the guests threw <lb/>
            him bones, as if he had been a dog; so he, as he went away, <lb/>
            put up his leg against them as if he had been a dog in reality. <lb/>
            He used to call the orators, and all those who speak for fame <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τϱιςάνθϱωποι</foreign> (thrice men), instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τϱιςάθλιοι</foreign>, (thrice misera- <lb/>
            ble). He said that a rich but ignorant man, was like a sheep <lb/>
            with a golden fleece. When he saw a notice on the house of <lb/>
            a profligate man, " To be sold." " I knew," said he, " that <lb/>
            you who are so incessantly drunk, would soon vomit up your <lb/>
            owner." To a young man, who was complaining of the num- <lb/>
            ber of people who sought his acquaintance, he said, " Do not <lb/>
            make such a parade of your vanity."</p>
          <p>Having been in a very dirty bath, he said, " I wonder <lb/>
            where the people, who bathe here, clean themselves." When <lb/>
            all the company was blaming an indifferent harp-player, he <lb/>
            alone praised him, and being asked why he did so, he said, <lb/>
            " Because, though he is such as he is, he plays the harp and <lb/>
            does not steal." He saluted a harp player who was always <lb/>
            left alone by his hearers, with, " Good morning, cock;" and <lb/>
            when the man asked him, "Why so ?" he said, " Because you, <lb/>
            when you sing, make every one get up." When a young man <lb/>
            was one day making a display of himself, he, having filled the <lb/>
            bosom of his robe with lupins, began to eat them; and when <lb/>
            the multitude looked at him, he said, " that he marvelled at <lb/>
            their leaving the young man to look at him." And when a <lb/>
            man, who was very superstitious, said to him, " With one <lb/>
            blow I will break your head ;" " And I," he replied, " with <lb/>
            one sneeze will make you tremble." When Hegesias en- <lb/>
            treated him to lend him one of his books, he said, " You are <lb/>
            a silly fellow, Hegesias. for you will not take painted figs, but <lb/>
            real ones; and yet you overlook the genuine practice of virtue, <lb/>
            and seek for what is merely written." A man once reproached <lb/>
            him with his banishment, and his answer was, " You wretched <lb/>
            man, that is what made me a philosopher." And when, on <lb/>
            another occasion, some one said to him, " The people of <lb/>
            Sinope condemned you to banishment," he replied, " And I <lb/>
            condemned them to remain where they were." Once he saw <lb/>
            a man who had been victor at the Olympic games, feeding <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νεμοντα</foreign>) sheep, and he said to him, " You have soon come <lb/>
            across my friend from the Olympic games, to the Nemean." <lb/>
             <pb n="235"/>
            When he was asked why athletes are insensible to pain, he <lb/>
            said, " Because they are built up of pork and beef."</p>
          <p>He once asked for a statue ; and being questioned as to <lb/>
            his reason for doing so, he said, " I am practising disappoint- <lb/>
            ment,'' Once he was begging of some one (for he did this <lb/>
            at first out of actual want), he said, " If you have given to <lb/>
            any one else, give also to me ; and if you have never given <lb/>
            to any one, then begin with me." On one occasion, he was <lb/>
            asked by the tyrant, " What sort of brass was the best for a <lb/>
            statue?" and he replied, " That of which the statues of Har- <lb/>
            modius and Aristogiton are made." When he was asked <lb/>
            how Dionysius treats his friends, he said, " Like bags; those <lb/>
            which are full he hangs up, and those which are empty he throws <lb/>
            away." A man who was lately married put an inscription <lb/>
            on his house, " Hercules Callinicus, the son of Jupiter, lives <lb/>
            here ; let no evil enter." And so Diogenes wrote in addition, <lb/>
            " An alliance is made after the war is over." He used to <lb/>
            say that covetousness was the metropolis of all evils. Seeing <lb/>
            on one occasion a profligate man in an inn eating olives, he <lb/>
            said, " If you had dined thus, you would not have supped <lb/>
            thus." One of his apophthegms was, that good men were the <lb/>
            images of the Gods ; another, that love was the business of <lb/>
            those who had nothing to do. When he was asked what was <lb/>
            miserable in life, he answered, " An indigent old man." And <lb/>
            when the question was put to him, what beast inflicts the <lb/>
            worst bite, he said, " Of wild beasts the sycophant, and of <lb/>
            tame animals the flatterer."</p>
          <p>On one occasion he saw two Centaurs very badly painted ; <lb/>
            he said, "Which of the two is the worst?"* He used to say <lb/>
            that a speech, the object of which was solely to please, was a <lb/>
            honeyed halter. He called the belly, the Charybdis of life. <lb/>
            Having heard once that Didymon the adulterer, had been <lb/>
            caught in the fact, he said, " He deserves to be hung by his <lb/>
            name."† When the question was put to him, why gold is of a <lb/>
            pale colour, he said, " Because it has so many people plotting <note type="footnote"> * There is a pun here. <foreign xml:lang="grc">χείϱων</foreign> is the word used for worse. Chiron <lb/>
            was also the most celebrated of the Centaurs, the tutor of Achilles. </note><note type="footnote"> t There is a pun intended here; as Diogenes proposed Didymus a <lb/>
            fate somewhat similar to that of the beaver. <lb/>

            Testiculorum. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="236"/>
            against it." When he saw a woman in a litter, he said, " The <lb/>
            cage is not suited to the animal." And seeing a runaway <lb/>
            slave sitting on a well, he said, " My boy, take care you do <lb/>
            not fall in." Another time, he saw a little boy who was a <lb/>
            stealer of clothes from the baths, and said, " Are you going <lb/>
            for unguents, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπ' ἀλειμμάτιον</foreign>), or for other garments (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπ' <lb/>
            ἄλλ' ἱμάτιον</foreign>). Seeing some women hanging on olive trees, <lb/>
            he said, " I wish every tree bore similar fruit." At another <lb/>
            time, he saw a clothes' stealer, and addressed him thus :— <lb/>
            What moves thee, say, when sleep has clos'd the sight, <lb/>
            To roam the silent fields in dead of night ? <lb/>
            Art thou some wretch by hopes of plunder led, <lb/>
            Through heaps of carnage to despoil the dead.*</p>
          <p>When he was asked whether he had any girl or boy to wait on <lb/>
            him, he said, " No." And as his questioner asked further, <lb/>
            " If then you die, who will bury you?" He replied, "Who- <lb/>
            ever wants my house." Seeing a handsome youth sleeping <lb/>
            without any protection, he nudged him, and said, " Wake <lb/>
            up: <lb/>
            Mix'd with the vulgar shall thy fate be found, <lb/>
            Pierc'd in the back, a vile dishonest wound.t</p>
          <p>And he addressed a man who was buying delicacies at a <lb/>
            great expense :- <lb/>
            Not long, my son, will you on earth remain, <lb/>
            If such your dealings. ‡</p>
          <p>When Plato was discoursing about his " ideas," and using <lb/>
            the nouns " tableness " and " cupness ;" "I, I, 0 Plato !" inter- <lb/>
            rupted Diogenes, " see a table and a cup, but I see no table- <lb/>
            ness or cupness." Plato made answer, " That is natural <lb/>
            enough, for you have eyes, by which a cup and a table are <lb/>
            contemplated; but you have not intellect, by which tableness <lb/>
            and cupness are seen."</p>
          <p>On one occasion, he was asked by a certain person, " What <lb/>
            sort of a man, 0 Diogenes, do you think Socrates ?" and he <note type="footnote"> * This is taken from Homer, Il. k. 387.

            said, " A madman." Another time, the question was put to <lb/>
            him, when a man ought to marry ? and his reply was, <lb/>
            " Young men ought not to marry yet, and old men never <lb/>
            ought to marry at all." When asked what he would take to <lb/>
            let a man give him a blow onthe head?" he replied, " A <lb/>
            helmet." Seeing a youth smartening himself up very care- <lb/>
            fully, he said to him, " If you are doing that for men, you are <lb/>
            miserable ; and if for women, you are profligate." Once he <lb/>
            saw a youth blushing, and addressed him, " Courage, my <lb/>
            boy, that is the complexion of virtue." Having once listened <lb/>
            to two lawyers, he condemned them both ; saying.,,, That the <lb/>
            one had stolen the thing in question, and that the other had <lb/>
            not lost it." When asked what wine he liked to drink, he <lb/>
            said, " That which belongs to another," A man said to him <lb/>
            one day, " Many people laugh at you." " But I," he replied, <lb/>
            " am not laughed down." When a man said to him, that it <lb/>
            was a bad thing to live ; " Not to live," said he, “ but to live <lb/>
            badly." When some people were advising him to make <lb/>
            search for a slave who had run away," he said, " It would be a <lb/>
            very absurd thing for Manes to be able to live without <lb/>
            Diogenes, but for Diogenes not to be able to live without <lb/>
            Manes." When he was dining on olives, a cheese-cake was <lb/>
            brought in, on which he threw the olive away, saying:- <lb/>
            Keep well aloof, 0 stranger, from all tyrants.*</p>
          <p>And presently he added :— <lb/>
            He drove the olive off (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μάστίξεν δ</foreign>’<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐλάαν</foreign>).†</p>
          <p>When he was asked what sort of a dog he was, he replied, <lb/>
            "When hungry, I am a dog of Melita; when satisfied, a <lb/>
            Molossian ; a sort which most of those who praise, do not <lb/>
            like to take out hunting with them, because of the labour of <lb/>
            keeping up with them; and in like manner, you cannot associate <lb/>
            with me, from fear of the pain I give you." The question <lb/>
            was put to him, whether wise men ate cheese-cakes, and he <lb/>
            replied, " They eat everything, just as the rest of mankind." <lb/>

            phers, he said, " Because they think it possible that they <lb/>
            themselves may become lame and blind, but they do not <lb/>
            expect ever to turn out philosophers." He once begged of a <lb/>
            covetous man, and as he was slow to give, he said, " Man, I <lb/>
            am asking you for something to maintain me (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰς τϱοϕὴν</foreign>and <lb/>
            not to bury me (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰςταϕὴν</foreign>).” When some one reproached <lb/>
            him for having tampered with the coinage, he said, "There <lb/>
            was a time when I was such a person as you are now ; but <lb/>
            there never was when you were such as I am now, and never <lb/>
            will be." And to another person who reproached him on the <lb/>
            same grounds, he said, " There were times when 1 did what I <lb/>
            did not wish to, but that is not the case now." When he went <lb/>
            to Myndus, he saw some very large gates, but the city was a <lb/>
            small one, and so he said, " Oh men of Myndus, shut your <lb/>
            gates, lest your city should steal out." On one occasion, he <lb/>
            saw a man who had been detected stealing purple, and so he <lb/>
            said :— <lb/>
            A purple death, and mighty fate o'ertook him *</p>
          <p>When Craterus entreated him to come and visit him, he <lb/>
            said, " I would rather lick up salt at Athens, than enjoy <lb/>
            a luxurious table with Craterus." On one occasion, he met <lb/>
            Anaximenes, the orator, who was a fat man, and thus accosted <lb/>
            him; " Pray give us, who are poor, some of your belly ; for <lb/>
            by so doing you will be relieved yourself, and yon will assist <lb/>
            us." And once, when he was discussing some point, Diogenes <lb/>
            held up a piece of salt fish, and drew off the attention of his <lb/>
            hearers ; and as Anaximenes was indignant at this, he said, <lb/>
            " See, one pennyworth of salt fish has put an end to the <lb/>
            lecture of Anaximenes." Being once reproached for eating in <lb/>
            the market-place, he made answer, " I did, for it was in the <lb/>
            market-place that I was hungry." Some authors also attri- <lb/>
            bute the following repartee to him. Plato saw him washing <lb/>
            vegetables, and so, coming up to him, he quietly accosted <lb/>
            him thus, " If you had paid court to Dionysius, you would <lb/>
            not have been washing vegetables." " And," he replied, <lb/>
            with equal quietness, "if you had washed vegetables, you <lb/>
            would never have paid court to Dionysius." When a mail <lb/>
            said to him once, " Most people laugh at you ; ”“And very <note type="footnote"> * This line occurs, Horn. II. e. 83. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="239"/>
            likely," he replied, " the asses laugh at them; but they do not <lb/>
            regard the asses, neither do I regard them." Once he saw a <lb/>
            youth studying philosophy, and said to him, " Well done; <lb/>
            inasmuch as you are leading those who admire your person <lb/>
            to contemplate the beauty of your mind."</p>
          <p>A certain person was admiring the offerings in the temple <lb/>
            at Samothrace,* and he said to him, " They would have been <lb/>
            much more numerous, if those who were lost had offered them <lb/>
            instead of those who were saved ;" but some attribute this <lb/>
            speech to Diagoras the Thelian. Once he saw a handsome <lb/>
            youth going to a banquet, and said to him, " You will come <lb/>
            back worse (<foreign xml:lang="grc">χείϱων</foreign>);”and when he the next day after the <lb/>
            banquet said to him, “ I have left the banquet, and was no <lb/>
            worse for it;" he replied, "You were not Chiron, but Eury- <lb/>
            tion."f He was begging once of a very ill-tempered mail, and <lb/>
            as he said to him, " If you can persuade me, I will give you <lb/>
            something;" he replied, " If I could persuade you, I would <lb/>
            beg you to hang yourself." He was on one occasion returning <lb/>
            from Lacedaemon to Athens ; and when some one asked him, <lb/>
            " Whither are you going, and whence do you come ?" he said,</p>
          <p>“I am going from the men's apartments to the women's." <lb/>
            Another time he was returning from the Olympic games, and <lb/>
            when some one asked him whether there had been a great <lb/>
            multitude there, he said, " A great multitude, but very few <lb/>
            men." He used to say that debauched men resembled figs <lb/>
            growing on a precipice ; the fruit of which is not tasted by men, <lb/>
            but devoured by crows and vultures. When Phryne had dedi- <lb/>
            cated a golden statue of Venus at Delphi, he wrote upon it, <lb/>
            " From the profligacy of the Greeks."</p>
          <p>Once Alexander the Great came and stood by him, and <lb/>
            said, " I am Alexander, the great king." " And I," said he, <lb/>
            " am Diogenes the dog." And when he was asked to what <lb/>
            actions of his it was owing that he was called a dog, he said, <lb/>
            " Because I fawn upon those who give me anything, and bark <lb/>
            at those who give me nothing, and bite the rogues." On one <lb/>
            occasion he was gathering some of the fruit of a fig-tree, and <note type="footnote"> * The Samothracian Gods were Gods of the sea, and it was custom- <lb/>
            ary for those who had been saved from shipwreck to make them an <lb/>

            had saved nothing but their lives. </note><note type="footnote"> t Eurytion was another of the Centaurs, who was killed by Hercules. </note> <lb/>

            when the man who was guarding it told him a man hung him- <lb/>
            self on this tree the other day, " I, then," said he, " will now <lb/>
            purify it." Once he saw a man who had been a conqueror at <lb/>
            the Olympic games looking very often at a courtesan ; " Look," <lb/>
            said he, " at that warlike ram, who is taken prisoner by the <lb/>
            first girl he meets." One of his sayings was, that good-look- <lb/>
            ing courtesans were like poisoned mead.</p>
          <p>On one occasion he was eating his dinner in the market- <lb/>
            place, and the bystanders kept constantly calling out " Dog ;” <lb/>
            but he said, " It is you who are the dogs, who stand around <lb/>
            me while I am at dinner." When two effeminate fellows were <lb/>
            getting out of his way, he said, " Do not be afraid, a dog does <lb/>
            not eat beetroot." Being once asked about a debauched boy, <lb/>
            as to what country he came from, he said, " He is a Tegean.”* <lb/>
            Seeing an unskilful wrestler professing to heal a man he said, <lb/>
            " What are you about, are you in hopes now to overthrow those <lb/>
            who formerly conquered you ?" On one occasion he saw the <lb/>
            son of a courtesan throwing a stone at a crowd, and said to <lb/>
            him, "Take care, lest you hit your father." When a boy <lb/>
            showed him a sword that he had received from one to whom <lb/>
            he had done some discreditable service, he told him, " The <lb/>
            sword is a good sword, but the handle is infamous." And when <lb/>
            some people were praising a man who had given him some- <lb/>
            thing, he said to them, " And do not you praise me who was <lb/>
            worthy to receive it?" He was asked by some one to give <lb/>
            him back his cloak ; but he. replied, " If you gave it me, it is <lb/>
            mine ; and if you only lent it me, I am using it." A suppo- <lb/>
            sititious son (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑποβολιμα̃ιος</foreign> of somebody once said to him, that <lb/>
            he had gold in his cloak ; " No doubt," said he, " that is the <lb/>
            very reason why I sleep with it under my head <foreign xml:lang="grc">η- <lb/>
            μένος</foreign>).”When he was asked what advantage he had derived <lb/>
            from philosophy, he replied, " If no other, at least this, that I <lb/>
            am prepared for every kind of fortune." The question was put <lb/>
            to him what countryman he was, and he replied, " A Citizen of <note type="footnote"> * This is a punon the similarity of the sound, Tegea, to <foreign xml:lang="grc">τέγος</foreign>,a <lb/>

            the world." Some men were sacrificing to the Gods to prevail <lb/>
            on them to send them sons, and he said, "And do you not sacri- <lb/>
            fice to procure sons of a particular character ?" Once he was <lb/>
            asking the president of a society for a contribution, and said to <lb/>
            him:— <lb/>
            , " Spoil all the rest, but keep your hands from Hector."</p>
          <p>He used to say that courtesans were the queens of kings ; <lb/>
            for that they asked them for whatever they chose. When the <lb/>
            Athenians had voted that Alexander was Bacchus, he said to <lb/>
            them, " Vote, too, that I am Serapis." When a man re- <lb/>
            proached him for going into unclean places, he said, " The sun <lb/>
            too penetrates into privies, but is not polluted by them." <lb/>
            When supping in a temple, as some dirty loaves were set <lb/>
            before him, he took them up and threw them away, saying <lb/>
            that nothing dirty ought to come into a temple ; and when some <lb/>
            one said to him, " You philosophize without being possessed <lb/>
            of any knowledge," he said, " If I only pretend to wisdom, that <lb/>
            is philosophizing." A man once brought him a boy, and said <lb/>
            that he was a very clever child, and one of an admirable dis- <lb/>
            position." “ What, then," said Diogenes, " does he want of <lb/>
            me?”He used to say, that those who utter virtuous senti- <lb/>
            ments but do not do them, are no better than harps, for that <lb/>
            a harp has no hearing or feeling. Once he was going into a <lb/>
            theatre while every one else was coming out of it; and when <lb/>
            asked why he did so, " It is," said he, " what I have been <lb/>
            doing all my life." Once when he saw a young man putting <lb/>
            on effeminate airs, he said to him, " Are you not ashamed to <lb/>
            have worse plans for yourself than nature had for you ? for <lb/>
            she has made you a man, but you are trying to force yourself <lb/>
            to be a woman." When he saw an ignorant man tuning a <lb/>
            psaltery, he said to him, " Are you not ashamed to be <lb/>
            arranging proper sounds on a wooden instrument, and not <lb/>
            arranging your soul to a proper life ? " When a man said to <lb/>
            him, " I am not calculated for philosophy," he said, "Why then <lb/>
            do you live, if you have no desire to live properly ? " To a <lb/>
            man who treated his father with contempt, he said, " Are you <lb/>
            not ashamed to despise him to whom you owe it that you <lb/>
            have it in your power to give yourself airs at all ?" Seeing <lb/>
            a handsome young man chattering in an unseemly manner, <note type="footnote"> R </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="242"/>
            he said, " Are you not ashamed to draw a sword cut of lead <lb/>
            out of a scabbard of ivory?" Being once reproached for <lb/>
            drinking in a vintner's shop, he said, " I have my hair cut, <lb/>
            too, in a barber's." At another time, he was attacked for <lb/>
            having accepted a cloak from Antipater, but he replied:- <lb/>
            " Refuse not thou to heed <lb/>
            The gifts which from the mighty Gods proceed."*</p>
          <p>A man once struck him with a broom, and said, “Take care <lb/>
            so he struck him in return with his staff, and said, " Take <lb/>
            care."</p>
          <p>He once said to a man who was addressing anxious en- <lb/>
            treaties to a courtesan, " What can you wish to obtain, you <lb/>
            wretched man, that you had not better be disappointed in ? ” <lb/>
            Seeing a man reeking all over with unguents, he said to <lb/>
            him, " Have a care, lest the fragrance of your head give a <lb/>
            bad odour to your life." One of his sayings was, that <lb/>
            servants serve their masters, and that wicked men are the <lb/>
            slaves of their appetites. Being asked why slaves were <lb/>
            called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνδϱάποδα</foreign>,he replied, " Because they have the feet of <lb/>
            men (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τοὺςπόδαςἀνδϱω̃ν</foreign>),and a soul such as you who are <lb/>
            asking this question." He once asked a profligate fellow for <lb/>
            a mina ; and when he put the question to him, why he asked <lb/>
            others for an obol, and him for a mina, he said, " Because I hope <lb/>
            to get something from the others another time, but the Gods <lb/>
            alone know whether I shall ever extract anything from you <lb/>
            again." Once he was reproached for asking favours, while <lb/>
            Plato never asked for any; and he said ;— <lb/>
            " He asks as well as I do, but he does it <lb/>
            Bending his head, that no one else may hear."</p>
          <p>One day he saw an unskilful archer shooting ; so he went <lb/>
            and sat down by the target, saying, " Now I shall be out of <lb/>
            harm's way." He used to say, that those who were in love <lb/>
            were disappointed in regard of the pleasure they expected. <lb/>
            When he was asked whether death was an evil, he replied, <lb/>
            " How can that be an evil which we do not feel when it is <lb/>
            present ?" When Alexander was once standing by him,"and <lb/>
            saying, “ Do not you fear me?" He replied, " No ; for what <lb/>
            are you, a good or an evil ? " And as he said that he was <note type="footnote"> * Horn. Il. r. 65. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="243"/>
            good, " Who, then," said Diogenes, " fears the good ?" He used <lb/>
            to say, that education was, for the young sobriety, for the old <lb/>
            comfort, for the poor riches, and for the rich an ornament." <lb/>
            When Didymus the adulterer was once trying to cure the eye <lb/>
            of a young girl (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰόϱης</foreign>), he said, " Take care, lest when you <lb/>
            are curing the eye of the maiden, you do not hurt the pupil."* <lb/>
            A man once said to him, that his friends laid plots against <lb/>
            him ; " What then," said he, " are you to do, if you must look <lb/>
            upon both your friends and enemies in the same light ?"</p>
          <p>On one occasion he was asked, what was the most excellent <lb/>
            thing among men; and he said, " Freedom of speech." <lb/>
            He went once into a school, and saw many statues of the <lb/>
            Muses, but very few pupils, and said, " Gods, and all my <lb/>
            good schoolmasters, you have plenty of pupils." He was in <lb/>
            the habit of doing everything in public, whether in respect of <lb/>
            Venus or Ceres ; and he used to put his conclusions in this <lb/>
            way to people: " If there is nothing absurd in dining, then <lb/>
            it is not absurd to dine in the market-place. But it is not <lb/>
            absurd to dine, therefore it is not absurd to dine in the <lb/>
            market-place." And as he was continually doing manual work <lb/>
            in public, he said one day, " Would that by rubbing my belly <lb/>
            I could get rid of hunger." Other sayings also are attributed <lb/>
            to him, which it would take a long time to enumerate, there <lb/>
            is such a multiplicity of them.</p>
          <p>He used to say, that there were two kinds of exercise: <lb/>
            that, namely, of the mind and that of the body; and that the <lb/>
            latter of these created in the mind such quick and agile <lb/>
            phantasies at the time of its performance, as very much facile <lb/>
            tated the practice of virtue; but that one was imperfect <lb/>
            without the other, since the health and vigour necessary for <lb/>
            the practice of what is good, depend equally on both mind <lb/>
            and body. And he used to allege as proofs of this, and of the <lb/>
            ease which practice imparts to acts of virtue, that people could <lb/>
            see that in the case of mere common working trades, and other <lb/>
            employments of that kind, the artisans arrived at no incon- <lb/>
            siderable accuracy by constant practice; and that any one <lb/>
            may see how much one flute player, or one wrestler, is superior <lb/>
            to another, by his own continued practice. And that if these <note type="footnote"> * There is a pun here; <foreign xml:lang="grc">κόϱη</foreign>means both " a girl" and " the pupil of <lb/>
            the eye." And <foreign xml:lang="grc">φθείϱω</foreign>,“to destroy," is also especially used for " to <lb/>

            men transferred the same training to their minds they would <lb/>
            not labour in a profitless or imperfect manner. He used to <lb/>
            say also, that there was nothing whatever in life which could <lb/>
            be brought to perfection without practice, and that that alone <lb/>
            was able to overcome every obstacle; that, therefore, as we <lb/>
            ought to repudiate all useless toils, and to apply ourselves to <lb/>
            useful labours, and to live happily, we are only unhappy in <lb/>
            consequence of most exceeding folly. For the very contempt <lb/>
            of pleasure, if we only inure ourselves to it, is very pleasant; <lb/>
            and just as they who are accustomed to live luxuriously, are <lb/>
            brought very unwillingly to adopt the contrary system ; so they <lb/>
            who have been originally inured to that opposite system, feel <lb/>
            a sort of pleasure in the contempt of pleasure.</p>
          <p>This used to be the language which he held, and he used to <lb/>
            show in practice, really altering men's habits, and deferring in <lb/>
            all things rather to the principles of nature than to those of <lb/>
            law; saying that he was adopting the same fashion of life as <lb/>
            Hercules had, preferring nothing in the world to liberty; and <lb/>
            saying that everything belonged to the wise, and advancing <lb/>
            arguments such as I mentioned just above. For instance : <lb/>
            every tiling belongs to the Gods; and the Gods are friends to <lb/>
            the wise; and all the property of friends is held in common ; <lb/>
            therefore everything belong to the wise. He also argued <lb/>
            about the law, that without it there is no possibility of a <lb/>
            constitution being maintained; for without a city there can be <lb/>
            nothing orderly, but a city is an orderly thing; and without a <lb/>
            city there can be no law; therefore law is order. And he <lb/>
            played in the same manner with the topics of noble birth, <lb/>
            and reputation, and all things of that kind, saying that they <lb/>
            were all veils, as it were, for wickedness ; and that that was <lb/>
            the only proper constitution which consisted, in order. An- <lb/>
            other of his doctrines was that all women ought to be possessed <lb/>
            in common ; and he said that marriage was a nullity, and that <lb/>
            the proper way would be for every man to live with her whom <lb/>
            he could persuade to agree with him. And on the same <lb/>
            principle he said, that all people's sons ought to belong to <lb/>
            every one in common ; and there was nothing intolerable in <lb/>
            the idea of taking anything out of a temple, or eating any <lb/>
            animal whatever, and that there was no impiety in tasting even <lb/>
            human flesh ; as is plain from the habits of foreign nations ; <lb/>
            and he said that this principle might be correctly extended to <lb/>
             <pb n="245"/>
            every case and every people. For he said that in reality every- <lb/>
            thing was a combination of all things. For that in bread <lb/>
            there was meat, and in vegetables there was bread, and so <lb/>
            there were some particles of all other bodies in everything, <lb/>
            communicating by invisible passages and evaporating.</p>
          <p>VII. And he explains this theory of his clearly in the <lb/>
            Thyestes, if indeed the tragedies attributed to him are really <lb/>
            his composition, and not rather the work of Philistus, of <lb/>
            Ægina, his intimate friend, or of Pasiphon, the son of Lucian, <lb/>
            who is stated by Phavorinus, in his Universal History, to <lb/>
            have written them after Diogenes' death.</p>
          <p>VIII. Music and geometry, and astronomy, and all things <lb/>
            of that kind, he neglected, as useless and unnecessary. But <lb/>
            he was a man very happy in meeting arguments, as is plain <lb/>
            from what we have already said.</p>
          <p>IX. And he bore being sold with a most magnanimous <lb/>
            spirit. For as he was sailing to Ægina, and was taken <lb/>
            prisoner by some pirates, under the command of Scirpalus, he <lb/>
            was carried off to Crete and sold; and when the Circe asked <lb/>
            him what art he understood, he said, " That of governing <lb/>
            men." And presently pointing out a Corinthian, very carefully <lb/>
            dressed, (the same Xeniades whom we have mentioned before), <lb/>
            he said, " Sell me to that man; for he wants a master." <lb/>
            Accordingly Xeniades bought him and carried him away to <lb/>
            Corinth; and then he made him tutor of his sons, and com- <lb/>
            mitted to him the entire management of his house. And he <lb/>
            behaved himself in every affair in such a manner, that <lb/>
            Xeniades, when looking over his property, said, " A good <lb/>
            genius has come into my house." And Cleomenes, in his <lb/>
            book which is called the Schoolmaster, says, that he wished <lb/>
            to ransom all his relations, but that Diogenes told him that <lb/>
            they were all fools ; for that lions did not become the slaves <lb/>
            of those who kept them, but, on the contrary, those who main- <lb/>
            tained lions were their slaves. For that it was the part of a <lb/>
            slave to fear, but that wild beasts were formidable to men.</p>
          <p>X. And the man bad the gift of persuasion in a wonderful <lb/>
            degree; so that he could easily overcome any one by his argu- <lb/>
            ments. Accordingly, it is said that an Æginetan of the name <lb/>
            of Onesicritus, having two sons, sent to Athens one of them, <lb/>
            whose name was Androsthenes, and that he, after having <lb/>
            heard Diogenes lecture, remained there; and that after <lb/>
             <pb n="246"/>
            that, he sent the elder, Philiscus, who has been already men- <lb/>
            tioned, and that Philiscus was charmed in the same manner. <lb/>
            And last of all, he came himself, and then he too remained, <lb/>
            no less than his son, studying philosophy at the feet of <lb/>
            Diogenes. So great a charm was there in the discourses of <lb/>
            Diogenes. Another pupil of his was Phocion, who was sur- <lb/>
            named the Good; and Stilpon, the Megarian, and a great <lb/>
            many other men of eminence as statesmen.</p>
          <p>XI. He is said to have died when he was nearly ninety <lb/>
            years of age, but there are different accounts given of his <lb/>
            death. For some say that he ate an ox's foot raw, and was in <lb/>
            consequence seized with a bilious attack, of which he died ; <lb/>
            others, of whom Cercidas, a Megalopolitan or Cretan, is one, <lb/>
            say that he died of holding his breath for several days; and <lb/>
            Cercidas speaks thus of him in his Meliambics:- <lb/>
            He, that Sinopian who bore the stick, <lb/>
            Wore his cloak doubled, and in th' open air <lb/>
            Dined without washing, would not bear with life <lb/>
            A moment longer : but he shut his teeth, <lb/>
            And held his breath. He truly was the son <lb/>
            Of Jove, and a most heavenly-minded dog, <lb/>
            The wise Diogenes,</p>
          <p>Others say that he, while intending to distribute a polypus to <lb/>
            his dogs, was bitten by them through the tendon of his foot, <lb/>
            and so died. But his own greatest friends, as Antisthenes <lb/>
            tells us in his Successions, rather sanction the story of his <lb/>
            having died from holding his breath. For he used to live in <lb/>
            the Craneum, which was a Gymnasium at the gates of Corinth. <lb/>
            And his friends came according to their custom, and found <lb/>
            him with his head covered ; and as they did not suppose that <lb/>
            he was asleep, for he was not a man much subject to the <lb/>
            influence of night or sleep, they drew away his cloak from his <lb/>
            face, and found him no longer breathing; and they thought <lb/>
            that he had done this on purpose, wishing to escape the <lb/>
            remaining portion of his life.</p>
          <p>On this there was a quarrel, as they say, between his friends, <lb/>
            as to who should bury him, and they even came to blows; but <lb/>
            when the elders and chief men of the city came there, they <lb/>
            say that he was buried by them at the gate which leads to <lb/>
            the Isthmus, And they placed over him a pillar, and on that <lb/>
            a dog in Parian marble. And at a later period his fellow <lb/>
             <pb n="247"/>
            citizens honoured him with brazen statues, and put this <lb/>
            inscription on them :- <lb/>
            E'en brass by lapse of time doth old become, <lb/>
            But there is no such time as shall efface, <lb/>
            Your lasting glory, wise Diogenes ; <lb/>
            Since you alone did teach to men the art <lb/>
            Of a contented life : the surest path <lb/>
            To glory and a lasting happiness.</p>
          <p>We ourselves have also written an epigram on him in the <lb/>
            proceleusmatic metre. <lb/>
            A. Tell me, Diogenes, tell me true, I pray, <lb/>
            How did you die; what fate to Pluto bore you ? <lb/>
            B. The savage bite of an envious dog did kill me.</p>
          <p>Some, however, say that when he was dying, he ordered <lb/>
            his friends to throw his corpse away without burying it, so <lb/>
            that every beast might tear it, or else to throw it into a ditch, <lb/>
            and sprinkle a little dust over it. And others say that his <lb/>
            injunctions were, that he should be thrown into the Ilissus; <lb/>
            that so he might be useful to his brethren. But Demetrius, <lb/>
            in his treatise on Men of the Same Name, says that Diogenes <lb/>
            died in Corinth the same day that Alexander died in Babylon. <lb/>
            And he was already an old man, as early as the hundred and <lb/>
            thirteenth olympiad.</p>
          <p>XII. The following books are attributed to him. The <lb/>
            dialogues entitled the Cephalion; the Icthyas ; the Jackdaw; <lb/>
            the Leopard; the People of the Athenians; the Republic; <lb/>
            one called Moral Art; one on Wealth; one on Love; the <lb/>
            Theodorus; the Hypsias ; the Aristarchus ; one on Death ; <lb/>
            a volume of Letters; seven Tragedies, the Helen, the <lb/>
            Thyestes, the Hercules, the Achilles, the Medea, the Chrysip- <lb/>
            pus, and the CEdippus,</p>
          <p>But Sosicrates, in the first book of his Successions, and <lb/>
            Satyrus, in the fourth book of his Lives, both assert that none <lb/>
            of all these are the genuine composition of Diogenes. And <lb/>
            Satyrus affirms that the tragedies are the work of Philiscus, <lb/>
            the Æginetan, a friend of Diogenes. But Sotion, in his <lb/>
            seventh book, says that these are the only genuine works of <lb/>
            Diogenes: a dialogue on Virtue; another on the Good; <lb/>
            another on Love; the Beggar ; the Solmæus; the Leopard; <lb/>
            the Cassander; the Cephalion; and that the Aristarchus, the <lb/>
             <pb n="248"/>
            Sisyphus, the Ganymede, a volume of Apophthegms, and <lb/>
            another of Letters, are all the work of Philiscus.</p>
          <p>XIII. There were five persons of the name of Diogenes. <lb/>
            The first a native of Apollonia, a natural philosopher; and <lb/>
            the beginning of his treatise on Natural Philosophy is as <lb/>
            follows: " It appears to me to be well for every one who <lb/>
            commences any kind of philosophical treatise, to lay down <lb/>
            some undeniable principle to start with." The second was a <lb/>
            Sicymian, who wrote an account of Peloponnesus. The third <lb/>
            was the man of whom we have been speaking. The fourth <lb/>
            was a Stoic, a native of Seleucia, but usually called a Baby- <lb/>
            lonian, from the proximity of Seleucia to Babylon. The <lb/>
            fifth was a native of Tarsus, who wrote on the subject of some <lb/>
            questions concerning poetry which he endeavours to solve.</p>
          <p>XIV. Athenodorus, in the eighth book of his Conversations,, <lb/>
            says, that the philosopher always had a shining appearance, <lb/>
            from his habit of anointing himself.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF MONIMUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. MONIMUS was a Syracusan, and a pupil of Diogenes, but <lb/>
            also a slave of some Corinthian money-changer, as Sosicrates <lb/>
            tells us. Xeniades, who bought Diogenes, used often to come <lb/>
            to him, extolling the excellency of Diogenes both in actions <lb/>
            and words, till he excited a great affection for the mail in the <lb/>
            mind of Monimus. For he immediately feigned madness, <lb/>
            and threw about all the money and all the coins that were <lb/>
            on the table, until his master discarded him, and then he <lb/>
            straightway went to Diogenes and became his pupil. He also <lb/>
            followed Crates the Cynic a good deal, and devoted himself to <lb/>
            the same studies as be did; and the sight of this conduct of <lb/>
            his made his master all the more think him mad.</p>
          <p>II. And he was a very eminent man, so that even Menander, <lb/>
            the comic poet, speaks of him; accordingly, in one of his <lb/>
            plays, namely in the Hippocomus, he mentions him thus :— <lb/>
            There is a man, 0 Philo, named Monimus, <lb/>
            A wise man, though but little known, and one <lb/>
             <pb n="249"/>
            Who bears a wallet at his back, and is not <lb/>
            Content with one but three. He never spoke <lb/>
            A single sentence, by great Jove I swear, <lb/>
            Like this one, " Know thyself," or any other <lb/>
            Of the oft-quoted proverbs : all such sayings <lb/>
            He scorned, as he did beg his way through dirt; <lb/>
            Teaching that all opinion is but vanity.</p>
          <p>But he was a man of such gravity that he despised glory, and <lb/>
            sought only for truth.</p>
          <p>III. He wrote some jests mingled with serious treatises, <lb/>
            and two essays on the Appetites, and an Exhortation.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF ONESICRITUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. OSNESICRITUS is called by some authors an Æginetan, <lb/>
            but Demetrius the Magnesian affirms that he was a native of <lb/>
            Astypalæa. He also was one of the most eminent of the <lb/>
            disciples of Diogenes.</p>
          <p>II. And he appears in some points to resemble Xenophon. <lb/>
            For Xenophon joined in the expedition of Cyrus, and Onesi- <lb/>
            critus in that of Alexander; and Xenophon wrote the <lb/>
            Cyropædia, and Onesicritus wrote an account of the education <lb/>
            of Alexander. Xenophon, too, wrote a Panegyric on Cyrus, <lb/>
            and Onesicritus one on Alexander. They were also both <lb/>
            similar to one another in style, except that a copyist is <lb/>
            naturally inferior to the original.</p>
          <p>III. Menander, too, who was surnamed Drymus, was a pupil <lb/>
            of Diogenes, and a great admirer of Homer: and so was <lb/>
            Hegesæus of Sinope, who was nicknamed Clocus, and Philiscus <lb/>
            the Æginetan, as we have said before.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF CRATES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. CRATES was a Theban by birth, and the son of Ascondus. <lb/>
            He also was one of the eminent disciples of the Cynic. But <lb/>
            Hippobotus asserts that he was not a pupil of Diogenes, but <lb/>
            of Bryson the Achaean.</p><pb n="250"/>
            
          <p>II. There are the following sportive lines of his quoted:- <lb/>
            The waves surround vain Peres' fruitful soil, <lb/>
            And fertile acres crown the sea-born isle; <lb/>
            Land which no parasite e'er dares invade, <lb/>
            Or lewd seducer of a hapless maid ; <lb/>
            It bears figs, bread, thyme, garlic's savoury charms, <lb/>
            Gifts which ne'er tempt men to detested arms, <lb/>
            They'd rather fight for gold than glory's dreams.</p>
          <p>There is also an account-book of his much spoken of, which <lb/>
            is drawn up in such terms as these :— <lb/>
            Put down the cook for minas half a score, <lb/>
            Put down the doctor for a drachma more : <lb/>
            Five talents to the flatterer; some smoke <lb/>
            To the adviser, an obol and a cloak <lb/>
            For the philosopher ; for the willing nymph, <lb/>
            A talent ....</p>
          <p>He was also nicknamed Door-opener, because he used to <lb/>
            enter every house and give the inmates advice. These lines, <lb/>
            too, are his :— <lb/>
            All this I learnt and pondered in my mind, <lb/>
            Drawing deep wisdom from the Muses kind, <lb/>
            But all the rest is vanity.</p>
          <p>There is a line, too, which tells us that he gained from <lb/>
            philosophy:- <lb/>
            A peck of lupins, and to care for nobody.</p>
          <p>This, too, is attributed to him:— <lb/>
            Hunger checks love; and should it not, time does. <lb/>
            If both should fail you, then a halter choose.</p>
          <p>III. He flourished about the hundred and thirteenth <lb/>
            olympiad.</p>
          <p>IV. Antisthenes, in his Successions, says that he, having <lb/>
            once, in a certain tragedy, seen Telephus holding a date basket, <lb/>
            and in a miserable plight in other respects, betook himself to <lb/>
            the Cynic philosophy; and having turned his patrimony into <lb/>
            money (for he was of illustrious extraction), he collected three <lb/>
            hundred talents by that means, and divided them among the <lb/>
            citizens. And after that he devoted himself to philosophy <lb/>
            with such eagerness, that even Philemon the comic poet <lb/>
            mentions him. Accordingly he says :— <lb/>
             <pb n="251"/>
            And in the summer he'd a shaggy gown, <lb/>
            To inure himself to hardship : in the winter <lb/>
            He wore mere rags.</p>
          <p>But Diodes says that it was Diogenes who persuaded him <lb/>
            to discard all his estate and his flocks, and to throw his <lb/>
            money into the sea; and he says further, that the house of <lb/>
            Crates was destroyed by Alexander, and that of Hipparchia <lb/>
            under Philip. And he would very frequently drive away with <lb/>
            his staff those of his relations who came after him, and <lb/>
            endeavoured to dissuade him from his design; and he remained <lb/>
            immoveable.</p>
          <p>V. Demetrius, the Magnesian, relates that he deposited his <lb/>
            money with a banker, making an agreement with him, that if <lb/>
            his sons turned out ordinary ignorant people, he was then to <lb/>
            restore it to them; but if they became philosophers, then he <lb/>
            was to divide it among the people, for that they, if they were <lb/>
            philosophers, would have no need of anything. And Eratos- <lb/>
            thenes tells us that he had by Hipparchia, whom we shall men- <lb/>
            tion hereafter, a son whose name was Pasicles, and that when <lb/>
            he grew up, he took him to a brothel kept by a female slave, <lb/>
            and told him that that was all the marriage that his father <lb/>
            designed for him; but that marriages which resulted in adul- <lb/>
            tery were themes for tragedians, and had exile and bloodshed <lb/>
            for their prizes; and the marriages of those who lived with <lb/>
            courtesans were subjects for the comic poets, and often pro- <lb/>
            duced madness as the result of debauchery and drunkenness.</p>
          <p>VI. He had also a brother named Pasicles, a pupil of <lb/>
            Euclides.</p>
          <p>VII. Phavorinus, in the second book of his Commentaries, <lb/>
            relates a witty saying of his; for he says, that once, when he <lb/>
            was begging a favour of the master of a gymnasium, on the <lb/>
            behalf of some acquaintance, he touched his thighs; and as <lb/>
            he expressed his indignation at this, he said, " Why, do they <lb/>
            not belong to you as well as your knees?" He used to say <lb/>
            that it was impossible to find a man who had never done wrong, <lb/>
            in the same way as there was always some worthless seed in <lb/>
            a pomegranate. On one occasion he provoked Nicodromus, <lb/>
            the harp-player, and received a black eye from him ; so he <lb/>
            put a plaster on his forehead and wrote upon it, "Nicodromus <lb/>
            did this." He used to abuse prostitutes designedly, for the <lb/>
            purpose of practising himself in enduring reproaches. When <lb/>
             <pb n="252"/>
            Demetrius Phalereus sent him some loaves and wine, he <lb/>
            attacked him for his present, saying, " I wish that the foun- <lb/>
            tains bore loaves;" and it is notorious that he was a water <lb/>
            drinker.</p>
          <p>He was once reproved by the sediles of the Athenians, for <lb/>
            wearing fine linen, and so he replied, " I will show you Theo- <lb/>
            phrastus also clad in fine linen." And as they did not believe <lb/>
            him, he took them to a barber's shop, and showed him to them <lb/>
            as he was being shaved. At Thebes he was once scourged by <lb/>
            the master of the Gymnasium, (though some say it was by <lb/>
            Euthycrates, at Corinth), and dragged out by the feet; but he <lb/>
            did not care, and quoted the line :— <lb/>
            I feel, 0 mighty chief, your matchless might, <lb/>
            Dragged, foot first, downward from th' ethereal height.*</p>
          <p>But Diodes says that it was by Menedemus, of Eretria, <lb/>
            that he was dragged in this manner, for that as he was a <lb/>
            handsome man, and supposed to be very obsequious to Ascle- <lb/>
            piades, the Phliasian, Crates touched his thighs and said, " Is <lb/>
            Asclepiades within ?" And Menedemus was very much <lb/>
            offended, and dragged him out, as has been already said; and <lb/>
            then Crates quoted the above-cited line.</p>
          <p>VIII. Zeno, the Cittiæan, in his Apophthegms, says, that <lb/>
            he once sewed up a sheep's fleece in his cloak, without think- <lb/>
            ing of it; and he was a very ugly man, and one who excited <lb/>
            laughter when he was taking exercise. And he used to say, <lb/>
            when he put up his hands, " Courage, Crates, as far as your <lb/>
            eyes and the rest of your body is concerned;-</p>
          <p>IX. " For you shall see those who now ridicule you, con- <lb/>
            vulsed with disease, and envying your happiness, and accusing <lb/>
            themselves of slothfulness." One of his sayings was, " That <lb/>
            a man ought to study philosophy, up to the point of looking <lb/>
            on generals and donkey-drivers in the same light." Another <lb/>
            was, that those who live with flatterers, are as desolate as <lb/>
            calves when in the company of wolves; for that neither the <lb/>
            one nor the other are with those whom they ought to be, or <lb/>
            their own kindred, but only with those who are plotting <lb/>
            against them.</p>
          <p>X. When he felt that he was dying, he made verses on <lb/>
            himself, saying:- <note type="footnote"> * This is a parody on Homer. Il. 591. Pope's Version, 760. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="253"/>
            You're going, noble hunchback, you are going <lb/>
            To Pluto's realms, bent double by old age.</p>
          <p>For he was humpbacked from age.</p>
          <p>XI. When Alexander asked him whether he wished to see <lb/>
            the restoration of his country, he said, " What would be the <lb/>
            use of it ? for perhaps some other Alexander would come at <lb/>
            some future time and destroy it again.</p>
          <p>“ But poverty and dear obscurity, <lb/>
            Are what a prudent man should think his country ; <lb/>
            For these e'en fortune can't deprive him of."</p>
          <p>He also said that he was :- <lb/>
            A fellow countryman of wise Diogenes, <lb/>
            Whom even envy never had attacked.</p>
          <p>Menander, in his Twin-sister, mentions him thus :— <lb/>
            For you will walk with me wrapped in your cloak, <lb/>
            As his wife used to with the Cynic Crates.</p>
          <p>XII. He gave his daughter to his pupils, as he himself <lb/>
            used to say :- <lb/>
            To have and keep on trial for a month.</p>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF METROCLES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. METROCLES was the brother of Hipparchia; and though <lb/>
            he had formerly been a pupil of Theophrastus, he had <lb/>
            profited so little by his instructions, that once, thinking <lb/>
            that, while listening to a lecture on philosophy, he had dis- <lb/>
            graced himself by his inattention, he fell into despondency, <lb/>
            and shut himself up in his house, intending to starve himself <lb/>
            to death. Accordingly, when Crates heard of it, he came to <lb/>
            him, having been sent for; and eating a number of lupins, on <lb/>
            purpose, he persuaded him by numbers of arguments, that he <lb/>
            had done no harm ; for that it was not to be expected that a <lb/>
            man should not indulge his natural inclinations and habits; <lb/>
            and he comforted him by showing him that he, in a similar <lb/>
            case, would certainly have behaved in a similar manner. <lb/>
             <pb n="254"/>
            And after that, he became a pupil of Crates, and a man of <lb/>
            great eminence as a philosopher.</p>
          <p>II. He burnt all his writings, as Hecaton tells us in the <lb/>
            first book of his Apophthegms, and said :— <lb/>
            These are the phantoms of infernal dreams ;</p>
          <p>As if he meant that they were all nonsense. But some say <lb/>
            that it was the notes which he had taken of the lectures of <lb/>
            Theophrastus which he burnt, quoting the following verse: <lb/>
            Vulcan, draw near, 'tis Thetis asks your aid.*</p>
          <p>III. He used to say that some things could be bought <lb/>
            with money, as for instance a house; and some with time and <lb/>
            industry, as education; that wealth was mischievous; if a <lb/>
            man did not use it properly.</p>
          <p>IV. He died at a great age, having suffocated himself.</p>
          <p>V. His pupils were Theomentus and Cleomenes, Deme- <lb/>
            trius of Alexandria, the son of Theombrotus, Timarchus of <lb/>
            Alexandria, the. son of Cleomenes, and Echecles, of Ephesus. <lb/>
            Not but what Echecles was also a pupil of Theombrotus; and <lb/>
            Menedemus, of whom we shall speak hereafter, was his pupil. <lb/>
            Menippus, of Sinope, too, was a very eminent person in his <lb/>
            school.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF HIPPARCHIA.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. HIPPAKCHIA, the sister of Metrocles, was charmed among <lb/>
            others, by the doctrines of this school.</p>
          <p>II. Both she and Metrocles were natives of Maronea. She <lb/>
            fell in love with both the doctrines and manners of Crates, <lb/>
            and could not be diverted from her regard for him, by either <lb/>
            the wealth, or high birth, or personal beauty, of any of her <lb/>
            suitors, but Crates was everything to her; and she threatened <lb/>
            her parents to make away with herself, if she were not given <lb/>
            in marriage to him. Crates accordingly, being entreated by <lb/>
            her parents to dissuade her from this resolution, did all be <note type="footnote"> * Horn. IL 2. 395. Pope'a version, 460. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="255"/>
            could; and at last, as he could not persuade her, he rose up, <lb/>
            and placing all his furniture before her, he said, " This is the <lb/>
            bridegroom whom you are choosing, and this is the whole of <lb/>
            his property; consider these facts, for it will not be possible <lb/>
            for you to become his partner, if you do not also apply your- <lb/>
            self to the same studies, and conform to the same habits <lb/>
            that he does." But the girl chose him; and assuming the <lb/>
            same dress that he wore, went about with him as her husband, <lb/>
            and appeared with him in public everywhere, and went to <lb/>
            all entertainments in his company.</p>
          <p>III. And once when she went to sup with Lysimachus, she <lb/>
            attacked. Theodorus, who was surnamed the Atheist; propos- <lb/>
            ing to him the following sophism; "What Theodorus could <lb/>
            not be called wrong for doing, that same thing Hipparchia <lb/>
            ought not to be called wrong for doing. But Theodorus does <lb/>
            no wrong when he beats himself; therefore Hipparchia does <lb/>
            no wrong when she beats Theodorus." He made no reply to <lb/>
            what she said, but only pulled her clothes about; but Hippar- <lb/>
            chia was neither offended nor ashamed, as- many a woman <lb/>
            would have been; but when he said to her :— <lb/>
            " Who is the woman who has left the shuttle <lb/>
            So near the warp ?'*</p>
          <p>“I, Theodorus, am that person," she replied; "but do I <lb/>
            appear to you to have come to a wrong decision, if I devote <lb/>
            that time to philosophy, which I otherwise should have spent <lb/>
            at the loom?" And these and many other sayings are <lb/>
            reported of this female philosopher.</p>
          <p>IV. There is also a volume of letters of Crates t extant, in <lb/>
            which he philosophizes most excellently; and in style is very <lb/>
            little inferior to Plato. He also wrote some tragedies, which <lb/>
            are imbued with a very sublime spirit of philosophy, of which <lb/>
            the following lines are a specimen :— <lb/>
            'Tis not one town, nor one poor single house, <lb/>
            That is my country; but in every land <lb/>
            Each city and each dwelling seems to me, <lb/>
            A place for my reception ready made.</p>
          <p>And he died at a great age, and was buried in Bœotia. <note type="footnote"> * This line is from the Bacchæ of Euripides, v. 1228. </note><note type="footnote"> t From this last paragraph it is inferred by some critics, that origin- <lb/>

          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF MENIPPUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. MENIPPUS was also a Cynic, and a Phœnician by descent, <lb/>
            a slave by birth, as Achaicus tells us in his Ethics; and Diodes <lb/>
            informs us that his master was a native of Pontus, of the <lb/>
            name of Baton; but that subsequently, in consequence of his <lb/>
            importunities and miserly habits, he became rich, and obtained <lb/>
            the rights of citizenship at Corinth.</p>
          <p>II. He never wrote anything serious ; but his writings are <lb/>
            full of ridiculous matter; and in some respects similar to <lb/>
            those of Meleager, who was his contemporary. And Hermip- <lb/>
            pus tells us that he was a man who lent money at daily <lb/>
            interest, and that he was called a usurer; for lie used to <lb/>
            lend on nautical usury, and take security, so that he amassed <lb/>
            a very great amount of riches.</p>
          <p>III. But at last he fell into a snare, and lost all his money, <lb/>
            and in a fit of despair he hung himself, and so he died. And <lb/>
            we have written a playful epigram on him:— <lb/>
            This man was a Syrian by birth, <lb/>
            And a Cretan usurious hound, <lb/>
            As the name he was known by sets forth ; <lb/>
            You've heard of him oft I'll be bound ; <lb/>
            His name was Menippus—men entered his house, <lb/>
            And stole all his goods without leaving a louse, <lb/>
            When (from this the dog's nature you plainly may tell) <lb/>
            He hung himself up, and so went off to hell.</p>
          <p>IV. But some say that the books attributed to him are not <lb/>
            really his work, but are the composition of Dionysius and <lb/>
            Zopyrus the Colophonians, who wrote them out of joke, and <lb/>
            then gave them to him as a man well able to dispose of them.</p>
          <p>V. There were six persons of the name <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἵΜ</foreign>enippus; the <lb/>
            first was the man who wrote a history of the Lydians, and <lb/>
            made an abridgment of Xanthus; the second was this man of <lb/>
            whom we have been speaking; the third was a sophist of <lb/>
            Stratonice, a Carian by descent; the fourth was a statuary: <lb/>
            the fifth and the sixth were painters, and they are both men- <lb/>
            tioned by Apollodorus.</p>
          <p>VI. The writings left by the Cynic amount to thirteen <lb/>
            volumes; a Description of the Dead ; a volume called Wills ; <lb/>
             <pb n="257"/>
            a volume of Letters in which the Gods are introduced; treatises <lb/>
            addressed to the Natural Philosophers, and Mathematicians, <lb/>
            and Grammarians ; one on the Generations of Epicurus, and on <lb/>
            the Observance of the Twentieth Day by the philosophers of <lb/>
            his school; and one or two other essays.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">THE LIFE OF MENEDEMUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. MENEDEMUS was a disciple of Celotes of Lampsacus.</p>
          <p>II. He proceeded, as Hippobotus tells, to such a great degree <lb/>
            of superstition, that he assumed the garb of a fury, and went <lb/>
            about saying that he had come from hell to take notice of all <lb/>
            who did wrong, in order that he might descend thither again <lb/>
            and make his report to the deities who abode in that country. <lb/>
            And this was his dress: a tunic of a dark colour reaching to his <lb/>
            feet, and a purple girdle round his waist, an Arcadian hat on <lb/>
            his head with the twelve signs of the zodiac embroidered <lb/>
            on it, tragic buskins, a preposterously long beard, and an ashen <lb/>
            staff in his hand.</p>
          <p>III. These then are the lives of each of the Cynics ; and we <lb/>
            shall also subjoin some of the doctrines which they all held in <lb/>
            common, if indeed it is not an abuse of language to call that a <lb/>
            sect of philosophy at all, instead of, as some contend it should <lb/>
            be termed, a mere system of life.</p>
          <p>They wished to abolish the whole system of logic and natural <lb/>
            philosophy, like Aristo of Chios, and thought that men should <lb/>
            study nothing but ethics; and what some people assert of <lb/>
            Socrates was described by Diodes as a characteristic of Dio- <lb/>
            genes, for he said that his doctrine was, that a man ought to <lb/>
            investigate- <lb/>
            Only the good and ill that taketh place <lb/>
            Within our houses.</p>
          <p>They also discard aIr liberal studies. Accordingly, Antis- <lb/>
            thenes said that wise men only applied themselves to litera- <lb/>
            ture and learning for the sake of perverting others ; they also <lb/>
            wish to abolish geometry and music, and everything of that <note type="footnote"> S </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="258"/>
            kind. Accordingly, Diogenes said once to a person who was <lb/>
            showing him a clock; " It is a very useful thing to save a <lb/>
            man from being too late for supper." And once when a man <lb/>
            made an exhibition of musical skill before him, he said ;- <lb/>
            " Cities are governed,, so are houses too, <lb/>
            By wisdom, not by harp-playing and whistling." *</p>
          <p>Their doctrine is, that the chief good of mankind is to live <lb/>
            according to virtue, as Antisthenes says in his Hercules, in <lb/>
            which they resemble the Stoics. For those two sects have a <lb/>
            good deal in common with one another, on which account they <lb/>
            themselves say that cynicism is a short road to virtue ; and <lb/>
            Zeno, the Cittiæan lived in the same manner.</p>
          <p>They also teach that men ought to live simply, using only <lb/>
            plain food in moderate quantities, wearing nothing but a cloak, <lb/>
            and despising riches, and glory, and nobleness of birth; ac- <lb/>
            cordingly some of them feed upon nothing beyond herbs and <lb/>
            cold water, living in any shelter that they can find, or in tubs <lb/>
            as Diogenes did; for he used to say that it was the peculiar <lb/>
            property of the Gods to want nothing, and that, therefore, <lb/>
            when a man wished for nothing he was like the Gods.</p>
          <p>Another of their doctrines is, that virtue is a thing which <lb/>
            may be taught, as Antisthenes affirms in his Heraclides ; and <lb/>
            that when it has once been attained it can never be lost. <lb/>
            They also say that the wise man deserves to be loved, and <lb/>
            cannot commit error, and is a friend to every one who resem- <lb/>
            bles him, and that he leaves nothing to fortune. And every- <lb/>
            thing which is unconnected with either virtue or vice they call <lb/>
            indifferent, agreeing in this with Aristo, the Chian.</p>
          <p>These then were the Cynics; and now we must pass on to <lb/>
            the Stoics, of which sect the founder was Zeno, who had been <lb/>
            a disciple of Crates. <note type="footnote"> * This a parody on two lines in the Antiope of Euripides. </note> <figure type="illustration">

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF ZENO.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. ZENO was the son of Innaseas, or Demeas, and a native <lb/>
            of Citium, in Cyprus, which is a Grecian city, partly occupied <lb/>
            by a Phœnician colony,</p>
          <p>II. He had his head naturally bent on one side, as Timo- <lb/>
            thens, the Athenian, tells us, in his work on Lives. And <lb/>
            Apollonius, the Tyrian, says that he was thin, very tall, of a <lb/>
            dark complexion; in reference to which some one once called <lb/>
            him an Egyptian Clematis, as Chrysippus relates in the first <lb/>
            volume of his Proverbs: he had fat, flabby, weak legs, on <lb/>
            which account Persæus, in his Convivial Reminiscences, says <lb/>
            that he used to refuse many invitations to supper; and he <lb/>
            was very fond, as it is said, of figs both fresh and dried in <lb/>
            the sun.</p>
          <p>III. He was a pupil, as has been already stated, of Crates. <lb/>
            After that, they say that he became a pupil of Stilpon and of <lb/>
            Xenocrates, for ten years, as Timocrates relates in his Life of <lb/>
            Dion. He is also said to have been a pupil of Polemo. But <lb/>
            Hecaton, and Apollonius, of Tyre, in the first book of his <lb/>
            essay on Zeno, say that when he consulted the oracle, as to <lb/>
            what he ought to do to live in the most excellent manner, the <lb/>
            God answered him that he ought to become of the same <lb/>
            complexion as the dead, on which he inferred that he ought <lb/>
            to apply himself to the reading of the books of the ancients. <lb/>
            Accordingly, he attached himself to Crates in the following <lb/>
            manner. Having purchased a quantity of purple from Phœnicia, <lb/>
            he was shipwrecked close to the Piraeus ; and when he had <lb/>
            made his way from the coast as far as Athens, he sat down by <lb/>
            a bookseller's stall, being now about thirty years of age. And <lb/>
            as he took up the second book of Xenophon's Memorabilia and <lb/>
            began to read it, he was delighted with it, and asked where <lb/>
            such men as were described in that book lived; and as Crates <lb/>
            happened very seasonably to pass at the moment, the book- <lb/>
            seller pointed him out, and said, " Follow that man." From <note type="footnote">6 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="260"/>
            that time forth he became a pupil of Crates ; but though he <lb/>
            was in other respects very energetic in his application to <lb/>
            philosophy, still he was too modest for the shamelessness of <lb/>
            the Cynics. On which account, Crates, wishing to cure him <lb/>
            of this false shame, gave him a jar of lentil porridge to carry <lb/>
            through the Ceramicus; and when he saw that he was <lb/>
            ashamed, and that he endeavoured to hide it, he struck the <lb/>
            jar with his staff, and broke it; and, as Zeno fled away, and <lb/>
            the lentil porridge ran all down his legs, Crates called after <lb/>
            him, “Why do you run away, my little Phoenician, you have <lb/>
            done no harm ?" For some time then he continued a pupil of <lb/>
            Crates, and when he wrote his treatise entitled the Republic, <lb/>
            some said, jokingly, that he had written it upon the tail of the <lb/>
            dog.</p>
          <p>IV. And besides his Republic, he was the author also of the <lb/>
            following works : -a treatise on a Life according to Nature ; <lb/>
            one on Appetite, or the Nature of Man ; one on Passions ; <lb/>
            one on the Becoming ; one on Law ; one on the usual Edu- <lb/>
            cation of the Greeks ; one on Sight; one on the Whole ; one <lb/>
            on Signs; one on the Doctrines of the Pythagoreans; one on <lb/>
            Things in General; one on Styles ; five essays on Problems <lb/>
            relating to Homer ; one on the Bearing of the Poets. There <lb/>
            is also an essay on Art by him, and two books of Solutions <lb/>
            and Jests, and Reminiscences, and one called the Ethics of <lb/>
            Crates. These are the books of which he was the author.</p>
          <p>V. But at last he left Crates, and became the pupil of the <lb/>
            philosophers whom I have mentioned before, and continued <lb/>
            with them for twenty years. So that it is related that he said, <lb/>
            “I now find that I made a prosperous voyage when I was <lb/>
            wrecked." But some affirm that he made this speech in <lb/>
            reference to Crates. Others say, that while he was staying at <lb/>
            Athens he heard of a shipwreck, and said, " Fortune does well <lb/>
            in having driven us on philosophy." But as some relate the <lb/>
            affair, he was not wrecked at all, but sold all his cargo at <lb/>
            Athens, and then turned to philosophy.</p>
          <p>VI. And he used to walk up and down in the beautiful <lb/>
            colonnade which is called the Priscanactium, and which is also <lb/>
            called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποιϰίλη</foreign>,from the paintings of Polygnotus, and there he <lb/>
            delivered his discourses, wishing to make that spot tranquil; <lb/>
            for in the time of the thirty, nearly fourteen hundred of the <lb/>
            citizens had been murdered there by them.</p><pb n="261"/>
            
          <p>VII. Accordingly, for the future, men came thither to hear <lb/>
            him, and from this his pupils were called Stoics, and so were <lb/>
            his successors also, who had been at first called Zenonians, as <lb/>
            Epicurus tells us in his Epistles. And before this time, the <lb/>
            poets who frequented this colonnade (<foreign xml:lang="grc">στοὰ</foreign>)had been called <lb/>
            Stoics, as we are informed by Eratosthenes, in the eighth book <lb/>
            of his treatise on the Old Comedy; but now Zeno's pupils <lb/>
            made the name more notorious. Now the Athenians had a <lb/>
            great respect for Zeno, so that they gave him the keys of their <lb/>
            walls, and they also honoured him with a golden crown, and a <lb/>
            brazen statue ; and this was also done by his own countrymen, <lb/>
            who thought the statue of such a man an honour to their city. <lb/>
            And the Cittiæans, in the district of Sidon, also claimed him as <lb/>
            their countryman.</p>
          <p>VIII. He was also much respected by Antigonus, who, <lb/>
            whenever he came to Athens, used to attend his lectures, and <lb/>
            was constantly inviting him to come to him. But he begged <lb/>
            off himself, and sent Persæus, one of his intimate friends, who <lb/>
            was the son of Demetrius, and a Cittiæan by birth, and who <lb/>
            flourished about the hundred and thirtieth olympiad, when <lb/>
            Zeno was an old man. The letter of Antigonus to Zeno was <lb/>
            as follows, and it is reported by Apollonius, the Syrian, in <lb/>
            his essay on Zeno.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">KING ANTIGONUS TO ZENO THE PHILOSOPHER, GREETING.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>" I think that in good fortune and glory I have the advan- <lb/>
            tage of you; but in reason and education I am inferior to you, <lb/>
            and also in that perfect happiness which you have attained to. <lb/>
            On which account I have thought it good to address you, and <lb/>
            invite you to come to me, being convinced that you will not <lb/>
            refuse what is asked of you. Endeavour, therefore, by all <lb/>
            , means to come to me, considering this fact, that you will not <lb/>
            be the instructor of me alone, but of all the Macedonians <lb/>
            together. For he who instructs the ruler of the Macedonians, <lb/>
            and who leads him in the path of virtue, evidently marshals <lb/>
            all his subjects on the road to happiness. For as the ruler is, <lb/>
            so is it natural that his subjects for the most part should be <lb/>
            also."</p>
          <p>And Zeno wrote him back the following answer.</p><pb n="262"/>
            
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">ZENO TO KING ANTIGONUS, GREETING.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>" I admire your desire for learning, as being a true object <lb/>
            for the wishes of mankind, and one too that tends to their <lb/>
            advantage. And the mail who aims at the study of philosophy <lb/>
            has a proper disregard for the popular kind of instruction <lb/>
            which tends only to the corruption of the morals. And you, <lb/>
            passing by the pleasure which is so much spoken of, which <lb/>
            makes the minds of some young men effeminate, show plainly <lb/>
            that you are inclined to noble pursuits, not merely by your <lb/>
            nature, but also by your own deliberate choice. And a noble <lb/>
            nature, when it has received even a slight degree of training, <lb/>
            and which also meets with those who will teach it abundantly, <lb/>
            proceeds without difficulty to a perfect attainment of virtue. <lb/>
            But I now find my bodily health impaired by old age, for I <lb/>
            am eighty years old: on which account I am unable to come <lb/>
            to you. But I send you some of those who have studied with <lb/>
            me, who in that learning which has reference to the soul, are <lb/>
            in no respect inferior to me, and in their bodily vigour are <lb/>
            greatly my superiors. And if you associate with them you <lb/>
            will want nothing that can bear upon perfect happiness."</p>
          <p>So he sent him Persæus and Philonides, the Theban, both <lb/>
            of whom are mentioned by Epicurus, in his letter to his <lb/>
            brother Aristobulus, as being companions of Antigonus.</p>
          <p>IX. And I have thought it worth while also to set down the <lb/>
            decree of the Athenians concerning him ; and it is couched in <lb/>
            the following language.</p>
          <p>In the archonship of Arrhenides, in the fifth presidency of <lb/>
            the tribe Acamantis, on the twenty-first day of the month <lb/>
            Maimacterion, on the twenty-third day of the aforesaid <lb/>
            presidency, in a duly convened assembly, Hippo, the son of <lb/>
            Cratistoteles, of the borough of Xypetion, being one of the <lb/>
            presidents, and the rest of the presidents, his colleagues, put <lb/>
            the following decree to the vote. And the decree was pro- <lb/>
            posed by Thrason, of Anacæa, the son of Thrason.</p>
          <p>" Since Zeno the son of Innaseas, the Cittiæan, has passed <lb/>
            many years in the city, in the study of philosophy, being in <lb/>
            all other respects a good man, and also exhorting all the <lb/>
            young men who have sought his company to the practice of <lb/>
            virtue, and encouraging them in the practice of temperance ; <lb/>
            making his own life a model to all men of the greatest <lb/>
             <pb n="263"/>
            excellence, since it has in every respect corresponded to the <lb/>
            doctrines which he has taught; it has been determined by the <lb/>
            people (and may the determination be fortunate), to praise <lb/>
            Zeno, the son of Innaseas, the Cittiæan, and to present him <lb/>
            with a golden crown in accordance with the law, on account of <lb/>
            his virtue and temperance, and to build him a tomb in <lb/>
            the Ceramicus, at the public expense. And the people has <lb/>
            appointed by its vote five men from among the citizens of <lb/>
            Athens, who shall see to the making of the crown and the <lb/>
            building of the tomb. And the scribe of the borough shall <lb/>
            enrol the decree and engrave it on two pillars, and he shall be <lb/>
            permitted to place one pillar in the Academy, and one in the <lb/>
            Lyceum. And he who is appointed to superintend the work <lb/>
            shall divide the expense that the pillars amount to, in such a <lb/>
            way that every one may understand that the whole people of <lb/>
            Athens honours good men both while they are living and after <lb/>
            they are dead. And Thrason of Anaceea, Philocles of the <lb/>
            Piræus, Phædrus of Anaphlystos, Medon of Acharnæs, Mecy- <lb/>
            thus of Sypalyttas, and Dion of Pæania, are hereby appointed <lb/>
            to superintend the building of the tomb."</p>
          <p>These then are the terms of the decree.</p>
          <p>X. But Antigonus, of Carystos, says, that Zeno himself <lb/>
            never denied that he was a native of Cittium. For that when <lb/>
            on one occasion, there was a citizen of that town who had <lb/>
            contributed to the building of some baths, and was having his <lb/>
            name engraved on the pillar, as the countryman of Zeno the <lb/>
            philosopher, he bade them add, " Of Cittium."</p>
          <p>XI. And at another time, when he had bad a hollow <lb/>
            covering made for some vessel, he carried it about for some <lb/>
            money, in order to procure present relief for some difficulties <lb/>
            which were distressing Crates his master. And they say that <lb/>
            he, when he first arrived in Greece, had more than a thousand <lb/>
            talents, which he lent out at nautical usury.</p>
          <p>XII. And he used to eat little loaves and honey, and to <lb/>
            drink a small quantity of sweet smelling wine.</p>
          <p>XIII. He had very few youthful acquaintances of the male <lb/>
            sex, and he did not cultivate them much, lest be should be <lb/>
            thought to be a misogynist. And he dwelt in the same house <lb/>
            with Persseus ; and once, when he brought in a female flute- <lb/>
            player to him, he hastened to bring her back to him.</p>
          <p>XIV. And he was, it is said, of a very accommodating <lb/>
             <pb n="264"/>
            temper; so much so, that Antigonus, the king, often came to <lb/>
            dine with him, and often carried him off to dine with him, at <lb/>
            the house of Aristocles the harp-player; but when he was <lb/>
            there, he would presently steal away,</p>
          <p>XV, It is also said that he avoided a crowd with great care, <lb/>
            so that he used to sit at the end of a bench, in order at all <lb/>
            events to avoid being incommoded on one side. And he never <lb/>
            used to walk with more than two or three companions. And <lb/>
            he used at times to exact a piece of money from all who came <lb/>
            to hear him, with a view of not being distressed by numbers ; <lb/>
            and this story is told by Cleantbes, in his. treatise on Brazen <lb/>
            Money. And when he was surrounded by any great crowd, he <lb/>
            would point to a balustrade of wood at the end of the- colonnade <lb/>
            which surrounded an altar, and say, " That was once in the <lb/>
            middle of this place, but it was placed apart because it was in <lb/>
            people's way ; and now, if you will only withdraw from the <lb/>
            middle here, you too will incommode me much less."</p>
          <p>XVI. And when Demochares, the son of Laches, embraced <lb/>
            him once, and said that he would tell Antigonus, or write to <lb/>
            him of everything which he wanted, as he always did every- <lb/>
            thing for him, Zeno, when he had heard him say this, avoided <lb/>
            his company for the future. And it is said, that after the <lb/>
            death of Zeno, Antigonus said, " What a spectacle have I lost." <lb/>
            On which account he employed Thrason, their ambassador, to <lb/>
            entreat of the Athenians to allow him to be buried in the <lb/>
            Ceramicus. And when he was asked why he had such an <lb/>
            admiration for him, he replied, " Because, though I gave him a <lb/>
            great many important presents, he was never elated, and never <lb/>
            humbled.”</p>
          <p>XVII. He was a man of a very investigating spirit, and <lb/>
            one who inquired very minutely into everything ; in reference <lb/>
            to which, Timon, in his Silli, speaks thus :- <lb/>
            I saw an aged woman of Phœnicia, <lb/>
            Hungry and covetous, in a proud obscurity, <lb/>
            Longing for everything. She had a basket <lb/>
            So full of holes that it retained nothing. <lb/>
            Likewise her mind was less than a simdapsus.*</p>
          <p>He used to study very carefully with Philo, the dialectician, <lb/>
            and to argue with him at their mutual leisure; on which <note type="footnote"> * A sort of guitar or violin. </note> <lb/>

            account he excited the wonder of the younger Zeno, no less <lb/>
            than Diodorus his master.</p>
          <p>XVIII. There were also a lot of dirty beggars always about <lb/>
            him, as Timon tells us, where he says :— <lb/>
            Till he collected a vast cloud of beggars, <lb/>
            Who were of all men in the world the poorest, <lb/>
            And the most worthless citizens of Athens.</p>
          <p>And he himself was a man of a morose and bitter countenance, <lb/>
            with a constantly frowning expression. He was very economical, <lb/>
            and descended even to the meanness of the barbarians, under <lb/>
            the pretence of economy.</p>
          <p>XIX. If he reproved any one, he did it with brevity and <lb/>
            without exaggeration, and as it were, at a distance. I allude, <lb/>
            for instance, to the way in which he spoke of a man who took <lb/>
            exceeding pains in setting himself off, for as he was crossing a <lb/>
            gutter with great hesitation, be said, " He is right to look <lb/>
            down upon the mud, for he cannot see himself in it." And <lb/>
            when some Cynic one day said that he had no oil in his cruise, <lb/>
            and asked him for some, he refused to give him any, but bade <lb/>
            him go away and consider which of the two was the more im- <lb/>
            pudent. He was very much in love with Chremonides; and <lb/>
            once, when he and Cleanthes were both sitting by him, he got <lb/>
            up; and as Cleanthes wondered at this, he said, " I hear from <lb/>
            skilful physicians that the best thing for some tumours is rest." <lb/>
            Once, when two people were sitting above him at table at a <lb/>
            banquet, and the one next him kept kicking the other with his <lb/>
            foot, he himself kicked him with his knee ; and when he turned <lb/>
            round upon him for doing so, he said, " Why then do you <lb/>
            think that your other neighbour is to be treated in this way by <lb/>
            you ? "</p>
          <p>On one occasion he said to a man who was very fond of <lb/>
            young boys, that " Schoolmasters who were always associating <lb/>
            with boys had no more intellect than the boys themselves." <lb/>
            He used also to say that the discourses of those men who were <lb/>
            careful to avoid solecisms, and to adhere to the strictest rules <lb/>
            of composition, were like Alexandrine money, they were pleas- <lb/>
            ing to the eye and well-formed like the coni, but were'nothing <lb/>
            the better for that; but those who were not so particular he <lb/>
            likened to the Attic tessedrachmas, which were struck at <lb/>
            random and without any great nicety, and so he said that their <lb/>
             <pb n="266"/>
            discourses often outweighed the more polished styles of the <lb/>
            others. And when Ariston, his disciple, had been holding <lb/>
            forth a good deal without much wit, but still in some points <lb/>
            with a good deal of readiness and confidence, he said to him, <lb/>
            " It would be impossible for you to speak thus, if your father <lb/>
            had not been drunk when he begat you ;”and for the same <lb/>
            reason he nicknamed him the chatterer, as he himself was very <lb/>
            concise in his speeches. Once, when he was in company with <lb/>
            an epicure who usually left nothing for his messmates, and <lb/>
            when a large fish was set before him, he took it all as if he <lb/>
            could eat the whole of it; and when the others looked at him <lb/>
            with astonishment, he said, “What then do you think that <lb/>
            your companions feel every day, if you cannot bear with my <lb/>
            gluttony for one day ? "</p>
          <p>On one occasion, when a youth was asking him questions <lb/>
            with a pertinacity unsuited to his age, he led him to a looking- <lb/>
            glass and bade him look at himself, and then asked him <lb/>
            whether such questions appeared suitable to the face he saw <lb/>
            there. And when a man said before him once, that in most <lb/>
            points he did not agree with the doctrines of Antisthenes, he <lb/>
            quoted to him an apophthegm of Sophocles, and asked him <lb/>
            whether he thought there was much sense in that, and when he <lb/>
            said that he did not know, “ Are you not then ashamed,” said <lb/>
            he, " to pick out and recollect anything bad which may have <lb/>
            been said by Antisthenes, but not to regard or remember what- <lb/>
            ever is said that is good ? " A man once said, that the say- <lb/>
            ings of the philosophers appeared to him very trivial; " You say <lb/>
            true," replied Zeno, " and their syllables too ought to be short, <lb/>
            if that is possible." When some one spoke to him of Polemo, <lb/>
            and said that he proposed one question for discussion and then <lb/>
            argued another, he became angry, and said, " At what value <lb/>
            did he estimate the subject that had been proposed ? " And <lb/>
            he said that a man who was to discuss a question ought to <lb/>
            have a loud voice and great energy, like the actors, but not to <lb/>
            open his mouth too wide, which those who speak a great deal <lb/>
            but only talk nonsense usually do. And he used to say that <lb/>
            there was no need for those who argued well to leave their <lb/>
            hearers room to look about them, as good workmen do who <lb/>
            want to have their work seen ; but that, on the contrary, those <lb/>
            who are listening to them ought to be so attentive to all that <lb/>
            is said as to have no leisure to take notes.</p><pb n="267"/>
            
          <p>Once when a young man was talking a great deal, he said, <lb/>
            " Your ears have run down into your tongue." On one occa- <lb/>
            sion a very handsome man was saying that a wise man did not <lb/>
            appear to him likely to fall in love ; " Then," said he, " I can- <lb/>
            not imagine anything that will be more miserable than you <lb/>
            good-looking fellows." He also used often to say that most <lb/>
            philosophers were wise in great things, but ignorant of petty <lb/>
            subjects and chance details ; and he used to cite the saying of <lb/>
            Caphesius, who, when one of his pupils was labouring hard to <lb/>
            be able to blow very powerfully, gave him a slap, and said, <lb/>
            that excellence did not depend upon greatness, but greatness <lb/>
            on excellence. Once, when a young man was arguing very <lb/>
            confidently, he said, " I should not like to say, 0 youth, all <lb/>
            that occurs to me." And once, when a handsome and wealthy <lb/>
            Rhodian, but one who had no other qualification, was pressing <lb/>
            him to take him as a pupil, he, as he was not inclined to re- <lb/>
            ceive him, first of all made him sit on the dusty seats that he <lb/>
            might dirt his cloak, then he put him down in the place of the <lb/>
            poor that he might rub against their rags, and at last the young <lb/>
            man went away. One of his sayings used to be, that vanity <lb/>
            was the most unbecoming of all things, and especially so in the <lb/>
            young. Another was, that one ought not to try and recollect <lb/>
            the exact words and expressions of a discourse, but to fix all <lb/>
            one's attention on the arrangement of the arguments, instead <lb/>
            of treating it as if it were a piece of boiled meat, or some deli- <lb/>
            cate eatable. He used also to say that young men ought to <lb/>
            maintain the most scrupulous reserve in their walking, their <lb/>
            gait, and their dress; and he was constantly quoting the lines <lb/>
            of Euripides on Capaneus, that- <lb/>
            His wealth was ample. <lb/>
            But yet no pride did mingle with his state, <lb/>
            Nor had he haughty thought, or arrogance, <lb/>
            More than the poorest man.</p>
          <p>And one of his sayings used to be, that nothing was more <lb/>
            unfriendly to the comprehension of the accurate sciences than <lb/>
            poetry ; and that there was nothing that we stood in so much <lb/>
            need of as time. When he was asked what a friend was, he <lb/>
            replied, " Another I." They say that he was once scourging <lb/>
            a slave whom he had detected in theft; and when he said to <lb/>
            him, " It was fated that I should steal;" he rejoined, " Yes, <lb/>
            and that you should be beaten." He used to call beauty the <lb/>
             <pb n="268"/>
            flower of the voice ; but some report this as if he had said that <lb/>
            the voice is the flower of beauty. On one occasion, when he <lb/>
            saw a slave belonging to one of his friends severely bruised, <lb/>
            he said to his friend, " I see the footsteps of your anger." He <lb/>
            once accosted a man who was all over unguents and perfumes, <lb/>
            "Who is this who smells like a woman?" When Dionysius <lb/>
            Metathemenus asked him why he was the only perssn whom <lb/>
            he did not correct, he replied, " Because I have no confidence <lb/>
            in you." A young man was talking a great deal of nonsense, <lb/>
            and he said to him, " This is the reason why we have two ears <lb/>
            and only one mouth, that we may hear more and speak less."</p>
          <p>Once, when he was at an entertainment and remained <lb/>
            wholly silent, he was asked what the reason was ; and so he <lb/>
            bade the person who found fault with him tell the king that <lb/>
            there was a man in the room who knew how to hold his tongue ; <lb/>
            now the people who asked him this were ambassadors who had <lb/>
            come from Ptolemy, and who wished to know what report they <lb/>
            were to make of him to the king. He was once asked how he <lb/>
            felt when people abused him, and he said, “As an ambassador <lb/>
            feels when he is sent away without an answer." Apollonius of <lb/>
            Tyre tells us, that when Crates dragged him by the cloak away <lb/>
            from Stilpo, he said, “ 0 Crates, the proper way to take hold <lb/>
            of philosophers is by the ears; so now do you convince me and <lb/>
            drag me by them; but if you use force towards me, my body <lb/>
            may be with you, but my mind with Stilpo."</p>
          <p>XX. He used to devote a good deal of time to Diodorus, as <lb/>
            we learn from Hippobotus; and he studied dialectics under <lb/>
            him. And when he had made a good deal of progress he <lb/>
            attached himself to Polemo because of his freedom from arro- <lb/>
            gance, so that it is reported that he said to him, " I am not <lb/>
            ignorant, 0 Zeno, that you slip into the garden-door and steal <lb/>
            my doctrines, and then clothe them in a Phœnician dress." <lb/>
            When a dialectician once showed him seven species of dialectic <lb/>
            argument in the mowing argument,* he asked him how much <lb/>
            he charged for them, and when he said " A hundred drachmas," <lb/>
            he gave him two hundred, so exceedingly devoted was he to <lb/>
            learning.</p>
          <p>XXI. They say too, that he was the first who ever em- <note type="footnote"> * The Greek is, iv <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̜̃θερίζοντιΧο</foreign>yw, a species of argument so <lb/>
            called, because he who used it mowed or knocked down his adversa- <lb/>
            riese.—Aldob. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="269"/>
            ployed the word duty (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰαθη̃ϰον</foreign>), and who wrote a treatise on <lb/>
            the subject. And that he altered the lines of Hesiod <lb/>
            thus :- <lb/>
            He is the best of all men who submits <lb/>
            To follow good advice ; he too is good, <lb/>
            Who of himself perceives whate'er is fit.*</p>
          <p>For he said that that man who had the capacity to give a <lb/>
            proper hearing to what was said, and to avail himself of it, <lb/>
            was superior to him who comprehended everything by his <lb/>
            own intellect; for that the one had only comprehension, but <lb/>
            the one who took good advice had action also.</p>
          <p>XXII. When he was asked why he, who was generally <lb/>
            austere, relaxed at a dinner party, he said, " Lupins too are <lb/>
            bitter, but when they are soaked they become sweet." And <lb/>
            Hecaton, in the second book of his Apophthegms, says, that <lb/>
            in entertaiments of that kind, he used to indulge himself <lb/>
            freely. And he used to say that it was better to trip with <lb/>
            the feet, than with the tongue. And that goodness was <lb/>
            attained by little and little, but was not itself a small thing. <lb/>
            Some authors, however, attribute this saying to Socrates.</p>
          <p>XXIII. He was a person of great powers of abstinence <lb/>
            and endurance; and of very simple habits, living on food <lb/>
            which required no fire to. dress it, and wearing a thin cloak, <lb/>
            so that it was said of him:— <lb/>
            The cold of winter, and the ceaseless rain, <lb/>
            Come powerless against him; weak is the dart <lb/>
            Of the fierce summer sun, or fell disease, <lb/>
            To bend that iron frame. He stands apart, <lb/>
            In nought resembling the vast common crowd ; <lb/>
            But, patient and unwearied, night and day, <lb/>
            Clings to his studies and philosophy. <note type="footnote"> * The Greek in the text is :— </note> <figure type="illustration">

          <p>XXIV. And the comic poets, without intending it, praise <lb/>
            him in their very attempts to turn him into ridicule. Philemon <lb/>
            speaks thus of him in his play entitled the Philosophers :— <lb/>
            This man adopts a new philosophy, <lb/>
            He teaches to be hungry ; nevertheless, <lb/>
            He gets disciples. Bread his only food, <lb/>
            His best desert dried figs ; water his drink.</p>
          <p>But some attribute these lines to Posidippus. And they <lb/>
            have become almost a proverb. Accordingly it used to be <lb/>
            said of him, " More temperate than Zeno the philosopher." <lb/>
            Posidippus also writes thus in his Men Transported;- <lb/>
            So that for ten whole days he did appear <lb/>
            More temperate than Zeno's self.</p>
          <p>XXV. For in reality he did surpass all men in this descrip- <lb/>
            tion of virtue, and in dignity of demeanour, and, by Jove, in <lb/>
            happiness. For he lived ninety-eight years, and then died, <lb/>
            without any disease, and continuing in good health to the <lb/>
            last. But Persæus, in his Ethical School, states that he died <lb/>
            at the age of seventy-two, and that he came to Athens when <lb/>
            he was twenty-two years old. But Apollonius says that he <lb/>
            presided over his school for forty-eight years.</p>
          <p>XXVI. And he died in the following manner. When he <lb/>
            was going out of his school, he tripped, and broke one of his <lb/>
            toes ; and striking the ground with his hand, he repeated the <lb/>
            line out of the Niobe :— <lb/>
            I come : why call me so ?</p>
          <p>And immediately he strangled himself, and so he died. But the <lb/>
            Athenians buried him in the Ceramicus, and honoured him <lb/>
            with the decrees which I have mentioned before, bearing <lb/>
            witness to his virtue. And Antipater, the Sidonian, wrote an <lb/>
            inscription for him, which runs thus :— <lb/>
            Here Cittium's pride, wise Zeno, lies, who climb'd <lb/>
            The sumits of Olympus; but unmoved <lb/>
            By wicked thoughts ne'er strove to raise on Ossa <lb/>
            The pine-clad Pelion ; nor did he emulate <lb/>
            Th' immortal toils of Hercules ; but found <lb/>
            A new way for himself to th' highest heaven, <lb/>
            By virtue, temperance, and modesty.</p>
          <p>And Zenodotus, the Stoic, a disciple of Diogenes, wrote <lb/>
            another :- <lb/>
             <pb n="271"/>
            You made contentment the chief rule of life, <lb/>
            Despising haughty wealth, 0 God-like Zeno. <lb/>
            With solemn look, and hoary brow serene, <lb/>
            You taught a manly doctrine ; and didst found <lb/>
            By your deep wisdom, a great novel school, <lb/>
            Chaste parent of unfearing liberty. <lb/>
            And if your country was Phœnicia, <lb/>
            Why need we grieve, from that land Cadmus came, <lb/>
            Who gave to Greece her written books of wisdom.</p>
          <p>And Athenæus, the Epigrammatic poet, speaks thus of all <lb/>
            the Stoics in common :- <lb/>
            0, ye who've learnt the doctrines of the Porch, <lb/>
            And have committed to your books divine <lb/>
            The best of human learning ; teaching men <lb/>
            That the mind's virtue is the only good. <lb/>
            And she it is who keeps the lives of men, <lb/>
            And cities, safer than high gates or walls. <lb/>
            But those who place their happiness in pleasure, <lb/>
            Are led by the least worthy of the Muses.</p>
          <p>And we also have ourselves spoken of the manner of Zeno's <lb/>
            death, in our collection of poems in all metres, in the follow- <lb/>
            ing terms :- <lb/>
            Some say that Zeno, pride of Cittium, <lb/>
            Died of old age, when weak and quite worn out; <lb/>
            Some say that famine's cruel tooth did slay him; <lb/>
            Some that he fell, and striking hard the ground, <lb/>
            Said, " See, I come, why call me thus impatiently ?"</p>
          <p>For some say that this was the way in which he died. And <lb/>
            this is enough to say concerning his death.</p>
          <p>XXVII. But Demetrius, the Magnesian, says, in his essay <lb/>
            on People of the Same Name, that his father Innaseas often <lb/>
            came to Athens, as he was a merchant, and that he used to <lb/>
            bring back many of the books of the Socratic philosophers, to, <lb/>
            Zeno, while he was still only a boy; and that, from this cir- <lb/>
            cumstance, Zeno had already become talked of in his own <lb/>
            country; and that in consequence of this he went to Athens, <lb/>
            where he attached himself to Crates. And it seems, he adds, <lb/>
            that it was he who first recommended a clear enunciation of <lb/>
            principles, as the best remedy for error. He is said, too, to <lb/>
            have been in the habit of swearing " By Capers," as Socrates <lb/>
            swore " By the Dog."</p>
          <p>XXVIII. Some, indeed, among whom is Cassius the <lb/>
            Sceptic, attack Zeno on many accounts, saying first of all that <lb/>
            he denounced the general system of education in vogue at the <lb/>
             <pb n="272"/>
            time, as useless, which he did in the beginning of his Republic. <lb/>
            And in the second place, that he used to call all who were not <lb/>
            virtuous, adversaries, and enemies, and slaves, and unfriendly <lb/>
            to one another, parents to their children, brethren to brethren, <lb/>
            and kinsmen to kinsmen ; and again, that in his Republic, he <lb/>
            speaks of the virtuous as the only citizens, and friends, and <lb/>
            relations, and free men, so that in the doctrine of the Stoic, <lb/>
            even parents and their children are enemies; for they are <lb/>
            not wise. Also, that he lays down the principle of the com- <lb/>
            munity of women both in his Republic and in a poem of two <lb/>
            hundred verses, and teaches that neither temples nor courts of <lb/>
            Jaw, nor gymnasia, ought to be erected in a city ; moreover, <lb/>
            that he writes thus about money, " That he does not think <lb/>
            that men ought to coin money either for purposes of traffic, or <lb/>
            of travelling." Besides all this, he enjoins men and women <lb/>
            to wear the same dress, and to leave no part of their person <lb/>
            uncovered.</p>
          <p>XXIX. And that this treatise on the Republic is his work <lb/>
            we are assured by Chrysippus, in his Republic. He also dis- <lb/>
            cussed amatory subjects in the beginning of that book of his <lb/>
            which is entitled the Art of Love. And in his Conversations <lb/>
            he writes in a similar manner.</p>
          <p>Such are the charges made against him by Cassius, and also <lb/>
            by Isidorus, of Pergamus, the orator, who says that all the <lb/>
            unbecoming doctrines and assertions of the Stoics were cut <lb/>
            out of their books by Athenodorus, the Stoic, who was the <lb/>
            curator of the library at Pergamus. And that subsequently <lb/>
            they were replaced, as Athenodorus was detected, and placed <lb/>
            in a situation of great danger ; and this is sufficient to say <lb/>
            about those doctrines of his which were impugned.</p>
          <p>XXX. There were eight different persons of the name of <lb/>
            Zeno. The first was the Eleatic, whom we shall mention <lb/>
            hereafter ; the second was this man of whom we are now <lb/>
            speaking; the third was a Rhodian, who wrote a history of <lb/>
            his country in one book ; the fourth was a historian who wrote <lb/>
            an account of the expedition of Pyrrhus into Italy and Sicily; <lb/>
            and also an epitome of the transactions between the Romans <lb/>
            and Carthaginians ; the fifth was a disciple of Chrysippus, <lb/>
            who wrote very few books, but who left a great number of <lb/>
            disciples ; the sixth was a physician of Hesophila, a very <lb/>
            shrewd man in intellect, but a very indifferent writer; the <lb/>
             <pb n="273"/>
            seventh was a grammarian, who, besides other writings, has <lb/>
            left some epigrams behind him; the eighth was a Sidonian by <lb/>
            descent, a philosopher of the Epicurean school, a deep thinker, <lb/>
            and very clear writer.</p>
          <p>XXXI. The disciples of Zeno were very numerous. The <lb/>
            most eminent were, first of all, Persæus, of Cittium, the son of <lb/>
            Demetrius, whom some call a friend of his, but others describe <lb/>
            him as a servant and one of the amanuenses who were sent to <lb/>
            him by Antigonus, to whose son, Halcymeus, he also acted as <lb/>
            tutor. And Antigonus once, wishing to make trial of him, <lb/>
            caused some false news to be brought to him that his estate <lb/>
            had been ravaged by the enemy ; and as he began to look <lb/>
            gloomy at this news, he said to him, " You see that wealth is <lb/>
            not a matter of indifference."</p>
          <p>The following works are attributed to him. One on Kingly <lb/>
            Power; one entitled the Constitution of the Lacedaemonians ; <lb/>
            one on Marriage ; one on Impiety; the Thyestes; an Essay <lb/>
            on Love ; a volume of Exhortations; one of Conversations; <lb/>
            four of Apophthegms ; one of Reminiscences ; seven treatises, <lb/>
            the Laws of Plato.</p>
          <p>The next was Ariston, of Chios, the son of Miltiades, who <lb/>
            was the first author of the doctrine of indifference ; then <lb/>
            Herillus, who called knowledge the chief good; then Diony- <lb/>
            sius, who transferred this description to pleasure: as, on <lb/>
            account of the violent disease which he had in his eyes, he <lb/>
            could not yet bring himself to call pain a thing indifferent. <lb/>
            He was a native of Heraclea ; there was also Sphærus, of the <lb/>
            Bosphorus ; and Cleanthes, of Assos, the son of Phanias, who <lb/>
            succeeded him in his school, and whom he used to liken to <lb/>
            tablets of hard wax, which are written upon with difficulty, but <lb/>
            which retain what is written upon them. And after Zeno's <lb/>
            death, Sphærus became a pupil of Cleanthes. And we shall <lb/>
            speak of him in our account of Cleanthes.</p>
          <p>These also were all disciples of Zeno, as we are told by <lb/>
            Hippobotus. namely:—Philonides, of Theles; Callippus, of <lb/>
            Corinth; Posidonius, of Alexandria; Athenodorus, of Soli; <lb/>
            and Zeno, a Sidonian.</p>
          <p>XXXII. And I have thought it best to give a general <lb/>
            account of all the Stoic doctrines in the life of Zeno, because <lb/>
            he it was who was the founder of the sect.</p>
          <p>He has written a great many books, of which I have already <note type="footnote"> T </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="274"/>
            given a list, in which he has spoken as no other of the Stoics <lb/>
            has. And his doctrines in general are these. But we will <lb/>
            enumerate them briefly, as we have been in the habit of doing <lb/>
            in the case of the other philosophers.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. The Stoics divide reason according to philosophy, <lb/>
            into three parts; and say that one part relates to natural <lb/>
            philosophy, one to ethics, and one to logic. And Zeno, the <lb/>
            Cittiæan, was the first who made this division, in his treatise <lb/>
            on Reason ; and he was followed in it by Chrysippus, in the <lb/>
            first book of his treatise on Reason, and in the first book of <lb/>
            his treatise on Natural Philosophy; and also by Apollodorus; <lb/>
            and by Syllus, in the first book of his Introduction to the <lb/>
            Doctrines of the Stoics; and by Eudromus, in his Ethical <lb/>
            Elements; and by Diogenes, the Babylonian ; and Posidorus. <lb/>
            Now these divisions are called topics by Apollodorus, species <lb/>
            by Chrysippus and Eudromus, and genera by all the rest. <lb/>
            And they compare philosophy to an animal, likening logic to <lb/>
            the bones and sinews, natural philosophy to the fleshy parts, <lb/>
            and ethical philosophy to the soul. Again, they compare it to <lb/>
            an egg; calling logic the shell, and ethics the white, and <lb/>
            natural philosophy the yolk. Also to a fertile field; in which <lb/>
            logic is the fence which goes round it, ethics are the fruit, and <lb/>
            natural philosophy the soil, or the fruit-trees. Again, they <lb/>
            compare it to a city fortified by walls, and regulated by reason ; <lb/>
            and then, as some of them say, no one part is preferred to <lb/>
            another, but they are all combined and united inseparably ; <lb/>
            and so theytreat of them all in combination. But others <lb/>
            class logic first, natural philosophy second, and ethics third; <lb/>
            as Zeno does in his treatise on Reason, and in this he is <lb/>
            followed by Chrysippus, and Archidemus, and Eudromus.</p>
          <p>For Diogenes of Ptolemais begins with ethics ; but Apollo- <lb/>
            dorus places ethics second; and Pansetius and Posidonius' <lb/>
            begin with natural philosophy, as Phanias, the friend of <lb/>
            Posidonius asserts, in the first book of his treatise on the <lb/>
            School of Posidonius.</p>
          <p>But Cleanthes says, that there are six divisions of reason <lb/>
            according to philosophy : dialectics, rhetoric, ethics, politics, <lb/>
            physics, and theology ; but others assert that these are not <lb/>
            divisions of reason, but of philosophy itself; and this is the <lb/>
            opinion advanced by Zeno, of Tarsus, among others.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. Some again say, that the logical division is <lb/>
             <pb n="275"/>
            properly subdivided into two sciences, namely, rhetoric and <lb/>
            dialectics; and some divide it also into definitive species, <lb/>
            which is coversant with rules and tests; while others deny the <lb/>
            propriety of this last division altogether, and argue that the <lb/>
            object of rules and tests is the discovery of the truth ; for it <lb/>
            is in this division that they explain the differences of repre- <lb/>
            sentations. They also argue that, on'the other side, the science <lb/>
            of definitions has equally for its object the discovery of truth, <lb/>
            since we only know things by the intervention of ideas. They <lb/>
            also call rhetoric a science conversant about speaking well <lb/>
            concerning matters which admit of a detailed narrative ; and <lb/>
            dialectics they call the science of arguing correctly in discus- <lb/>
            sions which can be carried on by question and answer ; on <lb/>
            which account they define it thus: a knowledge of what is <lb/>
            true, and false, and neither one thing nor the other.</p>
          <p>Again, rhetoric itself they divide into three kinds; for one <lb/>
            description they say is concerning about giving advice, another <lb/>
            is forensic, and the third encomiastic; and it is also divided <lb/>
            into several parts, one relating to the discovery of arguments, <lb/>
            one to style, one to the arrangement of arguments, and the <lb/>
            other to the delivery of the speech. And a rhetorical oration <lb/>
            they divide into the exordium, the narration, the reply to the <lb/>
            statements of the adverse party, and the peroration.</p>
          <p>XXXV. Dialectics, they say, is divided into two parts ; one <lb/>
            of which has reference to the things signified, the other to the <lb/>
            expression. That which has reference to the things signified <lb/>
            or spoken of,they divide again into the topic of things con- <lb/>
            ceived in the fancy, and into those of axioms, of perfect <lb/>
            determinations, of predicaments, of things alike, whether <lb/>
            upright or prostrate, of tropes, of syllogisms, and of sophisms, <lb/>
            which are derived either from the voice or from the things. And <lb/>
            these sophisms are of various kinds ; there is the false one, <lb/>
            the one which states facts, the negative, the sorites, and others <lb/>
            like these; the imperfect one, the inexplicable one, the con- <lb/>
            clusive one, the veiled one, the horned one, the nobody, and <lb/>
            the mower.</p>
          <p>In the second part of dialectics, that which has for its object <lb/>
            the expression, they treat of written language, of the different <lb/>
            parts of a discourse, of solecism and barbarism, of poetical <lb/>
            forms of expression, of ambiguity, of a melodious voice, of <lb/>
            music ; and some even add definitions, divisions, and diction. <note type="footnote"> T 2 </note></p><pb n="276"/>
            
          <p>They say that the most useful of these parts is the con- <lb/>
            sideration of syllogisms ; for that they show us what are the <lb/>
            things which are capable of demonstration, and that contributes <lb/>
            much to the formation of our judgment, and their arrangement <lb/>
            and memory give a scientific character to our knowledge. <lb/>
            They define reasoning to be a system composed of assumptions <lb/>
            and conclusions : and syllogism is a syllogistic argument pro- <lb/>
            ceeding on them. Demonstration they define to be a method <lb/>
            by which one proceeds from that which is more known to that <lb/>
            which is less. Perception, again, is an impression produced on <lb/>
            the mind, its name being appropriately borrowed from impres- <lb/>
            sions on wax made by a seal; and perception they divide into- <lb/>
            comprehensible and incomprehensible: Comprehensible, which <lb/>
            they call the criterion of facts, and which is produced by a real <lb/>
            object, and is, therefore, at the same time conformable to that <lb/>
            object; Incomprehensible, which has no relation to any real <lb/>
            object, or else, if it has any such relation, does not correspond <lb/>
            to it, being but a vague and indistinct representation.</p>
          <p>Dialectics itself they pronounce to be a necessary science, <lb/>
            and a virtue which comprehends several other virtues under <lb/>
            its species. And the disposition not to take up one side of <lb/>
            an argument hastily, they defined to be a knowledge by which <lb/>
            we are taught when we ought to agree to a statement, and <lb/>
            when we ought to withhold our agreement. Discretion they <lb/>
            consider to be a powerful reason, having reference to what is <lb/>
            becoming, so as to prevent our yielding to an irrelevant argu- <lb/>
            ment. Irrefutability they define to be a power in an argument, <lb/>
            which prevents one from being drawn from it to its opposite. <lb/>
            Freedom from vanity, according to them, is a habit which <lb/>
            refers the perceptions back to right reason.</p>
          <p>Again, they define knowledge itself as an assertion or <lb/>
            safe comprehension, or habit, which, in the perception of what <lb/>
            is seen, never deviates from the truth. And they say further, <lb/>
            that without dialectic speculation, the wise man cannot <lb/>
            be free from all error in his reasoning. For that that is <lb/>
            what distinguishes what is true from what is false, and which <lb/>
            easily detects those arguments which are only plausible, and <lb/>
            those which depend upon an ambiguity of language. And <lb/>
            without dialectics they say it is not possible to ask or answer <lb/>
            questions correctly. They also add, that precipitation in <lb/>
            denials extends to those things which are done, so that those <lb/>
             <pb n="277"/>
            who have not properly exercised their perceptions fall into <lb/>
            irregularity and thoughtlessness. Again, without dialectics, <lb/>
            the wise man cannot be acute, and ingenious, and wary, and <lb/>
            altogether dangerous as an arguer. For that it belongs to the <lb/>
            same man to speak correctly and to reason correctly, and to <lb/>
            discuss properly those subjects which are proposed to him, and <lb/>
            to answer readily whatever questions are put to him, all which <lb/>
            qualities belong to a man who is skilful in dialectics. This <lb/>
            then is a brief summary of their opinions on logic.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. And, that we may also enter into some more <lb/>
            minute details respecting them, we will subjoin what refers to <lb/>
            what they call their introductory science, as it is stated by <lb/>
            Diodes, of Magnesia, in his Excursion of Philosophers, <lb/>
            where he speaks as follows, and we will give his account word <lb/>
            for word.</p>
          <p>The Stoics have chosen to treat, in the first place, of percep- <lb/>
            tion and sensation, because the criterion by which the truth of <lb/>
            facts is ascertained is a kind of perception, and because the <lb/>
            judgment which expresses the belief, and the comprehension, <lb/>
            and the understanding of a thing, a judgment which precedes <lb/>
            all others, cannot exist without perception. For perception <lb/>
            leads the way; and then thought, finding vent in expressions, <lb/>
            explains in words the feelings which it derives from perception. <lb/>
            But there is a difference between <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϕαντασία</foreign>and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϕάντασμα</foreign>.a.dfJ.Ct.. <lb/>
            For <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϕάντασμαι</foreign>s a conception of the intellect, such as takes <lb/>
            place in sleep ; but <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϕαντασίαι</foreign>s an impression, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τύπωσις</foreign>, pro- <lb/>
            duced on the mind, that is to say, an alteration, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀλλοίωσις</foreign>,as <lb/>
            Chrysippus states in the twelfth book of his treatise on the <lb/>
            Soul. For we must not take this impression to resemble that <lb/>
            made by a seal, since it is impossible to conceive that there <lb/>
            should be many impressions made at the same time on the <lb/>
            same thing. But <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϕαντασίαι</foreign>s understood to be that which is im- <lb/>
            pressed, and formed, and imprinted by a real object, according <lb/>
            to a real object, in such a way as it could not be by any other <lb/>
            than a real object; and, according to their ideas of the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϕαντασίαι</foreign>,some are sensible, and some are not. Those they <lb/>
            call sensible, which are derived by us from some one or more <lb/>
            senses; and those they call not sensible, which emanate <lb/>
            directly from the thought, as for instance, those which relate to <lb/>
            incorporeal objects, or any others which are embraced by <lb/>
            reason. Again, those which are sensible, are produced by a <lb/>
             <pb n="278"/>
            real object, which imposes itself on the intelligence, and com- <lb/>
            pels its acquiescence ; and there are also some others, which are <lb/>
            simply apparent, mere shadows, which resemble those which <lb/>
            are produced by real objects.</p>
          <p>Again, these <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϕαντάσιαι</foreign>are divided into rational and irra- <lb/>
            tional ; those which are rational belong to animals capable of <lb/>
            reason; those which are irrational to animals destitute of <lb/>
            reason. Those which are rational are thoughts ; those which <lb/>
            are irrational have no name ; but are again subdivided into <lb/>
            artificial and not artificial. At all events, an image is contem- <lb/>
            plated in a different light by a man skilful in art, from that <lb/>
            in which it is viewed by a man ignorant of art.</p>
          <p>By sensation, the Stoics understand a species of breath <lb/>
            which proceeds from the dominant portion of the soul to the <lb/>
            senses, whether it be a sensible perception, or an organic dispo <lb/>
            sition, which, according to the notions of some of them, is <lb/>
            crippled and vicious. They also call sensation the energy, <lb/>
            or active exercise, of the sense. According to them, it is to <lb/>
            sensation that we owe our comprehension of white and black, <lb/>
            and rough and smooth : from reason, that we derive the <lb/>
            notions which result from a demonstration, those for instance <lb/>
            which have for their object the existence of Gods, and of <lb/>
            Divine Providence. For all our thoughts are formed either <lb/>
            by indirect perception, or by similarity, or analogy, or trans- <lb/>
            position, or combination, or opposition. By a direct percep- <lb/>
            tion, we perceive those things which are the objects of sense ; <lb/>
            by similarity, those which start from some point present to <lb/>
            our senses ; as, for instance, we form an idea of Socrates from <lb/>
            his likeness. We draw our conclusions by analogy, adopt- <lb/>
            ing either an increased idea of the thing, as of Tityus, or the <lb/>
            Cyclops; or a diminished idea, as of a pigmy. So, too, the <lb/>
            idea of the centre of the world was one derived by analogy <lb/>
            from what we perceived to be the case of the smaller <lb/>
            spheres. We use transposition when we fancy eyes in a man's <lb/>
            breast; combination, when we take in the idea of a Centaur; <lb/>
            opposition, when we turn our thoughts to death. Some ideas <lb/>
            we also derive from comparison, for instance, from a comparison <lb/>
            of words and places.</p>
          <p>There is also nature ; as by nature we comprehend what is <lb/>
            just and good. And privation, when for instance, we form a <lb/>
            notion of a man without hands. Such are the doctrines -of <lb/>
             <pb n="279"/>
            the Stoics, on the subject of phantasm, and sensation, and <lb/>
            thought.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. They say that the proper criterion of truth is <lb/>
            the comprehension, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϕαντασία</foreign>; that is to say, one which is <lb/>
            derived from a real object, as Chrysippus asserts in the twelfth <lb/>
            book of his Physics ; and he is followed by Antipater and <lb/>
            Apollodorus. For Boethius leaves a great many criteria, <lb/>
            such as intellect, sensation, appetite, and knowledge; but <lb/>
            Chrysippus dissents from his view, and in the first book of <lb/>
            his treatise on Reason, says, that sensation and preconcep- <lb/>
            tion are the only criteria. And preconception is, according <lb/>
            to him, a comprehensive physical notion of general principles. <lb/>
            But others of the earlier Stoics admit right reason as one <lb/>
            criterion of the truth; for instance, this is the opinion of <lb/>
            Posidonius, and is advanced by him in his essay on Criteria.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. On the subject of logical speculation, there <lb/>
            appears to be a great unanimity among the greater part of the <lb/>
            Stoics, in beginning with the topic of the voice. Now voice <lb/>
            is a percussion of the air; or, as Diogenes the Babylonian, <lb/>
            defines it, in his essay on the Voice, a sensation peculiar to <lb/>
            the hearing. The voice of a beast is a mere percussion of <lb/>
            the air by some impetus : but the voice of a man is articulate, <lb/>
            and is emitted by intellect, as Diogenes lays it down, and is <lb/>
            not brought to perfection in a shorter period than fourteen <lb/>
            years. And the voice is a body according to the Stoics ; for <lb/>
            so it is laid down by Archidemus, in his book on the Voice, <lb/>
            and by Diogenes, and Antipater, and also by Chrysippus, in <lb/>
            the second volume of his Physics. For everything which <lb/>
            makes anything, is a body; and the voice makes something <lb/>
            when it proceeds to those who hear from those who speak.</p>
          <p>A word (<foreign xml:lang="grc">λέξις</foreign>), again, is, according to Diogenes, a voice <lb/>
            consisting of letters, as " Day." A sentence (<foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγος</foreign>) is a <lb/>
            significant voice, sent out by the intellect, as for instance, " It <lb/>
            is day;" but dialect is a peculiar style imprinted on the <lb/>
            utterance of nations, according to their race; and causes <lb/>
            varieties in the Greek language, being a sort of local habit, as <lb/>
            for instance, the Attics say <foreign xml:lang="grc">θάλαττα</foreign>,and the Ionians say <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἠμέϱη</foreign>.The elements of words are the twenty-four letters ; <lb/>
            and the word letter is used in a triple division of sense, <lb/>
            meaning the element itself, the graphical sign of the element, <lb/>
            and the name, as Alpha. There are seven vowels, a, s, <foreign xml:lang="grc">η,ι</foreign>, <lb/>
            o, <foreign xml:lang="grc">υ,ω</foreign> ;six mutes, /3, y, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δ</foreign>, x, <foreign xml:lang="grc">π, τ</foreign>. But voice is different from <lb/>
             <pb n="280"/>
            a word, because voice is a sound ; but a word is an articulate <lb/>
            sound. And a word differs from a sentence, because a sen- <lb/>
            tence is always significative of something, but a word by itself <lb/>
            has no signification, as for instance, <foreign xml:lang="grc">βλίτϱι</foreign>.But this is not <lb/>
            the case with a sentence. Again, there is a difference between <lb/>
            speaking and pronouncing; the sounds are pronounced, but <lb/>
            what are spoken are things which are capable of being spoken <lb/>
            of.</p>
          <p>XXXIX. Now of sentences there are five parts, as Dio- <lb/>
            genes tells us in his treatise on Voice ; and he is followed by <lb/>
            Chrysippus. There is the noun, the common noun, the verb, <lb/>
            the conjunction, and the article. Antipater adds also quality, <lb/>
            in his treatise upon Words and the things expressed by them. <lb/>
            And a common noun (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πϱοσηγοϱία</foreign>) is, according to Diogenes, a <lb/>
            part of a sentence signifying a common quality, as for instance, <lb/>
            man, horse. But a noun is a part of a sentence signifying a <lb/>
            peculiar quality, such as Diogenes, Socrates. A verb is a part <lb/>
            of a sentence signifying an uncombined categorem, as Diogenes <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ Διογένης</foreign>) or, as others define it, an element of a sentence, <lb/>
            devoid of case, signifying something compound in reference to <lb/>
            some person or persons, as, " I write," " I say." A conjunc- <lb/>
            tion is a part of a sentence destitute of case, uniting the divi- <lb/>
            sions of the sentence. An article is an element of a sentence, <lb/>
            having cases, defining the genders of nouns and their numbers ; <lb/>
            as o, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ, τὸ, ὁἰ, αἱ, τὰ</foreign>.</p>
          <p>XL. The excellences of a sentence are five,—good Greek, <lb/>
            clearness, conciseness, suitableness, elegance. Good Greek <lb/>
            (' <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ελληνιϭμὸς</foreign>) is a correct style, according to art, keeping aloof <lb/>
            from any vulgar form of expression ; clearness is a style which <lb/>
            states that which is conceived in the mind in such a way that <lb/>
            it is easily known : conciseness is a style which embraces all <lb/>
            that is necessary to the clear explanation of the subject under <lb/>
            discussion; suitableness is a style suited to the subject; <lb/>
            elegance is a style which avoids all peculiarity of expression. <lb/>
            Of the vices of a sentence, on the other hand, barbarism is a <lb/>
            use of words contrary to that in vogue among the well-educated <lb/>
            Greeks ; solecism is a sentence incongruously put together.</p>
          <p>XLI. A poetical expression is, as Posidonius defines it in <lb/>
            his introduction on Style, “ A metrical or rhythmical diction, <lb/>
            proceeding in preparation, and avoiding all resemblance to <lb/>
            prose." For instance, " The vast and boundless earth," <lb/>
            " Th' expanse of heaven," are rhythmical expressions; and <lb/>
             <pb n="281"/>
            poetry is a collection of poetical expressions signifying some- <lb/>
            thing, containing an imitation of divine and human beings.</p>
          <p>XLII. A definition is, as Antipater explains it in the first <lb/>
            book of his treatise on Definitions, a sentence proceeding by <lb/>
            analysis enunciated in such a way as to give a complete idea; <lb/>
            or, as Chrysippus says in his treatise on Definitions, it is the <lb/>
            explanation of an idea. Description is a sentence which, in a <lb/>
            figurative manner, brings one to a knowledge of the subject, or <lb/>
            it may be called a simpler kind of definition, expressing the <lb/>
            power of a definition in plainer language. Genus is a com- <lb/>
            prehending of many ideas indissolubly connected, as animal; <lb/>
            for this one expression comprehends all particular kinds of <lb/>
            animals. An idea is an imagination of the mind which does <lb/>
            not express actually anything real, or any quality, but only a <lb/>
            quasi reality and a quasi quality ; such, for instance, is the idea <lb/>
            of a horse when a horse is not present. Species is that which <lb/>
            is comprehended under genus, as man is comprehended under <lb/>
            animal.</p>
          <p>Again, that is the most general genus which, being a genus <lb/>
            itself, has no other genus, as the existent. And that is the' <lb/>
            most special species, which being a species has no other species, <lb/>
            as, for instance, Socrates.</p>
          <p>XLIII. The division of genus is a dissection of it into the <lb/>
            proximate species ; as, for instance, " Of animals, some are <lb/>
            rational, others irrational." Contrary division is the dissection <lb/>
            of genus into species on the principle of the contrary ; so as to <lb/>
            be by a sort of negation ; as, for instance, " Of existent things, <lb/>
            some are good and some not good; " and, " Of things which are <lb/>
            not good, some are bad and some indifferent." Partition is an <lb/>
            arrangement of a genus with reference to place, as Crinis says, <lb/>
            for instance, " Of goods, some have reference to the mind and <lb/>
            some to the body."</p>
          <p>XLIV. Ambiguity (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμϕιβολα</foreign>) is an expression signifying <lb/>
            two or more things having an ordinary or a peculiar meaning, <lb/>
            according to the pronunciation, in such a way that more things <lb/>
            than one may be understood by the very same expression. <lb/>
            Take, for instance, the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐλητϱὶςπέπτωϰε</foreign>.For you may <lb/>
            understand by them, a house has fallen down three times <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐλητϱὶςπέπτωϰε</foreign>), or, a female flute-player has fallen, taking <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐλητϱὶς</foreign>as synonymous with <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐλητϱία</foreign>.</p>
          <p>LV. Dialectics are, as Posidonius explains them, the science <lb/>
             <pb n="282"/>
            of what is true and false, and neither one or the other, and it is, <lb/>
            as Chrysippus explains it, conversant about words that signify and <lb/>
            things that are signified ; these then are the doctrines asserted <lb/>
            by the Stoics in their speculations on the subject of the voice.</p>
          <p>XL VI. But in that part of dialectics which concerns things <lb/>
            and ideas signified, they treat of propositions, of perfect enun- <lb/>
            ciations, of judgments, of syllogisms, of imperfect enuncia- <lb/>
            tions, of attributes and deficiences, and of both direct and <lb/>
            indirect categorems or predicaments.</p>
          <p>XL VII. And they say that enunciation is the manifestation <lb/>
            of the ideal perception ; and these enunciations the Stoics pro- <lb/>
            nounce some to be perfect in themselves, and some to be defec- <lb/>
            tive; now those are defective, which furnish an incomplete sense, <lb/>
            as for instance, "He writes." For then we ask further, "Who <lb/>
            writes?" But those are perfect in themselves, which give a <lb/>
            sense entirely complete, as for instance, " Socrates writes." <lb/>
            Accordingly, in the defective enunciations, categorems are <lb/>
            applied; but in those which are perfect in themselves, axioms, <lb/>
            and syllogisms, and questions, and interrogations, are brought <lb/>
            into play. Now a categorem is something which is predicated <lb/>
            of something else, being either a thing which is added to one <lb/>
            or more objects, according to the definition of Apollodorus, or <lb/>
            else a defective enunciation added to the nominative case, for <lb/>
            the purpose of forming a proposition:</p>
          <p>Now of categorems, some are accidents ....* as for in- <lb/>
            stance, “ The sailing through a rock." .... And of cate- <lb/>
            gorems, some are direct, some indirect, and some neither one <lb/>
            nor the other. Now those are correct, which are construed <lb/>
            with one of the oblique cases, in such a manner as to produce <lb/>
            a categorem, as for instance, " He hears, he sees, he con- <lb/>
            verses." And those are indirect, which are construed with <lb/>
            the passive voice, as for instance, " I am heard, I am seen." <note type="footnote"> * Huerner thinks (as indeed is evident) that something is lost her.e; <lb/>
            and proposes to read the sentence thus :—<foreign xml:lang="grc">Τω̃ν δὲκατηγορημάτωντὰ <lb/>
            μένεϭτιϭυμβάματαὡςΤΟ πλει̃ν</foreign>,olov <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σωκράτηςπλει̃,τὰδὲπαραϭυμ- <lb/>
            βάματαὡςΤΟ διὰπέτραςπλει̃ν</foreign>.With reference to which passage, <lb/>
            Liddell and Scott, Gr. Eng. Lex. voc. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭύμβαμα</foreign>,thus speak : " <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭύμβαμα</foreign> <lb/>
            .... as a philosophical term of the Stoicsa=<foreign xml:lang="grc">κατηγόρημα</foreign>,a com- <lb/>
            plete predicament such as is an intransitive verb: e. g. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σωκράης <lb/>
            περιπατε</foreign>ĩ; while an imperfect verb was regarded as an incomplete <lb/>
            predicament; e. g. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σωκράτειμέλει</foreign>, and called <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραϭύμβαμα</foreign>,or <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρακατηγορημα</foreign>.” </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="283"/>
            And those which are neither one nor the other, are those which <lb/>
            are construed in a neutral kind of manner, as for instance, <lb/>
            " To think, to walk." And those are reciprocal, which are <lb/>
            among the indirect ones, with out being indirect themselves. <lb/>
            Those are effects, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνϱγήματα</foreign>,which are such words as, " He <lb/>
            is shaved;" for then, the man who is shaved, implies himself.</p>
          <p>The oblique cases, are the genitive, the dative, and the <lb/>
            accusative.</p>
          <p>XL VIII. An axiom, is that thing which is true, or false, or <lb/>
            perfect in itself, being asserted, or denied positively, as far as <lb/>
            depends upon itself; as Chrysippus explains it in his Dialectic <lb/>
            Definitions ; as for instance, "It is day," " Dion is walking." <lb/>
            And it has received the name of axiom, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀξίωμα</foreign>,because it is <lb/>
            either maintained, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀξιου̃ται</foreign>, or repudiated. For the man who <lb/>
            says, "It is day," appears to maintain the fact of its being <lb/>
            day. If then it is day, the axiom put before one is true; but <lb/>
            if it is not day, the axiom is false. And an axiom, a question, <lb/>
            and an interrogation, differ from one another, and so does an <lb/>
            imperative proposition from one which is adjurative, or impre- <lb/>
            catory, or hypothetical, or appellative, or false. For that is <lb/>
            an axiom which we utter, when we affirm anything positively, <lb/>
            which is either true or false. And a question is a thing com- <lb/>
            plete in itself, as also is an axiom, but which requires an <lb/>
            answer, as for instance, " Is it day?" Now this is neither <lb/>
            true nor false ; but, as " It is day " is an axiom; so is, " Is it <lb/>
            day?" a question. But an interrogation, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πύϭμα</foreign>,is a thing <lb/>
            to which it is not possible to make an answer symbolically, as <lb/>
            in the case of a question, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐϱώτημα</foreign>,saying merely " Yes," but <lb/>
            we must reply, " He does live in this place."</p>
          <p>The imperative proposition is a thing which we utter when <lb/>
            we give an order, as for instance this :— <lb/>
            Do you now go to the sweet stream of Inachus.*</p>
          <p>The appellative proposition is one which is used in the <lb/>
            case in which, when a man says anything, be must address <lb/>
            somebody, as for instance :- <lb/>
            Atrides, glorious king of men, <lb/>
            Most mighty Agamemnon.t</p>
          <p>A false judgment is a proposition, which, while it has at the <note type="footnote"> * This line is from the Inachus of Sophocles (one of his lost plays). </note><note type="footnote"> t Homer, Iliad II. 484. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="284"/>
            same time the appearance of a real judgment, loses this <lb/>
            character by the addition, and under the influence of, some <lb/>
            particle, as for instance : <lb/>
            The Parthenon at least is beautiful. <lb/>
            How like the herdsman is to Priam's sons.</p>
          <p>There is also the dubitative proposition, which differs from <lb/>
            the judgment, inasmuch as it is always uttered in the form of <lb/>
            a doubt; as for instance :— <lb/>
            Are not, then, grief and life two kindred states ? *</p>
          <p>But questions, and interrogations, and things like these, <lb/>
            are neither true nor false, while judgments and propositions <lb/>
            are necessarily one or the other.</p>
          <p>Now of axioms, some are simple, and others are not simple; <lb/>
            as Chrysippus, and Archedemus, and Athenodorus, and Anti- <lb/>
            pater, and Crinis, agree in dividing them. Those are simple, <lb/>
            which consist of an axiom or proposition, which is not am- <lb/>
            biguous, (or of several axioms, or propositions of the same <lb/>
            character,) as for instance the sentence, "It is day." And <lb/>
            those are not simple, which consist of an axiom or proposition <lb/>
            which is ambiguous, or of several axioms or propositions of <lb/>
            that character. Of an axiom, or proposition, which is am- <lb/>
            biguous. as " If it is day;" of several axioms, or propositions <lb/>
            of that character, as, "If it is day, it is light."</p>
          <p>And simple propositions are divided into the affirmative, <lb/>
            the negative, the privative, the categorical, the definite, and <lb/>
            the indefinite ; those which are not simple, are divided into <lb/>
            the combined, and the adjunctive, the connected and the dis- <lb/>
            junctive, and the causal and the augmentative, and the dimi- <lb/>
            nutive. That is an affirmative proposition, " It is not day." <lb/>
            And the species of this is doubly affirmative. That again is <lb/>
            doubly affirmative, which is affirmative of an affirmative, as <lb/>
            for instance, “ It is not not day ; ” for this amounts to, " It is <lb/>
            day." That is a negative proposition, which consists of a <lb/>
            negative particle and a categorem, as for instance, " No one is <lb/>
            walking." That is a privative proposition which consists of a <lb/>
            privative particle and an axiom according to power, as "This <lb/>
            man is inhuman." That is a categorical proposition, which <lb/>
            consists of a nominative case and a categorem, as for in- <lb/>
            stance, " Dion is walking." That is a definite proposition, <note type="footnote"> * This line is from the Citharista of Menander. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="285"/>
            which consists of a demonstrative nominative case and a <lb/>
            categorem, as for instance, " This man is walking." That is <lb/>
            an indefinite one which consists of an indefinite particle, or <lb/>
            of indefinite particles, as for instance, " Somebody is walk- <lb/>
            ing," " He is moving."</p>
          <p>Of propositions which are not simple, the combined propo- <lb/>
            sition is, as Chrysippus states, in his Dialectics, and Diogenes, <lb/>
            too, in his Dialectic Art; that which is held together by the <lb/>
            copulative conjunction " if." And this conjunction professes <lb/>
            that the second member of the sentence follows the first, as <lb/>
            for instance, " If it is day, it is light." That which is adjunc- <lb/>
            tive is, as Crinis states in his Dialectic Art, an axiom which is <lb/>
            made to depend on the conjunction " since " (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπεὶ</foreign>), beginning <lb/>
            with an axiom and ending in an axiom, as for instance, " Since <lb/>
            it is day, it is light." And this conjunction professes both that <lb/>
            the second portion of the proposition follows the first, and <lb/>
            the first is true. That is a connected proposition which is <lb/>
            connected by some copulative conjunctions, as for instance, <lb/>
            " It both is day, and it is light." That is a disjunctive pro- <lb/>
            position which is disconnected by the disjunctive conjunction, <lb/>
            "or" (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἤτοι</foreign>,) as for instance, " It is either day or night." And <lb/>
            this proposition professes that one or other of these proposi- <lb/>
            tions is false. That is a causal proposition which is connected <lb/>
            by the word, "because;" as for instance, " Because it is day, it <lb/>
            is light." For the first is, as it were, the cause of the second. <lb/>
            That is an augmentative proposition, which explains the <lb/>
            greater, which is construed with an augmentative particle, <lb/>
            and which is placed between the two members of the pro- <lb/>
            position, as for instance, "It is rather day than night." The <lb/>
            diminutive proposition is, in every respect, the exact contrary <lb/>
            of the preceding one ; as for instance, " It is less night than <lb/>
            day." Again, at times, axioms or propositions are opposed to <lb/>
            one another in respect of their truth and falsehood, when one <lb/>
            is an express denial of the other; as for instance, " It is day," <lb/>
            and, " It is not day."</p>
          <p>Again, a conjunctive proposition is correct, when it is such <lb/>
            that the opposite of the conclusion is contradictory of the <lb/>
            premiss; as for instance, the proposition, "If it is day, it is <lb/>
            light," is true ; for, " It is not light," which is the opposite to. <lb/>
            the conclusion expressed, is contradictory to the premiss, " It <lb/>
            is day." And a conjunctive proposition is incorrect, when it <lb/>
             <pb n="286"/>
            is such that the opposite of the conclusion is not inconsistent <lb/>
            with the premiss, as for instance, " If it is day, Dion is walk- <lb/>
            ing." For the fact that Dion is not walking, is not contra- <lb/>
            dictory of the premiss, " It is day."</p>
          <p>An adjunctive proposition is correct, which begins with a <lb/>
            true premiss, and ends in a consequence which follows of <lb/>
            necessity, as for instance, " Since it is day, the sun is above <lb/>
            the earth." But it is incorrect when it either begins with a <lb/>
            false premiss, or ends with a consequence which does not fol- <lb/>
            low properly; as for instance, " Since it is night, Dion is <lb/>
            walking," for this may be said in the day-time.</p>
          <p>A causal proposition is correct, when it begins with a true <lb/>
            premiss, and ends in a consequence which necessarily follows <lb/>
            from it, but yet does not have its premiss reciprocally con- <lb/>
            sequent upon its conclusion; as for instance, " Because it is <lb/>
            day, it is light." For the fact of its being light, is a neces- <lb/>
            sary consequence of its being day; but the fact of its being <lb/>
            day, is not necessarily a consequence of its being light. A <lb/>
            causal proposition is incorrect, which either begins with a false <lb/>
            premiss, or ends with a conclusion that does not follow from <lb/>
            it, or which has a premiss which does not correspond to the <lb/>
            conclusion ; as for instance, " Because it is night, Dion is <lb/>
            walking."</p>
          <p>A proposition is persuasive, which leads to the assent of <lb/>
            the mind, as for instance, “ If she brought him forth, she is <lb/>
            his mother." But still this is a falsehood, for a hen is not <lb/>
            the mother of an egg. Again, there are some propositions <lb/>
            which are possible, and some which are impossible ; and some <lb/>
            which are necessary, and some which are not necessary. That <lb/>
            is possible, which is capable of being true, since external cir- <lb/>
            cumstances are no hindrance to its being true; as for instance, <lb/>
            " Diodes lives." And that is impossible which is not capable <lb/>
            of being true; as for instance, " The earth flies." That is <lb/>
            necessary which, being true, is not capable of being false ; or <lb/>
            perhaps is intrinsically capable of being false, but still has ex- <lb/>
            ternal circumstances whioh hinder its being false, as for <lb/>
            instance, " Virtue profits a man." That again, is not neces- <lb/>
            sary, which is true, but which has a capacity of being false, <lb/>
            though external circumstances offer no hindrance to either <lb/>
            alternative ; as for instance, " Dion walks."</p>
          <p>That is a reasonable or probable proposition, which has a <lb/>
             <pb n="287"/>
            great preponderance of opportunities in favour of its being <lb/>
            true ; as for instance, " I shall be alive to-morrow." And <lb/>
            there are other different kinds of propositions and conversions <lb/>
            of them, from true to false, and re-conversions again; con- <lb/>
            cerning which we must speak at some length.</p>
          <p>XLIX. An argument, as Crinis says, is that which is com- <lb/>
            posed of a lemma or major premiss, an assumption or minor <lb/>
            premiss, and a conclusion; as for instance this, " If it is day, <lb/>
            it is light;" , But it is day, therefore it is light." For the <lb/>
            lemma, or major premiss, is, " If it is day, it is light." The <lb/>
            assumption, or minor premiss, is, "It is day." The conclusion <lb/>
            follows, " Therefore it is light." The mode of a proposition <lb/>
            is, as it were, a figure of an argument, as for instance, such as <lb/>
            this, " If it is the first, it is the second ; but it is the first, <lb/>
            therefore it is the second."</p>
          <p>A conditional syllogism is that which is composed of both <lb/>
            the preceding arguments ; as for instance, " If Plato is alive, <lb/>
            Plato breathes; but the first fact is so, therefore so is the <lb/>
            second." And this conditional syllogism has been introduced <lb/>
            for the sake, in long and complex sentences, of not being <lb/>
            forced to repeat the assumption, as it was a long one, and also <lb/>
            the conclusion ; but of being able, instead, to content one's <lb/>
            self with summing it up briefly thus, “ The first case put is <lb/>
            true, therefore so is the second."</p>
          <p>Of arguments, some are conclusive, others are inconclusive. <lb/>
            Those are inconclusive which are such, that the opposite of <lb/>
            the conclusion drawn in them is not necessarily incompatible <lb/>
            with the connection of the premisses. As for instance, such <lb/>
            arguments as these, " If it is day, it is light; but it is day, <lb/>
            therefore, Dion is walking." But of conclusive arguments, <lb/>
            some are called properly by the kindred name conclusions, <lb/>
            and some are called syllogistic arguments. Those then are <lb/>
            syllogistic which are either such as do not admit of demonstra- <lb/>
            tion, or such as are brought to an indemonstrable conclusion, <lb/>
            according to some one or more propositions ; such for instance <lb/>
            as the following: " If Dion walks, then Dion is in motion." <lb/>
            Those are conclusive, which infer their conclusion specially, <lb/>
            and not syl-logistically ; such for instance, as this, " The <lb/>
            proposition it is both day and night is false. Now it is day; <lb/>
            therefore, it is not night."</p>
          <p>Those again, are unsyllogistic arguments which have an air <lb/>
             <pb n="288"/>
            of probability about them, and a resemblance to syllogistic <lb/>
            ones, but which still do not lead to the deduction of proper <lb/>
            conclusions. As for instance, " If Dion is a horse, Dion is an <lb/>
            animal; but Dion is not a horse, therefore, Dion is not an <lb/>
            animal."</p>
          <p>Again, of arguments, some are true, and some are false. <lb/>
            Those are true which deduce a conclusion from true premisses, <lb/>
            as, for instance, " If virtue profits, then vice injures." And <lb/>
            those are false which have some falsehood in their premisses, <lb/>
            or which are inconclusive ; as, for instance, " If it is day, it is <lb/>
            light; but it is day, therefore, Dion is alive."</p>
          <p>There are also arguments which are possible, and others <lb/>
            which are impossible ; some likewise which are necessary, and <lb/>
            others which are not necessary. There are too, some which <lb/>
            are not demonstrated from their not standing in need of <lb/>
            demonstration, and these are laid down differently by different <lb/>
            people ; but Chrysippus enumerates five kinds, which serve as <lb/>
            the foundation for every kind of argument; and which are <lb/>
            assumed in conclusive arguments properly so called, and in <lb/>
            syllogisms, and in modes.</p>
          <p>The first kind that is not demonstrated, is that in which the <lb/>
            whole argument consists of a conjunctive and an antecedent; <lb/>
            and in which the first term repeats itself so as to form a sort <lb/>
            of conjunctive proposition, and to bring forward as the conclu- <lb/>
            sion the last term. As, for instance, " If the first be true, so <lb/>
            is the second ; but the first is true, therefore, so is the second." <lb/>
            The second kind that is not demonstrated, is that which, by <lb/>
            means of the conjunctive and the opposite of the conclusion, <lb/>
            has a conclusion opposite to the first premiss. As, for instance, <lb/>
            " If it be day, it is light; but it is night, therefore it is not <lb/>
            day." For here the assumption arises from the opposite of <lb/>
            the conclusion, and the conclusion from the opposite of the <lb/>
            first term. The third kind that is not demonstrative, is that <lb/>
            which, by a negative combination, and by one of the terms in <lb/>
            the proposition, produces the contradictory of the remainder; <lb/>
            as, for instance, " Plato is not dead and alive at the same <lb/>
            time but Plato is dead ; therefore, Plato is not alive." The <lb/>
            fourth kind that is not demonstrative, is that which, by <lb/>
            means of a disjunctive, and one of those terms which are in <lb/>
            the disjunctive, has a conclusion opposite to what remains; <lb/>
            as, for instance, " It is either the first, or the second : but it <lb/>
             <pb n="289"/>
            is the first; therefore, it is not the second." The fifth kind <lb/>
            that is not demonstrative, is that in which the whole argument <lb/>
            consists of a disjunctive proposition, and the opposite of one of <lb/>
            the terms, aud then one makes the conclusion identical with <lb/>
            the remainder ; as, for instance, " It is either day or night ; <lb/>
            but it is not night; therefore it is day."</p>
          <p>According to the Stoics, truth follows upon truth, as " It is <lb/>
            light," follows upon " It is day." And falsehood follows upon <lb/>
            falsehood ; as, " If it is false that it is night, it is also false that <lb/>
            it is dark." Sometimes too, truth follows from falsehood ; for <lb/>
            instance, though it is false that " the earth flies,” it is true <lb/>
            that " there is the earth." But falsehood does never follow <lb/>
            from truth; for, from the fact that " there is the earth," it <lb/>
            does not follow that the earth flies."</p>
          <p>There are also some arguments which are perplexed, being <lb/>
            veiled and escaping notice ; or such as are called sorites, the <lb/>
            horned one, or the nobody. That is a veiled argument* which <lb/>
            resembles the following one ; “ two are not a few, nor three, <lb/>
            nor those, nor four, and so on to ten ; but two are few ; there- <lb/>
            fore, so are ten few."</p>
          <p>The nobody is a conjunctive argument, and one that consists <lb/>
            of the indefinite and the definite, and which has a minor pre- <lb/>
            miss and a conclusion; as, for instance, " If any one is here, <lb/>
            he is not in Rhodes."</p>
          <p>L. Such then are the doctrines which the Stoics maintain <lb/>
            on the subject of logic, in order as far as possible to establish <lb/>
            their point that the logician is the only wise man. For they <lb/>
            assert that all affairs are looked at by means of that speculation <note type="footnote"> * It would appear that there is a considerable hiatus here ; for the <lb/>
            instance following is a sorites, and not a specimen of the veiled argu- <lb/>
            ment. And there is no instance given of the concealed, or of the <lb/>
            homed one. Still, the mere fact of the text being unintelligible, is far <lb/>
            from proving that we have not got it as Diogenes wrote it; as though <lb/>
            in the language of the writer in Smith's Biographical Dictionary, vol. <lb/>
            i. pp. 1022, 1023, "the work contains a rich store of living features, <lb/>
            which serve to illustrate the private life of the Greeks," it is equally clear <lb/>
            that the author " was unequal to writing a history of Greek philosophy. <lb/>
            His work in reality is nothing but a compilation of the most hetero- <lb/>
            geneous and often contradictory accounts . . . . . The traces of <lb/>
            carelessness and mistakes are very numerous; much in the work is con- <lb/>
            fused, and there is also much that is quite absurd. And as far as philo- <lb/>
            sophy itself is concerned, Diogenes very frequently did not know what <lb/>
            he was talking about when he abridged the theories of the philosophers." </note><note type="footnote">u </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="290"/>
            which proceeds by argument, including under this assertion' <lb/>
            both those that belong to natural and also those which belong <lb/>
            to moral philosophy : for, say they, how else could one deter- <lb/>
            mine the exact value of nouns, or how else could one explain <lb/>
            what laws are imposed upon such and such actions ? More- <lb/>
            over, as there are two habits both incidental to virtue, the one <lb/>
            considers what each existing thing is, and the other inquires <lb/>
            what it is called. These then are the notions of the Stoics on <lb/>
            the subject of logic.</p>
          <p>LI. The ethical part of philosophy they divide into the topic <lb/>
            of inclination, the topic of good and bad, the topic of the <lb/>
            passions, the topic of virtue, the topic of the chief good, and <lb/>
            of primary estimation, and of actions ; the topic of what things <lb/>
            are becoming, and of exhortation and dissuasion. And this <lb/>
            division is the one laid down by Chrysippus, and Archedemus, <lb/>
            and Zeno, of Tarsus, and Apollodorus, and Diogenes, and <lb/>
            Antipater, and Posidonius. For Zeno, of Cittium, and Clean- <lb/>
            thes, have, as being more ancient they were likely to, adopted <lb/>
            a more simple method of treating these subjects. But these <lb/>
            men divided logical and the natural philosophy.</p>
          <p>LII. They say that the first inclination which an animal <lb/>
            has is to protect itself, as nature brings herself to take an <lb/>
            interest in it from the beginning, as Chrysippus affirms in the <lb/>
            first book of his treatise on Ends ; where he says, that the <lb/>
            first and dearest object to every animal is its own existence, <lb/>
            and its consciousness of that existence. For that it is not <lb/>
            natural for any animal to be alienated from itself, or even to <lb/>
            be brought into such a state as to be indifferent to itself, being <lb/>
            neither alienated from nor interested in itself. It remains, <lb/>
            therefore, that we must assert that nature has bound the <lb/>
            animal to itself by the greatest unanimity and affection; <lb/>
            for by that means it repels all that is injurious, and attracts <lb/>
            all that is akin to it and desirable. But as for what some <lb/>
            people say, that the first inclination of animals is to <lb/>
            pleasure, they say what is false. For they say that pleasure, <lb/>
            if there be any such thing at all, is an accessory only, which, <lb/>
            nature, having sought it out by itself, as well as those things <lb/>
            which are adapted to its constitution, receives incidentally in <lb/>
            the same manner as animals are pleased, and plants made to <lb/>
            flourish.</p>
          <p>Moreover, say they, nature makes no difference between <lb/>
             <pb n="291"/>
            animals and plants, when she regulates them so as to leave <lb/>
            them without voluntary motion or sense ; and some things too <lb/>
            take place in ourselves in the same manner as in plants. But, <lb/>
            as inclination in animals tends chiefly to the point of making <lb/>
            them pursue what is appropriate to them, we may say that <lb/>
            their inclinations are regulated by nature. And as reason is <lb/>
            given to rational animals according to a more perfect principle, <lb/>
            it follows, that to live correctly according to reason, is properly <lb/>
            predicated of those who live according to nature. For nature <lb/>
            is as it were the artist who produces the inclination.</p>
          <p>LIII. On which account Zeno was the first writer who, in <lb/>
            his treatise on the Nature of Man, said, that the chief good was <lb/>
            confessedly to live according to nature; which is to live ac- <lb/>
            cording to virtue, for nature leads us to this point. And in <lb/>
            like manner Cleanthes speaks in his treatise on Pleasure, and <lb/>
            so do Posidonius and Hecaton in their essays on Ends as the <lb/>
            Chief Good. And again, to live according to virtue is the same <lb/>
            thing as living according to one's experience of those things <lb/>
            which happen by nature ; as Chrysippus explains it in the first <lb/>
            book of his treatise on the Chief Good. For our individual <lb/>
            natures are all parts of universal nature ; on which account the <lb/>
            chief good is to live in a manner corresponding to nature, and <lb/>
            that means corresponding to one's own nature and to universal <lb/>
            nature ; doing none of those things which the common law of <lb/>
            mankind is in the habit of forbidding, and that common law <lb/>
            is identical with that right reason which pervades everything, <lb/>
            being the same with Jupiter, who is the regulator and chief <lb/>
            manager of all existing things.</p>
          <p>Again, this very thing is the virtue of the happy man and <lb/>
            the perfect happiness of life when everything is done according <lb/>
            to a harmony with the genius of each individual with reference <lb/>
            to the will of the universal governor and manager of all <lb/>
            things. Diogenes, accordingly, says expressly that the chief <lb/>
            good is to act according to sound reason in our selection of <lb/>
            things according to our nature. And Archidemus defines it to <lb/>
            be living in the discharge of all becoming duties. Chrysippus <lb/>
            again understands that the nature, in a manner corresponding <lb/>
            to which we ought to live, is both the common nature, and also <lb/>
            human nature in particular; but Cleanthes will not admit of <lb/>
            any other nature than the common one alone, as that to which <lb/>
            people ought to live in a manner corresponding; and re- <note type="footnote"> u 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="292"/>
            pudiates all mention of a particular nature. And he asserts <lb/>
            that virtue is a disposition of the mind always consistent and <lb/>
            always harmonious; that one ought to seek it out for its own <lb/>
            sake, without being influenced by fear or hope by any external <lb/>
            ' influence. Moreover, that it is in it that happiness consists, as <lb/>
            producing in the soul the harmony of a life always consistent <lb/>
            with itself; and that if a rational animal goes the wrong way, <lb/>
            it is because it allows itself to be misled by the deceitful <lb/>
            appearances of exterior things, or perhaps by the instigation <lb/>
            of those who surround it; for nature herself never gives us any <lb/>
            but good inclinations.</p>
          <p>LIV. Now virtue is, to speak generally, a perfection in <lb/>
            everything, as in the case of a statue ; whether it is invisible <lb/>
            as good health, or speculative as prudence. For Hecaton says, <lb/>
            in the first book of his treatise on Virtues, that the scientific <lb/>
            and speculative virtues are those which have a constitution <lb/>
            arising from speculation and study, as, for instance, prudence <lb/>
            and justice ; and that those which are not speculative are those <lb/>
            which are generally viewed in their extension as a practical <lb/>
            result or effect of the former; such for instance, as health <lb/>
            and strength. Accordingly, temperance is one of the specu- <lb/>
            lative virtues, and it happens that good health usually follows <lb/>
            it, and is marshalled as it were beside it; in the same way as <lb/>
            strength follows the proper structure of an arch.-And the <lb/>
            unspeculative virtues derive their name from the fact of their <lb/>
            not proceeding from any acquiescence reflected by intelli- <lb/>
            gence ; but they are derived from others, are only accessories, <lb/>
            and are found even in worthless people, as in the case of good <lb/>
            health, or courage. And Posidonius, in the first book of his <lb/>
            treaties on Ethics, says that the great proof of the reality of <lb/>
            virtue is that Socrates, and Diogenes, and Antisthenes, made <lb/>
            great improvement; and the great proof of the reality of vice <lb/>
            may be found in the fact of its being opposed to virtue.</p>
          <p>Again, Chrysippus, in the first book of his treatise on the <lb/>
            Chief Good, and Cleanthes, and also Posidonius in his Ex- <lb/>
            hortations, and Hecaton, all agree that virtue may be taught. <lb/>
            And that they are right, and that it may be taught, is plain <lb/>
            from men becoming good after having been bad. On this <lb/>
            account Pansetius teaches that there are two virtues, one <lb/>
            speculative and the other practical; but others make three <lb/>
            kinds, the logical, the natural, and the ethical. Posidonius <lb/>
             <pb n="293"/>
            divides virtue into four divisions; and Cleanthes, Chrysippus, <lb/>
            and Antipater make the divisions more numerous still; for <lb/>
            Apollophanes asserts that there is but one virtue, namely, <lb/>
            prudence.</p>
          <p>Among the virtues some are primitive and some are derived. <lb/>
            The primitive ones are prudence, manly courage, justice, and <lb/>
            temperance. And subordinate to these, as a kind of species <lb/>
            contained in them, are magnanimity, continence, endurance, <lb/>
            presence of mind, wisdom in council. And the Stoics define <lb/>
            prudence as a knowledge of what is good, and bad, and in- <lb/>
            different ; justice as a knowledge of what ought to be chosen, <lb/>
            what ought to be avoided, and what is indifferent; magnanimity <lb/>
            as a knowledge of engendering a lofty habit, superior to all <lb/>
            such accidents as happen to all men indifferently, whether <lb/>
            they be good or bad; continence they consider a disposition <lb/>
            which never abandons right reason, or a habit which never <lb/>
            yields to pleasure ; endurance they call a knowledge or habit <lb/>
            by which we understand what we ought to endure, what we <lb/>
            ought not, and what is indifferent; presence of mind they <lb/>
            define as a habit which is prompt at finding out what is <lb/>
            suitable on a sudden emergency; and wisdom in counsel they <lb/>
            think a knowledge which leads us to judge what we are to do, <lb/>
            and how we are to do it, in order to act becomingly. And <lb/>
            analogously, of vices too there are some which are primary, <lb/>
            and some which are subordinate ; as, for instance, folly, and <lb/>
            cowardice, and injustice, and intemperance, are among the <lb/>
            primary vices ; incontinence, slowness, and folly in counsel <lb/>
            among the subordinate ones. And the vices are ignorance of <lb/>
            those things of which the virtues are the knowledge.</p>
          <p>LV. Good, looked at in a general way, is some advantage, <lb/>
            with the more particular distinction, being partly what is actually <lb/>
            useful, partly what is not contrary to utility. On which account <lb/>
            virtue itself, and the good which partakes of virtue are spoken <lb/>
            of in a threefold view of the subject. First, as to what kind <lb/>
            of good it is, and from what it ensues ; as, for instance, in an <lb/>
            action done according to virtue. Secondly, as to the agent, <lb/>
            in the case of a good man who partakes of virtue. <note type="footnote"> *****† <lb/>
            † The third point of view is wanting; and those that are given <lb/>
            appear to be ill selected. The French translator, following the hint of </note></p><pb n="294"/>
            
          <p>At another time, they define the good in a peculiar manner, <lb/>
            as being what is perfect according to the nature of a rational <lb/>
            being as rational being. And, secondly, they say that it is <lb/>
            conformity to virtue, so that all actions which partake of <lb/>
            virtue, and all good men, are themselves in some sense the <lb/>
            good. And in the third place, they speak of its accessories, <lb/>
            joy, and mirth, and things of that kind. In the same manner <lb/>
            they speak of vices, which they divide into folly, cowardice, <lb/>
            injustice, and things of that kind. And they consider that <lb/>
            those things which partake of vices, and actions done according <lb/>
            to vice, and bad men, are themselves in some sense the evil; <lb/>
            and its accessories are despondency, and melancholy, and other <lb/>
            things of that kind.</p>
          <p>LVI. Again, of goods, some have reference to the mind, <lb/>
            and some are external; and some neither have reference to <lb/>
            the mind, nor are external. The goods having reference to the <lb/>
            mind are virtues, and actions according to the virtues. The <lb/>
            external goods are the having a virtuous country, a virtuous <lb/>
            friend, and the happiness of one's country and friend. And <lb/>
            those which are not external, and which have no reference <lb/>
            to the mind, are such as a man's being virtuous and happy to <lb/>
            himself. And reciprocally, of evils, some have reference to <lb/>
            the mind, such as the vices and actions according to them; <lb/>
            some are external, such as having a foolish country, or a foolish <lb/>
            friend, or one's country or one's friend being unhappy. And <lb/>
            those evils which are not external, and which have no reference <lb/>
            to the mind, are such as a man's being worthless and unhappy <lb/>
            to himself.</p>
          <p>LVII. Again, of goods, some are final, some are efficient, <lb/>
            and some are both final and efficient. For instance, a friend, <note type="footnote"> Huebner, gives the following passage from Sextus Empiricus (a physi- <lb/>
            cian of the Sceptic school, about B.C. 250), in his work against the <lb/>
            Philosophers, which he says may serve to rectify and complete the <lb/>
            statement of Diogenes Laërtius. " Good is said in one sense of that <lb/>
            which produces the useful, or from which the useful results ; that is, <lb/>
            the good par excellence, virtue. For virtue is as it were the source <lb/>
            from which all utility naturally flows. In another sense it is said of <lb/>
            that which is accidentally the cause of utility; under this point of <lb/>
            view we call good not only virtue, but also those actions which are <lb/>
            conformable to virtue, for they are accidentally useful. In the third <lb/>
            and last place, we call good everything that possibly can be useful, <lb/>
            comprehending under this definition virtue, virtuous actions, friends, <lb/>
            good men, the Gods, &amp;c., &amp;c.” </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="295"/>
            and the services done by him to one, are efficient goods; <lb/>
            but courage, and prudence, and liberty, and delight, and <lb/>
            mirth, and freedom from pain, and all kinds of actions done <lb/>
            according to virtue, are final goods. There are too, as I said <lb/>
            before, some goods which are both efficient and final; for <lb/>
            inasmuch as they produce perfect happiness they are efficient, <lb/>
            and inasmuch as they complete it by being themselves parts <lb/>
            of it, they are final. And in the same way, of evils, some are <lb/>
            final, and some efficient, and some partake of both natures. <lb/>
            For instance, an enemy and the injuries done to one by him, <lb/>
            are efficient evils ; fear, meanness of condition, slavery, want <lb/>
            of delight, depression of spirits, excessive grief, and all actions <lb/>
            done according to vice, are final evils ; and some partake of <lb/>
            both characters, since, inasmuch as they produce perfect <lb/>
            unhappiness, they are efficient; and inasmuch as they complete <lb/>
            it in such a way as to become parts of it, they are final.</p>
          <p>LVIII. Again, of the goods which have reference to the <lb/>
            mind, some are habits, some are dispositions, and some are <lb/>
            neither habits nor dispositions. Dispositions are virtues, <lb/>
            habits are practices, and those which are neither habits nor <lb/>
            dispositions are energies. And, speaking generally, the <lb/>
            following may be called mixed goods: happiness in one's <lb/>
            children, and a happy old age. But knowledge is a pure good. <lb/>
            And some goods are continually present, such as virtue ; and <lb/>
            some are not always present, as joy, or taking a walk.</p>
          <p>LIX. But every good is expedient, and necessary, and <lb/>
            profitable, and useful, and serviceable, and beautiful, and <lb/>
            advantageous, and eligible, and just. Expedient, inasmuch as <lb/>
            it brings us things, which by their happening to us do us <lb/>
            good ; necessary, inasmuch as it assists us in what we have <lb/>
            need to be assisted ; profitable, inasmuch as it repays all the <lb/>
            care that is expended on it, and makes a return with interest <lb/>
            to our great advantage; useful, inasmuch as it supplies us <lb/>
            with what is of utility ; serviceable, because it does us service <lb/>
            which is much praised; beautiful, because it is in accurate <lb/>
            proportion to the need we have of it, and to the service it <lb/>
            does. Advantageous, inasmuch as it is of such a character as <lb/>
            to confer advantage on us ; eligible, because it is such that we <lb/>
            may rationally choose it; and just, because it is in accordance <lb/>
            with law, and is an efficient cause of union.</p>
          <p>And they call the honourable the perfect good, because it <lb/>
             <pb n="296"/>
            has naturally all the numbers which are required by nature, <lb/>
            and because it discloses a perfect harmony. Now, the species <lb/>
            of this perfect good are four in number: justice, manly courage, <lb/>
            temperance, and knowledge; for in these goods all beautiful <lb/>
            actions have their accomplishment. And analogously, there <lb/>
            are also four species of the disgraceful: injustice, and cowardice, <lb/>
            and intemperance, and folly. And the honourable is predicated <lb/>
            in one sense, as making those who are possessed of it worthy <lb/>
            of all praise; and in a second sense, it is used of what is well <lb/>
            adapted by nature for its proper work ; and in another sense, <lb/>
            when it expresses that which adorns a man, as when we say <lb/>
            that the wise man alone is good and honourable.</p>
          <p>The Stoics also say, that the beautiful is the only good, as <lb/>
            Hecaton says, in the third book of his treatise on Goods, and <lb/>
            Chrysippus asserts the same principle in his essays on the <lb/>
            Beautiful. And they say that this is virtue, and that which <lb/>
            partakes of virtue; and this assertion is equal to the other, <lb/>
            that everything good is beautiful, and that the good is an <lb/>
            equivalent term to the beautiful, inasmuch as the one thing is <lb/>
            exactly equal to the other. For since it is good, it is beautiful; <lb/>
            and it is beautiful, therefore, it is good.</p>
          <p>LX. But it seems that all goods are equal, and that every <lb/>
            good is to be desired in the highest degree, and that it admits <lb/>
            of no relaxation, and of no extension. Moreover, they divide <lb/>
            all existing things into good, bad, and indifferent. The good <lb/>
            are the virtues, prudence, justice, manly courage, temperance, <lb/>
            and the rest of the like qualities. The bad are the contraries, <lb/>
            folly, injustice, and the like. Those are indifferent which are <lb/>
            neither beneficial nor injurious, such as life, health, pleasure, <lb/>
            beauty, strength, riches, a good reputation, nobility of birth ; <lb/>
            and their contraries, death, disease, labour, disgrace, weakness, <lb/>
            poverty, a bad reputation, baseness of birth, and the like; as <lb/>
            Hecaton lays it down in the seventh book of his treatise on <lb/>
            the Chief Good ; and he is followed by Apollodorus, in his <lb/>
            Ethics, and by Chrysippus. For they affirm that those things <lb/>
            are not good but indifferent, though perhaps a little more near <lb/>
            to one species than to the other.</p>
          <p>For, as it is the property of the hot to warm and not to <lb/>
            chill one, so it is the property of the good to benefit and not <lb/>
            to injure one. Now, wealth and good health cannot be said <lb/>
            to benefit any more than to injure any one : therefore, neither <lb/>
             <pb n="297"/>
            wealth nor good health are, goods. Again, they say that that <lb/>
            thing is not good which it is possible to use both well and ill. <lb/>
            But it is possible to make either a good or a bad use of wealth, <lb/>
            or of health; therefore, wealth and good health are not goods. <lb/>
            Posidonius, however, affirms that these things do come under <lb/>
            the head of goods. But Hecaton, in the nineteenth book of <lb/>
            his treatise on Goods, and Chrysippus, in his treatises on <lb/>
            Pleasure, both deny that pleasure is a good. For they say <lb/>
            that there are disgraceful pleasures, and that nothing disgrace- <lb/>
            ful is good. And that to benefit a person is to move him or <lb/>
            to keep him according to virtue, but to injure him is to move <lb/>
            him or to keep him according to vice.</p>
          <p>They also assert, that things indifferent are so spoken of in <lb/>
            a twofold manner; firstly, those things are called so, which <lb/>
            have no influence in producing either happiness or unhappi- <lb/>
            ness ; such for instance, as riches, glory, health, strength, and <lb/>
            the like ; for it is possible for a man to be happy without any <lb/>
            of these things; and also, it is upon the character of the use <lb/>
            that is made of them, that happiness or unhappiness depends. <lb/>
            In another sense, those things are called indifferent, which <lb/>
            do not exite any inclination or aversion, as for instance, the <lb/>
            fact of a man's having an odd or an even number of hairs on <lb/>
            his head, or his putting out or drawing back his finger; for <lb/>
            it is not in this sense that the things previously mentioned <lb/>
            are called indifferent, for they do excite inclination or aver- <lb/>
            sion. On which account some of them are chosen, though <lb/>
            there is equal reason for preferring or shunning all the <lb/>
            others.</p>
          <p>LXI. Again, of things indifferent, they call some pre- <lb/>
            ferred (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πϩοηγμένα</foreign>), and others rejected (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποπϩοηγμένα</foreign>). Those <lb/>
            are preferred, which have some proper value (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀξιάν</foreign>), and those <lb/>
            are rejected, which have no value at all (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπαξιάν ἔχοντα</foreign>). <lb/>
            And by the term proper value, they mean that quality of <lb/>
            things, which causes them to concur in producing a well- <lb/>
            regulated life ; and in this sense, every good has a proper <lb/>
            value. Again, they say that a thing has value, when in some <lb/>
            point of view, it has a sort of intermediate power of aiding us <lb/>
            to live conformably to nature; and under this class, we may <lb/>
            range riches or good health, if they give any assistance to <lb/>
            natural life. Again, value is predicated of the price which <lb/>
            one gives for the attainment of an object, which some one, <lb/>
             <pb n="298"/>
            who has experience of)the object sought, fixes as its fair price ; <lb/>
            as if we were to say, for instance, that as some wheat was to <lb/>
            be exchanged for barley, with a mule thrown in to make up <lb/>
            the difference. Those goods then are preferred, which have a <lb/>
            value, as in the case of the mental goods, ability, skill, im- <lb/>
            provement, and the like; and in the case of the corporeal <lb/>
            goods, life, health, strength, a good constitution, soundness, <lb/>
            beauty; and in the case of external goods, riches, glory, <lb/>
            nobility of birth, and the like.</p>
          <p>Rejected things are, in the case of qualities of the mind, <lb/>
            stupidity, unskilfulness, and the like ; in the case of circum- <lb/>
            stances affecting the body, death, disease, weakness, a bad <lb/>
            constitution, mutilation, disgrace, and the like ; in the case <lb/>
            of external circumstances, poverty, want of reputation, ignoble <lb/>
            birth, and the like. But those qualities and circumstances <lb/>
            which are indifferent, are neither preferred nor rejected. <lb/>
            Again, of things preferred, some are preferred for their own <lb/>
            sakes, some for the sake of other things, and some partly for <lb/>
            their own sakes and partly for that of other things. Those <lb/>
            which are preferred for their own sakes, are ability, improve- <lb/>
            ment, and the like ; those which are preferred for the sake of <lb/>
            other things, are wealth, nobility of birth, and the like ; those <lb/>
            which are preferred partly for their own sake, and partly for <lb/>
            that of something else, are strength, vigour of the senses, <lb/>
            universal soundness, and the like; for they are preferred, for <lb/>
            their own sakes, inasmuch as they are in accordance with <lb/>
            nature ; and for the sake of something else, inasmuch as <lb/>
            they are productive of no small number of advantages ; and <lb/>
            the same is the case in the inverse ratio, with those things <lb/>
            which are rejected.</p>
          <p>LXII. Again, they say that that is duty, which is preferred, <lb/>
            and which contains in itself reasonable arguments why we <lb/>
            should prefer it; as for instance, its corresponding to the <lb/>
            nature of life itself; and this argument extends to plants and <lb/>
            animals, for even their nature is subject to the obligation of <lb/>
            certain duties. And duty (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ϰαθη̃ϰον</foreign>) had this name given to <lb/>
            it by Zeno, in the first instance, its appellation being derived <lb/>
            from its coming to, or according to some people, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸ του̃ ϰατά <lb/>
            τινας ἥϰειν</foreign>; and its effect is something kindred to the prepa- <lb/>
            rations made by nature. Now of the things done according <lb/>
            to inclination, some are duties, and some are contrary to <lb/>
            duty; and some are neither duties nor contrary to duty. <lb/>
             <pb n="299"/>
            Those are duties, which reason selects to do, as for instance, <lb/>
            to honour one's parents, one's brothers, one's country, to <lb/>
            gratify one's friends. Those actions are contrary to duty, <lb/>
            which reason does not choose; as for instance, to neglect one's <lb/>
            parents, to be indifferent to one's brothers, to shirk assisting <lb/>
            one's friends, to be careless about the welfare of one's country, <lb/>
            and so on. Those are neither duties, nor contrary to duty, <lb/>
            which reason neither selects to do, nor, on the other hand, <lb/>
            repudiates, such actions, for instance, as to pick up straw, to <lb/>
            hold a pen, or a comb, or things of that sort.</p>
          <p>Again, there are some duties which do not depend on cir- <lb/>
            cumstances, and some which do. These do not depend on <lb/>
            circumstances, to take care of one's health, and of the sound <lb/>
            state of one's senses, and the like. Those which do depend <lb/>
            on circumstances, are the mutilation of one's members, the <lb/>
            sacrificing of one's property, and so on. And the case of <lb/>
            those actions which are contrary to duty, is similar. Again, <lb/>
            of duties, some are always such, and some are not always. <lb/>
            What is always a duty, is to live in accordance with virtue; <lb/>
            but to ask questions, to give answers, to walk, and the like, <lb/>
            are not always duties. And the same statement holds good <lb/>
            with respect to acts contrary to duty.</p>
          <p>There is also a class of intermediate duties, such as the <lb/>
            duty of boys obeying their masters.</p>
          <p>LXIII. The Stoics also say that the mind is divisible into <lb/>
            eight parts; for that the five organs of sensation, and the <lb/>
            vocal power, and the intellectual power, which is the mind <lb/>
            itself, and the generative power, are all parts of the mind. <lb/>
            But by error, there is produced a perversion which operates on <lb/>
            the intellect, from which many perturbations arise, and many <lb/>
            causes of inconstancy. And all perturbation is itself, accord- <lb/>
            ing to Zeno, a movement of the mind, or superfluous inclina- <lb/>
            tion, which is irrational, and contrary to nature. Moreover, <lb/>
            of the |superior class of perturbations, as Hecaton says, in the <lb/>
            second book of his treatise on the Passions, and as Zeno <lb/>
            also says in his work on the Passions, there are four kinds, <lb/>
            grief, fear, desire, and pleasure. And they consider that <lb/>
            these perturbations are judgments, as Chrysippus contends in <lb/>
            his work on the Passions ; for covetousness is an opinion that <lb/>
            money is a beautiful object, and in like manner drunkenness <lb/>
            and intemperance, and other things of the sort, are judg- <lb/>
             <pb n="300"/>
            ments. And grief they define to be an irrational contraction <lb/>
            of the mind, and it is divided into the following species, pity, <lb/>
            envy, emulation, jealousy, pain, perturbation, sorrow, anguish, <lb/>
            confusion. Pity is a grief over some one, on the ground of <lb/>
            his being in undeserved distress. Envy is a grief, at the good <lb/>
            fortune of another. Emulation is a grief at that belonging to <lb/>
            some one else, which one desires one's self. Jealousy is a <lb/>
            grief at another also having what one has one's self. Pain is <lb/>
            a grief which weighs one down. Perturbation is grief which <lb/>
            narrows one, and causes one to feel in a strait. Sorrow is a <lb/>
            grief arising from deliberate thought, which endures for some <lb/>
            time, and gradually increases. Anguish is a grief with acute <lb/>
            pain. Confusion is an irrational grief, which frets one, and <lb/>
            prevents one from clearly discerning present circumstances. <lb/>
            But fear is the expectation of evil ; and the following feelings <lb/>
            are all classed under the head of fear: apprehension, hesita- <lb/>
            tion, shame, perplexity, trepidation, and anxiety. Apprehen- <lb/>
            sion is a fear which produces alarm. Shame is a fear of dis- <lb/>
            credit. Hesitation is a fear of coming activity. Perplexity <lb/>
            is a fear, from the imagination of some unusual thing. Tre- <lb/>
            pidation is a fear accompanied with an oppression of the voice. <lb/>
            Anxiety is a fear of some uncertain event.</p>
          <p>Again, desire is an irrational appetite ; to which head, the <lb/>
            following feelings are referrible: want, hatred, contentiousness, <lb/>
            anger, love, enmity, rage. Want is a desire arising from our <lb/>
            not having something or other, and is, as it were, separated <lb/>
            from the thing, but is still stretching, and attracted towards it <lb/>
            in vain. And hatred is a desire that it should be ill with <lb/>
            some one, accompanied with a certain continual increase and <lb/>
            extension. Contentiousness is a certain desire accompanied <lb/>
            with deliberate choice. Anger is a desire of revenge, on a <lb/>
            person who appears to have injured one in an unbecoming <lb/>
            way. Love is a desire not conversant about a virtuous object, <lb/>
            for it is an attempt to conciliate affection, because of some <lb/>
            beauty which is seen. Enmity is a certain anger of long <lb/>
            duration, and full of hatred, and it is a watchful passion, as is <lb/>
            shown in the following lines :— <lb/>
            For though we deem the short-liv'd fury past, <lb/>
            'Tis sure the mighty will revenge at last. * <note type="footnote"> * Horn. II. I. 81. Pope's Version, 1.105. </note></p><pb n="301"/>
            
          <p>But rage is anger at its commencement.</p>
          <p>Again, pleasure is an irrational elation of the mind over <lb/>
            something which appears to be desirable; and its different <lb/>
            species are enjoyment, rejoicing at evil, delight, and extrava- <lb/>
            gant joy. Enjoyment now, is a pleasure which charms the <lb/>
            mind through the ears. Rejoicing at evil (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιχαιρεϰαϰιά</foreign>), is a <lb/>
            pleasure which arises at the misfortunes of others. Delight <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τέϩψις</foreign>,) that is to say turning (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τϩέψις</foreign>), is a certain turning of <lb/>
            the soul (<foreign xml:lang="grc">προτροπή τις ψυχη̃ς</foreign>), to softness. Extravagant joy is <lb/>
            the dissolution of virtue. And as there are said to be some <lb/>
            sicknesses (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀῤῥωστηματα</foreign>,) in the body, as, for instance, gout and <lb/>
            arthritic disorders; so too are those diseases of the soul, such as a <lb/>
            fondness for glory, or for pleasure, and other feelings of that sort. <lb/>
            For an <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀῤῥώστημα</foreign> is a disease accompanied with weakness ; <lb/>
            and a disease is an opinion of something which appears ex- <lb/>
            ceedingly desirable. And, as in the case of the body, there <lb/>
            are illnesses to which people are especially liable, such as <lb/>
            colds or diarrhoea; so also are there propensities which the <lb/>
            mind is under the influence of, such as enviousness, pitifulness, <lb/>
            quarrelsomeness, and so on.</p>
          <p>There are also three good dispositions of the mind; joy, <lb/>
            caution, and will. And joy they say is the opposite of pleasure, <lb/>
            since it is a rational elation of the mind; so caution is the <lb/>
            opposite of fear, being a rational avoidance of anything, for <lb/>
            the wise man will never be afraid, but he will act with caution; <lb/>
            and will, they define as the opposite of desire, since it is a <lb/>
            rational wish. As therefore some things fall under the class <lb/>
            of the first perturbations, in the same manner do some things <lb/>
            fall under the class of the first good dispositions. And <lb/>
            accordingly, under the head of will, are classed goodwill, <lb/>
            placidity, salutation, affection; and under the head of caution <lb/>
            are ranged reverence and modesty; under the head of joy, <lb/>
            we speak of delight, mirth, and good spirits.</p>
          <p>LXIV. They say also, that the wise man is free from per- <lb/>
            turbations, because he has no strong propensities. But that <lb/>
            this freedom from propensities also exists in the bad man, <lb/>
            being, however, then quite another thing, inasmuch as it pro- <lb/>
            ceeds in him only from the hardness and unimpressibility of <lb/>
            his nature. They also pronounce the wise man free from <lb/>
            vanity, since he regards with equal eye what is glorious and <lb/>
            what is inglorious. At the same time, they admit that there <lb/>
             <pb n="302"/>
            is another character devoid of vanity, who, however, is only <lb/>
            reckoned one of the rash men, being in fact the bad man. <lb/>
            They also say that all the virtuous men are austere, because <lb/>
            they do never, speak with reference to pleasure, nor do they <lb/>
            listen to what is said by others with reference to pleasure. <lb/>
            At the same time, they call another man austere too, using the <lb/>
            term in nearly the same sense as they do when they speak of <lb/>
            austere wine, which is used in compounding medicines, but <lb/>
            not for drinking.</p>
          <p>They also pronounce the wise to be honest-hearted men, <lb/>
            anxiously attending to those matters which may make them <lb/>
            better, by means of some principle which conceals what is <lb/>
            bad, and brings to light what is good. Nor is there any <lb/>
            hypocrisy about them; for they cut off all pretence in their <lb/>
            voice and appearance. They also keep aloof from business; for <lb/>
            they guard carefully against doing any thing contrary to <lb/>
            their duty. They drink wine, but they do not get drunk ; <lb/>
            and they never yield to frenzy. Occasionally, extraordinary <lb/>
            imaginations may obtain a momentary power over them, <lb/>
            owing to some melancholy or trifling, arising not according to <lb/>
            . the principle of what is desirable, but contrary to nature. <lb/>
            Nor, again, will the wise man feel grief; because grief is an <lb/>
            irrational contraction of the soul, as Apollodorus defines it <lb/>
            in his Ethics.</p>
          <p>They are also, as they say, godlike ; for they have something <lb/>
            in them which is as it were a God. But the bad man is an <lb/>
            atheist. Now there are two kinds of atheists; one who <lb/>
            speaks in a spirit of hostility to, and the other, who utterly <lb/>
            disregards, the divine nature; but they admit that all bad <lb/>
            men are not atheists in this last sense. The good, on the <lb/>
            contrary, are pious; for they have a thorough acquaintance <lb/>
            with the laws respecting the Gods. And piety is a knowledge <lb/>
            of the proper reverence and worship due to the Gods. <lb/>
            Moreover they sacrifice to the Gods, and keep themselves <lb/>
            pure; for they avoid all offences having reference to the <lb/>
            Gods, and the Gods admire them ; for they are holy and just <lb/>
            in all that concerns the Deity; and the wise men are the <lb/>
            only priests; for they consider the matters relating to sacri- <lb/>
            fices, and the erection of temples, and purifications, and all <lb/>
            other things which peculiarly concern the Gods. They <lb/>
            also pronounce that men are bound to honour their parents, <lb/>
            and their brethren, in the second place after the Gods. <lb/>
             <pb n="303"/>
            They also say that parental affection for one's children is <lb/>
            natural to them, and is a feeling which does not exist in bad <lb/>
            men. And they lay down the position that all offences are <lb/>
            equal, as Chrysippus argues in the fourth book of his Ethic <lb/>
            Questions, and so say Persæus and Zeno. For if one thing <lb/>
            that is true is not more true than another thing that is true, <lb/>
            neither is one thing that is false more false than another <lb/>
            thing that is false; so too, one deceit is not greater than another, <lb/>
            nor one sin than another. For the man who is a hundred <lb/>
            furlongs from Canopus, and the man who is only one, are both <lb/>
            equally not in Canopus ; and so too, he who commits a greater <lb/>
            sin, and he who commits a less, are both equally not in <lb/>
            the right path.</p>
          <p>Heraclides of Tarsus, indeed, the friend of Antipater, of <lb/>
            Tarsus, and Atbenodorus, both assert that offences are not <lb/>
            equal.</p>
          <p>Again, the Stoics, as for instance, Chrysippus, in the first <lb/>
            book of his work on Lives, say, that the wise man will take a <lb/>
            part in the affairs of the state, if nothing hinders him. For <lb/>
            that he will restrain vice, and excite men to virtue. Also, <lb/>
            they say that he will marry, as Zeno says, in his Republic, <lb/>
            and beget children. Moreover, that the wise man will never <lb/>
            form mere opinions, that is to say, he will never agree to <lb/>
            anything that is false ; and that he will become a Cynic ; for <lb/>
            that Cynicism is a short path to virtue, as Apollodorus calls <lb/>
            it in his Ethics ; that he will even eat human flesh, if there <lb/>
            should be occasion; that he is the only free man, and that <lb/>
            the bad are slaves ; for that freedom is a power of indepen- <lb/>
            dent action, but slavery a deprivation of the same. That <lb/>
            there is besides, another slavery, which consists in subjection, <lb/>
            and a third which consists in possession and subjection; the <lb/>
            contrary of which is masterhood, which is likewise bad.</p>
          <p>And they say, that not only are the wise free, but that they <lb/>
            are also kings, since kingly power is an irresponsible dominion, <lb/>
            which can only exist in the case of the wise man, as Chry- <lb/>
            sippus says in his treatise on the Proper Application of his <lb/>
            Terms made by Zeno; for he says that a ruler ought to give <lb/>
            decisions on good and evil, and that none of the wicked <lb/>
            understand these things. In the same way, they assert that <lb/>
            they are the only people who are fit to be magistrates or <lb/>
            judges, or orators, and that none of the bad are qualified for <lb/>
            these tasks. Moreover, that they are free from all error, in <lb/>
             <pb n="304"/>
            consequence of their not being prone to any wrong actions. <lb/>
            Also, that they are unconnected with injury, for that they <lb/>
            never injure any one else, nor themselves. Also, that they <lb/>
            are not pitiful, and that they never make allowance for -any <lb/>
            one; for that they do not relax the punishments appointed by <lb/>
            Jaw, since yielding, and pity, and mercifulness itself, never <lb/>
            exist in any of their souls, so as to induce an affectation of <lb/>
            kindness in respect of punishment; nor do they ever think <lb/>
            any punishment too severe. Again, they say that the wise <lb/>
            man never wonders at any of the things which appear extra- <lb/>
            ordinary ; as for instance, at the stories about Charon, or the <lb/>
            ebbing of the tide, or the springs of hot water, or the burst- <lb/>
            ing forth of flames. But, say they further, the wise man <lb/>
            will not live in solitude ; for he is by nature sociable and <lb/>
            practical. Accordingly, he will take exercise for the sake of <lb/>
            hardening and invigorating his body. And the wise man will <lb/>
            pray, asking good things from the Gods, as Posidonius says in <lb/>
            the first book of his treatise on Duties, and Hecaton says the <lb/>
            same thing in the thirteenth book of his treatise on Extra- <lb/>
            ordinary Things.</p>
          <p>They also say, that friendship exists in the virtuous alone, <lb/>
            on account of their resemblance to one another. And they <lb/>
            describe friendship itself as a certain communion of the things <lb/>
            which concern life, since we use our friends as ourselves. And <lb/>
            they assert that a friend is desirable for his own sake, and that <lb/>
            a number of friends is a good ; and that among the wicked <lb/>
            there is no such thing as friendship, and that no wicked man <lb/>
            can have a friend.</p>
          <p>Again, they say that all the foolish are mad; for that they <lb/>
            are not prudent, and that madness is equivalent to folly in <lb/>
            every one of its actions ; but that the wise man does every- <lb/>
            thing properly, just as we say that Ismenias can play every <lb/>
            piece of flute-music well. Also, they say that everything <lb/>
            belongs to the wise man, for that the law has given them <lb/>
            perfect and universal power ; but some things also are said to <lb/>
            belong to the wicked, just in the same manner as some things <lb/>
            are said to belong to the unjust, or as a house is said to belong <lb/>
            to a city in a different sense from that in which a thing belongs <lb/>
            to the person who uses it.</p>
          <p>LXV. And they say that virtues reciprocally follow one <lb/>
            another, and that he who has one has all; for that the precepts <lb/>
             <pb n="305"/>
            of them all are common, as Chrysippus affirms in the first <lb/>
            book of his treatise on Laws; and Apollodorus, in his Natural <lb/>
            Philosophy, according to the ancient system; and Hecaton, in <lb/>
            the third book of his treatise on Virtues. For they say that <lb/>
            the man who is endued with virtue, is able to consider and <lb/>
            also to do what must be done. But what must be done must <lb/>
            be cHosen, and encountered, and distributed, and awaited ; so <lb/>
            that if the man does some things by deliberate choice, and <lb/>
            some in a spirit of endurance, and some distributively, and <lb/>
            some patiently; he is prudent, and courageous, and just, and <lb/>
            temperate. And each of the virtues has a particular subject <lb/>
            of its own, about which it is conversant; as, for instance, <lb/>
            courage is conversant about the things which must be endured; <lb/>
            prudence is conversant about what must be done and what <lb/>
            must not, and what is of a neutral or indifferent character. <lb/>
            And in like manner, the other virtues are conversant about <lb/>
            their own peculiar subjects; and wisdom in counsel and <lb/>
            shrewdness follow prudence ; and good order and decorum <lb/>
            follow temperance; and equality and goodness of judgment <lb/>
            follow justice ; and constancy and energy follow courage.</p>
          <p>Another doctrine of the Stoics is, that there is nothing <lb/>
            intermediate between virtue and vice ; while the Peripatetics <lb/>
            assert that there is a stage between virtue and vice, being an <lb/>
            improvement on vice which has not yet arrived at virtue. For <lb/>
            the Stoics say, that as a stick must be either straight or <lb/>
            crooked, so a man must be either just or unjust, and cannot <lb/>
            be more just than just, or more unjust than unjust; and that <lb/>
            the same rule applies to all cases. Moreover, Chrysippus is <lb/>
            of opinion that virtue can be lost, but Cleanthes affirms that <lb/>
            it cannot; the one saying that it can be lost by drunkenness <lb/>
            or melancholy, the other maintaining that it cannot be lost on <lb/>
            account of the firm perceptions which it implants in men. <lb/>
            They also pronounce it a proper object of choice ; accordingly, <lb/>
            we are ashamed of actions which we do improperly, while we <lb/>
            are aware that what is honourable is the only good. Again, <lb/>
            they affirm that it is of itself sufficient for happiness, as Zeno <lb/>
            says, and he is followed in this assertion by Chrysippus in the <lb/>
            first book of his treatise on Virtues, and by Hecaton in the <lb/>
            second book of his treatise on Goods.</p>
          <p>" For if," says he, " magnanimity be sufficient of itself to <lb/>
            enable us to act in a manner superior to all other men; and <note type="footnote"> x </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="306"/>
            if that is a part of virtue, then virtue is of itself sufficient for <lb/>
            happiness, despising all things which seem troublesome to it." <lb/>
            However, Panætius and Posidonius do not admit that virtue <lb/>
            has this sufficiency of itself, but say that there is also need of <lb/>
            good health, and competency, and strength. And their opinion <lb/>
            is that a man exercises virtue in everything, as Cleanthes <lb/>
            asserts, for it cannot be lost; and the virtuous man on every <lb/>
            occasion exercises his soul, which is in a state of perfection.</p>
          <p>LXVI. Again, they say that justice exists by nature, and <lb/>
            not because of any definition or principle ; just as law does, <lb/>
            or right reason, as Chrysippus tells us in his treatise on the <lb/>
            Beautiful; and they think that one ought not to abandon <lb/>
            philosophy on account of the different opinions prevailing <lb/>
            among philosophers, since on this principle one would wholly <lb/>
            quit life, as Posidonius argues in his Exhortatory Essays. <lb/>
            Another doctrine of Chrysyppus is, that general learning is <lb/>
            very useful.</p>
          <p>And the School in. general maintain that there are no <lb/>
            obligations of justice binding on us with reference to other <lb/>
            animals, on account of their dissimilarity to us, as Chrysippus <lb/>
            asserts in the first book of his treatise on Justice, and the <lb/>
            same opinion is maintained by Posidonius in the first book of <lb/>
            his treatise on Duty. They say too, that the wise man will <lb/>
            love those young men, who by their outward appearance, show <lb/>
            a natural aptitude for virtue ; and this opinion is advanced by <lb/>
            Zeno, in his Republic, and by Chrysippus in the first book of <lb/>
            his work on Lives, and by Apollodorus in his Ethics. And <lb/>
            they describe love as an endeavour to benefit a friend on <lb/>
            account of his visible beauty; and that it is an attribute not <lb/>
            of acquaintanceship, but of friendship. Accordingly, that <lb/>
            Thrasmides, although he had his mistress in his power, <lb/>
            abstained from her, because he was hated by her. Love, <lb/>
            therefore, according to them is a part of friendship, as Chry- <lb/>
            sippus asserts in his essay on Love ; and it is not blameable. <lb/>
            Moreover, beauty is the flower of virtue.</p>
          <p>And as there are three kinds of lives ; the theoretical, the <lb/>
            practical, and the logical; they say that the last is the one <lb/>
            which ought to be chosen. For that a logical, that is a rational, <lb/>
            animal was made by nature on purpose for speculation and <lb/>
            action. And they say that a wise man will very rationally <lb/>
            take himself out of life, either for the sake of his country or of <lb/>
             <pb n="307"/>
            his friends, or if he be in bitter pain, or under the affliction <lb/>
            of mutilation, or incurable disease. And they also teach that <lb/>
            women ought to be in common among the wise, so that who- <lb/>
            ever meets with any one may enjoy her, and this doctrine is <lb/>
            maintained by Zeno in his Republic, and by Chrysippus in <lb/>
            his treatise on Polity, and by Diogenes the Cynic, and by <lb/>
            Plato ; and then, say they, we shall love all boys equally after <lb/>
            the manner of fathers, and all suspicion on the ground of <lb/>
            undue familiarity will be removed.</p>
          <p>They affirm too, that the best of political constitutions is a <lb/>
            mixed one, combined of democracy, and kingly power, and <lb/>
            aristocracy. And they say many things of this sort, and more <lb/>
            too, in their Ethical Dogmas, and they maintain them by <lb/>
            suitable explanations and arguments. But this may be enough <lb/>
            for us to say of their doctrines on this head by way of summary, <lb/>
            and taking them in an elementary manner.</p>
          <p>LXVII. They divide natural philosophy into the topics of <lb/>
            bodies, and of principles, and of elements, and of Gods, and of <lb/>
            boundaries, and of place, and of the vacuum. And they make <lb/>
            these divisions according to species; but according to genera <lb/>
            they divide them into three topics, that of the world, that of <lb/>
            the elements, and the third is that which reasons on causes. <lb/>
            The topic about the world, they say, is subdivided into two <lb/>
            parts. For that in one point of view, the mathematicians <lb/>
            also have a share in it; and according to it it is that they <lb/>
            prosecute their investigations into the nature of the fixed <lb/>
            stars and the planets; as, for instance, whether the sun is of <lb/>
            such a size as he appears to be, and similarly, whether the <lb/>
            moon is ; and in the same way they investigate the question of <lb/>
            spherical motion, and others of the same character. The <lb/>
            other point of view is that which is reserved exclusively for <lb/>
            natural philosophers, according to which it is that the existence <lb/>
            and substance of things are examined, [for instance, whether <lb/>
            the sun and the stars consist of matter and form,] and whether <lb/>
            the sun is born or not born, whether it is living or lifeless, <lb/>
            corruptible or incorruptible, whether it is regulated by Provi- <lb/>
            dence, and other questions of this kind.</p>
          <p>The topic which examines into causes they say is also <lb/>
            divisible into two parts; and with reference to one of its <lb/>
            considerations, the investigations of physicians partake of it; <lb/>
            according to which it is that they investigate the dominant <note type="footnote"> x 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="308"/>
            principle of the soul, and the things which exist in the <lb/>
            soul, and seeds, and things of this kind. And its other <lb/>
            division is claimed as belonging to them also by the mathema- <lb/>
            ticians, as, for instance, how we see, what is the cause of our <lb/>
            appearance being reflected in a mirror, how clouds are collected. <lb/>
            how thunder is produced, and the rainbow, and the halo, and <lb/>
            comets, and things of that kind.</p>
          <p>LXVIII. They think that there are two general principles <lb/>
            in the universe, the active and the passive. That the passive <lb/>
            is matter, an existence without any distinctive quality. That <lb/>
            the active is the reason which exists in the passive, that is to <lb/>
            say, God. For that he, being eternal, and existing through- <lb/>
            out all matter, makes everything. And Zeno, the Cittiæan, <lb/>
            lays down this doctrine in his treatise on Essence, and so does <lb/>
            Cleanthes in his essay on Atoms, Chrysippus in the first book <lb/>
            of his Investigations in Natural Philosophy, towards the end, <lb/>
            Archedemus in his work on Elements, and Posidonius in the <lb/>
            second book of his treatise on Natural Philosophy. But they <lb/>
            say that principles and elements differ from one another. For <lb/>
            that the one had no generation or beginning, and will have no <lb/>
            end ; but that the elements may be destroyed by the operation <lb/>
            ■ of fire. Also, that the elements are bodies, but principles <lb/>
            have no bodies and no forms, and elements too have forms.</p>
          <p>Now a body, says Apollodorus in his Natural Philosophy, is <lb/>
            extended in a threefold manner; in length, in breadth, in <lb/>
            depth; and then it is called a solid body ; and the superficies <lb/>
            is the limit of the body having length and breadth alone, but <lb/>
            not depth. But Posidonius, in the third book of his Heavenly <lb/>
            Phenomena, will not allow a superficies either any substantial <lb/>
            reality, or any intelligible existence. A line is the limit of a <lb/>
            superficies, or length without breadth, or something which has <lb/>
            nothing but length. A point is the boundary of a line, and is <lb/>
            the smallest of all symbols.</p>
          <p>They also teach that God is unity, and that he is called <lb/>
            Mind, and Fate, and Jupiter, and by many other names be- <lb/>
            sides. And that, as he was in the beginning by himself, be <lb/>
            turned into water the whole substance which pervaded the air ; <lb/>
            and as the seed is contained in the produce, so too, he being <lb/>
            the seminal principle of the world, remained behind in <lb/>
            moisture, making matter fit to be employed by himself in the <lb/>
            production of those things which were to come after; and, <lb/>
             <pb n="309"/>
            then, first of all, be made the four elements, fire, water, air, <lb/>
            and earth. And Zeno speaks of these in his treatise on the <lb/>
            Universe, and so does Chrysippus in the first book of his <lb/>
            Physics, and so does Archedemus in some treatise on the <lb/>
            Elements.</p>
          <p>LXIX. Now an element is that out of which at first all <lb/>
            things which are are produced, and into which all things are <lb/>
            resolved at last. And the four elements are all equally an <lb/>
            essence without any distinctive quality, namely, matter; but <lb/>
            fire is the hot, water the moist, air the cold, and earth the dry <lb/>
            -though this last quality is also common to the air. The fire, <lb/>
            is the highest, and that is called aether, in which first of all <lb/>
            the sphere was generated in which the fixed stars are set, <lb/>
            then that in which the planets revolve ; after that the air, <lb/>
            then the water; and the sediment as it were of all is the <lb/>
            earth, which is placed in the centre of the rest.</p>
          <p>LXX. They also speak of the world in a threefold sense; <lb/>
            at one time meaning God himself, whom they call a being of <lb/>
            a certain quality, having for his peculiar manifestation universal <lb/>
            substance, a being imperishable, and who never had any <lb/>
            generation, being the maker of the arrangement and order <lb/>
            that we see; and who, after certain periods of time, absorbs <lb/>
            all substance in himself, and then re-produces it from himself. <lb/>
            And this arrangement of the stars they call the world, and so <lb/>
            the third sense is one composed of both the preceding ones. <lb/>
            And the world is a thing which is peculiarly of such and such <lb/>
            a quality consisting of universal substance, as Posidonius <lb/>
            affirms in his Meteorological Elements, being a system com- <lb/>
            pounded of heaven and earth, and all the creatures which <lb/>
            exist in them; or it may be called a system compounded of <lb/>
            Gods and men, and of the things created on their account. <lb/>
            And the heaven is the most remote circumference of the <lb/>
            world, in which all the Divine Nature is situated.</p>
          <p>Again, the world is inhabited and regulated according to <lb/>
            intellect and providence, as Chrysippus says, in his works on <lb/>
            Providence, and Posidonius in the thirteenth book of his <lb/>
            treatise on Gods, since mind penetrates into every part of the <lb/>
            world, just as the soul pervades us; but it is in a greater <lb/>
            degree in some parts, and in a less degree in others. For <lb/>
            instance, it penetrates as a habit, as, for instance, into the <lb/>
            bones and sinews; and into some it penetrates as the mind <lb/>
             <pb n="310"/>
            does, for instance, into the dominant principle. And thus the <lb/>
            whole world, being a living thing, endowed with a soul and <lb/>
            with reason, has the æther as its dominant principle, as <lb/>
            Antipater, of Tyre, says in the eighth book of his treatise on <lb/>
            the World. But Chrysippus, in the first book of his essay on <lb/>
            Providence, and Posidonius in his treatise on Gods, say that <lb/>
            the heaven is the dominant principle of the world; and <lb/>
            Cleanthes attributes this to the sun. Chrysippus, however, <lb/>
            on this point contradicts himself; for he says in another place, <lb/>
            that the most subtle portion of the aether, which is also called <lb/>
            by the Stoics the first God, is what is infused in a sensible <lb/>
            manner into all the beings which are in the air, and through <lb/>
            every animal and every plant, and through the earth itself <lb/>
            according to a certain habit; and that it is this which com- <lb/>
            municates to them the faculty of feeling.</p>
          <p>They say too, that the world is one and also finite, having <lb/>
            a spherical form. For that such a shape is the most convenient <lb/>
            for motion, as Posidonius says, in the fifteenth book of his <lb/>
            Discussions on Natural Philosophy, and so says Antipater also <lb/>
            in his essay on the World. And on the outside there is <lb/>
            diffused around it a boundless vacuum, which is incorporeal. <lb/>
            And it is incorporeal inasmuch, as it is capable of being con- <lb/>
            tained by bodies, but is not so. And that there is no such <lb/>
            thing as a vacuum in the world, but that it is all closely united <lb/>
            and compact; for that this condition is necessarily brought <lb/>
            about by the concord and harmony which exist between the <lb/>
            heavenly bodies and those of the earth. And Chrysippus <lb/>
            mentions a vacuum in his essay on a Vacuum, and also in the <lb/>
            first book of his treatise on the Physical Arts, and so does <lb/>
            Apollophanes in his Natural Philosophy, and so does Apollo- <lb/>
            dorus, and so does Posidonius in the second book of his <lb/>
            discourses on Natural Philosophy. And they say that these <lb/>
            things are all incorporeal, and all alike. Moreover, that time <lb/>
            is incorporeal, since it is an interval of the motion of the <lb/>
            world. And that of time, the past and the future are both <lb/>
            illimitable, but the present is limited. And they assert that <lb/>
            the world is perishable, inasmuch as it was produced by reason, <lb/>
            and is one of the things which are perceptible by the senses; <lb/>
            and whatever has its parts perishable, must also be perishable <lb/>
            in the whole. And the parts of the world are perishable, for <lb/>
            they change into one another. Therefore, the whole world is <lb/>
             <pb n="311"/>
            perishable. And again, if anything admits of a change for the <lb/>
            worse it is perishable ; therefore, the world is perishable, for it <lb/>
            can be dried up, and it can be covered with water.</p>
          <p>Now the world was created when its substance was changed <lb/>
            from fire to moisture, by the action of the air; and then its <lb/>
            denser parts coagulated, and so the earth was made, and the <lb/>
            thinner portions were evaporated and became air; and this <lb/>
            being rarefied more and more, produced fire. And then, by <lb/>
            the combination of all these elements, were produced plants <lb/>
            and animals, and other kinds of things. Now Zeno speaks <lb/>
            of the creation, and of the destruction of the world, in his <lb/>
            treatise on the Universe, and so does Cleanthes, and so does <lb/>
            Antipater, in the tenth book of his treatise on the World. <lb/>
            But Panætius asserts that the world is imperishable.</p>
          <p>Again, that the world is an animal, and that it is endued <lb/>
            with reason, and life, and intellect, is affirmed by Chrysippus, <lb/>
            in the first volume of his treatise on Providence, and by <lb/>
            Apollodorus in his Natural Philosophy, and by Posidonius ; <lb/>
            and that it is an animal in this sense, as being an essence <lb/>
            endued with life, and with sensation. For that which is an <lb/>
            animal, is better than that which is not an animal. But <lb/>
            nothing is better than the world; therefore the world is an <lb/>
            animal. And it is endued with life, as is plain from the fact <lb/>
            of our own soul being as it were a fragment broken off from <lb/>
            it. But Boethus denies that the world is an animal.</p>
          <p>Again, that the world is one, is affirmed by Zeno, in his <lb/>
            treatise on the Universe, and by Chrysippus, and by Apollo- <lb/>
            dorus, in his Natural Philosophy, and by Posidonius, in the <lb/>
            first book of his Discourses on Natural Philosophy. And by <lb/>
            the term, the universe, according to Apollodorus, is understood <lb/>
            both the world itself, and also the whole of the world itself, <lb/>
            and of the exterior vacuum taken together. The world, then, <lb/>
            is finite, and the vacuum infinite.</p>
          <p>LXXI. Of the stars, those which are fixed are only moved <lb/>
            in connection with the movements of the entire heaven ; but <lb/>
            the planets move according to their own peculiar and separate <lb/>
            motions. And the sun takes an oblique path through the <lb/>
            circle of the zodiac, and in the same manner also does the <lb/>
            moon, which is of a winding form. And the sun is pure fire, <lb/>
            as Posidonius asserts in the seventh book of his treatise on <lb/>
            the Heavenly Bodies, and it is larger than the earth, as the <lb/>
             <pb n="312"/>
            same author informs us, in the sixteenth book of his Dis- <lb/>
            closures on Natural Philosophy. Also it is spherical, as he <lb/>
            says in another place, being made on the same principle as <lb/>
            the world is. Therefore it is fire, because it performs all the <lb/>
            functions of fire. And it is larger than the earth, as is <lb/>
            proved by the fact of the whole earth being illuminated by it, <lb/>
            and also the whole heaven. Also the fact of the earth throw- <lb/>
            ing a conical shadow, proves that the sun is greater than it; <lb/>
            and the sun is seen in every part, because of its magnitude. <lb/>
            But the moon is of a more earthy nature than the sun, <lb/>
            inasmuch as it is nearer the earth.</p>
          <p>Moreover, they say that all these fiery bodies, and all the <lb/>
            other stars, receive nutriment; the sun from the vast sea, <lb/>
            being a sort of intellectual appendage; and the moon from <lb/>
            the fresh waters, being mingled with the air, and also near <lb/>
            the earth, as Posidonius explains it in the sixth book of his <lb/>
            Discourses on Natural Philosophy. And all the other stars <lb/>
            derive their nourishment from the earth. They also consider <lb/>
            that the stars are of a spherical figure, and that the earth <lb/>
            is immovable. And that the moon has not a light of her <lb/>
            own, but that she borrows it from the sun. And that the sun <lb/>
            is eclipsed, when the moon runs in front of it on the side <lb/>
            towards us, as Zeno describes in his work on the Universe; <lb/>
            for when it comes across it in its passage, it conceals it, and <lb/>
            again it reveals it; and this is a phenomenon easily seen in a <lb/>
            basin of water. And the moon is eclipsed when it comes <lb/>
            below the shadow of the earth, on which account this never <lb/>
            happens, except at the time of the full moon; and although <lb/>
            it is diametrically opposite to the sun every month, still it is <lb/>
            not eclipsed every month, because when its motions are <lb/>
            obliquely towards the sun, it does not find itself in the same <lb/>
            place as the sun, being either a little more to the north, or a <lb/>
            little more to the south. When therefore it is found in the <lb/>
            same place with the sun, and with the other intermediate <lb/>
            objects, then it takes as it were the diameter of the sun, and <lb/>
            is eclipsed. And its place is along the line which runs <lb/>
            between the crab and the scorpion, and the ram and the bull, <lb/>
            as Posidonius tells us.</p>
          <p>LXXII. They also say that God is an animal immortal, <lb/>
            rational, perfect, and intellectual in his happiness, unsuscept- <lb/>
            ible of any kind of evil, having a foreknowledge of the world <lb/>
             <pb n="313"/>
            and of all that is in the world ; however, that he has not the <lb/>
            figure of a man; and that he is the creator of the universe, <lb/>
            and as it were, the Father of all things in common, and that <lb/>
            a portion of him pervades everything, which is called by <lb/>
            different names, according to its powers ; for they call him <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δία</foreign>. <lb/>
            as being the person (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δἰ ὃν</foreign>) everything is, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ζη̃να</foreign>, inasmuch <lb/>
            as he is the cause of life, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">το̃υ Ζῃ̃ν</foreign>), or because he pervades <lb/>
            life. And <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀθηνα̃</foreign>, with reference to the extension of his <lb/>
            dominant power over the æther (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰς αἰθέρα</foreign>). And "Hga, on <lb/>
            account of his extension through the air (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰς ἀέρα</foreign>). And <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἤϕαιστος</foreign>, on account of his pervading fire, which is the <lb/>
            chief instrument of art; and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ποσειδων</foreign>, as pervading moisture, <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δημήτηρ</foreign>, as pervading the earth (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Γη̃</foreign>). And in the same <lb/>
            way, regarding some other of his peculiar attributes, they <lb/>
            have given him other names.*</p>
          <p>The substance of God is asserted by Zeno to be the universal <lb/>
            world, and the heaven; and Chrysippus agrees with this <lb/>
            doctrine, in his eleventh book on the Gods; and so also does <lb/>
            Posidonius, in the first book of his treatise on the same sub- <lb/>
            ject. Antipater, in the seventh book of his treatise on the <lb/>
            World, says that his substance is aerial. And Boethus, in his <lb/>
            treatise on Nature, calls the substance of God the sphere of <lb/>
            the fixed stars.</p>
          <p>LXXIII. And his nature they define to be, that which <lb/>
            keeps the world together, and sometimes that which produces <lb/>
            the things upon the earth. And nature is a habit which <lb/>
            derives its movements from itself, perfecting and holding <lb/>
            together all that arises out of it, according to the principles of <lb/>
            production, in certain definite periods, and doing the same as <lb/>
            the things from which it is separated. And it has for its <lb/>
            object, suitableness and pleasure, as is plain from its having <lb/>
            created man.</p>
          <p>LXXIV. But Chrysippus, in his treatise on Fate, and <lb/>
            Posidonius, in the second book of his work on Fate, and <lb/>
            Zeno, and Boethus, in the eleventh book of his treatise on <lb/>
            Fate, say, that all things are produced by fate. And fate, <note type="footnote"> * It is hardly necessary to remark that ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αθηνα̃</foreign> is the name of <lb/>
            Minerva, not of Jupiter; "Hpa, of Juno ; <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἤϕαιστος</foreign>, of Vulcan; <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ποσειδω̃ν</foreign>, of Neptune, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δημήτηρ</foreign>, of Ceres. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἤϕαιστος</foreign> is properly <lb/>

            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰμαρμένη</foreign>), is a connected (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰρομένη</foreign>) cause of existing things, <lb/>
            or the reason according to which the world is regulated.</p>
          <p>LXXV. They also say that divination has a universal <lb/>
            existence, since Providence has; and they define it as an act <lb/>
            on account of certain results, as Zeno and Chrysippus, in the <lb/>
            second book of his treatise on Divination, and Athenodorus <lb/>
            and Posidonius, in the twelfth book of his discourses on <lb/>
            Natural Philosophy, and in the fifth book of his treatise on <lb/>
            Divination, all agree in saying; for Panætius denies that it <lb/>
            has any certain foundation.</p>
          <p>LXXVI. And they say that the substance of all existing <lb/>
            things is Primary Matter, as Chrysippus asserts in the first <lb/>
            book of his Physics; and Zeno says the same. Now matter <lb/>
            is that from which anything whatever is produced. And it is <lb/>
            called by a twofold appellation, essence and matter ; the one <lb/>
            as relating to all things taken together, and the other to <lb/>
            things in particular and separate. The one which relates to <lb/>
            all things taken together, never becomes either greater or <lb/>
            less; but the one relating to things in particular, does become <lb/>
            greater or less, as the case may be.</p>
          <p>LXXVII. Body is, according to them, a substance and <lb/>
            finite ; as Antipater says, in the second book of his treatise on <lb/>
            Substance; and Apollodorus, in his Natural Philosophy,'agrees <lb/>
            with him. It is also subject to change, as we learn from the <lb/>
            same author; for if it were immutable, then the things which <lb/>
            have been produced out of it would not have been produced; <lb/>
            on which account he also says that it is infinitely divisible : <lb/>
            but Chrysippus denies that it is infinite ; for that nothing is <lb/>
            infinite, which is divisible at all.</p>
          <p>LXXVIII. He admits, however, that it is infinitely <lb/>
            divisible, and that its concretions take place over the whole <lb/>
            of it, as he explains in the third book of his Physics, and not <lb/>
            according to any circumference or juxtaposition; for a little <lb/>
            wine when thrown into the sea, will keep its distinctness for a <lb/>
            brief period, but after that, will be lost.</p>
          <p>LXXIX. They also say that there are some Dæmones, <lb/>
            who have a sympathy with mankind, being surveyors of all <lb/>
            human affairs ; and that there are heroes, which are the souls <lb/>
            of virtuous men, which have left their bodies.</p>
          <p>LXXX. Of the things which take place in the air, they <lb/>
            say that winter is the effect of the air above the earth being <lb/>
             <pb n="315"/>
            cooled, on account of the retirement of the sun to a greater <lb/>
            distance than before; that spring is a good temperature of <lb/>
            the air, according to the sun's approach towards us; that <lb/>
            summer is the effect of the air above the earth being warmed <lb/>
            by the approach of the sun towards the north; that autumn <lb/>
            is caused by the retreat of the sun from us. <lb/>
            to those places from which they flow..</p>
          <p>LXXXI. And the cause of the production of the winds is <lb/>
            the sun, which evaporates the clouds. Moreover, the rain- <lb/>
            bow is the reflexion of the sun's rays from the moist clouds, <lb/>
            or, as Posidonius explains it in his Meteorology, a manifesta- <lb/>
            tion of a section of the sun or moon, in a cloud suffused with <lb/>
            dew ; being hollow and continuous to the sight; so that it is <lb/>
            reflected as in a mirror, under the appearance of a circle. <lb/>
            And that comets, and bearded stars, and meteors, are fires <lb/>
            which have an existence when the density of the air is borne <lb/>
            upwards to the regions of the æther.</p>
          <p>That a ray of light is a kindling of sudden fire, borne <lb/>
            through the air with great rapidity, and displaying an appear- <lb/>
            ance of length; that rain proceeds from the clouds, being a <lb/>
            transformation of them into water, whenever the moisture <lb/>
            which is caught up from the earth or from the sea, by the sun, <lb/>
            is not able to be otherwise disposed of; for when it is soli- <lb/>
            dined, it is then called hoar frost. And hail is a cloud con- <lb/>
            gealed, and subsequently dispersed by the wind. Snow is <lb/>
            moisture from a congealed cloud, as Posidonius tells us in <lb/>
            the eighth book of his discourse on Natural Philosophy. <lb/>
            Lightning is a kindling of the clouds from their being rubbed <lb/>
            together, or else broken asunder by the wind, as Zeno tells <lb/>
            us in his treatise on the Universe; and thunder is the noise <lb/>
            made by them on the occasion of their being rubbed together <lb/>
            or broken asunder ; and the thunderbolt is a sudden kindling <lb/>
            which falls with great violence on the earth, from the clouds <lb/>
            being rubbed together or broken asunder, or, as others say, it is <lb/>
            a conversion of fiery air violently brought down to the earth. <lb/>
            A typhon is a vast thunderbolt, violent and full of wind, or a <lb/>
            smoky breath of a cloud broken asunder. A <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρηστὴς</foreign> is a cloud <note type="footnote"> * There is a--hiatus in the text here. Casaubon supplies the meaning <lb/>
            by a reference to Plutarch's Treatise on the opinions of the Philoso- <lb/>
            phers, iii. 7, " that the winds are a flowing of the air, and that they <lb/>
            have various names with reference to the countries from which they <lb/>
            flow." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="316"/>
            rent by fire, with wind,*. . . . . . . <lb/>
            into the hollows of the earth, or when the wind is pent up in <lb/>
            the earth, as Posidonius says in his eighth book; and that <lb/>
            Bone of them are shakings, others rendings, others emissions <lb/>
            of fire, and others, instances of violent fermentation.</p>
          <p>LXXXII. They also think that the general arrangement <lb/>
            of the world is in this fashion ; that the earth is in the mid- <lb/>
            dle, occupying the place of the centre; next to which comes <lb/>
            the water, of a spherical form ; and having the same centre as <lb/>
            the earth; so that the earth is in the water ; and next to the <lb/>
            water comes the air, which has also a spherical form.</p>
          <p>LXXXIII. And that there are five circles in the heaven ; <lb/>
            of which the first is the arctic circle, which is always visible ; <lb/>
            the second is the tropical summer circle ; the third is the <lb/>
            equinoctial circle; the fourth, the winter tropical circle; and <lb/>
            the fifth the antarctic, which is not visible. And they are <lb/>
            called parallel, because they do not incline to one another; <lb/>
            they are drawn however around the same centre. But the <lb/>
            zodiac is oblique, cutting the parallel circles. There are also <lb/>
            five zones on the earth ; the first is the northern one, placed <lb/>
            under the arctic circle, uninhabitable by reason of the cold ; <lb/>
            The second is temperate ; the third is uninhabitable because <lb/>
            of the heat, and is called the torrid zone; the fourth is a <lb/>
            temperate zone, on the other side of the torrid zone ; the fifth <lb/>
            is the southern zone, being also uninhabitable by reason of the <lb/>
            cold. t</p>
          <p>LXXXIV. Another of their doctrines is that nature is an <lb/>
            artificial fire tending by a regular road to production, which i- <lb/>
            a fiery kind of breath proceeding according to art. Also, th.i <lb/>
            the soul is sensible, and that it is a spirit which is born with <lb/>
            us; consequently it is a body and continues to exist aft" <lb/>
            death ; that nevertheless it is perishable. But that the so 1 <lb/>
            of the universe is imperishable, and that the souls which ex <lb/>
            in animals are only parts of that of the universe. But Zei <lb/>
            the Cittiæan, and Antipater, in their treatise concerning the <note type="footnote">* Something is evidently wanting here; probably some mention of <lb/>
            an earthquake. </note><note type="footnote"> t This is similar to Virgil's description. <lb/>
            Quinque tenent cœlum zonæ, quarum una corusco <lb/>
            Semper Sole rubens, et torrida semper ab igni: <lb/>
            Quam circum extremæ dextra lævaque trahuntur, </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="317"/>
            Soul, and Posidonius also, all say that the soul is a warm <lb/>
            spirit; for that by it we have our breath, and by it we are <lb/>
            moved. Cleanthes, accordingly, asserts that all souls continue <lb/>
            to exist till they are burnt up; but Chrysippus says that it is <lb/>
            only the souls of the wise that endure. And they further <lb/>
            teach that there are eight parts of the soul; the five senses, <lb/>
            and the generative faculties, and voice, and reason. And we <lb/>
            see because of a body of luminous air which extends from the <lb/>
            organ of sight to the object in a conical form, as it is asserted <lb/>
            by Chrysippus, in the second book of his Natural Philosophy, <lb/>
            and also by Apollodorus. And the apex of this cone is close <lb/>
            to the eye, and its base is formed by the object which is seen ; <lb/>
            so that that which is seen is as it were reported to the eye by <lb/>
            this continuous cone of air extended towards it like a staff. In <lb/>
            the same way, we hear because the air between the speaker and <lb/>
            the hearer is struck in a spherical manner ; and is then <lb/>
            agitated in waves, resembling the circular eddies which one <lb/>
            sees in a cistern when a stone is dropped into it.</p>
          <p>Sleep, they say, is produced by a relaxation of the aesthetic <lb/>
            energies with reference to the dominant part of the soul. And <lb/>
            the causes of the passions they explain to be the motions and <lb/>
            conversions which take place in connection with this spirit or <lb/>
            soul.</p>
          <p>LXXXV. Seed, they define as a thing of a nature capable <lb/>
            of producing other things of the same nature as the thing <lb/>

            in the second book of his Natural Philosophy, that it is a <lb/>
            spirit according to substance ; as is manifest from the seeds <lb/>
            which are planted in the earth ; and which, if they are old, <lb/>
            do not germinate, because all their virtue has evaporated. <lb/>
            And Sphærus says, that seed proceeds from the entire body, <lb/>
            and that that is how it is that it produces all the parts of <lb/>
            the body.</p>
          <p>They also say that the seed of the female is unproductive; <lb/>
            for, as Sphærus says, it is devoid of tone, and small in <lb/>

            of the soul which is its most excellent part; in which the <lb/>

            philosophy entertained by them, which it seems sufficient for <lb/>
            us to detail, having regard to the due proportions of this <lb/>
            book. And the following are the points in which some of <lb/>
            them disagreed with the rest.</p>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF ARISTON.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. ARISTON the Bald, a native of Chios, surnamed the <lb/>
            Scion, said, that the chief good was to live in perfect indiffer- <lb/>
            ence to all those things which are of an intermediate characte <lb/>
            between virtue and vice ; making not the slightest difference <lb/>
            between them, but regarding them all on a footing of equality. <lb/>
            For that the wise man resembles a good actor ; who, whether <lb/>
            he is filling the part of Agamemnon or Thersites, will perform <lb/>
            them both equally well.</p>
          <p>II. And he discarded altogether the topic of physics, and <lb/>
            of logic, saying that the one was above us, and that the other <lb/>
            had nothing to do with us ; and that the only branch of <lb/>
            philosophy with which we had any real concern was ethics.</p>
          <p>III. He also said that dialectic reasonings were like <lb/>
             <pb n="319"/>
            cobwebs; which although they seem to be put together on <lb/>
            principles of art, are utterly useless.</p>
          <p>IV. And he did not introduce many virtues into his scheme, <lb/>
            as Zeno did; nor one virtue under a great many names, as <lb/>
            the Megaric philosophers did; but defined virtue as consisting <lb/>
            in behaving in a certain manner with reference to a certain <lb/>
            thing.</p>
          <p>V. And as he philosophized in this manner, and carried on <lb/>
            his discussions in the Cynosarges, he got so much influence <lb/>
            as to be called a founder of a sect. Accordingly, Miltiades, <lb/>
            and Diphilus were called Aristoneans.</p>
          <p>VI. He was a man of very persuasive eloquence, and one <lb/>
            who could adapt himself well to the humours of a multitude. <lb/>
            On which account Timon says of him : — <lb/>
            And one who, from Ariston's wily race, <lb/>
            Traced his descent.</p>
          <p>Diodes, the Magnesian, tells us that Ariston having fallen <lb/>
            in with Polemo, passed over to his school, at a time when <lb/>
            Zeno was lying ill with a long sickness. The Stoic doctrine to <lb/>
            which he was most attached, was the one that the wise man <lb/>
            is never guided by opinions. But Persæus argued against <lb/>
            this, and caused one of two twin brothers to place a deposit in <lb/>
            his hands, and then caused the other to reclaim it; and thus <lb/>
            he convicted him, as he was in doubt on this point, and there <lb/>
            fore forced to act on opinion. He was a great enemy of <lb/>
            Arcesilaus. And once, seeing a bull of a monstrous confor- <lb/>
            mation, having a womb, he said, " Alas ! here is an argument <lb/>
            for Arcesilaus against the evidence of his senses." On another <lb/>
            occasion, when a philosopher of the Academy said that he did <lb/>
            not comprehend anything, he said to him, " Do not you even <lb/>
            see the man who is sitting next to you ?" And as he said <lb/>
            that he did not, he said :— <lb/>
            Who then has blinded you, who's been so harsh, ' <lb/>
            As thus to rob you of your beaming eyes ?</p>
          <p>VII. The following works are attributed to him. Two books <lb/>
            of Exhortatory Discourses; Dialogues on the Doctrines of <lb/>
            Zeno; six books of Conversations ; seven books of Discussions <lb/>
            on Wisdom ; Conversations on Love; Commentaries on Vain <lb/>
            Glory; twenty-five books of Reminiscences; three books of <lb/>
             <pb n="320"/>
            Memorabilia ; eleven books of Apophthegms ; a volume against <lb/>
            the Orators; a volume against the Rescripts of Alexinus; <lb/>
            three treatises against the Dialecticians ; four books of Letters <lb/>
            to Cleanthes. But Panætius and Sosicrates say, that his only <lb/>
            genuine writings are his letters ; and that all the rest are the <lb/>
            works of Ariston the Peripatetic.</p>
          <p>VIII. It is said that he, being bald, got a stroke of the <lb/>
            sun, and so died. And we have written a jesting epigram on <lb/>
            him in Scayon iambics, in the following terms:- <lb/>
            Why, 0 Ariston, being old and bald, <lb/>
            Did you allow the sun to roast your crown ? <lb/>
            Thus, in an unbecoming search for warmth, <lb/>
            Against your will, you've found out chilly Hell.</p>
          <p>IX. There was also another man of the name of Ariston; <lb/>
            a native of Julii, one of the Peripatetic school. And another <lb/>
            who was an Athenian musician. A fourth who was a tragic <lb/>
            poet. A fifth, a native of Alcea, who wrote a treatise on the <lb/>
            Oratorical Art. A sixth was a peripatetic Philosopher of <lb/>
            Alexandria.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF HERILLUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. HERILLUS, a native of Carthage, said that the chief good <lb/>
            was knowledge; that is to say, the always conducting one's <lb/>
            self in such a way as to refer everything to the principle of <lb/>
            living according to knowledge, and not been misled by igno- <lb/>
            rance. He also said that knowledge was a habit not departing <lb/>
            from reason in the reception of perceptions.</p>
          <p>On one occasion, he said that there was no such thing as a <lb/>
            chief good, but that circumstances and events changed it, just <lb/>
            as the same piece of brass might become a statue either of <lb/>
            Alexander or of Socrates. And that besides the chief good or <lb/>
            end (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πέλος</foreign>*), there was a subordinate end (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑποτελίς</foreign>) different <lb/>
            from it. And that those who were not wise aimed at the <note type="footnote"> * “ <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ὑποτελὶς</foreign>, a name given by Herillus in Diogenes Laërtius to a <lb/>
            man's natural talents, &amp;c., which ought all to be subordinate to the <lb/>
            attainment of the chief good.”—L. E. S. in voc. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="321"/>
            latter ; but that only the wise man directed his views to the <lb/>
            former. And all the things between virtue and vice he <lb/>
            pronounced indifferent.</p>
          <p>II. His books contain but few lines, but they are full of <lb/>
            power, and contain arguments in opposition to Zeno.</p>
          <p>III. It is said, that when he was a boy, many people were <lb/>
            attached to him ; and as Zeno wished to drive them away, he <lb/>
            persuaded him to have his head shaved, which disgusted them <lb/>
            all.</p>
          <p>IV. His books are these. One on Exercise; one on the <lb/>
            Passions; one on Opinion; the Lawgiver ; the Skilful <lb/>
            Midwife; the Contradictory Teacher; the Preparer; the <lb/>
            Director ; the Mercury ; the Medea ; a book of Dialogues; a <lb/>
            book of Ethical Propositions.</p>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF DIONYSIUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. DIONYSIUS, the Deserter, as he was called, asserted that <lb/>
            pleasure was the chief good, from the circumstance of his <lb/>
            being afflicted with a complaint in his eyes. For, as he <lb/>
            suffered severely, he could not pronounce pain a thing in- <lb/>
            different.</p>
          <p>II. He was the son of Theophantus, and a native of <lb/>
            Heraclea.</p>
          <p>III. He was a pupil, as we are told by Diodes, first of all <lb/>
            of Heraclides, his fellow citizen ; after that of Alexinus, and <lb/>
            Menedemus; and last of all of Zeno. And at first, as he was <lb/>
            very devoted to learning, he tried his hand at all kinds of <lb/>
            poetry. Afterwards, he attached himself to Aratus, whom he <lb/>
            took for his model. Having left Zeno, he turned to the <lb/>
            Cyrenaics, and became a frequenter of brothels, and in other <lb/>
            respects indulged in luxury without disguise.</p>
          <p>IV. When he had lived near eighty years, he died of <lb/>
            starvation.</p>
          <p>V. The following books are attributed to him. Two books <lb/>
            on Apathy ; two on Exercise; four on Pleasure; one on <note type="footnote"> Y </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="322"/>
            Riches, and Favours, and Revenge; one on the Use of Men ; <lb/>
            one on Good Fortune ; one on Ancient Kings ; one on Things <lb/>
            which are Praised ; one on Barbarian Customs.</p>
          <p>These now are the chief men who differed from the Stoics. <lb/>
            But the man who succeeded Zeno in his school was Cleanthes, <lb/>
            whom we must now speak of.</p>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF CLEANTHES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. CLEANTHES was a native of Assos, and the son of <lb/>
            Phanias. He was originally a boxer, as we learn from Antis- <lb/>
            thenes, in his Successions. And he came to Athens, having <lb/>
            but four drachmas, as some people say, and attaching himself <lb/>
            to Zeno, he devoted himself to Philosophy in a most noble <lb/>
            manner; and he adhered to the same doctrines as his master.</p>
          <p>II. He was especially eminent for his industry, so that as <lb/>
            he was a very poor man, he was forced to undertake mercenary <lb/>
            employments, and he used to draw water in the gardens by <lb/>
            night, and by day he used to exercise himself in philosophical <lb/>
            discussions; on which account he was called Phreantles.* <lb/>
            They also say that he was on one occasion brought before a <lb/>
            court of justice, to be compelled to give an account what his <lb/>
            sources of income were from which he maintained himself in <lb/>
            such good condition ; and that then he was acquitted, having <lb/>
            produced as his witness the gardener in whose garden he drew <lb/>
            the water ; and a woman who was a mealseller, in whose <lb/>
            establishment he used to prepare the meal. And the judges <lb/>
            of the Areopagus admired him, and voted that ten minæ should <lb/>
            be given to him ; but Zeno forbade him to accept them.</p>
          <p>They also say that Antigonus presented him three thousand <lb/>
            drachmas. And once, when he was conducting some young <lb/>
            men to some spectacle, it happened that the wind blew away <lb/>
            his cloak, and it was then seen that he had nothing on under <lb/>
            it; on which he was greatly applauded by the Athenians, <note type="footnote"> * From <foreign xml:lang="grc">φρέαρ</foreign>, a well, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντλέω</foreign>, to draw water. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="323"/>
            . according to the account given by Demetrius, the Magnesian, <lb/>
            in his essay on People of the same Name. And he was greatly <lb/>
            admired by them on account of this circumstance.</p>
          <p>They also say that Antigonus, who was a pupil of his, once <lb/>
            asked him why he drew water; and that he made answer, <lb/>
            " Do I do nothing beyond drawing water ? Do I not also dig, <lb/>
            and do I not water the land, and do all sorts of things for the <lb/>
            sake of philosophy ?" For Zeno used to accustom him to this, <lb/>
            and used to require him to bring him an obol by way of <lb/>
            tribute*. And once he brought one of the pieces of money <lb/>
            which he had collected in this way, into the middle of a <lb/>
            company of his acquaintances, and said, " Cleanthes could <lb/>
            maintain even another Cleanthes if he were to choose; but <lb/>
            others who have plenty of means to support themselves, seek <lb/>
            for necessaries from others ; although they only study philo- <lb/>
            sophy in a very lazy manner." And, in reference to these <lb/>
            habits of his, Cleanthes was called a second Heracles.</p>
          <p>III. He was then very industrious; but he was not well <lb/>
            endowed by nature, and was very slow in his intellect. On <lb/>
            which account Timon says of him :— <lb/>
            What stately ram thus measures o'er the ground, <lb/>
            And master of the flock surveys them round ? <lb/>
            What citizen of Assos, dull and cold, <lb/>
            Fond of long words, a mouth-piece, but not bold.t</p>
          <p>And when he was ridiculed by his fellow pupils, he used to <lb/>
            bear it patiently.</p>
          <p>IV. He did not even object to the name when he was <lb/>
            called an ass ; but only said that he was the only animal able <lb/>
            to bear the burdens which Zeno put upon him." And once, <lb/>
            when he was reproached as a coward, be said, " That is the <lb/>
            reason why I make but few mistakes." He used to say, in <lb/>
            justification of his preference of his own way of life to that of <lb/>
            the rich, " That while they were playing at ball, he was earning <lb/>
            money by digging hard and barren ground." And he very <lb/>
            often used to blame himself. And once, Ariston beard him <lb/>
            doing so, and said, " Who is it that you are reproaching ?" <note type="footnote"> * The Greek used is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀποφορὰ</foreign> ; which was a term especially applied <lb/>

            and he replied, “ An old man who has grey hair, but no <lb/>
            brains."</p>
          <p>When some one once said to him, that Arcesilaus did not <lb/>
            do what he ought, " Desist," he replied, " and do not blame <lb/>
            him; for if he destroys duty as |far as his words go, at all <lb/>
            events he establishes it by his actions." Arcesilaus once said <lb/>
            to him, " I never listen to flatterers." " Yes," rejoined Clean- <lb/>
            thes, " I flatter you, when I say that though you say one <lb/>
            thing, you do another." When some one once asked him what <lb/>
            lesson he ought to inculcate on his son, he replied, " The <lb/>
            warning of Electra — <lb/>
            Silence, silence, gently step.-</p>
          <p>When a Lacedæmonian once said in his hearing, that labour <lb/>
            was a good thing, he was delighted, and addressed him :— <lb/>
            Oh, early worth, a soul so wise and young <lb/>
            Proclaims you from the sage Lycurgus sprung.</p>
          <p>Hecaton tells us in his Apophthegms, that once when a <lb/>
            young man said, " If a man who beats his stomach <foreign xml:lang="grc">γαστρίζει</foreign>, <lb/>
            then a man who slaps his thigh <foreign xml:lang="grc">μηρίζει</foreign>,” he replied, " Do you <lb/>
            stick to your But analogous words do not always <lb/>
            indicate analogous facts. Once when he was conversing with <lb/>
            a youth, he asked him if he felt; and as he said that he did, <lb/>
            " Why is it then," said Cleanthes, " that I do not feel that <lb/>
            you feel ?”</p>
          <p>When Sositheus, the poet, said in the theatre where he was <lb/>
            present:— <lb/>
            Men whom the folly of Cleanthes urges;</p>
          <p>He continued in the same attitude ; at which the hearers were <lb/>
            surprised, and applauded him, but drove Sositheus away. And <lb/>
            when he expressed his sorrow for having abused him in this <lb/>
            manner, he answered him gently, saying, " That it would be <lb/>
            a preposterous thing for Bacchus and Hercules to bear being <lb/>
            ridiculed by the poets without any expression of anger, and <lb/>
            for him to be indignant at any chance attack." He used <lb/>
            also to say, " That the Peripatetics were in the same condi- <lb/>
            dion as lyres, which though they utter sweet notes, do not <note type="footnote"> * Taken from the Orestes of Euripides, i. 140. </note><note type="footnote"> t This is parodied from Horn. Od. iv. 611. Pope's version, 1. 831. </note> <lb/>

            hear themselves." And it is said, that when he asserted <lb/>
            that, on the principles of Zeno, one could judge of a man's <lb/>
            character by his looks, some witty young men brought him <lb/>
            a profligate fellow, having a hardy look from continual <lb/>
            exercise in the fields, and requested him to tell them his <lb/>
            moral character; and he, having hesitated a little, bade the <lb/>
            man depart; and, as he departed, he sneezed, "I have the <lb/>
            fellow now," said Cleanthes, " he is a debauchee."</p>
          <p>He said once to a man who was conversing with him by <lb/>
            himself, "You are not talking to a bad man." And when <lb/>
            some one reproached him with his old age, he rejoined, " I <lb/>
            too wish to depart, but when I perceive myself to be in <lb/>
            good health in every respect, and to be able to recite and <lb/>
            read, I am content to remain." They say too, that he used <lb/>
            to write down all that he heard from Zeno on oyster shells, <lb/>
            and on the shoulder-blades of oxen, from want of money to <lb/>
            buy paper with.</p>
          <p>V. And though he was of this character, and in such <lb/>
            circumstances, he became so eminent, that, though Zeno <lb/>
            had many other disciples of high reputation, he succeeded <lb/>
            him as the president of his School.</p>
          <p>VI. And he left behind him some excellent books, which <lb/>
            are these. One on Time; two on Zeno's System of Natural <lb/>
            Philosophy; four books of the Explanations of Heraclitus: <lb/>
            one on Sensation ; one on Art; one addressed to Democritus ; <lb/>
            one to Aristarchus; one to Herillus ; two on Desire; one <lb/>
            entitled Archaeology; one on the Gods; one on the Giants; <lb/>
            one on Marriage; one on Poets; three on Duty; one on <lb/>
            Good Counsel; one on Favour; one called Exhortatory; <lb/>
            one on Virtues; one on Natural Ability; one on Gorgippus ; <lb/>
            one ' on Enviousness; one on Love; one on Freedom; <lb/>
            one called the Art of Love; one on Honour; one on <lb/>
            Glory; The Statesman; one on Counsel; one on Laws ; <lb/>
            one on Deciding as a Judge; one on the Way of Life; <lb/>
            three on Reason ; one on the Chief Good; one on the <lb/>
            Beautiful; one on Actions; one on Knowledge; one on <lb/>
            Kingly Power; one on Friendship; one on Banquets; one <lb/>
            on the Principle that Virtue is the same in Man and Woman ; <lb/>
            one on the Wise Man Employing Sophisms ; one on Apoph- <lb/>
            thegms ; two books of Conversations; one on Pleasure; one <lb/>
             <pb n="326"/>
            on Properties; one on Doubtful Things; one on Dialectics ; <lb/>
            one on Modes ; one on Categorems.</p>
          <p>VII. These are his writings.</p>
          <p>And he died in the following manner. His gums swelled <lb/>
            very much ; and, at the command of his physicians, he abstained <lb/>
            from food for two days. And he got so well that his physicians <lb/>
            allowed him to return to all his former habits ; but he refused, <lb/>
            and saying that he had now already gone part of the way, he <lb/>
            abstained from food for the future, and so died; being, as <lb/>
            some report, eighty years old, and having been a pupil of Zeno <lb/>
            nineteen years. And we have written a playful epigram on <lb/>
            him also, which runs thus :— <lb/>
            I praise Cleanthes, but praise Pluto more; <lb/>
            Who could not bear to see him grown so old, <lb/>
            So gave him rest at last among the dead, <lb/>
            Who'd drawn such loads of water while alive.</p>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF SPHÆRUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. SPHÆRUS, a native of the Bosphorus, was, as we have <lb/>
            said before, a pupil of Cleanthes after the death of Zeno.</p>
          <p>II. And when he made a considerable advance in philosophy <lb/>
            he went to Alexandria, to the court of Ptolemy Philopater. <lb/>
            And once, when there was a discussion concerning the ques- <lb/>
            tion whether a wise man would allow himself to be guided by <lb/>
            opinion, and when Sphærus affirmed that he would not, the <lb/>
            king, wishing to refute him, ordered some pomegranates of <lb/>
            wax to be set before him; and when Sphærus was deceived by <lb/>
            them, the king shouted that he had given his assent to a false <lb/>
            perception. But Sphærus answered very neatly, that he had <lb/>
            not given his assent to the fact that they were pomegranates, <lb/>
            but to the fact that it was probable that they might be pome- <lb/>
            granates. And that a perception which could be comprehended <lb/>
            differed from one that was only probable.</p>
          <p>Once, when Innesistratus accused him of denying that <lb/>
             <pb n="327"/>
            Ptolemy was a' king, he said to him, " That Ptolemy was a <lb/>
            man with such and such qualities, and a king."*</p>
          <p>III. He wrote the following books. Two on the World; <lb/>
            one on the Elements of Seed ; one on Fortune ; one on the <lb/>
            Smallest Things; one on Atoms and Phantoms ; one on the <lb/>
            Senses; five Conversations about Heraclitus ; one on Ethical <lb/>
            Arrangement; one on Duty ; one on Appetite; two on the <lb/>
            Passions; one on Kingly Power; on the Lacedæmonian <lb/>
            Constitution; three on Lycurgus and Socrates ; one on Law ; <lb/>
            one on Divination; one volume of Dialogues on Love; one <lb/>
            on the Eretrian Philosophers; one on Things Similar; one <lb/>
            on Terms ; one on Habits ; three on Contradictions ; one on <lb/>
            Reason ; one on Riches ; one on Glory; one on Death; two <lb/>
            on the Art of Dialectics; one on Categorems : one on Ambi- <lb/>

          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF CHRYSIPPUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. CHRYSIPPUS was the son of Apollonius, and a native of <lb/>
            either Soli or Tarsus, as Alexander tells us in his Successions; <lb/>
            and he was a pupil of Cleanthes. Previously he used to <lb/>
            practise running as a public runner; then he became a pupil <lb/>
            of Zeno or of Cleanthes, as Diodes and the generality of <lb/>
            authors say, and while he was still living he abandoned him, <lb/>
            and became a very eminent philosopher.</p>
          <p>II. He was a man of great natural ability, and of great <lb/>
            acuteness in every way, so that in many points he dissented <note type="footnote"> * This is referring to the Stoic doctrine ridiculed by Horace : <lb/>
            Si dives qui sapiens est, <lb/>
            Et sutor bonus, et solus formosus, et est Rex <lb/>
            Cur optas quod habes ?—Hor. Sat. L 130. </note><note type="footnote"> Which may be translated :- <lb/>
            If every man is rich who's wise, <lb/>
            A cobbler too beyond all price; <lb/>
            A handsome man, and eke a king; <lb/>
            Why thus your vows at random fling ? </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="328"/>
            from Zeno, and also from Cleanthes, to whom he often used <lb/>
            to say that he only wanted to be instructed in the dogmas of <lb/>
            the school, and that he would discover the demonstrations for <lb/>
            himself. But whenever he opposed him with any vehemence, <lb/>
            he always repented, so that he used frequently to say :— <lb/>
            In most respects I am a happy man, <lb/>
            Excepting where Cleanthes is concerned ; <lb/>
            For in that matter I am far from fortunate.</p>
          <p>And he had such a high reputation as a dialectician, that most <lb/>
            people thought that if there were such a science as dialectic <lb/>
            among the Gods; it would be in no respect different from that <lb/>
            of Chrysippus. But though he was so eminently able in matter, <lb/>
            he was not perfect in style.</p>
          <p>III. He was industrious beyond all other men ; as is plain <lb/>
            from his writings ; for he wrote more than seven hundred and <lb/>
            five books. And he often wrote several books on the same <lb/>
            subject, wishing to put down everything that occurred to him; <lb/>
            and constantly correcting his previous assertions, and using a <lb/>
            great abundance of testimonies. So that, as in one of his <lb/>
            writings he had quoted very nearly the whole of the Medea of <lb/>
            Euripides, and some one had his book in his hands ; this latter, <lb/>
            when he was asked what he had got there, made answer, <lb/>
            " The Medea of Chrysippus." And Apollodorus, the Athenian, <lb/>
            in his Collection of Dogmas, wishing to assert that what <lb/>
            Epicurus had written out of his own head, and without any <lb/>
            quotations to support his arguments, was a great deal more <lb/>
            than all the books of Chrysippus, speaks thus (I give his <lb/>
            exact words), " For if any one were to take away from the <lb/>
            books of Chrysippus all the passages which he quotes from <lb/>
            other authors, his paper would be left empty."</p>
          <p>These are the words of Apollodorus; but the old woman <lb/>
            who lived with him, as Dioles reports, used to say that he <lb/>
            wrote five hundred lines every day. And Hecaton says, that <lb/>
            he first applied himself to philosophy, when his patrimony had <lb/>
            been confiscated, and seized for the royal treasury.</p>
          <p>IV. He was slight in person, as is plain from his statue <lb/>
            which is in the Ceramicus, which is nearly hidden by the <lb/>
            equestrian statue near it; in reference to which circumstance, <lb/>
            Carneades called him Cryxippus.* He was once reproached <note type="footnote"> * From'<foreign xml:lang="grc">κρύπτω</foreign>, to hide, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἵππος</foreign>, a horse. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="329"/>
            by some one for not attending the lectures of Ariston, who <lb/>
            was drawing a great crowd after him at the time; and he <lb/>
            replied, " If I had attended to the multitude I should not have <lb/>
            been a philosopher." And once, when he saw a dialectician <lb/>
            pressing hard on Cleanthes, and proposing sophistical fallacies <lb/>
            to him, he said, " Cease to drag that old man from more <lb/>
            important business, and propose these questions to us who are <lb/>
            young." At another time, when some one wishing to ask him <lb/>
            something privately, was addressing him quietly, but when he <lb/>
            saw a multitude approaching began to speak more energetically <lb/>
            he said to him :— <lb/>
            Alas, my brother ! now your eye is troubled; <lb/>
            You were quite sane just now; and yet how quickly <lb/>
            Have you succumbed to frenzy.*</p>
          <p>And at drinking parties he used to behave quietly, moving his <lb/>
            legs about however, so that a female slave once said, " It is <lb/>
            only the legs of Chrysippus that are drunk." And he had so <lb/>
            high an opinion of himself, that once, when a man asked him, <lb/>
            " To whom shall I entrust my son ?" he said " To me, for if <lb/>
            I thought that there was any one better than myself, I would <lb/>
            have gone to him to teach me philosophy." In reference to <lb/>
            which anecdote they report that people used to say of him :— <lb/>
            He has indeed a clear and subtle head, <lb/>
            The rest are forms of empty æther made.†</p>
          <p>And also :— <lb/>
            For if Chrysippus had not lived and taught, <lb/>
            The Stoic school would surely have been nought.</p>
          <p>VI. But at last, when Arcesilaus and Lacydes, as Sotion <lb/>
            records in his eighth book, came to the Academy, he joined <lb/>
            them in the study of philosophy ; from which circumstance <lb/>
            he got the habit of arguing for and against a custom, and dis- <lb/>
            cussed magnitudes and quantities, following the system of the <lb/>
            Academics.</p>
          <p>VII. Hermippus relates, that one day, when he was teaching <lb/>
            .n the Odeum, he was invited to a sacrifice by his pupils; <note type="footnote"> * These lines are from the Erestes of Euripides, v. 247. </note><note type="footnote"> t This is a quotation from Homer, Od. x. 495. Pope's Version, <lb/>
            586. The Greek here is, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἷος πέπνυται</foreign>. The line in Homer stands : </note> <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_21_fig10.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="330"/>
              and, that drinking some sweet unmixed wine, he was seizi <lb/>
              with giddiness, and departed this life five days afterward <lb/>
              when he had lived seventy-three years; dying in the hundr. <lb/>
              and forty-third olympiad, as Apollodorus says in his Chronicle <lb/>
              And we have written an epigram on him : <lb/>
              Chrysippus drank with open mouth some wine ; <lb/>
              Then became giddy, and so quickly died. <lb/>
              Too little reck'd he of the Porch's weal, <lb/>
              Or of his country's, or of his own dear life; <lb/>
              And so descended to the realms of Hell.</p>
          <p>But some people say that he died of a fit of immoderai <lb/>
            laughter. For that seeing his ass eating figs, he told his ol <lb/>
            woman to give the ass some unmixed wine to drink afterwards <lb/>
            and then laughed so violently that he died.</p>
          <p>VIII. He appears to have been a man of exceeding amri <lb/>
            gance. Accordingly, though he wrote such numbers of boob <lb/>
            he never dedicated one of them to any sovereign. And h <lb/>
            was contented with one single old woman, as Demetrius tell <lb/>
            us, in his People of the same Name. And when Ptolemy wrot <lb/>
            to Cleanthes, begging him either to come to him himself or t4 <lb/>
            send him some one, Sphærus went to him, but Chrysippu <lb/>
            slighted the invitation.</p>
          <p>IX. However, he sent for the sons of his sister, Aristocrea <lb/>
            and Philocrates, and educated them; and he was the firs <lb/>
            person who ventured to hold a school in the open air in the <lb/>
            -Lyceum, as the before mentioned Demetrius relates.</p>
          <p>X. There was also another Chrysippus, a native of Cnidos <lb/>
            a physician, from whom Erasistratus testifies that he receive <lb/>
            great benefit. And another also who was a son of his, and the <lb/>
            physician of Ptolemy; who, having had a false accusation <lb/>
            brought against him, was apprehended and punished by being <lb/>
            scourged. There was also a fourth who was a pupil of Era- <lb/>
            sistratus; and a fifth was an author of a work called Georgics.</p>
          <p>XI. Now this philosopher used to delight in proposing <lb/>
            questions of this sort. The person who reveals the myste- <lb/>
            ries to the uninitiated commits a sin; the heirophant <lb/>
            reveals them to the uninitiated ; therefore the hierophant <lb/>
            commits sin? Another was, that which is not in the city, is <lb/>
            also not in the house ; but a well is not in the city, therefore <lb/>
            there is not a well in the house. Another was, there is a <lb/>
            certain head; that head you have not got; there is then a <lb/>
             <pb n="331"/>
            i head that you have not got; therefore, you have not got a <lb/>
            nead. Again, if a man is in Megara, he is not in Athens ; <lb/>
            mut there is a man in Megara, therefore, there is not a man in <lb/>
            Athens. Again, if you say anything, what you say comes out <lb/>
            )f your mouth ; but you say “ a waggon," therefore a waggon <lb/>
            ;omes out of your mouth. Another was, if you have not lost <lb/>
            t thing, you have it;* but you have not lost horns ; therefore, <lb/>
            rou have horns. Though some attribute this sophism to <lb/>
            Subulides.</p>
          <p>XII. There are people who run Chrysippus down as having <lb/>
            vritten a great deal that is very shameful and indecent. For <lb/>
            nhis treatise on the Ancient Natural Historians, he relates <lb/>
            the story of Jupiter and Juno very indecently, devoting six <lb/>
            lundred lines to what no one could repeat without polluting <lb/>
            lis mouth. For, as it is said, he composes this story, though <lb/>
            ie praises it as consisting of natural details, in a way more <lb/>
            suitable to street walkers than to Goddesses; and not at all <lb/>
            esembling the ideas which have been adopted or cited by <lb/>
            vriters in paintings. For they were found neither in Polemo, <lb/>
            lor in Hypsicrates, nor in Antigonus, but were inserted by <lb/>
            limself. And in his treatise on Polity, he allows people to <lb/>
            narry their mothers, or their daughters, or their sons. And <lb/>
            ne repeats this doctrine in his treatise on those things which <lb/>
            re not desirable for their own sake, in the very opening of it. <lb/>
            And in the third book of his treatise on Justice, he devotes a <lb/>
            housand lines to bidding people devour even the dead.</p>
          <p>In the second book of his treatise on Life and Means of <lb/>
            Support, where he is warning us to consider beforehand, how <lb/>
            he wise man ought to provide himself with means, he says, <lb/>
            And yet why need he provide himself with means? for if it <lb/>
            3 for the sake of living, living at all is a matter of in differ- <lb/>
            ence ; if it is for the sake of pleasure, that is a matter of in- <lb/>
            .ifference too ; if it is for the sake of virtue, that is of itself <lb/>
            ufficient for happiness. But the methods of providing one's <lb/>
            elf with means are ridiculous; for instance, some derive <lb/>
            hem from a king ; and then it will be necessary to humour <lb/>
            im. Some from friendship; and then friendship will become <lb/>
            , thing to be bought with a price. Some from wisdom; and <lb/>
            hen wisdom will become mercenary; and these are the <lb/>
            ccusations which he brings."</p>
          <p>But since he has written many books of high reputation, it <lb/>
             <pb n="332"/>
            has seemed good to me to give a catalogue of them, classify- <lb/>
            ing them according to their subjects. They are the follow- <lb/>
            ing :— <lb/>
            Books on Logic; Propositions ; Logical Questions; a book <lb/>
            of the Contemplations of the Philosopher; six books of <lb/>

          <p>I. SINCE we have now gone through the Ionian philosophy, <lb/>
            which was derived from Thales, and the lives of the several <lb/>
            illustrious men who were the chief ornaments of that school; <lb/>
            we will now proceed to treat of the Italian School, which was <lb/>
            founded by Pythagoras, the son of Mnesarchus, a seal engraver, <lb/>
            as he is recorded to have been by Hermippus; a native of <lb/>
            Samos, or as Aristoxenus asserts, a Tyrrhenian, and a native <lb/>
            of one of the islands which the Athenians occupied after they <lb/>
            had driven out the Tyrrhenians. But some authors say that <lb/>
            he was the son of Marmacus, the son of Hippasus, the son of <lb/>
            Euthyphron, the son of Cleonymus, who was an exile from <lb/>
            Phlias; and that Marmacus settled in Samos, and that from <lb/>
            this circumstance Pythagoras was called a Samian. After <lb/>
            that he migrated to Lesbos, having come to Plierecydes with <lb/>
            letters of recommendation from Zoilus, his uncle. And having <lb/>
            made three silver goblets, he carried them to Egypt as a <lb/>
            present for each of the three priests. He had brothers, the <lb/>
            eldest of whom was named Eunomus, the middle one Tyrrhe-, <lb/>
            nus, and a slave named Zamolxis, to whom the Getæ sacrifice, <lb/>
            believing him to be the same as Saturn, according to the <lb/>
            account of Herodotus.*</p>
          <p>II. He was a pupil, as I have already mentioned, of <lb/>
            Pherecydes, the Syrian; and after his death he came to <lb/>
            Samos, and became a pupil of Hermodamas, the descendant <lb/>
            of Creophylus, who was by this time an old man.</p>
          <p>III. And as he was a young man, and devoted to learning, <lb/>
            he quitted his country, and got initiated into all the Grecian <lb/>
            and barbarian sacred mysteries. Accordingly, he went to <note type="footnote"> * See Herod. iv. 93. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="339"/>
            Egypt, on which occasion Polycrates gave him a letter of <lb/>
            introduction to Amasis ; and he learnt the Egyptian language, <lb/>
            as Antipho tells us, in his treatise on those men who have <lb/>
            been conspicuous for virtue, and be associated with the <lb/>
            Chaldæans and with the Magi.</p>
          <p>Afterwards he went to Crete, and in company with Epi- <lb/>
            menides, he descended into the Idæan cave, (and in Egypt <lb/>
            too, he entered into the holiest parts of their temples,) and <lb/>
            learned all the most secret mysteries that relate to their <lb/>
            Gods. Then he returned back again to Samos, and finding <lb/>
            his country reduced under the absolute dominion of Poly- <lb/>
            crates, he set sail, and fled to Crotona in Italy. And there, <lb/>
            having given laws to the Italians, he gained a very high <lb/>
            reputation, together with his scholars, who were about three <lb/>
            hundred in number, and governed the republic in a most <lb/>
            excellent manner; so that the constitution was very nearly <lb/>
            an aristocracy.</p>
          <p>IV. Heraclides Ponticus says, that be was accustomed to <lb/>
            speak of himself in this manner; that he had formerly been <lb/>
            ޺Æthalides, and had been accounted the son of Mercury; <lb/>
            and that Mercury had desired him to select any gift he <lb/>
            pleased except immortality. And that he accordingly had <lb/>
            requested that, whether living or dead, he might preserve the <lb/>
            memory of what had happened to him. While, therefore. <lb/>
            he was alive, he recollected everything; and when he was <lb/>
            dead, he retained the same memory. And at a subsequent <lb/>
            period he passed into Euphorbus, and was wounded by <lb/>
            Menelaus. And while he was Euphorbus, he used to say <lb/>
            that he had formerly been Æthalides; and that he had <lb/>
            received as a gift from Mercury the perpetual transmigra- <lb/>
            tion of his soul, so that it was constantly transmigrating and <lb/>
            passing into whatever plants or animals it pleased ; and he <lb/>
            had also received the gift of knowing and recollecting all <lb/>
            that his soul had suffered in hell, and what sufferings too <lb/>
            are endured by the rest of the souls.</p>
          <p>But after Euphorbus died, he said that his soul had passed <lb/>
            into Hermotimus; and when he wished to convince people <lb/>
            of this, he went into the territory of the Branchidæ,. and <lb/>
            going into the temple of Apollo, he showed his shield which <lb/>
            Menelaus had dedicated there as an offering. For he said <note type="footnote"> z 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="340"/>
            that he, when he sailed from Troy,' had offered up his shield * <lb/>
            which was already getting worn out, to Apollo, and that nothing <lb/>
            remained but the ivory face which was on it. And when <lb/>
            Hermotimus died, then he said that he had become Pyrrhus, a <lb/>
            fisherman of Delos ; and that he still recollected everything, <lb/>
            how he had been formerly Æthalides, then Euphorbus, then <lb/>
            Hermotimus, and then Pyrrhus. And when Pyrrhus died, <lb/>
            he became Pythagoras, and still recollected all the circum- <lb/>
            stances that I have been mentioning.</p>
          <p>V. Now, some people say that Pythagoras did not leave be- <lb/>
            hind him a single book; but they talk foolishly ; for Heraclitus, <lb/>
            the natural philosopher, speaks plainly enough of him, saying, <lb/>
            “ Pythagoras, the son of Mnesarchus, was the most learned <lb/>
            of all men in history ; and having selected from these writings, <lb/>
            he thus formed his own wisdom and extensive learning, and <lb/>
            mischievous art." And he speaks thus, because Pythagoras, <lb/>
            in the beginning of his treatise on Natural Philosophy, writes <lb/>
            in the following maner : “ By the air which I breathe, and <lb/>
            by the water which 1 drink, I will not endure to be blamed <lb/>
            on account of this discourse."</p>
          <p>And there are three volumes extant written by Pythagoras. <note type="footnote"> * This resembles the account which Ovid puts into the mouth of <lb/>
            Pythagoras, in the last book of his Metamorphoses, where he makes <lb/>
            him say :- <lb/>
            Morte carent animæ, semperque priore relicta <lb/>
            Sede, novis domibus habitant vivuntque receptæ; <lb/>
            Ipse ego, nam memini, Trojani tempera belli, <lb/>
            Panthorides Euphorbus eram, cui pectore quondam <lb/>
            Hæsit in adverse gravis hasta minoris Atridæ : <lb/>
            Agnovi Clypeum lævæ gestamina nostræ <lb/>

            One on Education ; one on Politics ; and one on Natural <lb/>
            Philosophy. But the treatise which is now extant under the <lb/>
            name of Pythagoras is the work of Lysis, of Tarentum, a <lb/>
            philosopher of the Pythagorean School, who fled to Thebes, <lb/>
            and became the master of Epaminondas. And Heraclides, <lb/>
            the son of Sarapion, in his Abridgment of Sotion, says that <lb/>
            he wrote a poem in epic verse on the Universe; and besides <lb/>
            that a sacred poem, which begins thus ;— <lb/>
            Dear youths, I warn you cherish peace divine, <lb/>
            And in your hearts lay deep these words of mine.</p>
          <p>A third about the Soul; a fourth on Piety ; a fifth entitled <lb/>
            Helothales, which was the name of the father of Epicharmus, <lb/>
            of Cos ; a sixth called Crotona, and other poems too. But <lb/>
            the mystic discourse which is extant under his name, they say <lb/>
            is really the work of Hippasus, having been composed with a <lb/>
            view to bring Pythagoras into disrepute. There were also <lb/>
            many other books composed by Aston, of Crotona, and attributed <lb/>
            to Pythagoras.</p>
          <p>Aristoxenus asserts that Pythagoras derived the greater <lb/>
            part of his ethical doctrines from Themistoclea, the priestess <lb/>
            at Delphi. And Ion, of Chios, in his Victories, says that he <lb/>
            wrote some poems and attributed them to Orpheus. They <lb/>
            also say that the poem called the Scopeadæ is by him, which <lb/>
            begins thus :— <lb/>
            Behave not shamelessly to any one.</p>
          <p>VI. And Sosicrates, in his Successions, relates that he, <lb/>
            having being asked by Leon, the tyrant of the Phliasians, who <lb/>
            he was, replied, " A philosopher." And adds, that he used <lb/>
            to compare life to a festival. " And as some people came to <lb/>
            a festival to contend for the prizes, and others for the purposes <lb/>
            3f traffic, and the best as spectators ; so also in life, the men <lb/>
            of slavish dispositions," said he, " are born hunters after glory <lb/>
            md covetousness, but philosophers are seekers after truth." <lb/>
            And thus he spoke on this subject. But in the three treatises <lb/>
            above mentioned, the following principles are laid down by <lb/>
            Pythagoras generally.</p>
          <p>He forbids men to pray for anything in particular for them- <lb/>
            selves, because they do not know what is good for them. He <lb/>
            calls drunkenness an expression identical with ruin, and <lb/>
             <pb n="342"/>
            rejects all superfluity, saying, “ That no one ought to exceed <lb/>
            the proper quantity of meat and drink." And on the subject <lb/>
            of venereal pleasures, he speaks thus :—" One ought to sacri- <lb/>
            fice to Venus in the winter, not in the summer ; and in autumn <lb/>
            and spring in a lesser degree. But the practice is pernicious <lb/>
            at every season, and is never good for the health." And once, <lb/>
            when he was asked when a man might indulge in the pleasures <lb/>
            of love, he replied, " Whenever you wish to be weaker than <lb/>
            yourself. ”</p>
          <p>VII. And he divides the life of man thus. A boy for <lb/>
            twenty years ; a young man (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νεάισϰος</foreign>) for twenty years; a <lb/>
            middle-aged man (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νεάνιας</foreign>) for twenty years ; an old man for <lb/>
            twenty years. And these different ages correspond proportion- <lb/>
            ably to the seasons: boyhood answers to spring; youth to <lb/>
            summer; middle age to autumn; and old age to winter. And <lb/>
            he uses <foreign xml:lang="grc">νεάνισϰος</foreign> here as equivalent to <foreign xml:lang="grc">μειϱάϰιον</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">νεανίας</foreign> as <lb/>
            equivalent to <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἀνϱ</foreign>.</p>
          <p>VIII. He was the first person, as Timæus says, who <lb/>
            asserted that the property of friends is common, and that <lb/>
            friendship is equality. And his disciples used to put all their <lb/>
            possessions together into one store, and use them in common ; <lb/>
            and for five years they kept silence, doing nothing but listen <lb/>
            to discourses, and never once seeing Pythagoras, until they <lb/>
            were approved; after that time they were admitted into his <lb/>
            house, and allowed'to see lilim. They also abstained from the <lb/>
            use of cypress coffins, because the sceptre of Jupiter was made <lb/>
            of that wood, as Hermippus tells us in the second book of <lb/>
            his account of Pythagoras.</p>
          <p>IX. He is said to have been a man of the most dignified <lb/>
            appearance, and his disciples adopted an opinion respecting <lb/>
            him, that he was Apollo who had come from the Hyperbo- <lb/>
            reans ; and it is said, that once when he was stripped naked, <lb/>
            he was seen to have a golden thigh. And there were many <lb/>
            people who affirmed, that when he was crossing the river <lb/>
            Nessus it addressed him by his name.</p>
          <p>X. Timæus, in the tenth book of his Histories, tells us, <lb/>
            that he used to say that women who were married to men <lb/>
            had the names of the Gods, being successively called virgins, <lb/>
            then nymphs, and subsequently mothers.</p>
          <p>XI. It was Pythagoras also who carried geometry to per- <lb/>
            fection, after Mceris had first found out the principles of the <lb/>
             <pb n="343"/>
            elements of that science, as Aristiclides tells us in the second <lb/>
            book of his History of Alexander ; and the part of the science <lb/>
            to which Pythagoras applied himself above all others was <lb/>
            arithmetic. He also discovered the numerical relation of <lb/>
            sounds on a single string: he also studied medicine. And <lb/>
            Apollodorus, the logician, records of him, that he sacrified a <lb/>
            hecatomb, when he had discovered that the square of the <lb/>
            hypothenuse of a right-angled triangle is equal to the squares <lb/>
            of the sides containing the right angle. And there is an <lb/>
            epigram which is couched in the following terms :— <lb/>
            When the great Samian sage his noble problem found, <lb/>
            A hundred oxen dyed with their life-blood the ground.</p>
          <p>XII. He is also said to have been the first man who <lb/>
            trained athletes on meat; and Eurymenes was the first man, <lb/>
            according to the statement of Phavorinus, in the third book of <lb/>
            his Commentaries, who ever did submit to this diet, as before <lb/>
            that time men used to train themselves on dry figs and <lb/>
            moist cheese, and wheaten bread; as the same Phavorinus <lb/>
            informs us in the eighth book of his Universal History. But <lb/>
            some authors state, that a trainer of the name of Pythagoras <lb/>
            certainly did train his athletes on this system, but that it was <lb/>
            not our philosopher; for that he even forbade men to kill <lb/>
            animals at all, much less would have allowed his disciples to <lb/>
            eat then, as having a right to live in common with mankind. <lb/>
            And this was his pretext; but in reality, he prohibited the <lb/>
            eating of animals, because he wished to train and accustom <lb/>
            men to simplicity of life, so that all their food should be easily <lb/>
            procurable, as it would be, if they ate only such things as <lb/>
            required no fire to dress them, and if they drank plain water; <lb/>
            for from this diet they would derive health of body and <lb/>
            acuteness of intellect.</p>
          <p>The only altar at which he worshipped was that of Apollo <lb/>
            the Father, at Delos, which is at the back of the altar of <lb/>
            Ceratinus, because wheat, and barley, and cheese-cakes are <lb/>
            the only offerings laid upon it, being not dressed by fire;and <lb/>
            no victim is ever slain there, as Aristotle tells us in his <lb/>
            Constitution of the Delians. They say, too, that he was the <lb/>
            first person who asserted that the soul went a necessary circle, <lb/>
             <pb n="344"/>
            being changed about and confined at different times in differ- <lb/>
            ent bodies.</p>
          <p>XIII. He was also the first person who introduced mea- <lb/>
            sures and weights among the Greeks ; as Aristoxenus the <lb/>
            musician informs us.</p>
          <p>XIV. Parmenides, too, assures us, that he was the first <lb/>
            person who asserted the identity of Hesperus and Lucifer.</p>
          <p>XV. And he was so greatly admired, that they used to say <lb/>
            that his friends looked on all his sayings as the oracles of <lb/>
            God.* And he himself says in his writings, that he had come <lb/>
            among men after having spent two hundred and seven years <lb/>
            in the shades below. Therefore the Lucanians and the <lb/>
            Peucetians, and the Messapians, and the Romans, flocked <lb/>
            around him, coming with eagerness to hear his discourses ; <lb/>
            but until the time of Philolaus, there were no doctrines of <lb/>
            Pythagoras ever divulged; and he was the first person who <lb/>
            published the three celebrated books which Plato wrote to <lb/>
            have purchased for him for a hundred minæ. Nor were the <lb/>
            number of his scholars who used to come to him by night <lb/>
            fewer than six hundred. And if any of them had ever been <lb/>
            permitted to see him, they wrote of it to their friends, as if <lb/>
            they had gained some great advantage.</p>
          <p>The people of Metapontum used to call his house the <lb/>
            temple of Ceres; and the street leading to it they called the <lb/>
            street of the Muses, as we are told by Phavorinus in his <lb/>
            Universal History.</p>
          <p>And the rest of the Pythagoreans used to say, according to <lb/>
            the account given by Aristoxenus, in the tenth book of his <lb/>
            Laws on Education, that his precepts ought not to be divulged <lb/>
            to all the -world; and Xenophilus, the Pythagorean, when he <lb/>
            was asked what was the best way for a man to educate his son, <lb/>
            said, " That he must first of all take care that he was born in <lb/>
            a city which enjoyed good laws."</p>
          <p>Pythagoras, too, formed many excellent men in Italy, by <note type="footnote"> * This passage has been interpreted in more ways than one. Casau- <lb/>
            bon thinks with great probability that there is a hiatus in the text. I <lb/>
            have endeavoured to extract a meaning out of what remains. Compare <lb/>
            Samuel ii. 16, 23. "And the counsel of Ahitophel, which he counselled <lb/>
            in those days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God; so <lb/>
            was all the counsel of Ahitophel both with David and with Absalom." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="345"/>
            his precepts, and among them Zaleucus,* and Charondas,f <lb/>
            the lawgivers.</p>
          <p>XVI. For he was very eminent for his power of attracting <lb/>
            friendships; and among other things, if ever he heard that <lb/>
            any one had any community of symbols with him, he at once <lb/>
            made him a companion and a friend.</p>
          <p>XVII. Now, what he called his symbols were such as these. <lb/>
            " Do not stir the fire with a sword." " Do not sit down on a <lb/>
            bushel." " Do not devour your heart." " Do not aid men in <lb/>
            discarding a burden, but in increasing one." " Always have <lb/>
            your bed packed up." " Do not bear the image of a God on a <lb/>
            ring." " Efface the traces of a pot in the ashes." “ Do not <lb/>
            wipe a seat with a lamp." “ Do not make water in the sun- <note type="footnote"> * Zaleucus was the celebrated lawgiver of the Epizephyrian Locrians, <lb/>
            and is said -to have been originally a slave employed by a shepherd, <lb/>
            and to have been set free and appointed lawgiver by the direction of <lb/>
            an oracle, in consequence of his announcing some excellent laws, which <lb/>
            he represented Minerva as having communicated to him in a dream. <lb/>
            Diogenes, is wrong however, in calling him a disciple of Pythagoras <lb/>
            (see Bentley on Phalaris), as he lived about a hundred years before his <lb/>
            time; his true date being 660 B.C. The code of Zaleucus is stated to <lb/>
            have been the first collection of written laws that the Greeks possessed. <lb/>
            Their character was that of great severity. They have not come down <lb/>
            to us. His death is said to have occurred thus. Among his laws was <lb/>
            one forbidding any citizen to enter the senate house in arms, under <lb/>
            ' the penalty of death. But in a sudden emergency, Zaleucus himself, in <lb/>
            a moment of forgetfulness, transgressed his own law : on which he slew <lb/>
            himself, declaring that he would vindicate his law. (Eustath. ad. II. i. <lb/>
            p. 60). Diodorus, however, tells the same story of Charondas. </note><note type="footnote"> † Charondas was a lawgiver of Catana, who legislated for his own <lb/>
            city and the other towns of Challidian origin in Magna Grecia, such as <lb/>
            Zancle, Naxos, Leontini, Eubæa, Mylæ, Himera, Callipolis, and Rhegium. <lb/>
            His laws have not been preserved to us, with the exception of a few <lb/>
            judgments. They were probably in verse, for Athenæus says that they <lb/>
            were sung in Athens at banquets. Aristotle tells us that they were <lb/>
            adapted to an aristocracy. It is much doubted whether it is really <lb/>
            true that he was a disciple of Pythagoras, though we are not sure of <lb/>
            his exact time, so that we cannot pronounce it as impossible as in the <lb/>
            preceding case. He must have lived before the time of Anaxilaus, tyrant <lb/>
            of Rhegium, who reigned from B.C. 494 to B.C. 476, because he abolished <lb/>
            the laws of Charondas, which had previously been in force in that city. <lb/>
            Diodorus gives a code of laws which he states that Charondas gave to <lb/>
            the city of Thurii, which was not founded till B.C. 443, when he must <lb/>
            certainly have been dead a long time. There is one law of his pre- <lb/>
            served by Stobæus, which is probably authentic, since it is found in a - <lb/>
            fragment of Theophrastus ; enacting that all buying and selling shall <lb/>
            be transacted by ready money only. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="346"/>
            shine." " Do not walk in the main street." " Do not offer <lb/>
            your right hand lightly.” " Do not cherish swallows under <lb/>
            your roof." " Do not cherish birds with crooked talons." " Do <lb/>
            not defile ; and do not stand upon the parings of your nails, or <lb/>
            the cuttings of your hair." "Avoid a sharp sword." "When <lb/>
            you are travelling abroad, look not back at your own borders." <lb/>
            Now the precept not to stir fire with a sword meant, not to <lb/>
            provoke the anger or swelling pride of powerful men ; not to <lb/>
            violate the beam of the balance meant, not to transgress fair- <lb/>
            ness and justice; not to sit on a bushel is to have an equal <lb/>
            care for the present and for the future, for by the bushel is <lb/>
            meant one's daily food. By not devouring one's heart, he <lb/>
            intended to show that we ought not to waste away our souls <lb/>
            with grief and sorrow. In the precept that a man when <lb/>
            travelling abroad should not turn his eyes back, he recom- <lb/>
            mended those who were departing from life not to be desirous <lb/>
            to live, and not to be too much attracted by the pleasures here <lb/>
            on earth. And the other symbols may be explained in a <lb/>
            similar manner, that we may not be too prolix here.</p>
          <p>XVIII. And above all things, he used to prohibit the eating <lb/>
            of the erythinus, and the melanurus ; and also, he enjoined <lb/>
            his disciples to abstain from the hearts of animals, and from <lb/>
            beans. And Aristotle informs us, that he sometimes used also <lb/>
            to add to these prohibitions paunches and mullet. And some <lb/>
            authors assert that he himself used to be contented with honey <lb/>
            and honeycomb, and bread, and that he never drank wine in <lb/>
            the day time. And his desert was usually vegetables, either <lb/>
            boiled or raw ; and he very rarely ate fish. His dress was <lb/>
            white, very clean, and his bed-clothes were also white, and <lb/>
            woollen, for linen had not yet been introduced into that <lb/>
            country. He was never known to have eaten too much, or to <lb/>
            have drunk too much, or to indulge in the pleasures of love. <lb/>
            He abstained wholly from laughter, and from all such indul- <lb/>
            gences as jests and idle stories. And when he was angry, he <lb/>
            never chastised any one, whether slave or freeman. He used <lb/>
            to call admonishing, feeding storks.</p>
          <p>He used to practise divination, as far 'as auguries and <lb/>
            auspices go, but not by means of burnt offerings, except only <lb/>
            the burning of frankincense. And all the sacrifices which he <lb/>
            offered consisted of inanimate things. But some, however, <lb/>
            assert that he did sacrifice animals, limiting himself to cocks, <lb/>
             <pb n="347"/>
            and sucking kids, which are called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁπάλιοι</foreign>, but that he very <lb/>
            rarely offered lambs. Aristoxenus, however, affirms that he <lb/>
            permitted the eating of all other animals, and only abstained <lb/>
            from oxen used in agriculture, and from rams.</p>
          <p>XIX. The same author tells us, as I have already mentioned, <lb/>
            that he received his doctrines from Themistoclea, at -Delphi. <lb/>
            And Hieronymus says, that when he descended to the shades <lb/>
            below, he saw the soul of Hesiod bound to a brazen pillar, and <lb/>
            gnashing its teeth; and that of Homer suspended from a tree, <lb/>
            and snakes around it, as a punishment for the things that they <lb/>
            bad said of the Gods. And that those people also were punished <lb/>
            who refrained from commerce with their wives ; and that on <lb/>
            account of this he was greatly honoured by the people of <lb/>
            Crotona.</p>
          <p>But Aristippus, of Cyrene, in his Account of Natural Philo- <lb/>
            sophers, says that Pythagoras derived his name from the fact <lb/>
            of his speaking (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγοϱεύειν</foreign>) truth no less than the God at Delphi <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">του̃ πυθίου</foreign>).</p>
          <p>It is said that he used to admonish his disciples to repeat <lb/>
            these lines to themselves whenever they returned home to their <lb/>
            houses :- <lb/>
            In what have I transgress'd ? What have I done ? <lb/>
            What that I should have done have I omitted ?</p>
          <p>And that he used to forbid them to offer victims to the Gods, <lb/>
            ordering them to worship only at those altars which were un- <lb/>
            stained with blood. He forbade them also to swear by the <lb/>
            Gods; saying, “ That every man ought so to exercise himself, <lb/>
            as to be worthy of belief without an oath." He also taught <lb/>
            men that it behoved them to honour their elders, thinking that <lb/>
            which was precedent in point of time more honourable; just <lb/>
            as in the world, the rising of the sun was more so than the <lb/>
            setting ; in life, the beginning more so than the end; and in <lb/>
            animals, production more so than destruction.</p>
          <p>Another of his rules was that men should honour the Gods <lb/>
            above the dæmones, heroes above men ; and of all men parents <lb/>
            were entitled to the highest degree of reverence. Another, <lb/>
            that people should associate with one another in such a way as <lb/>
            not to make their friends enemies, but to render their enemies <lb/>
            friends. Another was that they should think nothing exclu- <lb/>
            sively their own. Another was to assist the law, and to make <lb/>
             <pb n="348"/>
            war upon lawlessness. Not to destroy or injure a cultivated <lb/>
            tree, nor any animal either which does not injure men. That <lb/>
            modesty and decorum consisted in never yielding to laughter, <lb/>
            and yet not looking stern. He taught that men should avoid <lb/>
            too much flesh, that they should in travelling let rest and <lb/>
            exertion alternate; that they should exercise memory; that <lb/>
            they should never say or do anything in anger ; that they should <lb/>
            not pay respect to every kind of divination; that they should <lb/>
            use songs set to the lyre ; and by hymns to the Gods and to <lb/>
            eminent men, display a reasonable gratitude to them.</p>
          <p>I He also forbade his disciples to eat beans, because, as they <lb/>
            were flatulent, they greatly partook of animal properties [he <lb/>
            also said that men kept their stomachs in better order by <lb/>
            avoiding them]; and that such abstinence made the visions <lb/>
            which appear in one's sleep gentle and free from agitation. <lb/>
            Alexander also says, in his Successions of Philosophers, that <lb/>
            he found the following dogmas also set down in the Commen- <lb/>
            taries of Pythagoras:—</p>
          <p>That the monad was the beginning of everything. From <lb/>
            the monad proceeds an indefinite duad, which is subordinate <lb/>
            to the monad as to its cause. That from the monad and the <lb/>
            indefinite duad proceed numbers. And from numbers signs. <lb/>
            And from these last, lines of which plane figures consist. And <lb/>
            from plane figures are derived solid bodies. And from solid <lb/>
            bodies sensible bodies, of which last there are four elements ; <lb/>
            fire, water, earth, and air. And that the world, which is endued <lb/>
            with life, and intellect, and which is of a spherical figure, <lb/>
            having the earth, which is also spherical, and inhabited all <lb/>
            over in its centre, results from a combination of these elements, <lb/>
            and derives its motion from them ; and also that there are <lb/>
            antipodes,* and that what is below, as respects us, is above in <lb/>
            respect of them. <note type="footnote"> * This doctrine is alluded to doubtfully by Virgil, Georg. i. 247. <lb/>
            Illic, ut perhibent, aut intempesta silet nox <lb/>

          <p>He also taught that light and darkness, and cold and heat, <lb/>
            and dryness and moisture, were equally divided in the world; <lb/>
            and that, while heat was predominant it was summer ; while <lb/>
            cold had the mastery it was winter; when dryness prevailed <lb/>
            it was spring; and when moisture preponderated, winter. And <lb/>
            while all these qualities were on a level, then was the loveliest <lb/>
            season of the year; of which the flourishing spring was the <lb/>
            wholesome period, and the season of autumn the most pernicious <lb/>
            one. Of the day, he said that the flourishing period was the <lb/>
            morning, and the fading one the evening; on which account <lb/>
            that also was the least healthy time.</p>
          <p>Another of his theories was, that the air around the earth <lb/>
            was immoveable, and pregnant with disease, and that every- <lb/>
            thing in it was mortal; but that the upper air was in perpetual <lb/>
            motion, and pure and salubrious ; and that everything in that <lb/>
            was immortal, and on that account divine. And that the sun, <lb/>
            and the moon, and the stars, were all Gods; for in them the <lb/>
            warm principle predominates which is the cause of life. And <lb/>
            that the moon derives its light from the sun. And that there <lb/>
            is a relationship between men and the Gods, because men <lb/>
            partake of the divine principle; on which account also, God <lb/>
            exercises his providence for our advantage. Also, that fate is <lb/>
            the cause of the arrangement of the world both generally and <lb/>
            particularly. Moreover, that a ray from the sun penetrated <lb/>
            both the cold æther and the dense sether; and they call the <lb/>
            air (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀὴϱ</foreign>), the cold æther (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ψυχϱὸν αἰθέϱα</foreign>), and the sea and <lb/>
            moisture they call the dense æther (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παχὺν αἰθϱα</foreign>). And this <lb/>
            ray descends into the depths, and in this way vivifies every- <lb/>
            thing. And everything which partakes of the principle of <lb/>
            heat lives, on which account also plants are animated beings ; <lb/>
            but that all living things have not necessarily souls. And <lb/>
            that the soul is a something torn off from the æther, both <lb/>
            warm and cold, from its partaking of the cold æther. And <lb/>
            that the soul is something different from life. Also, that it is <lb/>
            immortal, because that from which it has been detached is <lb/>
            immortal.</p>
          <p>Also, that animals are born from one another by seeds, and <note type="footnote"> Or when Aurora leaves our northern sphere, <lb/>
            She lights the downward heav'n and rises there : <lb/>
            And when on us she breathes the living light <lb/>
            Red Vesper kindles there the tapers of the night. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="350"/>
            that it is impossible for there to be any spontaneous production <lb/>
            by the earth. And that seed is a drop from the brain which <lb/>
            contains in itself a warm vapour; and that when this is applied <lb/>
            to the womb, it transmits virtue, and moisture, and blood from <lb/>
            the brain, from which flesh, and sinews, and bones, and hair, <lb/>
            and the whole body are produced. And from the vapour is <lb/>
            produced the soul, and also sensation. And that the infant <lb/>
            first becomes a solid body at the end of forty days; but, <lb/>
            according to the principles of harmony, it is not perfect till <lb/>
            seven, or perhaps nine, or at most ten months, and then it is <lb/>
            brought forth. And that it contains in itself all the principles <lb/>
            of life, which are all connected together, and by their union <lb/>
            and combination form a harmonious whole, each of them <lb/>
            developing itself at the appointed time.</p>
          <p>The senses in general, and especially the sight, are a vapour <lb/>
            of excessive warmth, and on this account a man is said to see <lb/>
            through air, and through water. For the hot principle is <lb/>
            opposed by the cold one ; since, if the vapour in the eyes were <lb/>
            cold, it would have the same temperature as the air, and so <lb/>
            would be dissipated. As it is, in some passages he calls the <lb/>
            eyes the gates of the sun. And he speaks in a similar manner <lb/>
            of hearing, and of the other senses.</p>
          <p>He also says that the soul of man is divided into three <lb/>
            parts ; into intuition (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νου̃ς</foreign>), and reason (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ϕϱὴν</foreign>), and mind (<foreign xml:lang="grc">θυμὸς</foreign>), <lb/>
            and that the first and last divisions are found also in other <lb/>
            animals, but that the middle one, reason, is only found in <lb/>
            man. And that the chief abode of the soul is in those parts <lb/>
            of the body which are between the heart and the brain. And, <lb/>
            that that portion of it which is in the heart is the mind (<foreign xml:lang="grc">θυμός</foreign>); <lb/>
            but that deliberation (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νοὺς</foreign>), and reason reside in the <lb/>
            brain.*</p>
          <p>Moreover, that the senses are drops from them; and that <lb/>
            the reasoning sense is immortal, but the others are mortal. <lb/>
            And that the soul is nourished by the blood ; and that reasons <lb/>
            are the winds of the soul. That it is invisible, and so are its <lb/>
            reasons, since the æther itself is invisible. That the links of <lb/>
            the soul are the veins, and the arteries, and the nerves. But <lb/>
            that when it is vigorous, and is by itself in a quiescent state, <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">νου̃ς</foreign> appears, in a division like this, to be the deliberative part of <lb/>
            the mind; <foreign xml:lang="grc">φρὴν</foreign>, the rational part of the intellect: <foreign xml:lang="grc">θυμός</foreign>, that part <lb/>
            with which the passions are concerned. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="351"/>
            then its links are words and actions. That when it is cast <lb/>
            forth upon the earth it wanders about, resembling the body. <lb/>
            Moreover, that Mercury is the steward of the souls, and that <lb/>
            on this account he has the name of Conductor, and Commercial, <lb/>
            and Infernal, since it is he who conducts the souls from their <lb/>
            bodies, and from earth, and sea; and that he conducts the <lb/>
            pure souls to the highest region, and that he does not allow <lb/>
            the impure ones to approach them, nor to come near one <lb/>
            another; but commits them to be bound in indissoluble fetters <lb/>
            by the Furies. The Pythagoreans also assert, that the whole <lb/>
            air is full of souls, and that these are those which are accounted <lb/>
            dæmones, and heroes. Also, that it is by them that dreams <lb/>
            are sent among men, and also the tokens of disease and health ; <lb/>
            these last too, being sent not only to men, but to sheep also, <lb/>
            and other cattle. Also, that it is they who are concerned with <lb/>
            purifications, and expiations, and all kinds of divination, and <lb/>
            oracular predictions, and things of that kind.</p>
          <p>They also say, that the most important privilege in man is, <lb/>
            the being able to persuade his soul to either good or bad. And <lb/>
            that men are happy when they have a good soul; yet, that <lb/>
            they are never quiet, and that they never retain the same mind <lb/>
            long. Also, that an oath is justice ; and that on that account, <lb/>
            Jupiter is called Jupiter of Oaths (“<foreign xml:lang="grc">Οϱϰιος</foreign>). Also, that virtue <lb/>
            is harmony, and health, and universal good, and God ; on which <lb/>
            account everything owes its existence and consistency to har- <lb/>
            mony. Also, that friendship is a harmonious equality.</p>
          <p>Again, they teach that one ought not to pay equal honours <lb/>
            to Gods and to heroes ; but that one ought to honour the Gods <lb/>
            at all times, extolling them with praises, clothed in white <lb/>
            garments, and keeping one's body chaste ; but that one ought <lb/>
            not to pay such honour to the heroes till after midday. Also, <lb/>
            that a state of purity is brought about by purifications, and <lb/>
            washings, and sprinklings, and by a man's purifying himself <lb/>
            from all funerals, or concubinage, or pollution of every kind, <lb/>
            and by abstaining from all flesh that has either been killed or <lb/>
            died of itself, and from mullets, and from melanuri, and from <lb/>
            eggs, and from such animals as lay eggs, and from beans, and <lb/>
            from other things which are prohibited by those who have the <lb/>
            charge of the mysteries in the temples.</p>
          <p>And Aristotle says, in his treatise on Beans, that Pythagoras <lb/>
            enjoined his disciples to abstain from beans, either because <lb/>
             <pb n="352"/>
            they resemble some part of the human body, or because they <lb/>
            are like the gates of hell (for they are the only plants without <lb/>
            parts); or because they dry up other plants, or because they <lb/>
            are representatives of universal nature, or because they are <lb/>
            used in elections in oligarchical governments. He also forbade <lb/>
            his disciples to pick up what fell from the table, for the sake <lb/>
            of accustoming them not to eat immoderately, or else because <lb/>
            such things belong to the dead.</p>
          <p>But Aristophanes says, that what falls belongs to the heroes; <lb/>
            saying, in his Heroes :— <lb/>
            Never taste the things which fall <lb/>
            From the table on the floor.</p>
          <p>He also forbade his disciples to eat white poultry, because <lb/>
            a cock of that colour was sacred to Month, and was also a <lb/>
            suppliant. He was also accounted a good animal;* and he <lb/>
            was sacred to the God Month, for he indicates the time.</p>
          <p>The Pythagoreans were also forbidden to eat of all fish that <lb/>
            were sacred ; on the ground that the same animals ought not <lb/>
            to be served up before both Gods and men, just as the same <lb/>
            things do not belong to freemen and to slaves. Now, white <lb/>
            is an indication of a good nature, and black of a bad one. <lb/>
            Another of the precepts of Pythagoras was, that men ought <lb/>
            not to break bread ; because in ancient times friends used to <lb/>
            assemble around one loaf, as they even now do among the <lb/>
            barbarians. Nor would he allow men to divide bread which <lb/>
            unites them. Some think that he laid down this rule in refer- <lb/>
            ence to the judgment which takes place in hell; some because <lb/>
            this practice engenders timidity in war. According to others, <lb/>
            what is alluded to is the Union, which presides over the <lb/>
            government of the universe.</p>
          <p>Another of his doctrines was, that of all solid figures the <lb/>
            sphere was the most beautiful; and of all plane figures, the <lb/>
            circle. That old age and all diminution were similar, and <lb/>
            also increase and youth were identical. That health was the <lb/>
            permanence of form, and disease the destruction of it. Of salt <lb/>
            his opinion was, that it ought to be set before people as a <lb/>
            reminder of justice ; for salt preserves everything which it <note type="footnote"> * There is a great variety of suggestions as to the proper reading <lb/>
            here. There is evidently some corruption in the text. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="353"/>
            touches, and it is composed of the purest particles of water and <lb/>
            sea.</p>
          <p>These are the doctrines which Alexander asserts that he <lb/>
            discovered in the Pythagorean treatises ; and Aristotle gives <lb/>
            a similar account of them.</p>
          <p>XV. Timon, in his Silli, has not left unnoticed the dignified <lb/>
            appearance of Pythagoras, when he attacks him on other points. <lb/>
            And his words are these :— <lb/>
            Pythagoras, who often teaches <lb/>
            Precepts of magic, and with speeches <lb/>
            Of long high-sounding diction draws, <lb/>
            From gaping crowds, a vain applause.</p>
          <p>And respecting his having been different people at different <lb/>
            times, Xenophanes adds his evidence in an elegiac poem which <lb/>
            commences thus :- <lb/>
            Now I will on another subject touch, <lb/>
            And lead the way.</p>
          <p>And the passage in which he mentions Pythagoras is as <lb/>
            follows:- <lb/>
            They say that once, as passing by he saw <lb/>
            A dog severely beaten, he did pity him, <lb/>
            And spoke as follows to the man who beat him :— <lb/>
            " Stop now, and beat him not; since in his body, <lb/>
            Abides the soul of a dear friend of mine, <lb/>
            Whose voice I recognized as he was crying."</p>
          <p>These are the words of Xenophanes.</p>
          <p>Cratinus also ridiculed him in his Pythagorean Woman ; <lb/>
            but in his Tarentines, he speaks thus :— <lb/>
            They are accustomed, if by chance they see <lb/>
            A private individual abroad, <lb/>
            To try what powers of argument he has, <lb/>
            How he can speak and reason : and they bother him <lb/>
            With strange antithesis and forced conclusions, <lb/>
            Errors, comparisons, and magnitudes, <lb/>
            Till they have filled and quite perplex'd his mind.</p>
          <p>And Innesimachus says in his Alcmæon:— <lb/>
            As we do sacrifice to the Phœbus whom <lb/>
            Pythagoras worships, never eating aught <lb/>
            Which has the breath of life.</p>
          <p>Austophon says in his Pythagorean:- <note type="footnote"> A A </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="354"/>
            A. He said that when he did descend below <lb/>
            Among the shades in Hell, he there beheld <lb/>
            All men who e'er had died; and there he saw, <lb/>
            That the Pythagoreans differ'd much <lb/>
            From all the rest; for that with them alone <lb/>
            Did Pluto deign to eat, much honouring <lb/>
            Their pious habits.</p>
          <p>B. He's a civil God, <lb/>
            If he likes eating with such dirty fellows.</p>
          <p>And again, in the same play he says :— <lb/>
            They eat <lb/>
            Nothing but herbs and vegetables, and drink <lb/>
            Pure water only. But their lice are such, <lb/>
            Their cloaks so dirty, and their unwash'd scent <lb/>
            So rank, that no one of our younger men <lb/>
            Will for a moment bear them.</p>
          <p>XXI. Pythagoras died in this manner. When he was <lb/>
            sitting with some of his companions in Milo's house, some <lb/>
            one of those whom he did not think worthy of admission into <lb/>
            it, was excited by envy to set fire to it. But some say that <lb/>
            the people of Crotona themselves did this, being afraid lest he <lb/>
            might aspire to the tyranny. And that Pythagoras was caught <lb/>
            as he was trying to escape ; and coming to a place full of beans, <lb/>
            he stopped there, saying that it was better to be caught than <lb/>
            to trample on the beans, and better to be slain than to speak ; <lb/>
            and so he was murdered by those who were pursuing him. <lb/>
            And in this way, also, most of his companions were slain; <lb/>
            being in number about forty ; but that a very few did escape, <lb/>
            among whom were Archippus, of Tarentum, and Lysis, <lb/>
            whom I have mentioned before.</p>
          <p>But Dicæarchus relates that Pythagoras died afterwards, <lb/>
            having escaped as far as the temple of the Muses, at Meta- <lb/>
            pontum, and that he died there of starvation, having abstained <lb/>
            from food for forty days. And Heraclides says, in his abridgment <lb/>
            of the life of Satyrus, that after he had buried Pherecydes in <lb/>
            Delos, he returned to Italy, and finding there a superb ban- <lb/>
            quet prepared at the house of Milo, of Cortona, he left Cro- <lb/>
            tona, and went to Metapontum, and there put an end to his <lb/>
            life by starvation, not wishing to live any longer. But Her- <lb/>
            mippus says, that when there was war between the people of <lb/>
            Agrigentum and the Syracusans, Pythagoras went out with <lb/>
            his usual companions, and took the part of the Agrigentines ; <lb/>
             <pb n="355"/>
            and as they were put to flight, he ran all round a field of <lb/>
            beans, instead of crossing it, and so was slain by the Syracu- <lb/>
            sans ; and that the rest, being about five-and-thirty in num- <lb/>
            ber, were burnt at Tarentum, when they were trying to excite <lb/>
            a sedition in the state against the principal magistrates.</p>
          <p>Hermippus also relates another story about Pythagoras. <lb/>
            For he says that when he was in Italy, he made a subterra- <lb/>
            neous apartment, and charged his mother to write an account <lb/>
            of everything that took place, marking the time of each on a <lb/>
            tablet, and then to send them down to him, until he came up <lb/>
            again ; and that his mother did so ; and that Pythagoras came <lb/>
            up again after a certain time, lean, and reduced to a skeleton ; <lb/>
            and that he came into the public assembly, and said that he <lb/>
            had arrived from the shades below, and then he recited to <lb/>
            them all that had happened during his absence. And they, <lb/>
            being charmed by what he told them, wept and lamented, and <lb/>
            believed that Pythagoras was a divine being; so that they <lb/>
            even entrusted their wives to him, as likely to learn some <lb/>
            good from him ; and that they too were called Pythagoreans. <lb/>
            And this is the story of Hermippus.</p>
          <p>XXII. And Pythagoras had a wife, whose name was <lb/>
            Theano; the daughter of Brontinus, of Crotona. But some <lb/>
            say that she was the wife of Brontinus, and only a pupil of <lb/>
            Pythagoras. And he had a daughter named Damo, as Lysis <lb/>
            mentions in his letter to Hipparchus; where he speaks thus <lb/>
            of Pythagoras: "And many say that you philosophize in public, <lb/>
            as Pythagoras also used to do; who, when he had entrusted <lb/>
            his Commentaries to Damo, his daughter, charged her to <lb/>
            divulge them to no person out of the house. And she, though <lb/>
            she might have sold his discourses for much money, would not <lb/>
            abandon them, for she thought poverty and obedience to her <lb/>
            father's injunctions more valuable than gold; and that too, <lb/>
            though she was a woman."</p>
          <p>He had also a son, named Telauges, who was the successor <lb/>
            of his father in his school, and who, according to some authors, <lb/>
            was the teacher of Empedocles. At least Hippobotus relates <lb/>
            that Empedocles said :— <lb/>
            " Telauges, noble youth, whom in due time, <lb/>
            Theano bore to wise Pythagoras."</p>
          <p>But there is no book extant, which.is the work of Telauges, <note type="footnote"> A A 2</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="356"/>
            though there are some extant, which are attributed to his <lb/>
            mother Theano. And they tell a story of her, that once, when <lb/>
            she was asked how long a woman ought to be absent from her <lb/>
            husband to be pure, she said, the moment she leaves her <lb/>
            own husband, she is pure ; but she is never pure at all, after she <lb/>
            leaves any one else. And she recommended a woman, who was <lb/>
            going to her husband, to put off her modesty with her clothes, <lb/>
            and when she left him, to resume it again with her clothes; <lb/>
            and when she was asked, "What clothes ?" she said, " Those <lb/>
            which cause you to be called a woman."</p>
          <p>XXIII. Now Pythagoras, as Heraclides, the son of Sara- <lb/>
            plan, relates, died when he was eighty years of age ; accord- <lb/>
            ing to his own account of his age, but according to the common <lb/>
            account, he was more than ninety. And we have written a <lb/>
            sportive epigram on him, which is couched in the following <lb/>
            terms :- <lb/>
            You're not the only man who has abstained <lb/>
            From living food, for so likewise have we; <lb/>
            And who, I'd like to know did ever taste <lb/>
            Food while alive, most sage Pythagoras ?, <lb/>
            When meat is boil'd, or roasted well and salted, <lb/>
            I don't think it can well be called living. <lb/>
            Which, therefore, without scruple then we eat it, <lb/>
            And call it no more living flesh, but meat.</p>
          <p>And another, which runs thus:- <lb/>
            Pythagoras was'so wise a man, that he <lb/>
            Never eat meat himself, and called it sin. <lb/>
            And yet he gave good joints of beef to others. <lb/>
            So that I marvel at his principles; <lb/>
            Who others wronged, by teaching them to do <lb/>
            What he believed unholy for himself.</p>
          <p>And another, as follows:- <lb/>
            Should you Phythagoras' doctrine wish to know, <lb/>
            Look on the centre of Euphorbus' shield. <lb/>
            For he asserts there lived a man of old, <lb/>
            And when he had no longer an existence, <lb/>
            He still could say that he had been alive, <lb/>
            Or else he would not still be living now.</p>
          <p>And this one too: <lb/>
            Alas ! alas ! why did Pythagoras hold <lb/>
            Beans in such wondrous honour ? Why, besides, <lb/>
            Did he thus die among his choice companions ? <lb/>
             <pb n="357"/>
            There was a field of beans; and so the sage, <lb/>
            Died in the common road of Agrigentum, <lb/>
            Rather than trample down his favourite beans.</p>
          <p>XXIV. And he flourished about the sixtieth olympiad: <lb/>
            and his system lasted for nine or ten generations. And the <lb/>
            last of the Pythagoreans, whom Aristoxenus knew, were <lb/>
            Xenophilus, the Chalcidean, from Thrace; and Phanton, the <lb/>
            Phliasian, and Echurates, and Diodes, and Polymnestus, who <lb/>
            were also Phliasians, and they were disciples of Philolaus <lb/>
            and Eurytus, of Tarentum.</p>
          <p>XXV. And there were four men of the name of Pytha- <lb/>
            goras, about the same time, at no great distance from one <lb/>
            another. One was a native of Crotona, a man who attained <lb/>
            tyrannical power; the second was a Phliasian, a trainer of <lb/>
            wrestlers, as some say ; the third was a native of Zacynthus ; <lb/>
            the fourth was this our philosopher, to whom they say the <lb/>
            mysteries of philosophy belong, in whose time that proverbial <lb/>
            phrase, " Ipse dixit," was introduced into ordinary life. Some <lb/>
            also affirm, that there was another man of the name of <lb/>
            Pythagoras, a statuary of Rhodes ; who is believed to have <lb/>
            been the first discoverer of rhythm and proportion; and <lb/>
            another was a Samian statuary; and another an orator, of no <lb/>
            reputation; and another was a physician, who wrote a treatise <lb/>
            on Squills ; and also some essays on Homer; and another <lb/>
            was a man, who wrote a history of the affairs of the Dorians, <lb/>
            as we are told by Dionysius.</p>
          <p>But Eratosthenes says, as Phavorinus quotes him, in the <lb/>
            eighth book of his Universal History, that this philosopher, <lb/>
            of whom we are speaking, was the first man who ever prac- <lb/>
            tised boxing in a scientific manner, in the forty-eighth olym- <lb/>
            piad, having his hair long, and being clothed in a purple <lb/>
            robe ; and that he was rejected from the competition among <lb/>
            boys, and being ridiculed for his application, he immediately <lb/>
            entered among the men, and came off victorious. And this <lb/>
            statement is confirmed among other things, by the epigram <lb/>
            which Theætetus composed :- <lb/>
            Stranger, if e'er you knew Pythagoras, <lb/>
            Pythagoras, the man with flowing hair, <lb/>
            The celebrated boxer, erst of Samos ; <lb/>
            I am Pythagoras. And if you ask <lb/>
            A citizen of Elis of my deeds, <lb/>
            You'll surely think he is relating fables.</p><pb n="358"/>
            
          <p>Phavorinus says, that he employed definitions, on account <lb/>
            of the mathematical subjects to which he applied himself. <lb/>
            And that Socrates and those who were his pupils, did so still <lb/>
            more ; and that they were subsequently followed in this by <lb/>
            Aristotle and the Stoics.</p>
          <p>He too, was the first person, who ever gave the name of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰόσμος</foreign> to the universe, and the first who called the earth <lb/>
            round; though Theophrastus attributes this to Parmenides, <lb/>
            and Zeno to Hesiod. They say too, that Cylon used to be a <lb/>
            constant adversary of his, as Antidicus was of Socrates. And <lb/>
            this epigram also used to be repeated, concerning Pythagoras <lb/>
            the athlete : — <lb/>
            Pythagoras of Samoa, son of Crates, <lb/>
            Came while a child to the Olympic games, <lb/>
            Eager to battle for the prize in boxing.</p>
          <p>XXVI. There is a letter of this philosopher extant, which <lb/>
            is couched in the following terms :—</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">PYTHAGORAS TO ANAXIMENES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>"You too, my most excellent friend, if you were not <lb/>
            superior to Pythagoras, in birth and reputation, would have <lb/>
            migrated from Miletus and gone elsewhere. But now the <lb/>
            reputation of your father keeps you back, which perhaps <lb/>
            would have restrained me too, if I had been like Anaximenes. <lb/>
            But if you, who are the most eminent man, abandon the <lb/>
            cities, all their ornaments will be taken from them, and the <lb/>
            Median power will be more dangerous to them. Nor is it <lb/>
            always seasonable to be studying astronomy, but it is more <lb/>
            honourable to exhibit a regard for one's country. And I my- <lb/>
            self am not always occupied about speculations of my own <lb/>
            fancy, but I am busied also with the wars which the Italians <lb/>
            are waging against one another.</p>
          <p>But since we have now finished our account of Pythagoras, <lb/>
            we must also speak of the most eminent of the Pythagoreans. <lb/>
            After whom, we must mention those who are spoken of more <lb/>
            promiscuously in connection with no particular school; and <lb/>
            then we will connect the whole series of philosophers worth <lb/>
            speaking of, till we arrive at Epicurus, as we have already <lb/>
            promised.</p><pb n="359"/>
            
          <p>Now Jelanges and Theano we have mentioned; and we <lb/>
            must now speak of Empedocles, in the first place, for, accord- <lb/>
            .ing to some accounts, he was a pupil of Pythagoras.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF EMPEDOCLES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. EMPEDOCLES, as Hippobotus relates, was the son of <lb/>
            Meton, the son of Empedocles, and a citizen of Agrigentum. <lb/>
            And Timæus, in the fifteenth book of his Histories, gives the <lb/>
            same account, adding that Empedocles, the grandfather of the <lb/>
            poet, was also a most eminent man. And Hermippus tells <lb/>
            the same story as Timæus; and in the same spirit Heraclides, <lb/>
            in his treatise on Diseases, relates that he was of an illus- <lb/>
            trious family, since his father bred a fine stud of horses. <lb/>
            Erastothenes, in his List of the Conquerors at the Olympic <lb/>
            Games, says, that the father of Meton gained the victory in <lb/>
            the seventy-first olympiad, quoting Aristotle as his authority <lb/>
            for the assertion.</p>
          <p>But Apollodorus, the grammarian, in his Chronicles, says <lb/>
            that he was the son of Meton; and Glaucus says that he <lb/>
            came to Thurii when the city was only just completed. And <lb/>
            then proceeding a little further, he adds :— <lb/>
            And some relate that he did flee from thence, <lb/>
            And came to Syracuse, and on their side <lb/>
            Did fight in horrid war against th' Athenians ; <lb/>
            But those men seem to me completely wrong- <lb/>
            For by this time he must have been deceased, <lb/>
            Or very old, which is not much believed; <lb/>
            For Aristotle, and Heraclides too, <lb/>
            Say that he died at sixty years of age.</p>
          <p>But certainly the person who got the victory with a single <lb/>
            horse in the seventy-first olympiad was a namesake of this <lb/>
            man, and that it is which deceived Apollodorus as to the age <lb/>
            of this philosopher.</p>
          <p>But Satyrus, in his Lives, asserts, that Empedocles was the <lb/>
            son of Exænetus, and that he also left a son who was named <lb/>
             <pb n="360"/>
            Exænetus, And that in the same Olympiad, he himself <lb/>
            gained the victory with the single horse; and his son, in <lb/>
            wrestling, or, as Heraclides says in his Abridgment, in <lb/>
            running. But I have found in the Commentaries of Phavo- <lb/>
            rinus, that Empedocles sacrificed, and gave as a feast to the <lb/>
            spectators of the games, an ox made of honey and flour, and <lb/>
            that he had a brother named Callicratidas.</p>
          <p>But Jelanges, the son of Pythagoras, in his letters to <lb/>
            Philolaus, says that Empedocles was the son of Archinomus ; <lb/>
            and that he was a citizen of Agrigentum, he himself asserts at <lb/>
            the beginning of his Purifications.</p>
          <p>Friends, who the mighty citadel inhabit, <lb/>
            Which crowns the golden waves-of Acragas.</p>
          <p>And this is enough to say about his family.</p>
          <p>II. Timæus, in his ninth book, relates that he was a pupil <lb/>
            of Pythagoras, saying that he was afterwards convicted of <lb/>
            having divulged his doctrines, in the same way as Plato was, <lb/>
            and therefore that he was forbidden from thenceforth to <lb/>
            attend his school. And they say that Pythagoras himself <lb/>
            mentions him when he says :— <lb/>
            And in that band there was a learned man, <lb/>
            Of wondrous wisdom; one, who of all men <lb/>
            Had the profoundest wealth of intellect.</p>
          <p>But some say that when the philosopher says this, he is <lb/>
            referring to Parmenides.</p>
          <p>Neanthes relates, that till the time of Philolaus and Empe- <lb/>
            docles, the Pythagoreans used to admit all persons indis- <lb/>
            criminately into their school; but when Empedocles made <lb/>
            their doctrines public by means of his poems, then they made <lb/>
            a law to admit no Epic poet. And they say that the same <lb/>
            thing happened to Plato ; for that he too was excluded from <lb/>
            the school. But who was the teacher of the Pythagorean <lb/>
            school that Empedocles was a pupil of, they do not say ; for, <lb/>
            as for the letter of Jelanges, in which he is stated to have <lb/>
            been a pupil of Hippasus and Brontinus, that is not worthy <lb/>
            of belief. But Theophrastus says that he was an imitator <lb/>
            and a rival of Parmenides, in his poems, for that he too had <lb/>
            delivered his opinions on natural philosophy in epic verse.</p>
          <p>Hermippus, however, says that he was an imitator, not of <lb/>
            Parmenides, but of Xenophanes with whom he lived; and <lb/>
             <pb n="361"/>
            that he imitated his epic style, and that it was at a later <lb/>
            period that he fell in with the Pythagoreans. But Alcidamas, <lb/>
            in his Natural Philosophy, says, that Zeno and Empedocles <lb/>
            were pupils of Parmenides, about the same time; and that <lb/>
            they subsequently seceded from him; and that Zeno adopted <lb/>
            a philosophical system peculiar to himself; but that Empedo- <lb/>
            cles became a pupil of Anaxagoras and Pythagoras, and that <lb/>
            he imitated the pompous demeanour, and way of life, and <lb/>
            gestures of the one, and the system of Natural Philosophy of <lb/>
            the other.</p>
          <p>III. And Aristotle, in his Sophist, says that Empedocles <lb/>
            was the first person who invented rhetoric, and Zeno the first <lb/>
            person who invented dialectics. And in his book on Poetry, <lb/>
            he says, that Empedocles was a man of Homeric genius, and <lb/>
            endowed with great power of language, and a great master of <lb/>
            metaphor, and a man who employed all the successful artifices <lb/>
            of poetry, and also that when he had written several poems, <lb/>
            and among them one on the passage of the Hellespont, by <lb/>
            Xerxes, and also the proœmium of a hymn to Apollo, his <lb/>
            daughter subsequently burnt them, or, as Hieronymus says, <lb/>
            his sister, burning the proœmium unintentionally, but the <lb/>
            Persian poem on purpose, because it was incomplete. And <lb/>
            speaking generally, he says that he wrote tragedies and <lb/>
            political treatises.</p>
          <p>But Heraclides, the son of Sarapion, says that the tragedies <lb/>
            were the work of some other Empedocles; and Hieronymus <lb/>
            says that he had met with forty-three. Neanthes, too, affirms <lb/>
            that when he was a young man, he wrote tragedies, and that <lb/>
            he himself had subsequently met with them; and Satyrus, in <lb/>
            his Lives, states that he was a physician, and also a most <lb/>
            excellent orator. And accordingly, that Gorgias, of Leontini, <lb/>
            was his pupil, a man of the greatest eminence as a rhetorician, <lb/>
            and one who left behind him a treatise containing a complete <lb/>
            system of the art; and who, as we are told by Apollodorus, <lb/>
            in his Chronicles, lived to the age of a hundred and nine <lb/>
            years.</p>
          <p>IV. Satyrus tells us that he used to say that he had been <lb/>
            present when Empedocles was practising magic; and that he <lb/>
            professes this science, and many others too in his poems when <lb/>
            he says :- <lb/>
             <pb n="362"/>
            And all the drugs which can relieve disease, <lb/>
            Or soften the approach of age, shall be <lb/>
            Revealed to your inquiries; I do know them, <lb/>
            And I to you alone will them disclose. <lb/>
            You shall restrain the fierce unbridled winds, <lb/>
            Which, rushing o'er the earth, bow down the corn. <lb/>
            And crush the farmer's hopes. And when you will, <lb/>
            You shall recall them back to sweep the land : <lb/>
            Then you shall learn to dry the rainy clouds, <lb/>
            And bid warm summer cheer the heart of men. <lb/>
            Again, at your behest, the drought shall yield <lb/>
            To wholesome show'rs : when you give the word <lb/>
            Hell shall restore its dead.</p>
          <p>V. And Timæus, in his eighteenth book, says, that this <lb/>
            man was held in great esteem on many accounts; for that <lb/>
            once, when the etesian gales were blowing violently, so as to <lb/>
            injure the crops, he ordered some asses to be flayed, and some <lb/>
            bladders to be made of their hides, and these he placed on <lb/>
            the hills and high places to catch the wind. And so, when <lb/>
            the wind ceased, he was called wind-forbidder (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰωλυσανέμας</foreign>). <lb/>
            And Heraclides, in his treatise on Diseases, says that he <lb/>
            dictated to Pausanias the statement which he made about the <lb/>
            dead woman. Now Pausanias, as both Aristippus and Satyrus <lb/>
            agree, was much attached to him ; and he dedicated to him <lb/>
            the works which he wrote on Natural Philosophy, in the <lb/>
            following terms :— <lb/>
            Hear, 0 Pausanias, son of wise Anchites.</p>
          <p>He also wrote an epigram upon him:— <lb/>
            Gela, his native land, does boast the birth <lb/>
            Of wise Anchites' son, that great physician, <lb/>
            So fitly named Pausanias,* from his skill; <lb/>
            A genuine son of Æsculapius, <lb/>
            Who has stopped many men whom fell disease <lb/>
            Marked for its own, from treading those dark paths <lb/>
            Which lead to Proserpine's infernal realms.</p>
          <p>The case of the dead woman above mentioned, Heraclides <lb/>
            says, was something of this sort; that he kept her corpse for <lb/>
            thirty days dead, and yet free from corruption ; on which <lb/>
            account he has called himself a physician and a prophet, <lb/>
            taking it also from these verses :— <note type="footnote"> * From <foreign xml:lang="grc">παύω</foreign>, to cause to cease, avia, sorrow. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="363"/>
            Friends who the mighty citadel inhabit, <lb/>
            Which crowns the golden waves of Acragas. <lb/>
            Votaries of noble actions, Hail to ye ; <lb/>
            I, an immortal God, no longer mortal, <lb/>
            Now live among you well revered by all, <lb/>
            As is my due, crowned with holy fillets <lb/>
            And rosy garlands. And whene'er I come <lb/>
            To wealthy cities, then from men and women <lb/>
            Due honours meets me ; and crowds follow me, <lb/>
            Seeking the way which leads to gainful glory. <lb/>
            Some ask for oracles, and some entreat, <lb/>
            For remedies against all kinds of sickness.</p>
          <p>VII. And he says that Agrigentum was a very large city, <lb/>
            since it had eight hundred thousand inhabitants; on which <lb/>
            account Empedocles, seeing the people immersed in luxury, <lb/>
            said, " The men of Agrigentum devote themselves wholly to <lb/>
            luxury as if they were to die to-morrow, but they furnish their <lb/>
            houses as if they were to live for ever."</p>
          <p>VIII. It is said that Cleomenes, the rhapsodist, sung this <lb/>
            very poem, called the Purifications, at Olympia; at least this <lb/>
            is the account given by Phavorinus, in his Commentaries.</p>
          <p>IX. And Aristotle says, that he was a most liberal man, <lb/>
            and far removed from anything like a domineering spirit; since <lb/>
            he constantly'refused the sovereign power when it was offered <lb/>
            to him, as Xanthus assures us in his account of him, showing <lb/>
            plainly that he preferred a simple style of living. And Timæus <lb/>
            tells the same story, giving at the same time the reason why <lb/>
            he was so very popular. For he says that when on one occa- <lb/>
            sion, he was invited to a banquet by one of the magistrates, <lb/>
            the wine was carried about, but the supper was not served up. <lb/>
            And as every one else kept silence, he, disapproving of what <lb/>
            he saw, bade the servants bring in the supper; but the person <lb/>
            who had invited him said that he was waiting for the secretary <lb/>
            of the council. And when he came he was appointed master <lb/>
            of the feast, at the instigation of the giver of it, and then he <lb/>
            gave a plain intimation of his tyrannical inclinations, for he <lb/>
            ordered all the guests to drink, and those who did not drink <lb/>
            were to have the wine poured over their heads. Empedocles <lb/>
            said nothing at the moment, but the next day he summoned <lb/>
            them before the court, and procured the execution of both the <lb/>
            entertainer and the master of the feast.</p>
          <p>And this was the beginning of his political career. And at <lb/>
            another time, when Acron, the physician, asked of the council <lb/>
             <pb n="364"/>
            a place where he might erect a monument to his father, on <lb/>
            account of his eminence as a physician, Empedocles came <lb/>
            forward and opposed any such grant, adducing many argu- <lb/>
            ments on the ground of equality, and also putting the following <lb/>
            question : —" And what elegy shall we inscribe upon it ? <lb/>
            Shall we say:-</p><figure type="illustration">
            <graphic url="ENG_BELL_21_fig11.jpg"/></figure>
          <p>But some give the second line thus :— <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_21_fig12.jpg"/></figure></p>
          <p><lb/>
            And others assert that it is the composition of Simonides. <lb/>
            But afterwards Empedocles abolished the assembly of a <lb/>
            thousand, and established a council in which. the magistrates <lb/>
            were to hold office for three years, on such a footing that it <lb/>
            should consist not only of rich men, but of those who were <lb/>
            favourers of the interests of the people. Timæus, however, <lb/>
            iu his first and second book (for he often mentions him), says <lb/>
            that he appeared to entertain opinions adverse to a republic. <lb/>
            And, as far as his poetry goes, any one may see that he was <lb/>
            arrogant and self-satisfied. Accordingly, he says :— <lb/>
            Hail to ye, * <lb/>
            I, an immortal God. no longer mortal, <lb/>
            Now live among you :</p>
          <p>And so on.</p>
          <p>But when he went to the olympic games he was considered <lb/>
            a worthy object of general attention ; so that there was no <lb/>
            mention made of any one else in comparison of Empedocles.</p>
          <p>X. Afterwards, indeed, when Agrigentum was settled, the <lb/>
            descendants of his enemies opposed his return ; on which <lb/>
            account he retired to Peloponnesus, where he died. And <lb/>
            Timon has not let even Empedocles escape, but satirises him <lb/>
            in this style, saying :— <lb/>
            And then Empedocles, the honeyed speaker <lb/>
            Of soft forensic speeches; he did take <lb/>
            As many offices as he was able, <lb/>
            Creating magistrates who wanted helpers. <note type="footnote"> * It is impossible to give the force of this epigram in any other <lb/>
            language. It is a pun on *<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ακϱων</foreign>, ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ακϱάγας</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄκϱος</foreign>. The last word </note></p><pb n="365"/>
            
          <p>But there are two accounts of the manner of his death.</p>
          <p>XI. For Heraclides, relating the story about the dead woman, <lb/>
            how Empedocles got great glory from sending away a dead <lb/>
            woman restored to life, says that he celebrated a sacrifice in <lb/>
            the field of Pisianax, and that some of his friends were invited, <lb/>
            among whom was Pausanias. And then, after the banquet, <lb/>
            they lay down, some going a little way off, and some lying under <lb/>
            the trees close by in the field, and some wherever they <lb/>
            happened to choose. But Empedocles himself remained in <lb/>
            the place where he had been sitting. But when day broke, <lb/>
            and they arose, he alone was not found. And when he was <lb/>
            sought for, and the servants were examined and said that they <lb/>
            did not know, one of them said, that at midnight he had heard <lb/>
            a loud voice calling Empedocles ; and that then he himself <lb/>
            rose up and saw a great light from heaven, but nothing else. <lb/>
            And as they were all amazed at what had taken place, Pau- <lb/>
            sanias descended and sent some people to look for him ; but <lb/>
            afterwards he was commanded not to busy himself about the <lb/>
            matter, as he was informed that what had happened was de- <lb/>
            serving of thankfulness, and that they behoved to sacrifice to <lb/>
            Empedocles as to one who had become a God.</p>
          <p>Hermippus says also, that a woman of the name of Panthea, <lb/>
            a native of Agrigentum, who had been given over by the physi- <lb/>
            cians, was cured by him, and that it was on this account that <lb/>
            he celebrated a sacrifice ; and that the guests invited were about <lb/>
            eighty in number. But Hippobotus says that he rose up and <lb/>
            went away as if he were going to mount Ætna; and that when <lb/>
            he arrived at the crater of fire he leaped in, and disappeared, <lb/>
            wishing to establish a belief that he had become a God. But <lb/>
            afterwards the truth was detected by one of his slippers having <lb/>
            been dropped. For he used to wear slippers with brazen soles. <lb/>
            Pausanias, however, contradicts this statement.* <note type="footnote"> meaning not only high, lofty, but also eminent, very skilful. The plain <lb/>
            English would be :—" The lofty height of a most eminent country con- <lb/>
            ceals Acron, a skilful physician of Acragas, the son of a skilful father." <lb/>
            The variation would be :—" A high tomb on a very high summit, <lb/>
            conceals," &amp;c. </note><note type="footnote"> * This story is mentioned by Horace :— <lb/>
            Siculique poetæ, <lb/>
            Narrabo interitum ; deus immortalis haberi, <lb/>
            Dum cupit Empedocles ardentem frigidus Ætnam, <lb/>
            Insiluit. A. P. 466. </note></p><pb n="366"/>
            
          <p>But Diodorus, of Ephesus, writing about Anaximander, says <lb/>
            that Empedocles imitated him; indulging in a tragic sort of <lb/>
            pride, and wearing magnificent apparel. And when a pestilence <lb/>
            attacked the people of Selinus, by reason of the bad smells <lb/>
            arising from the adjacent river, so that the men died and the <lb/>
            women bore dead children, Empedocles contrived a plan, and <lb/>
            brought into the same channel two other rivers at his own <lb/>
            expense ; and so, by mixing their waters with that of the other <lb/>
            river, he sweetened the stream. And as the pestilence was <lb/>
            removed in this way, when the people of Selinus were on one <lb/>
            occasion holding a festival on the bank of the river, Empedo- <lb/>
            cles appeared among them; and they rising up, offered him <lb/>
            adoration, and prayed to him as to a God. And he, wishing <lb/>
            to confirm this idea which they had adopted of him, leaped <lb/>
            into the fire.</p>
          <p>But Timæus contradicts all these stories ; saying expressly, <lb/>
            that he departed into Peloponnesus, and never returned at <lb/>
            all, on which account the manner of his death is uncertain. <lb/>
            And he especially denies the tale of Heraclides in his fourth <lb/>
            book; for he says that Pisianax was a Syracnsan, and had no <lb/>
            field in the district of Agrigentum ; but that Pausanias erected <lb/>
            a monument in honour of his friend, since such a report had <lb/>
            got about concerning him ; and, as he was a rich man, made it <lb/>
            a statue and little chapel, as one might erect to a God. " How <lb/>
            then," adds Timæus, " could he have leaped into a crater, of <lb/>
            which, though they were in the neighbourhood, he had never <lb/>
            made any mention ? He died then in Peloponnesus ; and <lb/>
            there is nothing extraordinary in there being no tomb of his <lb/>
            to be seen ; for there are many other men who have no tomb <lb/>
            visible." These are the words of Timaeus ; and he adds <lb/>
            further, " But Heraclides is altogether a man fond of strange <lb/>
            stories, and one who would assert that a man had fallen from <lb/>
            the moon."</p>
          <p>Hippobotus says, that there was a clothed statue of Empe <lb/>
            docles which lay formerly in Agrigentum, but which was <lb/>
            afterwards placed in front of the Senate House of the Romans <lb/>
            divested of its clothing, as the Romans had carried it off and <lb/>
            erected it there. And there are traces of some inscriptions <lb/>
            or reliefs still discernible on it.</p>
          <p>Neanthes, of Cyzicus, who also wrote about the Pythago- <lb/>
            reans, says, that when Meton was dead, the seeds of tyrannical <lb/>
             <pb n="367"/>
            power began to appear; and that then Empedocles persuaded <lb/>
            the Agrigentines to desist from their factious disputes, and to <lb/>
            establish political equality. And besides, as there were many <lb/>
            of the female citizens destitute of dowry, he portioned them <lb/>
            out of his own private fortune. And relying on these actions <lb/>
            of his, he assumed a purple robe and wore a golden circlet on <lb/>
            his hand, as Phavorinus relates in the first book of his Com- <lb/>
            mentaries. He also wore slippers with brazen soles, and a <lb/>
            Delphian garland. His hair was let grow very long, and he <lb/>
            had boys to follow him ; and he himself always preserved a <lb/>
            solemn countenance, and a uniformly grave deportment. And <lb/>
            he marched about in such style, that he seemed to all the <lb/>
            citizens, who met him and who admired his deportment, to <lb/>
            exhibit a sort of likeness to kingly power. And afterwards, it <lb/>
            happened that as on the occasion of some festival he was going <lb/>
            -in a chariot to Messene, he was upset and broke his thigh ; <lb/>
            and he was taken ill in consequence, and so died, at the age <lb/>
            of seventy-seven. And his tomb is in Megara.</p>
          <p>But as to his age, Aristotle differs from this account of <lb/>
            Neanthes ; for he asserts that he died at sixty years of age ; <lb/>
            others again say, that lie was a hundred and nine when he <lb/>
            died. He flourished about the eighty-fourth olympiad. Deme- <lb/>
            trius, of Træzen, in his book against the Sophists, reports that, <lb/>
            as the lines of Homer say :— <lb/>
            He now, self-murdered, from a beam depends, <lb/>
            And his mad soul to blackest hell descends.*</p>
          <p>But in the letter of Telauges, which has been mentioned before, <lb/>
            it is said that he slipped down through old age, and fell into <lb/>
            the sea, and so died.</p>
          <p>And this is enough to say about his death.</p>
          <p>There is also a jesting epigram of ours upon him, in our <lb/>
            collection of Poems in all Metres, which runs thus:- <lb/>
            You too, Empedocles, essayed to purge <lb/>
            Your body in the rapid flames, and drank <lb/>
            The liquid fire from the restless crater; <lb/>
            I say not that you threw yourself at once <lb/>
            Into the stream of Ætna's fiery flood. <lb/>
            But seeking to conceal yourself you fell, <lb/>
            And so you met with unintended death. <note type="footnote"> * This is slightly parodied from Homer. Od.xi. 278. Pope's <lb/>
            Version, 337. </note></p><pb n="368"/>
            
          <p>And another :- <lb/>
            'Tis said the wise Empedocles did fall <lb/>
            Out of his chariot, and so broke his thigh: <lb/>
            But if he leapt into the flames of Ætna, <lb/>
            How could his tomb be shown in Megara ?</p>
          <p>XII. The following were some of his doctrines. He used <lb/>
            to assert that there were four elements, fire, water, earth, and <lb/>
            air. And that that is friendship by which they are united, <lb/>
            and discord by which they are separated. And he speaks thus <lb/>
            on this subject:- <lb/>
            Bright Jove, life-giving Juno, Pluto dark, <lb/>
            And Nestis, who fills mortal eyes with tears.</p>
          <p>Meaning by Jove fire, by Juno the earth, by Pluto the air, <lb/>
            and by Nestis water. And these things, says he, never cease <lb/>
            alternating with one another; inasmuch as this arrangement is <lb/>
            perpetual. Accordingly, he says subsequently :— <lb/>
            Sometimes in friendship bound they coalesce, <lb/>
            Sometimes they're parted by fell discord's hate.</p>
          <p>And he asserts that the sun is a vast assemblage of fire, and <lb/>
            that it is larger than the moon. And the moon is disk-shaped ; <lb/>
            and that the heaven itself is like crystal ; and that the soul <lb/>
            inhabits every kind of form of animals and plants. Accord- <lb/>
            ingly, he thus expresses himself.</p>
          <p>For once I was a boy, and once a girl. <lb/>
            A bush, a bird, a fish who swims the sea,</p>
          <p>XIII. His writings on Natural Philosophy and his Purifi- <lb/>
            cations extend to five thousand verses ; and his Medical <lb/>
            Poem to six hundred ; and his Tragedies we have spoken of <lb/>
            previously.</p>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF EPICHARMUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. EPICHARMUS was a native of Cos, the son of Helothales; : <lb/>
            he also was a pupil of Pythagoras. When he was three months <lb/>
            old he was brought to Megara, in Sicily, and from thence he <lb/>
            came to Syracuse, as he himself tells us in his writings. And <lb/>
            on his statue there is the following inscription.</p><pb n="369"/>
            
          <p>As the bright sun excels the other stars, <lb/>
            As the sea far exceeds the river streams : <lb/>
            So does sage Epicharmus men surpass, <lb/>
            Whom hospitable Syracuse has crowned.</p>
          <p>If. He has left behind him Commentaries in which he <lb/>
            treats of natural philosophy, and delivers apophthegms, and <lb/>
            discusses medicine. He has also added brief notes to many <lb/>
            of his commentaries, in which he declares plainly that he is <lb/>
            the author of the works.</p>
          <p>III. He died at the age of ninety years.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF ARCHYTAS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. ARCHYTAS was a native of Tarentum, and the son of <lb/>
            Innesagoras ; or, as Aristoxenus relates, of Histiæus.</p>
          <p>II. He also was a Pythagorean ; and he it was who saved <lb/>
            Plato's life by means of a letter, when he was in danger of <lb/>
            being put to death by Dionysius.</p>
          <p>III. He was a man held in very general esteem on account <lb/>
            of his universal virtue; and he was seven times appointed <lb/>
            general of his countrymen, when no one else had ever held <lb/>
            the office for more than one year, as the law forbade it to be <lb/>
            held for a longer period.</p>
          <p>IV. Plato wrote his letters to him; as he had begun the <lb/>
            correspondence by writing himself to Plato, which he did in <lb/>
            the following manner :—</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">ARCHYTAS TO I PLATO, GREETING.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>" I am very glad that you have recovered from your delicate <lb/>
            state of health; for you yourself have sent me word of your <lb/>
            recovery, and Lamiscus gives the same account. I have been <lb/>
            much occupied with some commentaries, and have been among <lb/>
            the Lucanians, and have met with the descendants of Orellus. <lb/>
            I have now in my possession, and I send to you the treatises <lb/>
            on Law, and Kingly Power, and Piety, and the Creation of <lb/>
            the Universe. As for the rest, I have not been able to- find <lb/>
            them, but whenever I do find any, I will send them to you." <note type="footnote"> B B </note></p><pb n="370"/>
            
          <p>Thus wrote Archytas. And Plato sent him an answer in <lb/>
            the following terms :—</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">PLATO TO ARCHYTAS, GREETING.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>" I was exceedingly glad to receive the Commentaries which <lb/>
            came from you, and I have admired their author in the greatest <lb/>
            possible degree; and he seems to us to be a man worthy of his <lb/>
            ancient ancestors. For they are said to have been originally <lb/>
            natives of Myra ; and to have been among the Trojans, whom <lb/>
            Laomedon took with him, gallant men, as the story handed <lb/>
            down by tradition attests. As for my Commentaries which <lb/>
            you ask me for, they are not yet completed, but, such as they <lb/>
            are I send them to you. And on the propriety of taking care <lb/>
            of such things we are both agreed, so that I have no need to <lb/>
            impress anything on you on that head. Farewell."</p>
          <p>These then are the letters which these philososophers wrote <lb/>
            to one another.</p>
          <p>V. There were four people of the name of Archytas. The <lb/>
            first, this man of whom we are speaking. The second was a <lb/>
            Mytilenean, a musician. The third wrote a treatise on Agri- <lb/>
            culture. The fourth was an epigrammatic poet. Some writers <lb/>
            also make mention of a fifth, who was an architect; and there <lb/>
            is a book on mechanics extant which is attributed to him ; <lb/>
            which begins in this way :—</p>
          <p>" This is what I heard from Teucer, the Carthaginian."</p>
          <p>And concerning the musician, the following story is told : <lb/>
            That once he was reproached for not making himself heard, <lb/>
            and he replied, “My organ contends on my behalf, and <lb/>
            speaks."</p>
          <p>VI. Aristoxenus says, that this Pythagorean was never <lb/>
            once defeated while acting as general. But that as he was <lb/>
            attacked by envy, he once gave up his command, and his army <lb/>
            was immediately taken prisoner.</p>
          <p>VII. He was the first person who applied mathematical <lb/>
            principles to mechanics, and reduced them to a system; and <lb/>
            the first also who gave a methodical impulse to descriptive <lb/>
            geometry in seeking, in the sections of a demicylinder for a <lb/>
            proportional mean, which should enable him to find the double <lb/>
            of a given cube. He was also the first person who ever gave <lb/>
            the geometrical measure of a cube, as Plato mentions in his <lb/>
            Republic.</p><pb n="371"/>
            
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF ALCMÆON.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. ALCMÆON was a citizen of Crotona ; he also was a pupil <lb/>
            of Pythagoras. And the chief part of his writings are on <lb/>
            medical subjects ; but he also at times discusses points of <lb/>
            natural philosophy, and asserts that the greater part of human <lb/>
            affairs have two sides. He appears to have been the first <lb/>
            person who wrote a treatise on Natural Philosophy, as Phavo- <lb/>
            rinus affirms, in his Universal History; and he used to argue <lb/>
            that the moon had the same nature for ever which she had at <lb/>
            that moment.</p>
          <p>II. He was the son of Pirithus, as he himself states at the <lb/>
            beginning of his treatise, where he says, " Alcmaeon, of Cro- <lb/>
            tona, the son of Pirithus, says this to Brontinus, and Leon, <lb/>
            and Bathyllus. About things invisible, and things mortal, <lb/>
            the Gods alone have a certain knowledge ; but men may form <lb/>
            conjectures....” And so on.</p>
          <p>He used also to say that the soul was immortal, and that <lb/>
            it was In a state of perpetual motion in the same way as the <lb/>
            sun.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF HIPPASUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. HIPPASUS was a citizen of Metapontum, and a pupil of <lb/>
            Pythagoras.</p>
          <p>II. He used to say that the time of the changes of the <lb/>
            world was definite, and that the universe also was finite, and <lb/>
            in a state of perpetual motion.</p>
          <p>III. Demetrius, in his treatise on People of the same Name, <lb/>
            says that he left no writings behind him.</p>
          <p>IV. There were two people of the name of Hippasus ; this <lb/>
            man, and another who wrote an account of the Constitution of <lb/>
            the Lacedæmonians, in five books. And he was himself a <lb/>
            Lacedæmonian. <note type="footnote"> B B 2 </note></p><pb n="372"/>
            
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF PHILOLAUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. PHILOLAUS was a native of Crotona, and a pupil of <lb/>
            Pythagoras, it was from him that Plato wrote to Dion to take <lb/>
            care and purchase the books of Pythagoras.</p>
          <p>II. And he died under suspicion of having designed to <lb/>
            seize on the tyranny; and we have written an epigram on <lb/>
            him:— <lb/>
            I say that all men ought above all things <lb/>
            To guard against suspicion. For, though innocent, <lb/>
            Still if you are suspected, you're unfortunate. <lb/>
            And thus his native city of Crotona <lb/>
            Slew Philolaus; for the jealous citizens <lb/>
            Thought that his house betrayed a tyrant's purpose.</p>
          <p>III. His theory was, that everything was produced by <lb/>
            harmony and necessity. And he was the first person who <lb/>
            affirmed that the earth moved in a circle; though some <lb/>
            attribute the assertion of this principle to Icetas of Syracuse.</p>
          <p>IV. He wrote one book, which Hermippus reports, on the <lb/>
            authority of some unknown writer, that Plato the philosopher <lb/>
            purchased when he was in Sicily (having come thither to the <lb/>
            court of Dionysius), of the relations of Philolaus, for forty <lb/>
            Alexandrian minæ of silver; and that from this book he <lb/>
            copied his Timæus. But others say that Plato received it as a <lb/>
            present, after having obtained his liberty for a young man, <lb/>
            one of the disciples of Philolaus, who had been arrested <lb/>
            by Dionysius. Demetrius, in his treatise on people of the <lb/>
            same name, says that he was the first of the Pythagoreans <lb/>
            who wrote a treatise on Natural Philosophy; and it begins <lb/>
            thus :—</p>
          <p>" But nature in the world has been composed of bodies <lb/>
            infinite and finite, and so is the whole world and all that is <lb/>
            in it."</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF EUDOXUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. EUDOXUS was the son of Æschines, and a native of <lb/>
            Cnidos. He was an astronomer, a geometrician, a physician, <lb/>
             <pb n="373"/>
            and a lawgiver. In geometry he was a pupil of Archytas, <lb/>
            and in medicine of Philistion, the Sicilian, as Callimachus <lb/>
            relates in his Tablets ; and Sotion, in his Successions, asserts <lb/>
            that he was likewise a pupil of Plato ; for that, when he was <lb/>
            twenty-three years of age, and in very narrow circumstances, <lb/>
            he came to Athens with Theomedon the physician, by whom <lb/>
            he was chiefly supported, being attracted by the reputation of <lb/>
            the Socratic school. Some say that his attachment to Theo- <lb/>
            medon was cemented by nearer ties. And when he had arrived <lb/>
            at Piræus, he went up to the city every day, and when he had <lb/>
            heard the Sophists lecture he returned. And having spent two <lb/>
            , months there, he returned home again ; and being again aided <lb/>
            by the contributions of his friends, he set sail for Egypt, with <lb/>
            Chrysippus the physician, bearing letters of introduction from <lb/>
            Agesilaus to Nectanabis, and that he recommended him to the <lb/>
            priests.</p>
          <p>II. And having remained there a year and four months, <lb/>
            he shaved his eyebrows after the manner of the Egyptian <lb/>
            priests, and composed, as it is said, the treatise called the <lb/>
            Octacteris. From thence he went to Cyzicus, and to the <lb/>
            Propontis, in both of which places he lived as a Sophist; <lb/>
            he also went to the court of Mansolus. And then, in this <lb/>
            manner, he returned again to Athens, having a great many <lb/>
            disciples with him, for the sake, as some say, of annoying <lb/>
            Plato, because he had originally discarded him from his <lb/>
            school. Some say, that when Plato gave an entertainment on <lb/>
            one occasion, Eudoxus, as the guests were very numerous, <lb/>
            introduced the fashion of sitting in a semicircle.</p>
          <p>Nichomachus, the son of Aristotle, affirms that he used to <lb/>
            say, that pleasure was the good.</p>
          <p>III. He was received in his own country with great <lb/>
            honours, as the decree that was passed respecting him shows. <lb/>
            He was also accounted very illustrious among the Greeks, <lb/>
            having given laws to his own fellow citizens, as Hermippus <lb/>
            tells us in the fourth book of his account of the Seven Wise <lb/>
            Men; and having also written treatises on Astronomy and <lb/>
            Geometry, and several other considerable works.</p>
          <p>He had three daughters, Actis, Philtis, and Delphis. And <lb/>
            Eratosthenes asserts, in his books addressed to Baton, that he <lb/>
            also composed dialogues entitled Dialogues of Dogs; others <lb/>
            say that these were written by some Egyptians, in their own <lb/>
             <pb n="374"/>
            language, and that Eudoxus translated them, and published <lb/>
            them in Greece. One of his pupils was Chrysippus, of <lb/>
            Cnidos, son of Erineus, who learnt of him all that he knew <lb/>
            about the Gods, and the world, and the heavenly bodies; <lb/>
            and who learnt medicine from Philistion the Sicilian. He <lb/>
            also left some very admirable Reminiscences.</p>
          <p>IV. He had a son of the name of Aristagoras, who was the <lb/>
            teacher of Chrysippus, the son of Aëthlius; be was the author <lb/>
            of a work on Remedies for the Eyes, as speculations on <lb/>
            natural philosophy had come very much under his notice.</p>
          <p>V. There were three people of the name of Eudoxus. The <lb/>
            first, this man of whom we are speaking ; the second, a <lb/>
            Rhodian, who wrote histories; the third, a Sicilist, a son of <lb/>
            Agathocles, a comic poet, who gained three victories at the <lb/>
            Dionysia in the city, and five at the Lenæa,* as Apollodorus <lb/>
            tells us in his Chronicles. We also find another, who was a phy- <lb/>
            sician of Cnidos, who is mentioned by this Eudoxus, in his <lb/>
            Circuit of the World, where he says that he used to warn peo- <lb/>
            ple to keep constantly exercising their limbs in every kind of <lb/>
            exercise, and their senses too.</p>
          <p>VI. The same author says, that the Cnidean Eudoxus <lb/>
            flourished about the hundred and third olympiad; and that be <lb/>
            was the inventor of the theory of crooked lines. And he died in <lb/>
            his fifty-third year. But when he was in Egypt with Conu- <lb/>
            pliis, of Heliopolis, Apis licked his garment; and so the <lb/>
            priests said that he would be short-lived, but very illustrious, <lb/>
            as it is reported by Phavorinus in his Commentaries. And <lb/>
            we have written an epigram on him, that runs thus : — <lb/>
            'Tis said, that while at Memphis wise Eudoxus <lb/>
            Learnt his own fate from th' holy fair-horned bull; <lb/>
            He said indeed no word, bulls do not speak; <lb/>
            Nor had kind nature e'er calf Apis gifted <lb/>
            With an articulately speaking mouth. <lb/>
            But standing on one side he lick'd his cloak, <lb/>
            Slowing by this most plainly-in brief time <lb/>
            You shall put off your life. So death came soon, <lb/>
            When he had just seen three and fifty times <lb/>
            The Pleiads rise to warn the mariners. <note type="footnote"> * There were three festivals of Bacchus at Athens at which dra- <lb/>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF HERACLITUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. HERACLITUS was the son of Blyson, or, as some say, of <lb/>
            Heraceon, and a citizen of Ephesus. He flourished about the <lb/>
            sixty-ninth olympiad.</p>
          <p>II. He was above all men of a lofty and arrogant spirit, as <lb/>
            is plain from his writings, in which he says, " Abundant <lb/>
            learning does not form the mind; for if it did, it would have <lb/>
            instructed Hesiod, and Pythagoras, and likewise Xenophanes, <lb/>
            and Hecatæus. For the only piece of real wisdom is to <lb/>
            know that idea, which by itself will govern everything on <lb/>
            every occasion. He used to say, too, that Homer deserved to <lb/>
            be expelled from the games and beaten, and Archilochus <lb/>
            likewise. He used also to say, " It is more necessary to extin- <lb/>
            guish insolence, than to put out a fire." Another of his say- <lb/>
            ings was, " The people ought to fight for the law, as for their <lb/>
            city." He also attacks the Ephesians for having banished his <lb/>
            companion Hermodorus, when he says, " The Ephesians <lb/>
            deserve to have all their youth put to death, and all those who <lb/>
            are younger still banished from their city, inasmuch as they <lb/>
            have banished Hermodorus, the best man among them, saying, <lb/>
            “ Let no one of us be pre-eminently good ; and if there be <lb/>
            any such person, let him go to another city and another <lb/>
            people."</p>
          <p>And when he was requested to make laws for them, he <lb/>
            refused, because the city was already immersed in a thoroughly <lb/>
            bad constitution. And having retired to the temple of <lb/>
            Diana with his children, he began to play at dice; and when <lb/>
            all the Ephesians flocked round him, he said, " You wretches, <lb/>
            what are you wondering at ? is it not better to do this, than <lb/>
            to meddle with public affairs in your company?"</p>
          <p>III. And at last, becoming a complete misanthrope, he used <lb/>
            to live, spending his time in walking about the mountains ; <lb/>
            feeding on grasses and plants, and in consequence of these <lb/>
             <pb n="377"/>
            habits, he was attacked by the dropsy, and so then he returned <lb/>
            to the city, and asked the physicians, in a riddle, whether they <lb/>
            were able to produce a drought after wet weather. And as <lb/>
            they did not understand him, he shut himself up in a stable <lb/>
            for oxen, and covered himself with cow-dung, hoping to cause <lb/>
            the wet to evaporate from him, by the warmth that this pro- <lb/>
            duced. And as he did himself no go good in this way, he <lb/>
            died, having lived seventy years; and we have written an <lb/>
            epigram upon him which runs thus :— <lb/>
            I've often wondered much at Heraclitus, <lb/>
            That he should chose to live so miserably, <lb/>
            And die by such a miserable fate. <lb/>
            For fell disease did master all his body, <lb/>
            With water quenching all the light of his eyes, <lb/>
            And bringing darkness o'er his mind and body.</p>
          <p>But Hermippus states, that what he asked the physicians <lb/>
            was this, whether any one could draw off the water by de- <lb/>
            pressing his intestines ? and when they answered that they <lb/>
            could not, he placed himself in the sun, and ordered his <lb/>
            servants to plaster him over with cow-dung; and being <lb/>
            stretched out in that way, on the second day he died, and was <lb/>
            buried in the market-place. But Neanthes, of Cyzicus says, <lb/>
            that as he could not tear off the cow-dung, he remained there, <lb/>
            and on account of the alteration in his appearance, he was not <lb/>
            discovered, and so was devoured by the dogs.</p>
          <p>IV. And he was a wonderful person, from his boyhood, <lb/>
            since, while he was young, he used to say that he knew <lb/>
            nothing but when he had grown up, he then used to affirm <lb/>
            that he knew everything. And he was no one's pupil, but he <lb/>
            used to say, that he himself had investigated every thing, and <lb/>
            had learned everything of himself. But Sotion relates, that <lb/>
            some people affirmed that he had been a pupil of Xenophanes. <lb/>
            And that Ariston, stated in his account of Heraclitus, that <lb/>
            he was cured of the dropsy, and died of some other disease. <lb/>
            And Hippobotus gives the same account.</p>
          <p>Y. There is a book of his extant, which is about nature <lb/>
            generally, and it is divided into three discourses; one on the <lb/>
            Universe ; one on Politics; and one on Theology. And he <lb/>
            leposited this book in the temple of Diana, as some authors <lb/>
            eport, having written it intentionally in an obscure style, in <lb/>
            order that only those who were able men might comprehend <lb/>
             <pb n="378"/>
            it, and that it might not he exposed to ridicule at the hands <lb/>
            of the common people. Timon attacks this man also, say <lb/>
            ing:— <lb/>
            Among them came that cuckoo Heraclitus <lb/>
            The enigmatical obscure reviler <lb/>
            Of all the common people.</p>
          <p>Theophrastus asserts, that it was out of melancholy that h&lt; <lb/>
            left some of his works half finished, and wrote several, ii <lb/>
            completely different styles; and Antisthenes, in his Succes <lb/>
            sions, adduces as a proof of his lofty spirit, the fact, that h&lt; <lb/>
            yielded to his brother the title and privileges of royalty.* <lb/>
            And his book had so high a reputation, that a sect arose ii <lb/>
            consequence of it, who were called after his own name <lb/>
            Heracliteans,</p>
          <p>VI. The following may be set down in a general manner as <lb/>
            his main principles: that everything is created from fire <lb/>
            and is dissolved into fire; that everything happens accord <lb/>
            ing to destiny, and that all existing things are harmonized <lb/>
            and made to agree together by opposite tendencies ; and thai <lb/>
            all things are full of souls and dæmones. He also discussec <lb/>
            all the passions which exist in the world, and used also tc <lb/>
            contend that the sun was of that precise magnitude of which <lb/>
            he appears to be. One of his sayings too was, that no one, by <lb/>
            whatever road he might travel, could ever possibly find out <lb/>
            the boundaries of the soul, so deeply hidden are the prin- <lb/>
            ciples which regulate it. He used also to call opinion the <lb/>
            sacred disease ; and to say that eye-sight was often deceived <lb/>
            Sometimes, in his writings, he expresses himself with great <lb/>
            brilliancy and clearness; so that even the most stupid man <lb/>
            may easily understand him, and receive an elevation of soul <lb/>
            from him. And his conciseness, and the dignity of his style <lb/>
            are incomparable.</p>
          <p>In particulars, his doctrines are of this kind. That fire is <lb/>
            an element, and that it is by the changes of fire that all <lb/>
            things exist; being engendered sometimes by rarity, some- <lb/>
            times by density. But he explains nothing clearly. He also <lb/>
            says, that everything is produced by contrariety, and that <lb/>
            everything flows on like a river; that the universe is finite, <note type="footnote"> * According to Strabo, the descendants of Androclus, the founder <lb/>
            of Ephesus (of which family Heraclitus came), bore the title of king, <lb/>
            and had certain prerogatives and privileges attached to the title. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="379"/>
            and that there is one world, and that that is produced from <lb/>
            ire, and that the whole world is in its turn again con- <lb/>
            ,umed by fire at certain periods, and that all this happens <lb/>
            Lccording to fate. That of the contraries, that which leads to <lb/>
            production is called war and contest, and that which leads to <lb/>
            he conflagration is called harmony and peace ; that change is <lb/>
            he road leading upward, and the road leading downward; <lb/>
            and that the whole world exists according to it.</p>
          <p>For that fire, when densified becomes liquid, and. becoming <lb/>
            oncrete, becomes also water; again, that the water when con- <lb/>
            rete is turned to earth, and that this is the road down; again, <lb/>
            hat the earth itself becomes fused, from which water is pro- <lb/>
            luced, and from that everything else is produced ; and then <lb/>
            te refers almost everything to the evaporation which takes <lb/>
            )lace from the sea; and this is the road which leads upwards. <lb/>
            Also, that there are evaporations, both from earth and sea, <lb/>
            some of which are bright and clear, and some are dark; <lb/>
            .nd that the fire is increased by the dark ones, and the mois- <lb/>
            ure by the others. But what the space which surrounds us <lb/>
            s, he does not explain. He states, however, that there are <lb/>
            essels in it, turned with their hollow part towards us; in <lb/>
            vhich all the bright evaporations are collected, and form <lb/>
            lames, which are the stars; and that the brightest of these <lb/>
            lames, and the hottest, is the light of the sun; for that all <lb/>
            he other stars are farther off from the earth; and that on <lb/>
            his account, they give less light and warmth; and that the <lb/>
            noon is nearer the earth, but does not move through a pure <lb/>
            pace; the sun, on the other hand, is situated in a transparent <lb/>
            pace, and one free from all admixture, preserving a well <lb/>
            )roportioned distance from us, on which account it gives us <lb/>
            nore light and more heat. And that the sun and moon are <lb/>
            eclipsed, when the before-mentioned vessels are turned up- <lb/>
            wards. And that the different phases of the moon take place <lb/>
            very month, as its vessel keeps gradually turning round. <lb/>
            Moreover, that day and night, and months and years, and <lb/>
            ains and winds, and things of that kind, all exist according <lb/>
            o, and are caused by, the different evaporations.</p>
          <p>For that the bright evaporation catching fire in the circle <lb/>
            )f the sun causes day, and the predominance of the opposite <lb/>
            ne causes night; and again, from the bright one the heat is <lb/>
            ncreased so as to produce summer, and from the dark one <lb/>
             <pb n="380"/>
            the cold gains strength and produces winter; and he also <lb/>
            explains the causes of the other phenomena in a correspond- <lb/>
            ing manner.</p>
          <p>But with respect to the earth, he does not explain at all <lb/>
            of what character it is, nor does he do so in the case of the <lb/>
            vessels ; and these were his main doctrines.</p>
          <p>VII. Now, what his opinion about Socrates was, and what <lb/>
            expressions he used when he met with a treatise of his which <lb/>
            Euripides brought him, according to the story told by Ariston, <lb/>
            we have detailed in our account of Socrates. Seleucus, the <lb/>
            grammarian, however, says that a man of the name of Cro- <lb/>
            ton, in his Diver, relates that it was a person of the name of <lb/>
            Crates who first brought this book into Greece ; and that he <lb/>
            said that he wanted some Delian diver who would not be <lb/>
            drowned in it. And the book is described under several <lb/>
            titles; some calling it the Muses, some a treatise on Nature; <lb/>
            but Diodotus calls it- <lb/>
            A well compacted helm to lead a man <lb/>
            Straight through the path of life.</p>
          <p>Some call it a science of morals, the arrangement of the <lb/>
            changes * of unity and of everything.</p>
          <p>VIII. They say that when he was asked why he preserved <lb/>
            silence, he said, " That you may talk."</p>
          <p>IX. Darius was very desirous to enjoy his conversation; and <lb/>
            wrote thus to him :—</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">KING DARIUS, THE SON OF IIYSTASPES, ADDRESSES HERACLITUS, OF EPHESUS, THE WISE MAN, GREETING HIM. I</title>
          </ab>
          <p>" You have written a book on Natural Philosophy, difficult <lb/>
            to understand and difficult to explain. Accordingly, if in <lb/>
            some parts it is explained literally, it seems to disclose a very <lb/>
            important theory concerning the universal world, and all that. <lb/>
            is contained in it, as they are placed in a state of most divine <lb/>
            motion. But commonly, the mind is kept in suspense, so <lb/>
            that those who have studied your work the most, are not able <lb/>
            precisely to disentangle the exact meaning of your expressions. <lb/>
            Therefore, king Darius, the son of Hystaspes wishes to enjoy <lb/>
            the benefit of hearing you discourse, and of receiving some <note type="footnote"> * There is probably some corruption in the text here. </note> <lb/>

            3regard the admirable expositions delivered by them, which <lb/>
            e, however, worthy of being seriously listened to and <lb/>
            idied; but with me you shall have every kind of distinc- <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>" All the men that exist in the world, are far removed from <lb/>
            nth and just dealings ; but they are full of evil foolishness, <lb/>
            rich leads them to insatiable covetousness and vain-glorious <lb/>
            abition. I, however, forgetting all their worthlessness, and <lb/>
            unning satiety, and who wish to avoid all envy on the part <lb/>
            my countrymen, and all appearance of arrogance, will never <lb/>
            me to Persia, since I am quite contented with a little, and <lb/>
            re as best suits my own inclination."</p>
          <p>X. This was the way in which the man behaved even to the <lb/>
            ng. And Demetrius, in his treatise on People of the same <lb/>
            ame, says that he also despised the Athenians, among whom <lb/>
            had a very high reputation. And that though he was him- <lb/>
            elf despised by the Ephesians, he nevertheless preferred his <lb/>
            vn home. Demetrius Phaleruus also mentions him in his <lb/>
            efence of Socrates.</p>
          <p>XI. There were many people who undertook. to interpret <lb/>
            s book. For Antisthenes and Heraclides, Ponticus, and <lb/>
            leanthes, and Sphærus the Stoic; and besides them Pau- <lb/>
            mias, who was surnamed Heraclitistes, and Nicomedes, and <lb/>
            dionysius, all did so. And of the grammarians, Diodotus <lb/>
            adertook the same task; and he says that the subject of the <lb/>
            3ok is not natural philosophy: but politics; and that all that <lb/>
            said in it about natural philosophy, is only by way of illus- <lb/>
            ation. And Hieronymus tells us, that a man of the name of <lb/>
            cythenus, an iambic poet, attempted to render the book into <lb/>
            erse.</p>
          <p>XII. There are many epigrams extant which were written <lb/>
            pon him, and this is one of them :— <lb/>
             <pb n="382"/>
            I who lie here am Heraclitus, spare me <lb/>
            Ye rude unlettered men : 'Twas not for you <lb/>
            That I did labour, but for wiser people. <lb/>
            One man may be to me a countless host, <lb/>
            And an unnumbered multitude be no one ; <lb/>
            And this I still say in the shades below.</p>
          <p>And there is another expressed thus :— <lb/>
            Be not too hasty, skimming o'er the book <lb/>
            Of Heraclitus ; 'tis a difficult road, <lb/>
            For mist is there, and darkness hard to pierce. <lb/>
            But if you have a guide who knows his system, <lb/>
            Then everything is clearer than the sun.</p>
          <p>XIII. There were five people of the name of Heraclitus <lb/>
            The first was this philosopher of ours. The second a lyri <lb/>
            poet, who wrote a panegyrical hymn on the Twelve Gods <lb/>
            The third was an Elegiac poet, of Halicarnassus; on whor <lb/>
            Callimachus wrote the following epigram :— <lb/>
            I heard, 0 Heraclitus, of your death, <lb/>
            And the news filled my eyes with mournful tears, <lb/>
            When I remembered all the happy hours <lb/>
            When we with talk beguiled the setting sun. <lb/>
            You now are dust; but still the honeyed voice <lb/>
            Of your sweet converse cloth and will survive; <lb/>
            Nor can fell death, which all things else destroys, <lb/>
            Lay upon that his ruthless conquering grasp.</p>
          <p>The fourth was a Lesbian, who wrote a history of Macedonia <lb/>
            The fifth was a man who blended jest with earnest ; and wil <lb/>
            having been a harp-player, abandoned that profession for <lb/>
            serio-comic style of writing.</p>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF XENOPHANES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. XENOPHANES was the son of Dexius, or, as Apollodoru <lb/>
            says, of Orthomenes. He was a citizen of Colophon ; and i <lb/>
            praised by Timon. Accordingly, he says :— <lb/>
            Xenophanes, not much a slave to vanity, <lb/>
            The wise reprover of the tricks of Homer.</p>
          <p>He, having been banished from his own country, lived <lb/>
            Zande, in Sicily, and at Cataua.</p><pb n="383"/>
            
          <p>II. And, according to the statements made by some people, <lb/>
            he was a pupil of no one ; but, as others say, he was a pupil of <lb/>
            Boton the Athenian; or, as another account again affirms, of <lb/>
            Archelaus. He was, if we may believe Sotion, a contemporary <lb/>
            of Anaxemander.</p>
          <p>III. He wrote poems in hexameter and in elegiac verse <lb/>
            and also he wrote iambics against Hesiod and Homer, <lb/>
            attacking the things said in their poems about the Gods'. <lb/>
            He also used to recite his own poems. It is said likewise, <lb/>
            that he argued against the opinions of Thales and Pythagoras, <lb/>
            and that he also attacked Epimenides. He lived to an extreme <lb/>
            old age ; as he says somewhere himself:- <lb/>
            Threescore and seven long years are fully passed, <lb/>
            Since first my doctrines spread abroad through Greece : <lb/>
            And 'twixt that time and my first view of light <lb/>
            Six lustres more must added be to them : <lb/>
            If I am right at all about my age, <lb/>
            Lacking but eight years of a century.</p>
          <p>His doctrine was, that there were four elements of existing <lb/>
            things ; and an infinite number of worlds, which were all <lb/>
            unchangeable. He thought that the clouds were produced by <lb/>
            the vapour which was borne upwards from the sun, and which <lb/>
            lifted them up into the circumambient space. That the essence <lb/>
            of God was of a spherical form, in no respect resembling man ; <lb/>
            that the universe could see, and that the universe could hear, <lb/>
            but could not breathe ; and that it was in all its parts intellect, <lb/>
            and wisdom, and eternity. He was the first person who <lb/>
            asserted that everything which is produced is perishable, and <lb/>
            that the soul is a spirit. He used also to say that the many <lb/>
            was inferior to unity. Also, that we ought to associate with <lb/>
            tyrants either as little as possible, or else as pleasantly as <lb/>
            possible.</p>
          <p>When Empedocles said to him that the wise man was <lb/>
            andiscoverable, he replied, " Very likely; for it takes a wise <lb/>
            man to discover a wise man." And Sotion says, that he was <lb/>
            the first person who asserted that everything is incomprehen- <lb/>
            sible. But he is mistaken in this.</p>
          <p>Xenophanes wrote a poem on the Founding of Colophon ; <lb/>
            and also, on the Colonisation of Elea, in Italy, consisting of <lb/>
            two thousand verses. And he flourished about the sixtieth <lb/>
            olympiad.</p><pb n="384"/>
            
          <p>IV. Demetrius Phalereus, in his treatise on Old Age, and <lb/>
            Phenætius the Stoic, in his essay on Cheerfulness, relate that <lb/>
            he buried his sons with his own hands, as Anaxagoras had also <lb/>
            done. And he seems to have been detested * by the Pythago- <lb/>
            reans, Parmeniscus, and Orestades, as Phavorinus relates in <lb/>
            the first book of his Commentaries.</p>
          <p>V. There was also another Xenophanes, a native of Lesbos, <lb/>
            and an iambic poet.</p>
          <p>These are the Promiscuous or unattached philosophers.</p>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF PARMENIDES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. PARMENIDES, the son of Pyres, and a citizen of Velia <lb/>
            was a pupil of Xenophanes. And Theophrastus, in his <lb/>
            Abridgment, says that he was also a pupil of Anaximander <lb/>
            However, though he was a pupil of Xenophanes, he was not <lb/>
            afterwards a follower of his; but he attached himself to <lb/>
            Aminias, and Diochartes the Pythagorean, as Sotion relates <lb/>
            which last was a poor but honourable and virtuous man. Anc <lb/>
            he it was whose follower he became, and after he was dead hE <lb/>
            erected a shrine, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ήρῳ̑ον</foreign>, in his honour. And so Parmenides <lb/>
            who was of a noble family and possessed of considerable <lb/>
            wealth, was induced, not by Xenophanes but by Aminias, t( <lb/>
            embrace the tranquil life of a philosopher.</p>
          <p>II. He was the first person who asserted that the earth waf <lb/>
            of a spherical form ; and that it was situated in the centre o <lb/>
            the universe. He also taught that there were two elements <lb/>
            fire and earth ; and that one of them occupies the place of thE <lb/>
            maker, the other that of the matter. He also used to teacl <lb/>
            that man was originally made out of clay ; and that they wer&lt; <lb/>
            composed of two parts, the hot and the cold ; of which, in fact <lb/>
            everything consists. Another of his doctrines was, that th&lt; <lb/>
            mind and the soul were the same thing, as we are informe( <note type="footnote"> * There is great obscurity and uncertainty of the text here. Th <lb/>
            reading translated is that of Huebner, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πεφωρα̑σθαὺ</foreign>. Some read <lb/>

            the Pythagoreans. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="385"/>
            by Theophrastus,' in his Natural Philosophy, when he enu- <lb/>
            merates the theories of nearly all the different philosophers.</p>
          <p>He also used to say that philosophy was of a twofold <lb/>
            character; one kind resting on certain truth, the other on <lb/>
            opinion. On which account he says some wheie : <lb/>
            And 'twill be needful for you well to know, <lb/>
            The fearless heart of all-convincing truth : <lb/>
            Also the opinions, though less sure, of men, <lb/>
            Which rest upon no certain evidence.</p>
          <p>III. Parmenides too philosophizes in his poems ; as Hesiod <lb/>
            and Xenophanes, and Empedocles used to. And he used to <lb/>
            say that argument was the test of truth; and that the sensa- <lb/>
            tions were not trustworthy witnesses. Accordingly, he says :— <lb/>
            Let not the common usages of men <lb/>
            Persuade your better taught experience, <lb/>
            To trust to men's unsafe deceitful sight, <lb/>
            Or treacherous ears, or random speaking tongue : <lb/>
            Reason alone will prove the truth of facts.</p>
          <p>On which account Timon says of him :— <lb/>
            The vigorous mind of wise Parmenides, <lb/>
            Who classes all the errors of the thoughts <lb/>
            Under vain phantasies.</p>
          <p>Plato inscribed one of his dialogues with his name—Parme- <lb/>
            nides, or an essay on Ideas. He flourished about the sixty- <lb/>
            ninth Olympiad. He appears to have been the first person <lb/>
            who discovered that Hesperus and Lucifer were the same star, <lb/>
            as Phavorinus records, in the fifth book of his Commentaries. <lb/>
            Some, however, attribute this discovery to Pythagoras. And <lb/>
            Callimachus asserts that the poem in which this doctrine is <lb/>
            promulgated is not his work.</p>
          <p>IV. He is said also to have given laws to his fellow- <lb/>
            citizens, as Speusippus records, in his account of the Philoso- <lb/>
            phers. He was also the first employer of the question called <lb/>
            the Achilles,. as Phavorinus assures us in his Universal <lb/>
            History.</p>
          <p>V, There was also another Parmenides, an orator, who <lb/>
            wrote a treatise on the art of Oratory. <note type="footnote"> * See the account of Zeno the Cittiæan. </note> <note type="footnote"> c c </note></p><pb n="386"/>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF MELISSUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. MELISSUS was a Samian, and the son of Ithageses. He <lb/>
            was a pupil of Parmenides; but he also had conversed with <lb/>
            Heraclitus, when he recommended him to the Ephesians, who <lb/>
            were unacquainted with him, as Hippocrates recommended <lb/>
            Democritus to the people of Abdera.</p>
          <p>IT. He was a man greatly occupied in political affairs, and <lb/>
            held in great esteem among his fellow citizens; on which <lb/>
            account he was elected admiral. And he was admired still <lb/>
            more on account of his private virtues.</p>
          <p>III. His doctrine was, that the Universe was infinite, unsus- <lb/>
            ceptible of change, immoveable, and one, being always like <lb/>
            to itself, and complete ; and that there was no such thing <lb/>
            as real motion, but that there only appeared to be such. As <lb/>
            respecting the Gods, too, he denied that there was any occa- <lb/>
            sion to give a definition of them, for that there was no certain <lb/>
            knowledge of them.</p>
          <p>IV. Apollodorus states that he flourished about the eighty- <lb/>
            fourth olympiad.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF ZENO, THE ELEATIC.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. ZENO was a native of Velia. Apollodorus, in his Chro. <lb/>
            nicles, says that he was by nature the son of Telentagoras, <lb/>
            but by adoption the son of Parmenides.</p>
          <p>II. Timon speaks thus of him and Melissus :— <lb/>
            Great is the strength, invincible the might <lb/>
            Of Zeno, skilled to argue on both sides <lb/>
            Of any question, th' universal critic; <lb/>
            And of Melissus too. They rose superior <lb/>
            To prejudice in general; only yielding <lb/>
            To very few.</p>
          <p>And Zeno had been a pupil of Parmenides, and had beer <lb/>
            on other accounts greatly attached to him.</p>
          <p>III. He was a tall man, as Plato tells us in his Parmenides <lb/>
             <pb n="387"/>
            and the same writer, in his Phædrus, calls him also the <lb/>
            Eleatic Palamedes.</p>
          <p>IV. Aristotle, in his Sophist, says that he was the inventor <lb/>
            of dialectics, as Empedocles was of rhetoric. And he was a <lb/>
            man of the greatest nobleness of spirit, both in philosophy <lb/>
            and in politics. There are also many books extant, which are <lb/>
            attributed to him, full of great learning and wisdom.</p>
          <p>V. He, wishing to put an end to the power of Nearches, <lb/>
            the tyrant (some, however, call the tyrant Diomedon), was <lb/>
            arrested, as we are informed by Heraclides, in his abridgment <lb/>
            of Satyrus. And when he was examined, as to his accom- <lb/>
            plices, and as to the arms which he was taking to Lipara, he <lb/>
            named all the friends of the tyrant as his accomplices, wishing <lb/>
            to make him feel himself alone. And then, after he had <lb/>
            mentioned some names, he said that he wished to whisper <lb/>
            something privately to the tyrant ; and when he came near <lb/>
            him he bit him, and would not leave his hold till he was <lb/>
            stabbed. And the same thing happened to Aristogiton, the <lb/>
            tyrant slayer. But Demetrius, in his treatise on People of <lb/>
            the same Name, says that it was his nose that he bit off.</p>
          <p>Moreover, Antisthenes, in his Successions, says that after <lb/>
            he had given him information against his friends, he was <lb/>
            asked by the tyrant if there was any one else. And he <lb/>
            replied, "Yes, you, the destruction of the city." And that he <lb/>
            also said to the bystanders, " I marvel at your cowardice, if <lb/>
            you submit to be slaves to the tyrant out of fear of such pains <lb/>
            as I am now enduring." And at last he bit off his tongue <lb/>
            and spit it at him ; and the citizens immediately rushed for- <lb/>
            ward, and slew the tyrant with stones. And this is the <lb/>
            account that is given by almost every one.</p>
          <p>But Hermippus says, that he was put into a mortar, and <lb/>
            pounded to death. And we ourselves have written the fol- <lb/>
            lowing epigram on him:— <lb/>
            Your noble wish, 0 Zeno, was to slay <lb/>
            A cruel tyrant, freeing Elea <lb/>
            From the harsh bonds of shameful slavery, <lb/>
            But you were disappointed; for the tyrant <lb/>
            Pounded you in a mortar. I say wrong, <lb/>
            He only crushed your body, and not you.</p>
          <p>VI. And Zeno was an excellent man in other respects: <lb/>
            and he was also a despiser of great men in an equal degree <note type="footnote"> C C 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="388"/>
            with Heraclitus; for he, too, preferred the town which was <lb/>
            formerly called Hyele, and afterwards Elea, being a colony of <lb/>
            the Phocæans, and his own native place, a poor city possessed <lb/>
            of no other importance than the knowledge of how to raise <lb/>
            virtuous citizens, to the pride of the Athenians; so that he <lb/>
            did not often visit them, but spent his life at home.</p>
          <p>VII. He, too, was the first man who asked the question <lb/>
            called Achilles,* though Phavorinus attributes its first use to <lb/>
            Parmenides, and several others.</p>
          <p>VIII. His chief doctrines were, that there were several <lb/>
            worlds, and that there was no vacuum; that the nature of <lb/>
            all things consisted of hot and cold, and dry and moist, <lb/>
            these elements interchanging their substances with one <lb/>
            another; that man was made out of the earth, and that his <lb/>
            soul was a mixture of the before-named elements in such a <lb/>
            way that no one of them predominated.</p>
          <p>IX. They say that when he was reproached, he was indig- <lb/>
            nant ; and that when some one blamed him, he replied, " If <lb/>
            when I am reproached, I am not angered, then I shall not be <lb/>
            pleased when I am praised."</p>
          <p>X. We have already said in our account of the Cittiæan, <lb/>
            that there were eight Zenos; but this one flourished about <lb/>
            the seventy-ninth olympiad.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF LEUCIPPUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. LEUCIPPUS was a native of Velia, but, as some say, of <lb/>
            Abdera; and, as others report, of Melos.</p>
          <p>II. He was a pupil of Zeno. And his principal doctrines <lb/>
            were, that all things were infinite, and were interchanged with <lb/>
            one another; and that the universe was a vacuum, and full of <lb/>
            bodies; also that the worlds were produced by bodies falling <lb/>
            into the vacuum, and becoming entangled with one another; <lb/>
            and that the nature of the stars originated in motion, accord- <lb/>
            ing to their increase ; also, that the sun is borne round in a <note type="footnote"> * See the life of Parmenides. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="389"/>
            greater circle around the moon ; that the earth is carried on <lb/>
            revolving round the centre; and that its figure resembles a <lb/>
            drum; he was the first philosopher who spoke of atoms as <lb/>
            principles.</p>
          <p>III. These are his doctrines in general; in particular de- <lb/>
            tail, they are as follow: he says that the universe is infinite, <lb/>
            as I have already mentioned; that of it, one part is a <lb/>
            plenum, and the other a vacuum. He also says that the <lb/>
            elements, and the worlds which are derived from them, are <lb/>
            infinite, and are dissolved again into them; and that the <lb/>
            worlds are produced in this manner : That many bodies, of <lb/>
            various kinds and shapes, are borne by amputation from the <lb/>
            infinite, into a vast vacuum; and then, they being collected <lb/>
            together, produce one vortex; according to which they, dash- <lb/>
            ing against one another, and whirling about in every direction, <lb/>
            are separated in such a way that like attaches itself to like.</p>
          <p>But as they are all of equal weight, when by reason of <lb/>
            their number they are no longer able to whirl about, the thin <lb/>
            ones depart into the outer vacuum, as if they bounded through, <lb/>
            and the others remain behind, and becoming entangled with <lb/>
            one another, run together, and produce a sort of spherical <lb/>
            shaped figure.</p>
          <p>This subsists as a kind of membrane; containing within <lb/>
            itself bodies of every kind ; and as these are whirled about <lb/>
            so as to revolve according to the resistence of the centre, the <lb/>
            circumambient membrane becomes thin, since bodies are without <lb/>
            ceasing, uniting according to the impulse given by the vortex; <lb/>
            and in this way the earth is produced, since these bodies which <lb/>
            have once been brought to the centre remain there.</p>
          <p>On the other side, there is produced another enveloping <lb/>
            membrane, which increases incessantly by the accretion of <lb/>
            exterior bodies; and which, as it is itself animated by a cir- <lb/>
            cular movement, drags with it, and adds to itself, everything it <lb/>
            meets with; some of these bodies thus enveloped re-unite <lb/>
            again and form compounds, which are at first moist and <lb/>
            clayey, but soon becoming dry, and being drawn on in the <lb/>
            universal movement of the circular vortex, they catch fire, <lb/>
            and constitute the substance of the stars. The orbit of the <lb/>
            sun is the most distant one; that of the moon is the nearest <lb/>
            to the earth; and between the two are the orbits of the other <lb/>
            stars.</p><pb n="390"/>
            
          <p>All the stars are set on fire by the rapidity of their own <lb/>
            motion; and the sun is set on fire by the stars; the moon has <lb/>
            only a slight quantity of fire; the sun and the moon are eclipsed <lb/>
            in ... * in consequence of the inclination of the earth <lb/>
            towards the south. In the north it always snows, and those <lb/>
            districts are cold, and are often frozen.</p>
          <p>The sun is eclipsed but seldom; but the moon frequently, <lb/>
            because her orbits are unequal.</p>
          <p>Leucippus admits also, that the production of worlds, their <lb/>
            increase, their diminution, and their destruction, depend on a <lb/>
            certain necessity, the character of which he does not precisely <lb/>
            explain.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF DEMOCRITUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. DEMOCRITUS was the son of Hegesistratus, but as some <lb/>
            say, of Athenocrites, and, according to other accounts, of <lb/>
            Damasippus. He was a native of Abdera, or, as it is stated <lb/>
            by some authors, a citizen of Miletus.</p>
          <p>II. He was a pupil of some of the Magi and Chaldæans, <lb/>
            whom Xerxes had left with his father as teachers, when he <lb/>
            had been hospitably received by him, as Herodotus informs us;t <lb/>
            and from these men he, while still a boy, learned the principles <lb/>
            of astronomy and theology. Afterwards, his father entrusted <lb/>
            him to Leucippus, and to Anaxagoras, as some authors assert, <lb/>
            who was forty years older than he. And Phavorinus, in his <lb/>
            Universal History, says that Democritus said of Anaxagoras, <lb/>
            that his opinions about the sun and moon were not his own, <lb/>
            but were old theories, and that he had stolen them. And <lb/>
            that he used also to pull to pieces his assertions about the <lb/>
            composition of the world, and about mind, as he was hostile <lb/>
            to him, because he had declined to admit him as a pupil. How <lb/>
            then can he have been a pupil of his, as some assert ? And <note type="footnote"> * There is evidently a considerable gap in the text here. </note><note type="footnote"> t As there is no such passage in Herodotus, Valchenær conjectures <lb/>
            that we ought here to read Metrodorus. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="391"/>
            Demetrius in his treatise on People of the same Name, and <lb/>
            Antisthenes in his Successions, both affirm that he travelled <lb/>
            to Egypt to see the priests there, and to learn mathematics of <lb/>
            them; and that he proceeded further to the Chaldeans, and <lb/>
            penetrated into Persia, and went as far as the Persian Gulf. <lb/>
            Some also say that he made acquaintance with the Gymnoso- <lb/>
            phists in India, and that he went to Æthiopia.</p>
          <p>III. He was one of three brothers who divided their patri- <lb/>
            mony among them; and the most common story is, that he <lb/>
            took the smaller portion, as it was in money, because he <lb/>
            required money for the purpose of travelling; though his <lb/>
            brothers suspected him of entertaining some treacherous <lb/>
            design. And Demetrius says, that his share amounted to <lb/>
            more than a hundred talents, and that he spent the whole <lb/>
            of it.</p>
          <p>IV. He also says, that he was so industrious a man, that <lb/>
            he cut off for himself a small portion of the garden which sur- <lb/>
            rounded his house, in which there was a small cottage, and shut <lb/>
            himself up in it. And on one occasion, when his father <lb/>
            brought him an ox to sacrifice, and fastened it there, he for a <lb/>
            long time did not discover it, until his father having roused <lb/>
            him, on the pretext of the sacrifice, told him what he had done <lb/>
            with the ox.</p>
          <p>V. He further asserts, that it is well known that he went <lb/>
            to Athens, and as he despised glory, he did not desire to be <lb/>
            known ; and that he became acquainted with Socrates, with- <lb/>
            out Socrates knowing who he was. " For I came," says he, <lb/>
            " to Athens, and no one knew me." " If," says Thrasylus, <lb/>
            " the Rivals; is really the work of Plato, then Democritus <lb/>
            must be the anonymous interlocutor, who is introduced in that <lb/>
            dialogue, besides Ænopides and Anaxagoras, the one I mean <lb/>
            who, in the conversation with Socrates, is arguing about phi- <lb/>
            losophy. and whom the philosopher tells, that a philosopher <lb/>
            resembles a conqueror in the Pentathlum." And he was <lb/>
            veritably a master of five branches of philosophy. For he <lb/>
            was thoroughly acquainted with physics, and ethics, and <lb/>
            mathematics, and the whole encyclic system, and indeed he <lb/>
            was thoroughly experienced and skilful in every kind of art. <lb/>
            He it was who was the author of the saying, " Speech is the <lb/>
            shadow of action." But Demetrius Phalereus, in his Defence <lb/>
            of Socrates, affirms that he never came to Athens at all. And <lb/>
             <pb n="392"/>
            that is a still stranger circumstance than any, if he despised <lb/>
            so important a city, not wishing to derive glory from the <lb/>
            place in which he was, but preferring rather himself to invest <lb/>
            the place with glory.</p>
          <p>VI. And it is evident from his writings, what sort of man <lb/>
            he was. " He seems," says Thrasylus, " to have been also an <lb/>
            admirer of the Pythagoreans." And he mentions Pythagoras <lb/>
            himself, speaking of him with admiration, in the treatise which <lb/>
            is inscribed with his name. And he appears to have derived <lb/>
            all his doctrines from him to such a degree, that one would <lb/>
            have thought that he had been his pupil, if the difference of <lb/>
            time did not prevent it. At all events, Glaucus, of Rhegium, <lb/>
            who was a contemporary of his, affirms that he was a pupil of <lb/>
            some of the Pythagorean school.</p>
          <p>And Apollodorus, of Cyzicus, says that he was intimate <lb/>
            with Philolaus; " He used to practise himself," says Antis- <lb/>
            thenes, " in testing perceptions in various manners; some- <lb/>
            times retiring into solitary places, and spending his time even <lb/>
            among tombs."</p>
          <p>VII. And he further adds, that when he returned from his <lb/>
            travels, he lived in a most humble manner; like a man who <lb/>
            had spent all his property, and that on account of his poverty, <lb/>
            be was supported by his brother Damasus. But when he had <lb/>
            foretold some future event, which happened as he had pre- <lb/>
            dicted, and had in consequence become famous, he was for all <lb/>
            the rest of his life thought worthy of almost divine honours <lb/>
            by the generality of people. And as there was a law, that a <lb/>
            man who had squandered the whole of his patrimony, should <lb/>
            not be allowed funeral rites in his country, Antisthenes says, <lb/>
            that he, being aware of this law, and not wishing to be ex- <lb/>
            posed to the calumnies of those who envied him, and would be <lb/>
            glad to accuse him, recited to the people his work called the <lb/>
            Great World," which is far superior to all his other writings, <lb/>
            and that as a reward for it he was presented with five hun- <lb/>
            dred talents ; and not only that, but he also had some brazen <lb/>
            statues erected in his honour. And when he died, he was <lb/>
            buried at the public expense ; after having attained the age of <lb/>
            more than a hundred years. But Demetrius says, that it was <lb/>
            his relations who read the Great World, and that they <lb/>
            were presented with a hundred talents only; and Hippobotus <lb/>
            coincides in this statement.</p><pb n="393"/>
            
          <p>VIII. And Aristoxenus, in his Historic Commentaries, says <lb/>
            that Plato wished to burn all the writings of Democritus that <lb/>
            he was able to collect; but that Amyclas and Cleinias, the <lb/>
            Pythagoreans, prevented him, as it would do no good; for <lb/>
            that copies of his books were already in many hands. And it <lb/>
            is plain that that was the case; for Plato, who mentions <lb/>
            nearly all the ancient philosophers, nowhere speaks of Demo- <lb/>
            critus ; not even in those passages where he has occasion to <lb/>
            contradict his theories, evidently, because he said that if he <lb/>
            did, he would be showing his disagreement with the best of <lb/>
            all philosophers ; a man whom even Timon praises in the fol- <lb/>
            lowing terms :- <lb/>
            Like that Democritus, wisest of men, <lb/>
            Sage ruler of his speech ; profound converser, <lb/>
            Whose works I love to read among the first.</p>
          <p>IX. But he was, according to the statement made by him- <lb/>
            self in the Little World, a youth when Anaxagoras was an old <lb/>
            man, being forty years younger than he was. And he says, <lb/>
            that he composed the Little World seven hundred and thirty <lb/>
            years after the capture of Troy. And he must have been <lb/>
            born, according to the account given by Apollodorus in his <lb/>
            Chronicles, in the eightieth olympiad; but, as Thrasylus says, <lb/>
            in his work entitled the Events, which took place before the <lb/>
            reading of the books of Democritus, in the third year of the <lb/>
            seventy-seventh olympiad, being, as it is there stated, one <lb/>
            year older than Socrates. He must therefore have been a <lb/>
            contemporary of Archelaus, the pupil of Anaxagoras, and of <lb/>
            Ænopides, for he makes mention of this letter. He also <lb/>
            speaks of the theories of Parmenides and Zeno, on the sub- <lb/>
            ject of the One, as they were the men of the highest reputa- <lb/>
            tion in histories, and he also speaks of Protagoras of Abdera, <lb/>
            who confessedly lived at the same time as Socrates.</p>
          <p>X. Athenodorus tells us, in the eighth book of his Conver- <lb/>
            sations, that once, when Hippocrates came to see him, he <lb/>
            ordered some milk to be brought; and that, when he saw the <lb/>
            milk, he said that it was the milk of, a black goat, with her <lb/>
            first kid; on which Hippocrates marvelled at his accurate <lb/>
            knowledge. Also, as a young girl came with Hippocrates, on <lb/>
            the first day, he saluted her thus, " Good morning, my maid ; <lb/>
             <pb n="394"/>
            but on the next day, " Good morning, woman;" for, indeed, <lb/>
            she had ceased to be a maid during the night.</p>
          <p>XI. And Hermippus relates, that Democritus died in the <lb/>
            following manner : he was exceedingly old, and appeared at <lb/>
            the point of death; and his sister was lamenting that he <lb/>
            would die during the festival of the Thesmophoria,* and so <lb/>
            prevent.her from discharging her duties to the Goddess; and <lb/>
            so he bade her be of good cheer, and desired her to bring him <lb/>
            hot loaves every day. And, by applying these to his nostrils, <lb/>
            he kept himself alive even over the festival. But when the <lb/>
            days of the festival were passed (and it lasted three days), <lb/>
            then he expired, without any pain, as Hipparchus assures us, <lb/>
            having lived a hundred and nine years. And we have <lb/>
            written an epigram upon him in our collection of poems in <lb/>
            every metre, which runs thus:- <lb/>
            What mail was e'er so wise, who ever did <lb/>
            So great a deed as this Democritus ? <lb/>
            Who kept off death, though present for three days, <lb/>
            And entertained him with hot steam of bread.</p>
          <p>Such was the life of this man.</p>
          <p>XII. Now his principal doctrines were these. That atoms <lb/>
            and the vacuum were the beginning of the universe ; and that <lb/>
            everything else existed only in opinion. That the worlds were <lb/>
            infinite, created, and perishable. But that nothing was created <lb/>
            out of nothing, and that nothing was destroyed so as to become <lb/>
            nothing. That the atoms were infinite both in magnitude <lb/>
            and number, and were borne about through the universe in <lb/>
            endless revolutions. And that thus they produced all the <lb/>
            combinations that exist; fire, water, air, and earth; for that <lb/>
            all these things are only combinations of certain atoms; which <lb/>
            combinations are incapable of being affected by external cir- <note type="footnote"> * The Thesmophoria was a festival in honour of Ceres, celebrated in <lb/>
            various parts of Greece ; and only by married women ; though girls <lb/>
            might perform some of the ceremonies. Herodotus says, that it was <lb/>
            introduced into Greece from Egypt, by the daughters of Danaus. The <lb/>
            Attic Thesmophoria lasted probably three days, and began on the <lb/>
            eleventh day of the month Pyanession; the first day was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂνοδος</foreign>, <lb/>
            or <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάθοδος</foreign>, from the women going in procession to Eleusis; the second <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">νηστεία</foreign>, or fasting; the third was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλλιγένεια</foreign>, as on that day <lb/>
            Ceres was invoked under that name, and it was the day of merriment <lb/>
            of the festival. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="395"/>
            cumstances, and are unchangeable by reason of their solidity. <lb/>
            Also, that the sun and the moon are formed by such revolutions <lb/>
            and round bodies ; and in like manner the soul is produced ; <lb/>
            and that the soul and the mind are identical : that we see by <lb/>
            the falling of visions across our sight; and that everything <lb/>
            that happens, happens of necessity. Motion, being the cause <lb/>
            of the production of everything, which he calls necessity. The <lb/>
            chief good he asserts to be cheerfulness ; which, however, he <lb/>
            does not consider the same as pleasure; as some people, who <lb/>
            have misunderstood him, have fancied that he meant; but he <lb/>
            understands by cheerfulness, a condition according to which <lb/>
            the soul lives calmly and steadily, being disturbed by no fear, <lb/>
            or superstition, or other passion. He calls this state <foreign xml:lang="grc">εύθυμία</foreign>, <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">εύεστὼ</foreign>, and several other names. Everything which is <lb/>
            made he looks upon as depending for its existence on opinion ; <lb/>
            but atoms and the vacuum he believes exist by nature. These <lb/>
            were his principal opinions.</p>
          <p>XIII. Of his books, Thrasylus has given a regular catalogue, <lb/>
            in the same way that he has arranged the works of Plato, <lb/>
            dividing them into four classes.</p>
          <p>Now these are his ethical works. The Pythagoras; a <lb/>
            treatise on the Disposition of the Wise Man; an essay on <lb/>
            those in the Shades Below ; the Tritogeneia (this is so called <lb/>
            because from Minerva three things are derived which hold <lb/>
            together all human affairs) ; a treatise on Manly Courage or <lb/>
            Valour ; the Horn of Amalthea ; an essay'on Cheerfulness ; a <lb/>
            volume of Ethical Commentaries. A treatise entitled, For <lb/>
            Cheerfulness, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐεστὼ</foreign>) is not found.</p>
          <p>These are his writings on natural philosophy. The Great <lb/>
            World (which Theophrastus asserts to be the work of Leucip- <lb/>
            pus) ; the Little World ; the Cosmography; a treatise on the <lb/>
            Planets; the first book on Nature ; two books on the Nature <lb/>
            of Man, or on Flesh; an essay on the Mind ; one on the <lb/>
            Senses (some people join these two together in one volume, <lb/>
            which they entitle, on the Soul) ; a treatise on Juices ; one on <lb/>
            Colours; one on the Different Figures ; one on the Changes <lb/>
            of Figures ; the Cratynteria (that is to say, an essay, approving <lb/>
            of what has been said in preceding ones); a treatise on <lb/>
            Phenomenon, or on Providence ; three books on Pestilences. <lb/>
            or Pestilential Evils ; a book of Difficulties. These are his <lb/>
            books on natural philosophy.</p><pb n="396"/>
            
          <p>His miscellaneous works are these. Heavenly Causes ; <lb/>
            Aerial Causes; Causes affecting Plane Surfaces: Causes <lb/>
            referring to Fire, and to what is in Fire ; Causes affecting <lb/>
            Voices; Causes affecting Seeds, and Plants, and Fruits ; three <lb/>
            books of Causes affecting Animals ; Miscellaneous Causes ; a <lb/>
            treatise on the Magnet. These are his miscellaneous works.</p>
          <p>His mathematical writings are the following. A treatise <lb/>
            on the Difference of Opinion, or on the Contact of the Circle <lb/>
            and the Sphere ; one on Geometry ; one on Numbers ; one <lb/>

            nomical Calendar; a discussion on the Clepsydra ; the Map <lb/>
            of the Heavens ; Geography ; Polography ; Artmography, or <lb/>
            a discussion on Rays of Light. These, are his mathematical <lb/>

            able Opportunities ; a treatise on Agriculture, called also <lb/>
            the Georgic; one on Painting; Tactics, and Fighting in <lb/>
            heavy Armour. These are his works on such subjects.</p>
          <p>Some authors also give a list of some separate treatises <lb/>

          <p>XIV. There were six people of the name of Democritus. <lb/>
            The first was this man of whom we are speaking; the second <lb/>
            was a musician of Chios, who lived about the same time; the <lb/>
            third was a sculptor who is mentioned by Antigonus; the <lb/>
            fourth is a man who wrote a treatise on the Temple at Ephesus, <lb/>
            and on the city of Samothrace; the fifth was an epigrammatic <lb/>
            poet, of great'perspicuity and elegance ; the sixth was a citizen <lb/>
            of Pergamus, who wrote a treatise on Oratory.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF PROTAGORAS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. PROTAGORAS was the son of Artemon, or, as Apollodorus <lb/>
            says (which account is corroborated by Demon, in his History <lb/>
            of Persia), of Mæander. He was a native of Abdera, as <lb/>
            Heraclides Ponticus tell us, in his treatise on Laws ; and the <lb/>
            same authority informs us that he made laws for the Thurians. <lb/>
            But, according to the statement of Eupolis, in his Flatterers, <lb/>
            he was a native of Teos; for he says :— <lb/>
            Within you'll find Protagoras, of Teos.</p>
          <p>He, and Prodicas of Ceos, used to levy contributions for <lb/>
            giving their lectures; and Plato, in his Protagoras, says that <lb/>
            Prodicas had a very powerful voice.</p>
          <p>II. Protagoras was a pupil of Democritus. And he was <lb/>
            surnamed Wisdom, as Phavorinus informs us in his Universal <lb/>
            History.</p>
          <p>III. He was the first person who asserted that in every <lb/>
            question there were two sides to the argument exactly opposite <lb/>
            to one another. And he used to employ them in his arguments, <lb/>
            being the first person who did so. But he began something <lb/>
            in this manner : " Man is the measure of all things : of those <lb/>
            things which exist as he is ; and of those things which do not <lb/>
            exist as he is not." And he used to say that nothing else was <lb/>
            soul except the senses, as Plato says, in the Theætetus ; and <lb/>
            that everything was true. And another of his treatises he be- <lb/>
            gins in this way: " Concerning the Gods, I am not able to know <lb/>
             <pb n="398"/>
            to a certainty whether they exist or whether they do not. For <lb/>
            there are many things which prevent one from knowing, <lb/>
            especially the obscurity of the subject, and the shortness of <lb/>
            the life of man." And on account of this beginning of his <lb/>
            treatise, he was banished by the Athenians. And they burnt <lb/>
            his books in the market-place, calling them in by the public <lb/>
            crier, and compelling all who possessed them to surrender <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>He was the first person who demanded payment of his <lb/>
            pupils; fixing his charge at a hundred minæ. He was also <lb/>
            the first person who gave a precise definition of the parts of <lb/>
            time; and who explained the value of opportunity, and who <lb/>
            instituted contests of argument, and who armed the disputants <lb/>
            with the weapon of sophism. He it was too who first left facts <lb/>
            out of consideration, and fastened his arguments on words ; and <lb/>
            who was the parent of the present superficial and futile kinds <lb/>
            of discussion. On which account Timon says of him :— <lb/>
            Protagoras, that slippery arguer, <lb/>
            In disputatious contests fully skilled.</p>
          <p>He too, it was, who first invented that sort of argument <lb/>
            which is called the Socratic, and who first employed the <lb/>
            reasonings of Antisthenes, which attempt to establish the point <lb/>
            that they cannot be contradicted ; as Plato tells us in his <lb/>
            Euthydemus. He was also the first person who practised <lb/>
            regular discussions on set subjects, as Artemidorus, the dialec. <lb/>
            tician, tells us in his treatise against Chrysippus. He was <lb/>
            also the original inventor of the porter's pad for men to carry <lb/>
            their burdens on, as we are assured by Aristotle, in his book <lb/>
            on Education ; for he himself was a porter, as Epicurus says <lb/>
            somewhere or other. And it was in this way that he became <lb/>
            highly thought of by Democritus, who saw him as he was tying <lb/>
            up some sticks.</p>
          <p>He was also the first person who divided discourse into <lb/>
            four parts ; entreaty, interrogation, answer, and injunction: <lb/>
            though some writers make the parts seven ; narration, interro- <lb/>
            gation, answer, injunction, promise, entreaty, and invocation; <lb/>
            and these he called the foundations of discourse: but Alli- <lb/>
            domas says that there are four divisions of discourse; affirma- <lb/>
            tion, denial, interrogation, and invocation.</p>
          <p>V. The first of his works that he ever read in public was <lb/>
             <pb n="399"/>
            the treatise on the Gods, the beginning of which we have <lb/>
            quoted above, and he read this at Athens in the house of <lb/>
            Euripides, or, as some say, in that of Megaclides; others say <lb/>
            that he read it in the Lyceum; his pupil, Archagoras, the sort <lb/>
            of Theodotus, giving him the aid of his voice. His accuser <lb/>
            was Pythodorus, the son of Polyzelus, one of the four hundred; <lb/>
            but Aristotle calls him Evathlus.</p>
          <p>VI. The writings of his which are still extant are these : a <lb/>
            treatise on the Art of Contention; one on Wrestling; one on <lb/>
            Mathematics; one on a Republic; one on Ambition ; one on <lb/>
            Virtues; one on the Original Condition of Man; one on those <lb/>
            in the Shades Below; one on the Things which are not done <lb/>
            properly by Men; one volume of Precepts ; one essay entitled <lb/>
            Justice in Pleading for Hire; two books of Contradictions.</p>
          <p>These are his books.</p>
          <p>Plato also addressed a dialogue to him.</p>
          <p>VII. Philochorus relates that, as he was sailing to Sicily his <lb/>
            ship was wrecked, and that this circumstance is alluded to by <lb/>
            Euripides in his Ixion; and some say that he died on his <lb/>
            journey, being about ninety years old. But Apollodorus states <lb/>
            his age at seventy years, and says that he was a sophist forty <lb/>
            years, and that he flourished about the eighty-fourth Olympiad. <lb/>
            There is an epigram upon him written by myself, in the fol- <lb/>
            lowing terms:- <lb/>
            I hear accounts of you, Protagoras, <lb/>
            That, travelling far from Athens, on the road, <lb/>
            You, an old man, and quite infirm, did die. <lb/>
            For Cecrops' city drove you forth to exile; <lb/>
            But you, though 'scaping dread Minerva's might, <lb/>
            Could not escape the outspread arms of Pluto.</p>
          <p>VIII. It is said that once, when he demanded of Evathlus <lb/>
            his pupil payment for his lessons, Evathlus said to him, " But <lb/>
            I have never been victorious in an argument;" and he rejoined, <lb/>
            " But if I gain my cause, then I should naturally receive the <lb/>
            fruits of my victory, and so would you obtain the fruits of <lb/>
            yours."</p>
          <p>IX. There was also another Protagoras, an astronomer, on <lb/>
            whom Euphorion wrote an elegy; and a third also, who was a <lb/>
            philosopher of the Stoic sect.</p><pb n="400"/>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF DIOGENES, OF APOLLONIA.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. DIOGENES was a native of Apollonia, and the son of <lb/>
            Apollothemis, a natural philosopher of high reputation; and <lb/>
            he was, as Antisthenes reports, a pupil of Anaximenes. He <lb/>
            was also a contemporary of Anaxagoras, and Demetrius Pha- <lb/>
            lereus says, in his Defence of Socrates, that he was very <lb/>
            unpopular at Athens, and even in some danger of his life.</p>
          <p>II. The following were his principal doctrines ; that the <lb/>
            air was an element; that the worlds were infinite, and that <lb/>
            the vacuum also was infinite; that the air, as it was condensed, <lb/>
            and as it was rarified, was the productive cause of the worlds ; <lb/>
            that nothing can be produced out of nothing;. and that nothing <lb/>
            can be destroyed so as to become nothing; that the earth is <lb/>
            round, firmly planted in the middle of the universe, having <lb/>
            acquired its situation from the circumvolutions of the hot prin- <lb/>
            ciple around it, and its consistency from the cold.</p>
          <p>The first words of his treatise are :—</p>
          <p>"It appears to me that he .who begins any treatise ought to <lb/>
            lay down principles about which there can be no dispute, and <lb/>
            that his exposition of them ought to be simple and dig- <lb/>
            nified."</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">LIFE OF ANAXARCHUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. ANAXARCHUS was a native of Abdera. He was a pupil of <lb/>
            Diogenes, of Smyrna; but, as some say, of Metrodorus, of <lb/>
            Chios ; who said that he was not even sure that he knew <lb/>
            nothing; and Metrodbrus was a pupil of Nessus, of Chios ; <lb/>
            though others assert that he was a disciple of Democritus.</p>
          <p>II. Anaxarchus too enjoyed the intimacy of Alexander, and <lb/>
            flourished about the hundred and tenth olympiad, He had <lb/>
            for an enemy Nicocreon, the tyrant of Cyprus. And on one <lb/>
            occasion, when Alexander, at a banquet, asked him what he <note type="footnote"> * This is thus embodied by Lucretius :— <lb/>
            Nam nihil e nihilo, in nihilum nil posse reverti. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="401"/>
            thought of the entertainment, he is said to have replied, " 0 <lb/>
            king, everything is provided very sumptuously; and the only <lb/>
            thing wanting is to have the head of some satrap served up ;" <lb/>
            hinting at Nicocreon. And Nicocreon did not forget his <lb/>
            grudge against him for this ; but after the death of the king, <lb/>
            when Anaxarchus, who was making a voyage, was driven <lb/>
            against his will into Cyprus, he took him and put him in a <lb/>
            mortar, and commanded him to be pounded to death with iron <lb/>
            pestles. And then they say that he, disregarding this punish- <lb/>
            ment, uttered that celebrated saying, " Beat the bag of Anax- <lb/>
            archus, but you will not beat Anaxarchus himself." And then, <lb/>
            when Nicocreon commanded that his tongue should be cut out; <lb/>
            it is said that he bit it off, and spit it at him. And we have <lb/>
            'written an epigram upon him in the following terms :— <lb/>
            Beat more and more; you're beating but a bag ; <lb/>
            Beat, Anaxarchus is in heav'n with Jove. <lb/>
            Hereafter Proserpine will rack your bones, <lb/>
            And say, Thus perish, you accursed beater.</p>
          <p>III. Anaxarchus, on account of the evenness of his temper <lb/>
            and the tranquillity of his life, was called the Happy. And he <lb/>
            was a man to whom it was very easy to reprove men and bring <lb/>
            them to temperance. Accordingly, he produced an alteration <lb/>
            in Alexander who thought himself a God, for when he saw the <lb/>
            blood flowing from some wound that he had received, he <lb/>
            pointed to him with his finger, and said, " This is blood, and <lb/>
            not:- <lb/>
            " Such stream as issues from a wounded God; <lb/>
            Pure emanation, uncorrupted flood, <lb/>
            Unlike our gross, diseas'd, terrestrial blood."*</p>
          <p>But Plutarch says that it was Alexander himself who quoted <lb/>
            these lines to his friends.</p>
          <p>They also tell a story that Anaxarchus once drank to him, <lb/>
            and then showed the goblet, and said:- <lb/>
            Shall any mortal hand dare wound a God ? <note type="footnote"> It Horn. Il. v. 340. Pope's version, 422. </note> <note type="footnote"> D D </note></p><pb n="402"/>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF PYRRHO.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. PYRRHO was a citizen of Elis, and the son of Pleistarchus, <lb/>
            as Diodes informs us, and, as Apollodorus in his Chronicles <lb/>
            asserts, he was originally a painter.</p>
          <p>II. And he was a pupil of Bryson, the son'of Stilpon, as we <lb/>
            are told by Alexander in his Chronicles. After that he attached <lb/>
            himself to Anaxarchus, and attended him everywhere; so that <lb/>
            he even went as far as the Gymnosophists, in India, and the <lb/>
            Magi.</p>
          <p>III. Owing to which circumstance, he seems to have taken <lb/>
            a noble line in philosophy, introducing the doctrine of incom- <lb/>
            prehensibility, and of the necessity of suspending one's judg- <lb/>
            ment, as we learn from Ascanius, of Abdera. For he used to <lb/>
            say that nothing was honourable, or disgraceful, or just, or <lb/>
            unjust. And on the same principle he asserted that there <lb/>
            was no such thing as downright truth ; but that men did <lb/>
            everything in consequence of custom and law. For that <lb/>
            nothing was any more this than that. And his life corre- <lb/>
            sponded to his principles ; for he never shunned anything, and <lb/>
            never guarded against anything; encountering everything, <lb/>
            even waggons for instance, and precipices, and dogs, and every- <lb/>
            thing of that sort; committing nothing whatever to his senses. <lb/>
            So that he used to be saved, as Antigonus the Carystian tells <lb/>
            us, by his friends who accompanied him. And Ænesidemus <lb/>
            says that he studied philosophy on the principle of suspending <lb/>
            his judgment on all points, without however, on any occasion <lb/>
            acting in an imprudent manner, or doing anything without <lb/>
            due consideration. And he lived to nearly ninety years of <lb/>
            age.</p>
          <p>IV. And Antigonus, of Carystus, in his account of Pyrrho, <lb/>
            mentions the following circumstances respecting him ; that he <lb/>
            was originally a person of no reputation, but a poor man, and <lb/>
            a painter ; and that a picture of some camp-bearers, of very <lb/>
            moderate execution, was preserved in the Gymnasium at Elis, <lb/>
            which was his work ; and that he used to walk out into the <lb/>
            fields and seek solitary places, very rarely appearing to his <lb/>
            family at home ; and that he did this in consequence of <lb/>
            having heard some Indian reproaching Anaxarchus for never <lb/>
             <pb n="403"/>
            teaching any one else any good, but for devoting all his time to <lb/>
            paying court to princes in palaces. He relates of him too, <lb/>
            that he always maintained the same demeanour, so that if any <lb/>
            one left him in the middle of his delivery of a discourse, he <lb/>
            remained and continued what he was saying ; although, when <lb/>
            a young man, he was of a very excitable temperament. Often <lb/>
            too, says Antigonus, he would go away for a time, without <lb/>
            telling any one beforehand, and taking any chance persons <lb/>
            whom he chose for his companions. And once, when Anax- <lb/>
            archus had fallen into a pond, he passed by without assisting <lb/>
            him; and when some one blamed him for this, Anaxarchus <lb/>
            himself praised his indifference and absence of all emotion.</p>
          <p>On one occasion he was detected talking to himself, and <lb/>
            when he was asked the reason, he said that he was studying <lb/>
            how to be good. In his investigations he was never despised <lb/>
            by any one, because he always spoke explicitly and straight to <lb/>
            the question that had been put to him. On which account <lb/>
            Nausiphanes was charmed by him even when he was quite <lb/>
            young. And he used to say that he should like to be endowed <lb/>
            with the disposition of Pyrrho, without losing his own power <lb/>
            of eloquence. And he said too, that Epicurus, who admired <lb/>
            the conversation and manners of Pyrrho, was frequently asking <lb/>
            him about him.</p>
          <p>V. He was so greatly honoured by his country, that he was <lb/>
            appointed a priest; and on his account all the philosophers <lb/>
            were exempted from taxation. He had a great many imitators <lb/>
            of his impassiveness ; in reference to which Timon speaks <lb/>
            thus of him in his Python, and in his Silli :— <lb/>
            Now, you old man, you Pyrrho, how could you <lb/>
            Find an escape from all the slavish doctrines <lb/>
            And vain imaginations of the Sophists ? <lb/>
            How did you free yourself from all the bonds <lb/>
            Of sly chicane, and artful deep persuasion ? <lb/>
            How came you to neglect what sort of breeze <lb/>
            Blows round your Greece, and what's the origin <lb/>
            And end of everything ?</p>
          <p>And again, in his Images, he says :— <lb/>
            These things, my heart, 0 Pyrrho, longs to hear, <lb/>
            How you enjoy such ease of life and quiet, <lb/>
            The only man as happy as a God.</p>
          <p>And the Athenians presented him with the freedom of their <note type="footnote"> D D 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="404"/>
            city, as Diodes tells us, because he had slain Cotys, the <lb/>
            Thracian.</p>
          <p>VI. He also lived in a most blameless manner with his <lb/>
            sister, who was a midwife, as Eratosthenes relates, in his <lb/>
            treatise on Riches and Poverty; so that he himself used to <lb/>
            carry poultry, and pigs too if he could get any, into the market- <lb/>
            place and sell them. And he used to clean all the furniture <lb/>
            of the house without expressing any annoyance. And it is <lb/>
            said that he carried his indifference so far that he even washed <lb/>
            a pig. And once, when he was very angry about something <lb/>
            connected with his sister (and her name was Philista), and <lb/>
            some one took him up, he said, " The display of my indiffer- <lb/>
            ence does not depend on a woman." On another occasion, <lb/>
            when he was driven back by a dog which was attacking him, <lb/>
            he said to some one who blamed him for being discomposed, <lb/>
            " That it was a difficult thing entirely to put off humanity; <lb/>
            but that a mail ought to strive with all his power to counteract <lb/>
            circumstances with his actions if possible, and at all events <lb/>
            with his reason." They also tell a story that once, when some <lb/>
            medicines of a consuming tendency, and some cutting and <lb/>
            cautery was applied to him for some wound, that he never <lb/>
            even contracted his brow. And Timon intimates his disposi- <lb/>
            tion plainly enough in the letters which he wrote to Python. <lb/>
            Moreover, Philo. the Athenian, who was a friend of his, said <lb/>
            that he was especially fond of Democritus; and next to him <lb/>
            of Homer; whom he admired greatly, and was continually <lb/>
            saying :— <lb/>
            But as the race of falling leaves decay, <lb/>
            Such is the fate of man.*</p>
          <p>He used also, as it is said, to compare men to wasps, and <lb/>
            flies, and birds, and to quote the following lines :- <lb/>
            Die then, my friend, what boots it to deplore ? <lb/>
            The great, the good Patroclus is no more. <lb/>
            He, far thy better, was foredoom'd to die ; <lb/>
            And thou, doest thou bewail mortality ? t</p>
          <p>And so he would quote anything that bore on the uncertainty <lb/>
            and emptiness and fickleness of the affairs of man. Posi- <lb/>
            donius tells the following anecdote about him : that when some <lb/>
            people who were sailing with him were looking gloomy because <note type="footnote"> * II. vi. 146. </note><note type="footnote">† II. xxi. 106. Pope's version, 115. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="405"/>
            of a storm, he kept a calm countenance, and comforted their <lb/>
            minds, exhibiting himself on deck eating a pig, and saying <lb/>
            that it became a wise man to preserve an untroubled spirit in <lb/>
            that manner. Memenius is' the only writer who asserts that <lb/>
            he used to deliver positive dogmas.</p>
          <p>VII. He had many eminent disciples, and among them <lb/>
            Eurylochus, of whom the following defective characteristic is <lb/>
            related; for, they say, that he was once worked up to such a <lb/>
            pitch of rage that he took up a spit with the meat on it, and <lb/>
            chased the cook as far as the market-place. And once in <lb/>
            Elis he was so harassed by some people who put questions to <lb/>
            him in the middle of his discourses, that he threw down his <lb/>
            cloak and swam across the Alpheus. He was the greatest <lb/>
            possible enemy to the Sophists, as Timon tells us. But Philo, <lb/>
            on the contrary, was very fond of arguing; on which account <lb/>
            Timon speaks of him thus :— <lb/>
            Avoiding men to study all devoted, <lb/>
            He ponders with himself, and never heeds <lb/>
            The glory or disputes which harass Philo.</p>
          <p>Besides these disciples, Pyrrho also had Hecateus of Abdera. <lb/>
            and Timon the Phliasian, who wrote the Silli, and whom we <lb/>
            shall speak of hereafter; and also Nausiphanes, of Teos, who, <lb/>
            as some say, was the master of Epianus.</p>
          <p>VIII. All these men were called Pyrrhoneans from their <lb/>
            master ; and also doubters, and sceptics, and ephectics, or <lb/>
            suspenders of their judgment, and investigators, from their <lb/>
            principles. And their philosophy was called investigatory, <lb/>
            from their investigating or seeking the truth on all sides; and <lb/>
            sceptical from their being always doubting (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σϰέπτομαι</foreign>), and <lb/>
            never finding; and ephectic, from the disposition which they <lb/>
            encouraged after investigation, I mean the suspending of their <lb/>
            judgment (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐποχὴ</foreign>) ; and doubting, because they asserted that the <lb/>
            dogmatic philosophers only doubted, and that they did the <lb/>
            same. [And they were called Pyrrhoneans from Pyrrho him- <lb/>
            self.]</p>
          <p>But Theodosius, in his Chapters on Scepticism, contends, <lb/>
            that we ought not to call the Pyrrhonean school sceptical; <lb/>
            for since, says he, the motion and agitation of the mind in <lb/>
            each individual is incomprehensible to others, we are unable to <lb/>
            know what was the disposition of Pyrrho; and if we do not <lb/>
             <pb n="406"/>
            know it we ought not to be called Pyrrhoneans. He also <lb/>
            adds that Pyrrho was not the original inventor of Scepticism, <lb/>
            and that he had no particular dogma of any kind; and that, <lb/>
            consequently, it can only be called Pyrrhonism from some <lb/>
            similarity. Some say that Homer was the original founder of <lb/>
            this school; since he at different times gives different accounts <lb/>
            of the same circumstance, as much as any one else ever did; <lb/>
            and since he never dogmatizes definitively respecting affirma- <lb/>
            tion; they also say that the maxims of the seven wise men <lb/>
            were sceptical; such as that, " Seek nothing in excess," and <lb/>
            that, "Suretyship is near calamity;" which shows that calamity <lb/>
            follows a man who has given positive and certain surety; they <lb/>
            also argue that Archilochus and Euripides were Sceptics; and <lb/>
            Archilochus speaks thus :— <lb/>
            And now, 0 Glaucus, son of Leptines, <lb/>
            Such is the mind of mortal man, which changes <lb/>
            With every day that Jupiter doth send.</p>
          <p>And Euripides says :— <lb/>
            Why then do men assert that wretched mortals <lb/>
            Are with true wisdom gifted ; for on you <lb/>
            We all depend; and we do everything <lb/>
            Which pleases you.</p>
          <p>Moreover, Xenophanes, and Zeno the Eleatic, and Democritus <lb/>
            were also Sceptics; of whom Xenophanes speaks thus:- <lb/>
            And no man knows distinctly anything, <lb/>
            And no man ever will.</p>
          <p>And Zeno endeavours to put an end to the doctrine of motion by <lb/>
            saying: " The object moved does not move either in the place in <lb/>
            which it is, or in that in which it is not." Democritus, too, discards <lb/>
            the qualities, where he says : what is cold is cold in opinion, <lb/>
            and what is hot is hot in opinion; but atoms and the vacuum <lb/>
            exist in reality. And again he says: " But we know nothing <lb/>
            really; for truth lies in the bottom." Plato, too, following <lb/>
            them, attributes the knowledge of the truth to the Gods and <lb/>
            to the sons of the Gods, and leaves men only the investigation <lb/>
            of probability. And Euripides says :— <lb/>
            Who now can tell whether to live may not <lb/>
            Be properly to die. And whether that <lb/>
            Which men do call to die, may not in truth <lb/>
            Be but the entrance into real life ?</p><pb n="407"/>
            
          <p>And Empedocles speaks thus :— <lb/>
            These things are not perceptible to sight, <lb/>
            Nor to the ears, nor comprehensible <lb/>
            To human intellect.</p>
          <p>And in a preceding passage he says :— <lb/>
            Believing nothing, but such circumstances <lb/>
            As have befallen each.</p>
          <p>Heraclitus, too, says, "Let us not form conjectures at <lb/>
            random, about things of the greatest importance." And Hip- <lb/>
            pocrates delivers his opinion in a very doubtful manner, such <lb/>
            as becomes a man ; and before them all Homer has said :- <lb/>
            Long in the field of words we may contend, <lb/>
            Reproach is infinite and knows no end.</p>
          <p>And immediately after :— <lb/>
            Armed, or with truth or falsehood, right or wrong. <lb/>
            (So voluble a weapon is the tongue), <lb/>
            Wounded we wound, and neither side can fail, <lb/>
            For every man has equal strength to rail :*</p>
          <p>Intimating the equal vigour and antethetical force of words. And <lb/>
            the Sceptics persevered in overthrowing all the dogmas of every <lb/>
            sect, while they themselves asserted nothing dogmatically; <lb/>
            and contented themselves with expressing the opinions of <lb/>
            others, without affirming anything themselves, not even that <lb/>
            they did affirm nothing; so that even discarded all positive <lb/>
            denial; for to say, "We affirm nothing," was to affirm some- <lb/>
            thing. " But we," said they, " enunciate the doctrines of others, <lb/>
            to prove our own perfect indifference ; it is just as if we were <lb/>
            to express the same thing by a simple sign." So these words, <lb/>
            " We affirm nothing," indicate the absence of all affirmation, <lb/>
            just as other propositions, such as, " Not more one thing than <lb/>
            another," or, " Every reason has a corresponding reason <lb/>
            opposed to it," and all such maxims indicate a similar idea. <lb/>
            But the phrase, " Not more one thing," &amp;c., has sometimes an <lb/>
            affirmative sense, indicating the equality of certain things, as <lb/>
            for instance, in this sentence, " A pirate is not worse than a <lb/>
            liar." But by the sceptics this is said not positively, but <lb/>
            negatively, as for instance, where the speaker contests a point <note type="footnote"> * Homer, IL xx. 248. Pope's version, 294. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="408"/>
            and says, "It was not Scylla, any more than it was Chimæra." <lb/>
            And the word " more," itself, is sometimes used to indicate a <lb/>
            comparison, as when we say, " That honey is more sweet than <lb/>
            grapes." And at other times it is used positively, and at the <lb/>
            same time negatively, as when we say, " Virtue profits us more <lb/>
            than hurts us;" for in this phrase we intimate that virtue does <lb/>
            profit, and does not hurt us. But the Sceptics abolish the <lb/>
            whole expression, "Not more than it;" saying, that "Pru- <lb/>
            dence has not existence, any more than it has no existence." <lb/>
            Accordingly, then, expression, as Timon says in his Python, <lb/>
            indicates nothing more than an absence of all affirmation, or <lb/>
            of all assent of the judgment.</p>
          <p>Also the expression, " Every reason has a corresponding <lb/>
            reason," &amp;c., does in the same manner indicate the suspension <lb/>
            of the judgment; for if, while the facts are different, the <lb/>
            expressions are equipollent, it follows that a man must be <lb/>
            quite ignorant of the real truth.</p>
          <p>Besides this, to this assertion there is a contrary assertion <lb/>
            opposed, which, after having destroyed all others, turns <lb/>
            itself against itself, and destroys itself, resembling, as <lb/>
            it were, those cathartic medicines which, after they have <lb/>
            cleansed the stomach, then discharge themselves, and are got <lb/>
            rid of. And so the dogmatic philosophers say, that all these <lb/>
            reasonings are so far from overturning the authority of reason <lb/>
            that they confirm it. To this the Sceptics reply, that they <lb/>
            only employ reason as an instrument, because it is impossible <lb/>
            to overturn the authority of reason, without employing rea- <lb/>
            son ; just as if we assert that there is no such thing as space, <lb/>
            we must employ the word " space," but that not dogmati- <lb/>
            cally, but demonstratively; and if we assert that nothing <lb/>
            exists according to necessity, it is unavoidable that we must <lb/>
            use the word "necessity." The same principle of interpretation <lb/>
            did they adopt; for they affirmed that facts are not by nature <lb/>
            such as they appear to be, but that they only seem such ; and <lb/>
            they said, that what they doubt is not what they think, for <lb/>
            their thoughts are evident to themselves, but the reality of <lb/>
            the things which are only made known to them by their <lb/>
            sensations.</p>
          <p>The Pyrrhonean system, then, is a simple explanation of <lb/>
            appearances, or of notions of every kind, by means of which, <lb/>
            comparing one thing with another, one arrives at the con- <lb/>
             <pb n="409"/>
            elusion, that there is nothing in all these notions, but con- <lb/>
            tradiction and confusion; as Ænesidemus says in his Intro- <lb/>
            duction to Pyrrhonism. As to the contradictions which are <lb/>
            found in those speculations, when they have pointed out in <lb/>
            what way each fact is convincing, they then, by the same <lb/>
            means, take away all belief from it; for they say that we <lb/>
            regard as certain, those things which always produce similar <lb/>
            impressions on the senses, those which are the offspring of <lb/>
            habit, or which are established by the laws, and those too <lb/>
            which give pleasure or excite wonder. And they prove that <lb/>
            the reasons opposite to those on which our assent is founded <lb/>
            are entitled to equal belief.</p>
          <p>IX. The difficulties which they suggest, relating to the <lb/>
            agreement subsisting between what appears to the senses, and <lb/>
            what is comprehended by the intellect, divide themselves into, <lb/>
            ten modes of argument, according to which the subject and <lb/>
            object of our knowledge is incessantly changing. And these <lb/>
            ten modes Phyrrho lays down in the following manner.</p>
          <p>The first relates to the difference which one remarks between <lb/>
            the sentiments of animals in respect of pleasure, and pain, <lb/>
            and what is injurious, and what is advantageous ; and from <lb/>
            this we conclude, that the same objects do not always produce <lb/>
            the same impressions; and that the fact of this difference <lb/>
            ought to be a reason with us for suspending our judgment. <lb/>
            For there are some animals which are produced without any <lb/>
            sexual connexion, as those which live in the fire, and the <lb/>
            Arabian Phcenix, and worms. Others again are engendered <lb/>
            by copulation, as men and others of that kind ; and some are <lb/>
            composed in one way, and others in another; on which account <lb/>
            they also differ in their senses, as for instance, hawks are <lb/>
            very keen-sighted; dogs have a most acute scent. It is plain, <lb/>
            therefore, that the things seen produce different impressions <lb/>
            on those animals which differ in their power of sight. So, <lb/>
            too, young branches are eagerly eaten by the goat, but are <lb/>
            bitter to mankind; and hemlock is nutritious for the quail, but <lb/>
            deadly to man; and pigs eat their own dung, but a horse does <lb/>
            not.</p>
          <p>The second mode refers to the nature and idiosyncracies of <lb/>
            men. According to Demophon, the steward of Alexander <lb/>
            used to feel warm in the shade, and to shiver in the sun. <lb/>
            And Andron, the Argive, as Aristotle tells us, travelled <lb/>
             <pb n="410"/>
            through the dry parts of Libya, without once drinking. <lb/>
            Again, one man is fond of medicine, another of farming, <lb/>
            another of commerce; and the same pursuits are good for <lb/>
            one man, and injurious to another; on which account, we <lb/>
            ought to suspend our opinions.</p>
          <p>The third mode, is that which has for its object the differ- <lb/>
            ence of the organs of sense. Accordingly, an apple presents <lb/>
            itself to the sight as yellow, to the taste as sweet, to the <lb/>
            smell as fragrant; and the same form is seen, in very differ- <lb/>
            ent lights, according to the differences of mirrors. It follows, <lb/>
            therefore, that what is seen is just as likely to be something <lb/>
            else as the reality.</p>
          <p>The fourth refers to the dispositions of the subject, and the <lb/>
            changes in general to which it is liable. Such as health, <lb/>
            sickness, sleep, waking, joy, grief, youth, old age, courage, <lb/>
            fear, want, abundance, hatred, friendship, warmth, cold, easi- <lb/>
            ness of breathing, oppression of the respiratory organs, and so <lb/>
            on. The objects, therefore, appear different to us according to <lb/>
            the disposition of the moment; for, even madmen are not in a <lb/>
            state contrary to nature. For, why are we to say that of them <lb/>
            more than of ourselves ? For we too look at the sun as if it <lb/>
            stood still. Theon, of Tithora, the Stoic, used to walk about <lb/>
            in his sleep ; and a slave of Pericles' used, when in the same <lb/>
            state, to walk on the top of the house.</p>
          <p>The fifth mode is conversant with laws, and established <lb/>
            customs, and belief in mythical traditions, and the conventions <lb/>
            of art, and dogmatical opinions. This mode embraces all that <lb/>
            relates to vice, and to honesty; to the true, and to the false ; to <lb/>
            the good, and to the bad ; to the Gods, and to the production, <lb/>
            and destruction of all visible objects. Accordingly, the same <lb/>
            action is just in the case of some people, and unjust in that of <lb/>
            others. And good in the case of some, and bad in that of <lb/>
            others. On this principle we see that the Persians do not <lb/>
            think it unnatural for a man to marry his daughter; but among <lb/>
            the Greeks it is unlawful. Again, the Massagetæ, as Eudoxus <lb/>
            tells us in the first book of his Travels over the World, have <lb/>
            their women in common; but the Greeks do not. Arid the <lb/>
            Cilicians delight in piracy, but the Greeks avoid it. So again, <lb/>
            different nations worship different Gods ; and some believe in <lb/>
            the providence of God, and others do not. The Egyptians <lb/>
            embalm their dead, and then bury them; the Romans burn <lb/>
             <pb n="411"/>
            them; the Pæonians throw them into the lakes. All these <lb/>
            considerations show that we ought to suspend our judgment.</p>
          <p>The sixth mode has reference to the promiscuousness and <lb/>
            confusion of objects; according to which nothing is seen by <lb/>
            us simply and by itself; but in combination either with air, <lb/>
            or with light, or with moisture, or with solidity, or heat, or <lb/>
            cold, or motion, or evaporation or some other power. Accord- <lb/>
            ingly, purple exhibits a different hue in the sun, and in the <lb/>
            moon, and in a lamp. And our own complexions appear <lb/>
            different when seen at noonday and at sunset. And a stone <lb/>
            which one cannot lift in the air, is easily displaced in the <lb/>
            water, either because it is heavy itself and is made light by <lb/>
            the water, or because it is light in itself and is made heavy by <lb/>
            the air. So that we cannot positively know the peculiar <lb/>
            qualities of anything, just as we cannot discover oil in oint- <lb/>
            ment.</p>
          <p>The seventh mode has reference to distances, and position, <lb/>
            and space, and to the objects which are in space. In this <lb/>
            mode one establishes the fact that objects which we believe to <lb/>
            be large, sometimes appear small; that those which we believe <lb/>
            to be square, sometimes appear round ; that those which we <lb/>
            fancy even, appear full of projections ; those which we think <lb/>
            straight, seem bent; and those which we believe to be colour <lb/>
            less, appear of quite a different complexion. Accordingly, the <lb/>
            sun, on account of its distance from us, appears small. The <lb/>
            mountains too, at a distance,* appear airy masses and smooth, <lb/>
            but when beheld close, they are rough. Again, the sun has <lb/>
            one appearance at his rise, and quite a different one at midday. <lb/>
            And the same body looks very different in a wood from what <lb/>
            it does on plain ground. So too, the appearance of an object <lb/>
            changes according to its position as regards us ; for instance, <lb/>
            the neck of a dove varies as it turns. Since then, it is impos- <lb/>
            sible to view these things irrespectively of place and position, <lb/>
            it is clear that their real nature is not known.</p>
          <p>The eighth mode has respect to the magnitudes or quantities <lb/>
            of things ; or to the heat or coldness, or to the speed or slow- <note type="footnote"> * There is too remarkable a similarity in this to Campbell's lines :— <lb/>
            'Tis distance lends enchantment to the view, <lb/>
            And robes the mountains in their azure hue : <lb/>
            to allow one to pass it over without pointing it out. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="412"/>
            ness, or to the paleness or variety of colour of the subject. <lb/>
            For instance, a moderate quantity of wine when taken invigo- <lb/>
            rates, but an excessive quantity weakens. And the same is <lb/>
            the case with food, and other similar things.</p>
          <p>The ninth depends upon the frequency, or rarity, or <lb/>
            strangeness of the thing under consideration. For instance, <lb/>
            earthquakes excite no wonder among those nations with whom <lb/>
            they are of frequent occurrence ; nor does the sun, because he <lb/>
            is seen every day.</p>
          <p>The ninth mode is called by Phavorinus, the eighth, and by <lb/>
            Sextus and Ænesidemus, the tenth; and Sextus calls the <lb/>
            tenth the eighth, which Phavorinus reckons the tenth as the <lb/>
            ninth in order.</p>
          <p>The tenth mode refers to the comparison between one thing <lb/>
            and another ; as, for instance, between what is light and what <lb/>
            is heavy ; between what is strong and what is weak ; between <lb/>
            what is greater and what is less; what is above and what is <lb/>
            below. For instance, that which is on the right, is not on the <lb/>
            right intrinsically and by nature, but it is looked upon as such <lb/>
            in consequence of its relation to something else ; and if that <lb/>
            other thing be transposed, then it will no longer be on the <lb/>
            right. In the same way, a man is spoken of as a father, or <lb/>
            brother, or relation to some one else ; and day is called so in <lb/>
            relation to the sun: and everything has its distinctive name in <lb/>
            relation to human thought: therefore, those things which are <lb/>
            known in relation to others, are unknown of themselves.</p>
          <p>And these are the ten modes.</p>
          <p>X. But Agrippa adds five other modes to them. One <lb/>
            derived from the disagreement of opinions ; another from the <lb/>
            necessity of proceeding ad infinitum from one reasoning to <lb/>
            another; a third from relation ; a fourth from hypothesis ; and <lb/>
            the last from the reciprocal nature of proofs.</p>
          <p>That which refers to the disagreement of opinions, shows <lb/>
            that all the questions which philosophers propose to themselves, <lb/>
            or which people in general discuss, are full of uncertainty and <lb/>
            contradiction.</p>
          <p>That which is derived from the necessity of proceeding in- <lb/>
            cessantly from one reasoning to another, demonstrates that it <lb/>
            is impossible for a man ever, in his researches, to arrive at <lb/>
            undeniable truth; since one truth is only to be established by <lb/>
            another truth; and so on, ad infinitum.</p><pb n="413"/>
            
          <p>The mode which is derived from relation rests on the <lb/>
            doctrine that no object is ever perceived independently and <lb/>
            entirely by itself, but always in its relation to something else ; <lb/>
            so that it is impossible to know its nature correctly.</p>
          <p>That which depends on hypothesis is directed against those <lb/>
            arguers who pretend that it is necessary to accept the princi- <lb/>
            ples of things taken absolutely, and that one must place one's <lb/>
            faith in them without any examination, which is an absurdity; <lb/>
            for one may just as well lay down the opposite principles.</p>
          <p>The fifth mode, that one namely which arises from the <lb/>
            reciprocal nature of proofs, is capable of application whenever <lb/>
            the proof of the truth which we are looking for supposes, as a <lb/>
            necessary preliminary, our belief in that truth ; for instance, if, <lb/>
            after we have proved the porosity of bodies by their evapora- <lb/>
            tions, we return and prove the evaporations by the porosity.</p>
          <p>XI. These Sceptics then deny the existence of any demon- <lb/>
            stration, of any test of truth, of any signs, or causes, or motion, <lb/>
            or learning, and of anything as intrinsically or naturally good <lb/>
            or bad. For every demonstration, say they, depends either on <lb/>
            things which demonstrate themselves, or on principles which <lb/>
            are indemonstrable. If on things which demonstrate them- <lb/>
            selves, then these things themselves require demonstration; <lb/>
            and so on ad infinitum. If on principles which are indemon- <lb/>
            strable, then, the very moment that. either the sum total of <lb/>
            these principles, or even one single one of them, is incorrectly <lb/>
            urged, the whole demonstration falls instantly to pieces. But <lb/>
            if any one supposes, they add, that there are principles which <lb/>
            require no demonstration, that man deceives himself strangely, <lb/>
            not seeing that it is necessary for him in the first place to <lb/>
            establish this point, that they contain their proof in themselves. <lb/>
            For a man cannot prove that there are four elements, because <lb/>
            there are four elements.</p>
          <p>Besides, if particular proofs are denied in a complex de- <lb/>
            monstration, it must follow that the whole demonstration is <lb/>
            also incorrect. Again, if we are to know that an argument is <lb/>
            really a demonstrative proof, we must have a test of truth; <lb/>
            and in order to establish a test, we require a demonstrative <lb/>
            proof; and these two things must be devoid of every kind of <lb/>
            certainty, since they bear reciprocally the one on the other.</p>
          <p>How then is any one to arrive at certainty about obscure <lb/>
            matters, if one is ignorant even how one ought to attempt to <lb/>
             <pb n="414"/>
            prove them ? For what one is desirous to understand is not <lb/>
            what the appearance of things is, but what their nature and <lb/>
            essence is.</p>
          <p>They show, too, that the dogmatic philosophers act with <lb/>
            great simplicity ; for that the conclusions which they draw <lb/>
            from their hypothetical principles, are not scientific truths but <lb/>
            mere suppositions ; and that, in the same manner, one might <lb/>
            establish the most improbable propositions. They also say <lb/>
            that those who pretend that one ought not to judge of things <lb/>
            by the circumstances which surround them, or by their acces- <lb/>
            sories, but that one ought to take their nature itself as one'a <lb/>
            guide, do not perceive that, while they pretend to give the <lb/>
            precise measure and definition of everything, if the objects <lb/>
            present such and such an appearance, that depends solely on <lb/>
            their position and relative arrangement. They conclude from <lb/>
            thence, that it is necessary to say that everything is true, or <lb/>
            that everything is false. For if certain things only are true, <lb/>
            how is one to recognize them. Evidently it will not be the <lb/>
            senses which judge in that case of the objects of sensation, <lb/>
            for all appearances are equal to the senses; nor will it be <lb/>
            the intellect, for the same reason. But besides these two facul- <lb/>
            ties, there does not appear to be any other test or criterion at <lb/>
            all. So, say they, if we desire to arrive at any certainty with <lb/>
            respect to any object which comes under either sense or <lb/>
            intellect, we must first establish those opinions which are laid <lb/>
            down previously as bearing on those objects. For some people <lb/>
            have denied this doctrine, and others have overturned that; it <lb/>
            is therefore indispensable that they should be judged of either <lb/>
            by the senses or by the intellect. And the authority of each <lb/>
            of these faculties is contested; it is therefore impossible to <lb/>
            form a positive judgment of the operations of the senses and <lb/>
            of the intellect; and if the contest between the different <lb/>
            opinions, compels us to a neutrality, then the measure which <lb/>
            appeared proper to apply to the appreciation of all those <lb/>
            objects is at the same time put an end to, and one must fix a <lb/>
            similar valuation on everything.</p>
          <p>Perhaps our opponent will say, "Are then appearances! <lb/>
            trustworthy or deceitful ?"* We answer that, if they are i <note type="footnote"> * " Diogenes here appears (though he gives no intimation of his <lb/>
            doing so,) to be transcribing the reasonings of some one of the Sceptics." <lb/>
            French Trawl. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="415"/>
            trustworthy, the other side has nothing to object to those to <lb/>
            whom the contrary appearance presents itself. For, as he who <lb/>
            says that such and such a thing appears to him is trustworthy, <lb/>
            so also is he who says that the contrary appears to him. And <lb/>
            if appearances are deceitful, then they do not deserve any <lb/>
            confidence when they assert what appears to them to be true. <lb/>
            We are not bound then to believe that a thing is true, merely <lb/>
            because it obtains assent. For all men do not yield to the same <lb/>
            reasons; and even the same individual does not always see things <lb/>
            in the same light. Persuasion often depends on external cir <lb/>
            cumstances, on the authority of the speaker, on his ability, on <lb/>
            the elegance of his language, on habit, or even on pleasure.</p>
          <p>They also, by this train of reasoning, suppress the criterion <lb/>
            of truth. Either the criterion has been decided on, or it has <lb/>
            not. And if it has not, it does not deserve any confidence, <lb/>
            and it cannot be of any use at all in aiding us to discern truth <lb/>
            from falsehood. If, on the other hand, it has been decided on, <lb/>
            it then enters into the class of particular things which require <lb/>
            % criterion, and in that case to judge and to be judged amount <lb/>
            to the same thing; the criterion which judges is itself judged <lb/>
            of by something else, that again by a third criterion, and so <lb/>
            on ad infinitum. Add to this, say they, the fact that people <lb/>
            ire not even agreed as to the nature of the criterion of truth; <lb/>
            some say that man is the criterion, others that it is the senses <lb/>
            which are so : one set places reason in the van, another class <lb/>
            rely upon cataleptic perception.</p>
          <p>As to man himself, he disagrees both with himself and with <lb/>
            others, as the diversity of laws and customs proves. The <lb/>
            senses are deceivers, and reason disagrees with itself. Cata- <lb/>
            eptic perception is judged of by the intellect, and the intellect <lb/>
            changes in various manners; accordingly, we can never find <lb/>
            any positive criterion, and in consequence, truth itself wholly <lb/>
            ,ludes our search.</p>
          <p>They also affirm that there are no such things as signs; for <lb/>
            f there are signs, they argue they must be such as are appre- <lb/>
            lended either by the senses or by the intellect. Now, there <lb/>
            re none which are apprehended by the senses, for everything <lb/>
            vhich is apprehended by the senses is general, while a sign is <lb/>
            omething particular. Moreover, any object which is appre- <lb/>
            lended by the senses has an existence of its own, while signs <lb/>
            re only relative. Again, signs are not apprehended by the <lb/>
             <pb n="416"/>
            intellect, for in that case they would be either the visible <lb/>
            manifestation of a visible thing, or the invisible manifestation <lb/>
            of an invisible thing, or the invisible sign of a visible thing; <lb/>
            or the visible sign of an invisible thing. But none of all <lb/>
            these cases are possible ; there are therefore no such things as <lb/>
            signs at all.</p>
          <p>There is therefore no such thing as a visible sign of a visible <lb/>
            thing, for that which is visible has no need of a sign. Nor., <lb/>
            again, is there any invisible sign of an invisible thing; for <lb/>
            when anything is manifested by means of another thing, it, <lb/>
            must become visible. On the same principle there is no in- <lb/>
            visible sign of a visible object; for that which aids in the <lb/>
            perception of something else must be visible. Lastly, there <lb/>
            is no visible manifestation of an invisible thing; for as a sign <lb/>
            is something wholly relative, it must be perceived in that of <lb/>
            which it is the sign; and that is not the case. It follows, <lb/>
            therefore, that none of those things which are not visible in <lb/>
            themselves admit of being perceived ; for one considers signs <lb/>
            as things which aid in the perception of tHat which is not <lb/>
            evident by itself.</p>
          <p>They also wholly discard, and, as far as depends on them, <lb/>
            overturn the idea of any cause, by means of this same train of <lb/>
            reasoning. Cause is something relative. It is relative to that <lb/>
            of which it is the cause. But that which is relative is only <lb/>
            conceived, and has no real existence. The idea of a cause. <lb/>
            then is a pure conception ; for, inasmuch as it is a cause, it; <lb/>
            must be a cause of something ; otherwise it would be no cause <lb/>
            at all. In the same way as a father cannot be a father, unless <lb/>
            there exists some being in respect of whom one gives him the <lb/>
            title of father; so too a cause stands on the same ground. For, <lb/>
            supposing that nothing exists relatively to which a cause can <lb/>
            be spoken of; then, as there is no production, or destruction, <lb/>
            or anything of that sort, there can likewise be no cause. <lb/>
            However, let us admit that there are such things as causes. <lb/>
            In that case then, either a body must be the cause of a <lb/>
            body, or that which is incorporeal must be the cause of that <lb/>
            which is incorporeal. Now, neither of these cases is possible ; <lb/>
            therefore, there is no such thing as cause. In fact, one; <lb/>
            body cannot be the cause of another body, since both bodies <lb/>
            must have the same nature; and if it be said that one is <lb/>
            the cause, inasmuch as it is a body, then the other must <lb/>
             <pb n="417"/>
            be a cause for the same reason. And in that case one would <lb/>
            have two reciprocal causes; two agents without any passive <lb/>
            subject.</p>
          <p>Again, one incorporeal thing cannot be the cause of another <lb/>
            incorporeal thing for the same reason. Also, an incorporeal <lb/>
            thing cannot be the cause of a body, because nothing that <lb/>
            is incorporeal can produce a body. Nor, on the other hand, <lb/>
            can a body be the cause of anything incorporeal, because in <lb/>
            every production there must be some passive subject matter ; <lb/>
            but, as what is incorporeal is by its own nature protected <lb/>
            from being a passive subject, it cannot be the object of any <lb/>
            productive power. There is, therefore, no such thing as any <lb/>
            cause at all. From all which it follows, that the first prin- <lb/>
            ciples of all things have no reality; for such a principle, if <lb/>
            it did exist, must be both the agent and the efficient cause.</p>
          <p>Again, there is no such thing as motion. For whatever <lb/>
            is moved, is moved either in the place in which it is, or <lb/>
            in that in which it is not. It certainly is not moved in <lb/>
            the place in which it is, and it is impossible that it should <lb/>
            be moved in the place in which it is not; therefore, there is <lb/>
            10 such thing as motion at all.</p>
          <p>They also denied the existence of all learning. If, said <lb/>
            they, anything is taught, then either that which does exist is <lb/>
            caught in its existence or that which does not exist is taught <lb/>
            n its non-existence; but that which does exist is not taught <lb/>
            n its existence (for the nature of all existent things is visible <lb/>
            .0 all men, and is known by all men); nor is that which does <lb/>
            tot exist, taught in its non-existence, for nothing can happen <lb/>
            o that which does not exist, so that to be taught cannot <lb/>
            .appen to it.</p>
          <p>Nor again, say they, is there any such thing as production. <lb/>
            For that which is, is not produced, for it exists already ; nor <lb/>
            hat which is not, for that does not exist at all. And that <lb/>
            which has no being nor existence at all, cannot be produced.</p>
          <p>Another of their doctrines is, that there is no such thing as <lb/>
            ny natural good, or natural evil. For if there be any natural <lb/>
            ood, or natural evil, then it must be good to everyone, or evil <lb/>
            ) everyone; just as snow is cold to everyone. But there is <lb/>
            o such thing as one general good or evil which is common to <lb/>
            11 beings; therefore, there is no such thing as any natural <lb/>
            ood, or natural evil. For either one must pronounce every- <note type="footnote"> E E </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="418"/>
            thing good which is thought so by anyone whatever, or one <lb/>
            must say that it does not follow that everything which is <lb/>
            thought good is good. Now, we cannot say that everything <lb/>
            which is thought good is good, since the same thing is thought <lb/>
            good by one person (as, for instance, pleasure is thought good <lb/>
            by Epicurus) and evil by another (as it is thought evil by <lb/>
            Antisthenes) ; and on this principle the same thing will be <lb/>
            both good and evil. If, again, we assert that it does not follow <lb/>
            that everything which is thought good is good, then we must <lb/>
            distinguish between the different opinions; which it is not <lb/>
            possible to do by reason of the equality of the reasons adduced <lb/>
            in support of them. It follows that we cannot recognize any- <lb/>
            thing as good by nature.</p>
          <p>And we may also take a view of the whole of their system <lb/>
            by the writings which some of them have left behind them. <lb/>
            Pyrrho himself has left nothing; but his friends Timon, and <lb/>
            Ænesidemus, and Numenius, and Nausiphanes, and others of <lb/>
            that class have left books. And the dogmatical philosophers <lb/>
            arguing against them, say that they also adopt spurious and <lb/>
            pronounce positive dogmas. For where they think that they <lb/>
            are refuting others they are convicted, for in the very act of <lb/>
            refutation, they assert positively and dogmatize. For when <lb/>
            they say that they define nothing, and that every argument <lb/>
            has an opposite argument; they do here give a positive defi- <lb/>
            nition, and assert a possitive dogma. But they reply to these <lb/>
            objectors ; as to the things which happen to us as men, we <lb/>
            admit the truth of what you say; for we certainly do know <lb/>
            that it is day, and that we are alive; and we admit that we <lb/>
            know many other of the phenomena of life. But with respect <lb/>
            to those things as to which the dogmatic philosophers make <lb/>
            positive assertions, saying that they are comprehended, we <lb/>
            suspend our judgment on the ground of their being uncertain ; <lb/>
            and we know nothing but the passions ; for we confess that we <lb/>
            see, and we are aware that" we comprehend that such a thing <lb/>
            is the fact; but we do not know how we see, or how we com- <lb/>
            prehend. Also, we state in the way of narrative, that this <lb/>
            appears white, without asserting possitively that it really is so. <lb/>
            And with respect to the assertion, " We define nothing," and <lb/>
            other sentences of that sort, we do not pronounce them as <lb/>
            dogmas. For to say that is a different kind of statement from <lb/>
             <pb n="419"/>
            saying that the world is spherical; for the one fact is not <lb/>
            evident, while the other statements are mere admissions.</p>
          <p>While, therefore, we say that we define nothing, we do <lb/>
            not even say that as a definition.</p>
          <p>Again, the dogmatic philosophers say that the Sceptics over- <lb/>
            throw all life, when they deny everything of which life consists. <lb/>
            But the Sceptics say that they are mistaken ; for they do not <lb/>
            deny that they see, but that they do not know how it is that <lb/>
            they see. For, say they, we assert what is actually the fact, <lb/>
            but we do not describe its character. Again, we feel that fire <lb/>
            burns, but we suspend our judgment as to whether it has a <lb/>
            burning nature. Also, we see whether a person moves, and <lb/>
            that a man dies ; but how these things happen we know not. <lb/>
            Therefore, say they, we only resist the uncertain deductions <lb/>
            which are put by the side of evident facts. For when we say <lb/>
            that an image has projections, we only state plainly what is <lb/>
            evident; but when we say that it has not projections, we no <lb/>
            longer say what appears evident, but something else. On which <lb/>
            account Timon, in his Python, says that Pyrrho does not <lb/>
            destroy the authority of custom. And in his Images he speaks <lb/>
            thus :- <lb/>
            But what is evidently seen prevails, <lb/>
            Wherever it may be.</p>
          <p>And in his treatise on the Senses, he says, " The reason why <lb/>
            a thing is sweet I do not declare, but I confess that the fact <lb/>
            of sweetness is evident." So too, Ænesidemus, in the first book <lb/>
            of his Pyrrhonean Discourses, says that Pyrrho defines nothing <lb/>
            dogmatically, on account of the possibility of contradiction, <lb/>
            but that he is guided by what is evident. And he says the <lb/>
            same thing in his book against Wisdom, and in his treatise <lb/>
            on Investigation.</p>
          <p>In like manner, Zeuxis, a friend of Ænesidemus, in his <lb/>
            treatise on Twofold Arguments, and Antiochus, of Laodicea, <lb/>
            and Apellas, in his Agrippa, all declare nothing beyond what <lb/>
            is evident. The criterion therefore, among the Sceptics, is <lb/>
            that which is evident; as Ænesidemus also says; and Epicurus <lb/>
            says the same thing.</p>
          <p>But Democritus says, that there is no test whatever of <lb/>
            appearances, and also that they are not criteria of truth. More- <lb/>
            over, the dogmatic philosophers attack the criterion derived <note type="footnote"> E E 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="420"/>
            from appearances, and say that the same objects present at <lb/>
            times different appearances; so that a town presents at one <lb/>
            time a square, and at another a round appearance ; and that <lb/>
            consequently, if the Sceptic does not discriminate between <lb/>
            different appearances, he does nothing at all. If, on the <lb/>
            contrary, he determines in favour of either, then, say they, he <lb/>
            no longer attaches equal value to all appearances. The Sceptics <lb/>
            reply to this, that in the presence of different appearances, <lb/>
            they content themselves with saying that there are many <lb/>
            appearances, and that it is precisely because things present <lb/>
            themselves under different characters, that they affirm the <lb/>
            existence of appearances.</p>
          <p>Lastly, the Sceptics say, that the chief good is the suspen- <lb/>
            sion of the judgment which tranquillity of mind follows, like <lb/>
            its shadow, as Timon and Ænesidemus say; for that we need <lb/>
            not choose these things, or avoid those, which- all depend on <lb/>
            ourselves: but as to those things which do not depend upon <lb/>
            us, but upon necessity, such as hunger, thirst, and pain, those <lb/>
            we cannot avoid; for it is not possible to put an end to them <lb/>
            by reason.</p>
          <p>But when the dogmatic philosophers object that the Sceptic, <lb/>
            on his principles, will not refuse to kill his own father, if he <lb/>
            is ordered to do so ; so that they answer, that they can live <lb/>
            very well without disquieting themselves about the specula- <lb/>
            tions of the dogmatic philosophers; but, suspending their <lb/>
            judgment in all matters which do not refer to living and the <lb/>
            preservation of life. Accordingly, say they, we avoid some <lb/>
            things, and we seek others, following custom in that; and we <lb/>
            obey the laws.</p>
          <p>Some authors have asserted, that the chief good of the <lb/>
            Stoics is impassibility; others say that it is mildness and <lb/>
            tranquillity.</p>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF TIMON.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>1. APOLLONIDES, of Nicæa, a philosopher of our school, in <lb/>
            the first book of his Commentaries on the Silli, which he <lb/>
            dedicated to Tiberius Cæsar, says that Timon was the son of <lb/>
             <pb n="421"/>
            Timarchus, and a Phliasian by birth. And then, when he <lb/>
            was young, he studied dancing, and afterwards he renounced <lb/>
            that study, and went to Megara to Stilpo. And having spent <lb/>
            some time there, he returned home again and married. Then <lb/>
            he came with his wife to Elis, to see Pyrrho, and there he <lb/>
            remained while his children were born; the elder of whom, <lb/>
            he called Xanthus, and taught him medicine, and left him his <lb/>
            successor in his sect of philosophy. And he was a man of <lb/>
            considerable eminence, as Sotion tells us in his eleventh book. <lb/>
            Afterwards, being in difficulty as to his means, he departed <lb/>
            to the Hellespont and the Propontis; and living at Chalcedon <lb/>
            as a Sophist, he earned a very high reputation and great <lb/>
            popularity; from thence he departed, after having made a con- <lb/>
            siderable fortune, and went to Athens, and remained there till <lb/>
            his death, going across once for a short time to Thebes. He <lb/>
            was also acquainted with king Antigonus, and with Ptolemy <lb/>
            Philadelphus, as he himself testifies in his Iambics.</p>
          <p>II. He was, says Antigonus, fond of drinking, and he at <lb/>
            times occupied himself with works quite inconsistent with <lb/>
            philosophy; for he wrote lyric and epic poems, and tragedies <lb/>
            and satiric dramas, and thirty comedies, and sixty tragedies and <lb/>
            Silli, and amatory poems.</p>
          <p>There are works of his also enumerated in a regular <lb/>
            catalogue, extending to twenty thousand verses, which are <lb/>
            mentioned by Antigonus, of Carystos, who also wrote his life. <lb/>
            Of the Silli, there are three volumes ; in which he attacks <lb/>
            every one as if he were a Sceptic, and especially he lampoons <lb/>
            the dogmatic philosophers under the form of parodies. The <lb/>
            first volume of these Silli contain a long uninterrupted nar- <lb/>
            ration ; but the second and third are in the form of dialogues. <lb/>
            He is represented in them, as interrogating Xenophanes, the <lb/>
            Colophonian, about every thing, and he utters a long con- <lb/>
            tinued discourse; in his second book he speaks of the more <lb/>
            ancient philosophers; and in his third of the more modern <lb/>
            ones ; on which account some people have given the last <lb/>
            book the name of the epilogue.</p>
          <p>But the first book contains the same subjects, with this dif- <lb/>
            ference, that in that it is all confined to one single person ; <lb/>
            and its first line begins thus :- <lb/>
            Come hither, all you over-busy Sophists.</p><pb n="422"/>
            
          <p>III. He died when he was nearly ninety years old, as <lb/>
            Antigonus tells us; and Sotion, in his eleventh book; makes <lb/>
            the same statement. I have heard it said that he had only <lb/>
            one eye, and, indeed, he used to call himself Cyclops.</p>
          <p>IV. There was also another Timon, the misanthrope.</p>
          <p>V. Now this philosopher was very fond of a garden, and <lb/>
            also of solitude, as we are told by Antigonus. Accordingly it <lb/>
            is reported, that Hieronymus, the Peripatetic, said of him, as <lb/>
            among the Scythians, both they who fly, and they who pursue <lb/>
            shoot with the bow, so in the case of the philosophers, those <lb/>
            who pursue and those who fly both hunt for pupils, as Timon <lb/>
            for instance.</p>
          <p>VI. He was a man of very acute perceptions, and very <lb/>
            quick at seeing the ridiculous side of any question : he was also <lb/>
            very fond of learning, and a very clever man at devising plots <lb/>
            for poets, and at composing dramas. And he used to associate <lb/>
            with himself, in the composition of his tragedies, two other <lb/>
            poets, named Alexander and Homer ; and whenever he was <lb/>
            disturbed by his maid-servants or by the dogs, he paid no <lb/>
            attention to them, studying above all things to live in tran- <lb/>
            quillity. They tell a story, that Aratus asked him how he <lb/>
            could procure an entire and correct copy of Homer's poetry, <lb/>
            and he answered, " If he could fall in with an old manuscript <lb/>
            which had never been corrected." And all his works used to <lb/>
            lie about at random, and at times half eaten by mice; so <lb/>
            that once when he was reading them to Zopyrus, the orator, <lb/>
            and unrolling a volume, he read whatever passages came first, <lb/>
            and when he got to the middle of the book he found a great <lb/>
            gap, which he had not previously perceived, so very indifferent <lb/>
            was he about such matters.</p>
          <p>His constitution was so vigorous, that he could easily go <lb/>
            without his dinner. And they say, that once when he saw <lb/>
            Arcesilaus passing through the forum of the Cercipes, he said, <lb/>
            "What are you doing here, where we freemen are?" And <lb/>
            he used constantly to quote to those who invoked the testi- <lb/>
            mony of their intellects to judge of the senses :— <lb/>
            Attagas and Numenius are met.*</p>
          <p>And this jesting manner was habitual with him. Accord- <note type="footnote"> * That is to say, the harmony between intellect and the senses will <lb/>
            not last long. Attagas and Numenius were two notorious brigands. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="423"/>
            ingly he once said to a man, who was surprised at everything, <lb/>
            " Why do you not wonder that we three men have only four <lb/>
            eyes between us ? " for he himself had only one eye, no more <lb/>
            had Dioscorides, his pupil; but the man to whom he was <lb/>
            speaking had his sight unimpaired. On another occasion, he <lb/>
            was asked by Arcesilaus, why he had come from Thebes, and <lb/>
            he said, " To laugh at you all when I see you face to face." <lb/>
            But though he attacked Arcesilaus in his Silli, he has praised <lb/>
            him in the book entitled the Funeral Banquet of Arcesilaus.</p>
          <p>VII. He had no successor, as Menodotus tells us; but his <lb/>
            school ceased, till Ptolemy the Cyrenean re-established it. <lb/>
            .According to the account given to us by Hippobotus and <lb/>
            Sotion, he had as pupils, Dioscorides of Cyprus, and Nilolo- <lb/>
            chus of Rhodes, and Euphranor of Seleucia, and Pracylus <lb/>
            of the Troas, who was a mail of such constancy of mind that, <lb/>
            as Phylarchus relates in his History, he allowed himself to be <lb/>
            punished as a traitor wholly undeservedly, not uttering one <lb/>
            word of complaint against his fellow citizens ; and Euphranor <lb/>
            had for his pupil, Eubulus, of Alexandria, who was the <lb/>
            master of Ptolemy, who was the master of Sarpedon and <lb/>
            Heraclides. And Heraclides was the master of Ænesidemus, <lb/>
            of Cnossus, who wrote eight books of Pyrrhonean discourses; <lb/>
            he was also the master of Xeuxippus Polites, who was the <lb/>
            master of Zeuxis Gonicpus, who was the master of Antiochus, <lb/>
            of Laodicea, in Lycia. Antiochus again, was the master of <lb/>
            Menodotus, of Nicomedia, a skilful physician, and of Theodos, <lb/>
            of Laodicea; and Menodotus was the master of Herodotus, of <lb/>
            Tarsus, the son of Arieus ; Herodotus was the master of Sex- <lb/>
            tus Empiricus, who left ten books of Sceptic Maxims, and other <lb/>
            excellent works; and Sextus was the master of Saturninus <lb/>
            Cythenas, who was also an empiric.</p>

            <title type="sub">LIFE OF EPICURUS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I. EPICURUS was an Athenian, and the son of Neocles and <lb/>
            Chærestrate, of the burgh of Gargettus, and of the family of <lb/>
            the Philaidæ, as Metrodorus tells us in his treatise on Nobility <lb/>
            of Birth. Some writers, and among them Heraclides, in his <lb/>
            Abridgment of Sotion, say, that as the Athenians had Colonis <lb/>
            and Samos, he was brought up there, and came to Athens in <lb/>
            his eighteenth year, while Xenocrates was president of the <lb/>
            Academy, and Aristotle at Chalcis. But after the death of <lb/>
            Alexander, the Macedonian, when the Athenians were driven <lb/>
            out of Samos by Perdiccas, Epicurus went to Colophon to <lb/>
            his father.</p>
          <p>II. And when he had spent some time there, and collected <lb/>
            some disciples, he again returned to Athens, in the time of <lb/>
            Anaxicrates, and for some time studied philosophy, mingling <lb/>
            with the rest of the philosophers; but subsequently, he some <lb/>
            how or other established the school which was called after his <lb/>
            name; and he used to say, that he began to study philosophy, <lb/>
            when he was fourteen years of age ; but Apollodorus, the <lb/>
            Epicurean, in the first book of his account of the life of <lb/>
            Epicurus, says, that he came to the study of philosophy, <lb/>
            having conceived a great contempt for the grammarians, <lb/>
            because they could not explain to him the statements in <lb/>
            Hesiod respecting Chaos.</p>
          <p>But Hermippus tells us, that he himself was a teacher of <lb/>
            grammar, and that afterwards, having met with the books of <lb/>
            Democritus, he applied himself with zeal to philosophy, o.. <lb/>
            which account Timon says of him.— <lb/>
            The last of all the natural philosophers, <lb/>
            And the most shameless too, did come from Samos, <lb/>
            A grammar teacher, and the most ill-bred <lb/>
            And most unmanageable of mankind.</p>
          <p>And he had for his companions in his philosophical studies, <lb/>
             <pb n="425"/>
            his three brothers, Neocles, Chæredemus, and Aristobulus, <lb/>
            who were excited by his exhortations, as Philodemus, the <lb/>
            Epicurean, relates in the tenth book of the Classification of <lb/>
            Philosophers. He had also a slave, whose name was Inus, as <lb/>
            Myronianus tells us in his Similar Historical Chapters.</p>
          <p>III. But Diotimus, the Stoic, was very hostile to him, and <lb/>
            calumniated him in a most bitter manner, publishing fifty <lb/>
            obscene letters, and attributing them to Epicurus, and also <lb/>
            giving him the credit of the letters, which generally go under <lb/>
            the name of Chrysippus. And Posidonius, the Stoic, and <lb/>
            Nicolaus, and Sotion, in the twelfth of these books, which are <lb/>
            entitled the Refutations of Diodes, of which there are <lb/>
            altogether twenty-four volumes, and Dionysius, of Halicar- <lb/>
            nassus, have also attacked him with great severity; for they <lb/>
            say that he used to accompany his mother when she went <lb/>
            about the small cottages, performing purifications, and that <lb/>
            he used to read the formula, and that he used also to keep a <lb/>
            school with his father at very low terms. Also, that he, as <lb/>
            well as as one of his brothers, was a most profligate man in <lb/>
            his morals, and that he used to live with Leontium, the <lb/>
            courtesan. Moreover, that he claimed the books of Demo- <lb/>
            critus on Atoms, and that of Aristippus on Pleasure, as his <lb/>
            own; and that he was not a legitimate citizen; and this last <lb/>
            fact is asserted also by Timocrates, and by Herodotus, in his <lb/>
            treatise on the Youth of Epicurus.</p>
          <p>They also say that he used to flatter Mithras, the steward <lb/>
            of Lysimachus, in a disgraceful manner, calling him in his <lb/>
            letters Paean, and King; and also that he flattered Idomeneus, <lb/>
            and Herodotus, and Timocrates who had revealed all his secret <lb/>
            practices, and that he flattered them on this very account. <lb/>
            And in his letters to Leontium, he says, " 0 king Apollo, my <lb/>
            dear Leontium, what transports of joy did I feel when I read <lb/>
            your charming letter." And to Themista, the wife of Leontius, <lb/>
            he writes, " I am ready and prepared, if you do not come to <lb/>
            me, to roll myself to wherever you and Themista invite <lb/>
            me." And he addresses Pythocles, a beautiful youth, thus, <lb/>
            " I will sit quiet," says he, " awaiting your longed for and <lb/>
            god-like approach." And at another time, writing to Themista, <lb/>
            he says, " That he had determined to make his way with her," <lb/>
            as Theodorus tells us in the fourth book of his treatises <lb/>
            against Epicurus.</p><pb n="426"/>
            
          <p>He also wrote to many other courtesans, and especially tc <lb/>
            Leontium, with whom Metrodorus also was in love. And ic <lb/>
            his treatise on the Chief Good, he writes thus, " For I do not <lb/>
            know what I can consider good, if I put out of sight thE <lb/>
            pleasures which arise from favours, and those which are <lb/>
            derived from amatory pleasures, and from music, and from the <lb/>
            contemplation of beauty." And in his letter to Pythocles, he <lb/>
            writes, " And, my dear boy, avoid all sorts of education."</p>
          <p>Epictetus also attacks him as a most debauched man, and <lb/>
            reproaches him most vehemently, and so does Timocrates, the <lb/>
            brother of Metrodorus, in his treatise entitled the Merry <lb/>
            Guests, and this Timocrates had been a disciple in his school, <lb/>
            though he afterwards abandoned it; and he says that he used <lb/>
            to vomit twice a day, in consequence of his intemperance ; and <lb/>
            that he himself had great difficulty in escaping from this noc- <lb/>
            turnal philosophy, and that mystic kind of re-union. He also <lb/>
            accuses Epicurus of shameful ignorance in his reasoning, and <lb/>
            still more especially in all matters relating to the conduct of <lb/>
            life. And says that he was in a pitiable state of health, so <lb/>
            that he could not for many years rise up from his sofa; and <lb/>
            that he used to spend a minae a day on his eating, as he <lb/>
            himself states in his letter to Leontium, and in that to the <lb/>
            philosophers at Mitylene. He also says that many courtesans <lb/>
            used to live with him and Metrodorus ; and among them <lb/>
            Marmaricem, and Hedea, and Erotium, and Nicidium.</p>
          <p>IV. And in the thirty-seven books which he wrote about <lb/>
            natural philosophy, they say that he says a great many things <lb/>
            of the same kind over and over again, and that in them he <lb/>
            writes in contradiction of other philosophers, and especially of <lb/>
            Nausiphanes, and speaks as follows, word for word : " But if <lb/>
            any one else ever was afflicted in such a manner, then certainly <lb/>
            this mail had a continual labour, striving to bring forth the <lb/>
            sophistical boastfulness of his mouth, like many other slaves." <lb/>
            And Epicurus also speaks of Nausiphanes in his letters, in the <lb/>
            following terms : " These things led him on to such arrogance <lb/>
            of mind, that he abused me and called me a schoolmaster." <lb/>
            He used also to call him Lungs, and Blockhead, and Humbug, <lb/>
            and Fornicator. And he used to call Plato's followers Flat. <lb/>
            terers of Dionysius, but Plato himself he called Golden. <lb/>
            Aristotle he called a debauchee and a glutton, saying that he <lb/>
            joined the army after he had squandered his patrimony, and <lb/>
             <pb n="427"/>
            sold drugs. He used also to call Protagoras a porter, and the <lb/>
            secretary of Democritus, and to say that he taught boys their <lb/>
            etters in the streets. Heraclitus, he called a disturber; Demo- <lb/>
            eritus, he nicnamed Lerocrates ;* and Antidorus, Sænidorus ;t <lb/>
            rhe Cynics he called enemies of Greece ; and the Dialecticians <lb/>
            ne charged with being eaten up with envy. Pyrrho, he said, <lb/>
            vas ignorant and unlearned.</p>
          <p>V. But these men who say this are all wrong, for there are <lb/>
            lenty of witnesses of the unsurpassable kindness of the man <lb/>
            o every body ; both his own country which honoured him with <lb/>
            razen statues, and his friend who were so numerous that they <lb/>
            ould not be contained in whole cities; and all his acquaint- <lb/>
            nces who were bound to him by nothing but the charms of his <lb/>
            octrine, none of whom ever deserted him, except Metrodo- <lb/>
            us, the soil of Stratoniceus, who went over to Carneades, <lb/>
            robably because he was not able to bear with equanimity the <lb/>
            napproachable excellence of Epicurus. Also, the perpetual <lb/>
            accession of his school, which, when every other school decayed, <lb/>
            ontinued without any falling off, and produced a countless <lb/>
            umber of philosophers, succeeding one another without any <lb/>
            iterruption. We may also speak here of his gratitude towards <lb/>
            is parents, and his beneficence to his brothers, and his <lb/>
            entleness to his servants (as is plain from his will, and from <lb/>
            ne fact too, that they united with him in his philosophical <lb/>
            ;udies, and the most eminent of them was the one whom I <lb/>
            ave mentioned already, named Inus); and his universal <lb/>
            hilanthropy towards all men.</p>
          <p>His piety towards the Gods, and his affection for his country <lb/>
            as quite unspeakable ; though, from an excess of modesty, he <lb/>
            voided affairs of state. And though he lived when very <lb/>
            ifficult times oppressed Greece, he still remained in his <lb/>
            wn country, only going two or three times across to Ionia <lb/>
            &gt; see his friends, who used to throng to him from all quarters, <lb/>
            nd to live with him in his garden, as we are told by Apol- <lb/>
            dorus. (This garden he bought for eighty minæ.) <lb/>
            VI. And Diodes, in the third book of his Excursion, says <note type="footnote"> * That is "trifler," from <foreign xml:lang="grc">κϱίνω</foreign>, to judge; and <foreign xml:lang="grc">λη̃ρος</foreign>, nonsensical <lb/>
            lk. </note><note type="footnote"> t That is, flattering for gifts; from <foreign xml:lang="grc">σαίνω</foreign>, to wag the tail as a dog, <lb/>
            caress ; and <foreign xml:lang="grc">δω̃ρον</foreign>, a gift. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="428"/>
            that they all lived in the most simple and economical manner <lb/>
            " They were content," says he, " with a small cup of ligh <lb/>
            wine, and all the rest of their drink was water." He alsi <lb/>
            tells us that Epicurus would not allow his followers to throv <lb/>
            their property into a common stock, as Pythagoras did, wh( <lb/>
            said that the possessions of friends were held in common <lb/>
            For he said that such a doctrine as that was suited rathe] <lb/>
            for those who distrusted one another; and that those wh&lt; <lb/>
            distrusted one another were not friends. But he himsel <lb/>
            in his letters, says that he is content with water and plair <lb/>
            bread, and adds, "Send me some Cytherean cheese, that if ] <lb/>
            wish to have a feast, I may have the means." This was th( <lb/>
            real character of the man who laid down the doctrine that <lb/>
            pleasure was the chief good ; whom Athenæus thus mentions <lb/>
            in an epigram:- <lb/>
            0 men, you labour for pernicious ends; <lb/>
            And out of eager avarice, begin <lb/>
            Quarrels and wars. And yet the wealth of nature <lb/>
            Fixes a narrow limit for desires, <lb/>
            Though empty judgment is insatiable. <lb/>
            This lesson the wise child of Neocles <lb/>
            Had learnt by heart, instructed by the Muses, <lb/>
            Or at the sacred shrine of Delphi's God.</p>
          <p>And as we advance further, we shall learn this fact from his <lb/>
            dogmas, and his apophthegms.</p>
          <p>VII. Of all the ancient philosophers he was, as we are told <lb/>
            by Diodes, most attached to Anaxagoras k'although in some <lb/>
            points he argued against him) ; and to Archelaus, the master <lb/>
            of Socrates. And he used, Diodes adds, to accustom his pupils <lb/>
            to preserve his writings in their memory. Apollodorus, in his <lb/>
            Chronicles, asserts that he was a pupil of Nausiphanes, and <lb/>
            Praxiphanes ; but he himself does not mention this ; but says <lb/>
            in his letter to Euridicus, that he had been his own instructor. <lb/>
            He also agreed with Hermarchus in not admitting that <lb/>
            Leucippus deserved to be called a philosopher; though some <lb/>
            authors, among whom his Apollodorus, speak of him as the <lb/>
            master of Democritus. Demetrius, the Magnesian, says that <lb/>
            he was a pupil of Xenocrates also.</p>
          <p>VIII. He uses in his works plain language with respect to <lb/>
            anything he is speaking of, for which Aristophanes, the gram- <lb/>
            marian, blames him, on the ground of that style being vulgar. <lb/>
             <pb n="429"/>
            But he was such an admirer of perspicuity, that even in his <lb/>
            treatise on Rhetoric, he aims at and recommends nothing but <lb/>
            clearness of expression. And in his letters, instead of the <lb/>
            usual civil expressions, " Greeting," " Farewell," and so on, <lb/>
            he substitutes, " May you act well," "May you live virtuously," <lb/>
            and expressions of that sort. Some of his biographers assert <lb/>
            that it was he who composed the treatise entitled the Canon, <lb/>
            in imitation of the Tripod of Nausiphanes, whose pupil they <lb/>
            say that he was, and add that he was also a pupil of Pamphilus, <lb/>
            the Platonist, at Samoa.</p>
          <p>IX. They further tell us that he began to study philosophy <lb/>
            at twelve years of age, and that he presided over his school <lb/>
            thirty-two years. And he was born as we are told by Apollo- <lb/>
            dorus, in his Chronicles, in the third year of the hundred and <lb/>
            ninth olympiad, in the archonship of Sosigenes, on the seventh <lb/>
            day of the month Gamelion, seven years after the death of <lb/>
            Plato. And when he was thirty-two years of age, he first set <lb/>
            up his school at Mitylene, and after that at Lampsacus; and <lb/>
            when he had spent five years in these two cities, he came to <lb/>
            Athens ; and he died there in the second year of the hundred <lb/>
            and twenty-seventh olympiad, in the archonship of Pytharatus, <lb/>
            when he had lived seventy-two years. And Hermarchus, the <lb/>
            son of Agemarchus, and a citizen of Mitylene, succeeded him <lb/>
            in his school.</p>
          <p>He died of the stone, as Hermarchus mentions in his letters, <lb/>
            after having been ill a fortnight; and at the end of the fort- <lb/>
            night, Hermippus says that he went into a brazen bath, <lb/>
            properly tempered with warm water, aud asked for a cup of <lb/>
            pure wine and drank it; and having recommended his friends <lb/>
            to remember his doctrines, he expired. And there is an <lb/>
            epigram of ours on him, couched in the following language :— <lb/>
            Now, fare-ye-well, remember all my words; <lb/>
            This was the dying charge of Epicurus : <lb/>
            Then to the bath he went, and drank some wine, <lb/>
            And sank beneath the cold embrace of Pluto.</p>
          <p>Such was the life of the man, and such was his death.</p>
          <p>X. And he made his will in the following terms :- <lb/>
            "According to this my will, I give all my possessions to <lb/>
            Amynomachus, of Bate, the son of Philocrates, and to Timo- <lb/>
            crates, of Potamos, the son of Demetrius; according to the <lb/>
             <pb n="430"/>
            deed of gift to each, which is deposited in the temple &lt; <lb/>
            Cybele; on condition that they make over my garden and a <lb/>
            that is attached to it to Hermarchus, of Mitylene, the son &lt; <lb/>
            Agemarchus ; and to those who study philosophy with hin <lb/>
            and to whomsoever Hermarchus leaves as his successors in hi <lb/>
            school, that they may abide and dwell in it, in the study an <lb/>
            practice of philosophy; and I give it also to all those wh <lb/>
            philosophize according to my doctrines, that they may, to th <lb/>
            best of their ability, maintain my school which exists in m <lb/>
            garden, in concert with Amynomachus and Timocrates ; an. <lb/>
            I enjoin their heirs to do the same in the most perfect an <lb/>
            secure manner that they can ; so that they also may maintain <lb/>
            my garden, as those also shall to whom my immediatesuces <lb/>
            sors hand it down. As for the house in Melita, that Amyno <lb/>
            machus and Timocrates shall allow Hermarchus that he may <lb/>
            live in it during his life, together with all his companions in <lb/>
            philosophy.</p>
          <p>" Out of the income which is derived from that property <lb/>
            which is here bequeathed by me to Amynomachus and Timo <lb/>
            crates, I will that they, consulting with Hermarchus, shall <lb/>
            arrange in the best manner possible the offerings to the manes <lb/>
            in honour of the memory of my father, and mother, and <lb/>
            brothers, and myself, and that my birth-day may be kept as it <lb/>
            has been in the habit of being kept, on the tenth day of the <lb/>
            month Gamelion ; and that the re-union of all the philosophers <lb/>
            of our school, established in honour of Metrodorus and myself, <lb/>
            may take place on the twentieth day of every month. They <lb/>
            shall also celebrate, as I have been in the habit of doing <lb/>
            myself, the day consecrated to my brothers, in the month <lb/>
            Poseideon; and the day consecrated to the memory of <lb/>
            Polyænus, in the month Metageitnion.</p>
          <p>"Amynomachus and Timocrates, shall be the guardians of <lb/>
            Epicurus, the son of Metrodorus, and of the son of Polyænus, <lb/>
            as long as they study philosophy under, and live with, Hermar- <lb/>
            elms. In the same way also, they shall be the guardians of <lb/>
            the daughter of Metrodorus, and when she is of marriageable <lb/>
            age, they shall give her to whomsoever Hermarchus shall select <lb/>
            of his companions in philosophy, provided she is well behaved <lb/>
            and obedient to Hermarchus. And Amynomachus and Timo- <lb/>
            crates shall, out of my income, give them such a sum for their <lb/>
            support as shall appear sufficient year by year, after due <lb/>
             <pb n="431"/>
            consultation with Hermarchus. And they shall associate <lb/>
            Hermarchus with themselves in the management of my <lb/>
            revenues, in order that everything may be done with the <lb/>
            approval of that man who has grown old with me in the study <lb/>
            of philosophy, and who is now left as the president of all those <lb/>
            who have studied philosophy with us. And as for the dowry <lb/>
            for the girl when she is come to marriageable age, let Amyno- <lb/>
            machus and Timocrates arrange that, taking for the purpose <lb/>
            such a sum from my property as shall seem to them, in con- <lb/>
            junction with Hermarchus, to be reasonable. And let them <lb/>
            also take care of Nicanor, as we ourselves have done ; in order <lb/>
            that all those who have studied philosophy with us, and who <lb/>
            have assisted us with their means, and who have shown great <lb/>
            friendship for us, and who have chosen to grow old with us in <lb/>
            the study of philosophy, may never be in want of anything as <lb/>
            far as our power to prevent it may extend.</p>
          <p>" I further enjoin them to give all my books to Hermarchus; <lb/>
            and, if anything should happen to Hermarchus before the <lb/>
            children of Metrodorus are grown up, then I desire that <lb/>
            Amynomachus and Timocrates, shall take care that, provided <lb/>
            they are well behaved, they shall have everything that is <lb/>
            necessary for them, as far as the estate which I leave behind <lb/>
            me shall allow such things to be furnished to them. And the <lb/>
            same men shall also take care of everything else that I have <lb/>
            enjoined ; so that it may all be fulfilled, as far as the case may <lb/>
            permit.</p>
          <p>" Of my slaves, I hereby emancipate Inns, and Nicias, and <lb/>
            Lycon : I also give Phædrium her freedom."</p>
          <p>And when he was at the point of death, he wrote the <lb/>
            following letter to Idomeneus :—</p>
          <p>" We have written this letter to you on a happy day to us, <lb/>
            which is also the last day of our life. For strangury has <lb/>
            attacked me, and also a dysentery, so violent that nothing <lb/>
            can be added to the violence of my sufferings. But the <lb/>
            cheerfulness of my mind, which arises from the recollection of <lb/>
            all my philosophical contemplations, counterbalances all these <lb/>
            afflictions. And I beg you to take care of the children of <lb/>
            (Metrodorus, in a manner worthy of the devotion shown by the <lb/>
            youth to me, and to philosophy."</p>
          <p>Such then as I have given it, was his will.</p>
          <p>XI. He had a great number of pupils, of whom the most <lb/>

            eminent were Metrodorus, the Athenian, and Timocrates, and <lb/>
            Sandes, of Lampsacus ; who, from the time that he first became <lb/>
            acquainted with him, never left him, except once when he weni <lb/>
            home for six months ; after which he returned to him. And <lb/>
            he was a virtuous man in every respect, as Epicurus tells us ii <lb/>
            his Fundamental Principles. And he also bears witness tc <lb/>
            his virtue in the third book of his Timocrates. And being <lb/>
            man of this character, he gave his sister Bates in marriage to <lb/>
            Idomeneus ; and he himself had Leontium, the Attic courtesan, <lb/>
            for his concubine. He was very unmoved at all disturbances, <lb/>
            and even at death; as Epicurus tells us, in the first book of <lb/>
            his Metrodorus. He is said to have died seven years before <lb/>
            Epicurus himself, in the fifty-third year of his age. And <lb/>
            Epicurus himself, in the will which I have given above, gives! <lb/>
            many charges about the guardianship of his children, showing <lb/>
            by this that he had been dead some time. He also had a <lb/>
            brother whom I have mentioned before, of the name of Timo- <lb/>
            crates, a trifling, silly man.</p>
          <p>The writings of Metrodorus are these. Three books addressed <lb/>
            to the Physicians ; one essay on the Sensations ; one addressed <lb/>
            to Timocrates ; one on Magnanimity ; one on the Illness of <lb/>
            Epicurus ; one addressed to the Dialecticians ; one against the <lb/>
            Nine Sophists ; one on the Road to Wisdom; one on Change ; <lb/>
            one on Riches ; one against Democritus; one on Nobility of <lb/>
            Birth.</p>
          <p>XII. Likewise Polyænus, of Lampsacus, the son of Atheno- <lb/>
            dorus, was a man of mild and friendly manners, as Philodemus <lb/>
            particularly assures us.</p>
          <p>XIII. And his successor was Hermarchus, of Mitylene, the <lb/>
            son of Agemarchus, a poor man ; and his favourite pursuit was <lb/>
            rhetoric. And the following excellent works of his are extant. <lb/>
            Twenty-two books of letters about Empedocles; an essay on <lb/>
            Mathematics; A treatise against Plato; another against <lb/>
            Aristotle. And he died of paralysis, being a most eminent <lb/>
            man.</p>
          <p>XIV. There was also Leontius, of Lampsacus, and his wife <lb/>
            Themista, to whom Epicurus wrote.</p>
          <p>XV. There were also Colotes and Idomeneus; and these <lb/>
            also were natives of Lampsacus. And among the most eminent <lb/>
            philosophers of the school of Epicurus, were Polystratus, who <lb/>
            succeeded Hermarchus, and Dionysius who succeeded him, and <lb/>
             <pb n="433"/>
            Basilides who succeeded him. Likewise Apollodorus, who was <lb/>
            nicknamed the tyrant of the gardens (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰηποτύϱαννος</foreign>), was a very <lb/>
            eminent man, and wrote more than four hundred books. And <lb/>
            there were the two Ptolemies of Alexandria, Ptolemy the <lb/>
            Black, and Ptolemy the Fair. And Zeno, of Sidon, a pupil <lb/>
            of Apollodorus, a very voluminous author; and Demetrius, <lb/>
            who was surnamed the Lacedæmonian; and Diogenes, of <lb/>
            Tarsus, who wrote the Select Dialogues; and Orion, and <lb/>
            others whom the genuine Epicureans call Sophists.</p>
          <p>XVI. There were also three other persons of the name of <lb/>
            Epicurus; first, the son of Leonteus and Themista ; secondly, <lb/>
            a native of Magnesia ; and lastly, a Gladiator.</p>
          <p>XVII. And Epicurus was a most voluminous author. <lb/>
            exceeding all men in the number of his books ; for there are <lb/>
            more than three hundred volumes of them : and in the whole <lb/>
            of them there is not one citation from other sources, but they <lb/>
            are filled wholly with the sentiments of Epicurus himself. In <lb/>
            the quantity of his writings he was rivalled by Chrysippus, as <lb/>
            Carneades asserts, who calls him a parasite of the books of <lb/>
            Epicurus ; for if ever this latter wrote anything, Chrysippus <lb/>
            immediately set his heart on writing a book of equal size ; and <lb/>
            in this way he often wrote the same thing over again; putting <lb/>
            down whatever came into his head ; and he published it all <lb/>
            without any corrections, by reason of his haste. And he quotes <lb/>
            such numbers of testimonies from other authors, that his <lb/>
            books are entirely filled with them alone; as one may find <lb/>
            also in the works of Aristotle and Zeno.</p>
          <p>Such then, and so numerous are the works of Epicurus; <lb/>
            the chief of which are the following. Thirty-seven treatises <lb/>
            on Natural Philosophy; one on Atoms, and the Vacuum; <lb/>
            one on Love; an abridgment of the Arguments employed <lb/>
            against the Natural Philosophers; Doubts in Contradiction of <lb/>
            the Doctrines of the Megarians; Fundamental Propositions; <lb/>
            a treatise on Choice and Avoidance; another on the Chief <lb/>
            Good; another on the Criterion, called also the Canon; <lb/>
            the Chæridemus, a treatise on the Gods; one on Piety ; <lb/>
            the Hegesiana ; four essays on Lives; one on Just Dealing; <lb/>
            the Neocles ; one essay addressed to Themista ; the Banquet; <lb/>
            the Eurylochus ; one essay addressed to Metrodorus; one <lb/>
            on Seeing; one on the Angle in an Atom; one on Touch ; <note type="footnote"> F F </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="434"/>
            one on Fate; Opinions on the Passions; one treatise <lb/>
            addressed to Timocrates ; Prognostics; Exhortations; a <lb/>
            treatise on Spectres ; one on Perceptions; the Aristobulus ; <lb/>
            an essay on Music; one on Justice and the other Virtues ; <lb/>
            one on Gifts and Gratitude ; the Polymedes ; the Timocrates, <lb/>
            a treatise in three books; the Metrodorus, in five books ; <lb/>
            the Antidorus, in two books; Opinions about the South <lb/>
            Winds; a treatise addressed to Mithras; the Callistolas; <lb/>
            an essay on Kingly Power; the Anaximenes; Letters.</p>
          <p>XVIII. And I will endeavour to give an abridgment of <lb/>
            the doctrines contained in these works, as it may be agreeable, <lb/>
            quoting three letters of his, in which he has made a sort of <lb/>
            epitome of all his philosophy. I will also give his fundamental <lb/>
            and peculiar opinions, and any apophthegms which he uttered <lb/>
            which appear worthy of being selected. So that you may be <lb/>
            thoroughly acquainted with the man, and may also judge that <lb/>
            I understand him.</p>
          <p>Now the first letter is one that he wrote to Herodotus, on <lb/>
            the subject of Natural Philosophy; the second is one that he <lb/>
            wrote to Pythocles, which is about the Heavenly Bodies ; the <lb/>
            third is addressed to Menæceus, and in that there are contained <lb/>
            the discussions about lives.</p>
          <p>We must now begin with the first, after having said a little <lb/>
            by way of preface concerning the divisions of philosophy which <lb/>
            he adopted.</p>
          <p>XIX. Now he divides philosophy into three parts. The <lb/>
            canonical, the physical, and the ethical. The canonical, which <lb/>
            serves as an introduction to science, is contained in the single <lb/>
            treatise which is called the Canon. The physical embraces <lb/>
            the whole range of speculation on subjects of natural philoso- <lb/>
            phy, and is contained in the thirty-seven books on nature, <lb/>
            and in the letters again it is discussed in an elementary manner. <lb/>
            The ethical contains the discussions on Choice and Avoidance ; <lb/>
            and is comprised in the books about lives, and in some of the <lb/>
            Letters, and in the treatise on the Chief Good. Accordingly, <lb/>
            most people are in the habit of combining the canonical divi- <lb/>
            sion with the physical; and then they designate the whole <lb/>
            under the names of the criterion of the truth, and a discussion <lb/>
            on principles, and elements. And they say that the physical <lb/>
            division is conversant about production, and destruction, and <lb/>
             <pb n="435"/>
            nature; and that the ethical division has reference to the <lb/>
            objects of choice and avoidance, and lives, and the chief good <lb/>
            of mankind.</p>
          <p>XX. Dialectics they wholly reject as superfluous. For they <lb/>
            say that the correspondence of words with things is sufficient <lb/>
            for the natural philosopher, so as to enable him to advance <lb/>
            with certainty in the study of nature.</p>
          <p>Now, in the Canon, Epicurus says that the criteria of truth <lb/>
            are the senses, and the preconceptions, and the passions. But <lb/>
            the Epicureans, in general, add also the perceptive impressions <lb/>
            of the intellect. And he says the same thing in his Abridg- <lb/>
            ment, which he addresses to Herodotus, and also in his Funda- <lb/>
            mental Principles. For, says he, the senses are devoid of <lb/>
            reason, nor are they capable of receiving any impressions of <lb/>
            memory. For they are not by themselves the cause of any <lb/>
            motion, and when they have received any impression from any <lb/>
            external cause, then they can add nothing to it, nor can they <lb/>
            subtract anything from it. Moreover, they are out of the <lb/>
            reach of any control ; for one sensation cannot judge of another <lb/>
            which resembles itself; for they have all an equal value. Nor <lb/>
            can one judge of another which is different from itself; since <lb/>
            their objects are not identical. In a word, one sensation <lb/>
            cannot control another, since the effects of all of them influence <lb/>
            us equally. Again, the reason cannot pronounce on the senses ; <lb/>
            for we have already said that all reasoning has the senses for <lb/>
            its foundation. Reality and the evidence of sensation establish <lb/>
            the certainty of the senses ; for the impressions of sight and <lb/>
            hearing are just as real, just as evident, as pain.</p>
          <p>It follows from these considerations that we ought to judge <lb/>
            of things which are obscure by their analogy to those which <lb/>
            we perceive directly. In fact, every notion proceeds from the <lb/>
            senses, either directly, or in consequence of some analogy, or <lb/>
            proportion, or combination. Reasoning having always a share <lb/>
            in these last operations. The visions of insanity and of sleep <lb/>
            have a real object, for they act upon us; and that which <lb/>
            has no reality can produce no action.</p>
          <p>XXI. By preconception, the Epicureans mean a sort of <lb/>
            comprehension as it were, or right opinion, or notion, or general <lb/>
            idea which exists in us; or, in other words, the recollection <lb/>
            of an external object often perceived anteriorly. Such for <lb/>
            instance, is this idea: " Man is a being of such and such a <note type="footnote"> F F 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="436"/>
            nature." At the same moment that we utter the word man, <lb/>
            we conceive the figure of a man, in virtue of a preconception <lb/>
            which we owe to the preceding operations of the senses. <lb/>
            Therefore, the first notion which each word awakens in us is <lb/>
            a correct one; in fact, we could not seek for anything if we <lb/>
            had not previously some notion of it. To enable us to affirm <lb/>
            that what we see at a distance is a horse or an ox, we must <lb/>
            have some preconception in our minds which makes us ac- <lb/>
            quainted with the form of a horse and an ox. We could not <lb/>
            give names to things, if we had not a preliminary notion of <lb/>
            what the things were.</p>
          <p>XXII. These preconceptions then furnish us with certainty. <lb/>
            And with respect to judgments, their certainty depends on <lb/>
            our referring them to some previous notion, of itself certain, <lb/>
            in virtue of which we affirm such and such a judgment; for <lb/>
            instance, " How do we know whether this thing is a man?"</p>
          <p>The Epicureans call opinion (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δόξα</foreign>) also supposition (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπόληψις</foreign>). <lb/>
            And say that it is at times true, and at times false; for that, <lb/>
            if it is supported by testimony, and not contradicted by testi- <lb/>
            mony, then it is true ; but if it is not supported by testimony, <lb/>
            and is contradicted by testimony, then it is false. On which <lb/>
            account they have introduced the expression of " waiting," as if, <lb/>
            before pronouncing that a thing seen is a tower, we must wait <lb/>
            till we come near, and learn what it looks like when we are <lb/>
            near it.</p>
          <p>XXIII. They say that there are two passions, pleasure and <lb/>
            pain, which affect everything alive. And that the one is <lb/>
            natural, and the other foreign to our nature ; with reference to <lb/>
            which all objects of choice and avoidance are judged of. They <lb/>
            say also, that there are two kinds of investigation ; the one <lb/>
            about facts, the other about mere words. And this is as far as <lb/>
            an elementary sketch can go-their doctrine about division, <lb/>
            and about the criterion.</p>
          <p>XXIV. Let us now go to the letter:-</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">EPICURUS TO HERODOTUS, WISHING HE MAY DO WELL.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>" For those, 0 Herodotus, who are not able accurately to <lb/>
            comprehend all the things which I have written about nature, <lb/>
            nor to investigate those larger books which I have composed on <lb/>
            the subject, I have made an abridgment of the whole discus- <lb/>
             <pb n="437"/>
            sion on this question, as far as I thought sufficient to enable <lb/>
            them to recollect accurately the most fundamental points ; <lb/>
            that so, on all grave occasions, they might be able to assist <lb/>
            themselves on the most important and undeniable principles ; <lb/>
            in proportion as they devoted themselves to speculations on <lb/>
            natural philosophy. And here it is necessary for those who <lb/>
            have made sufficient progress in their view of the general <lb/>
            question, to recollect the principles laid down as elements of <lb/>
            the whole discussion ; for we have still greater need of a correct <lb/>
            notion of the whole, than we have even of an accurate under <lb/>
            standing of the details. We must, therefore, give preference <lb/>
            to the former knowledge, and lay up in our memory those <lb/>
            principles on which we may rest, in order to arrive at an <lb/>
            exact perception of things, and at a certain knowledge of <lb/>
            particular objects.</p>
          <p>" Now one has arrived at that point when one has thoroughly <lb/>
            embraced the conceptions, and, if I may so express myself, <lb/>
            the most essential forms, and when one has impressed them <lb/>
            adequately on one's senses. For this clear and precise know- <lb/>
            ledge of the whole, taken together, necessarily facilitates one's <lb/>
            particular perceptions, when one has brought one's ideas back <lb/>
            to the elements and simple terms. In short, a veritable <lb/>
            synthesis, comprising the entire circle of the phenomena of <lb/>
            the universe, ought to be able to resume in itself, and in a few <lb/>
            words, all the particular facts which have been previously <lb/>
            studied. This method being useful even to those who are <lb/>
            already familiarised with the laws of the universe, I recom- <lb/>
            mend them, while still pursuing without intermission the <lb/>
            study of nature, which contributes more than anything else to <lb/>
            the tranquillity and happiness of life, to make a concise state- <lb/>
            ment or summary of their opinions.</p>
          <p>" First of all, then, Herodotus, one must determine with <lb/>
            exactness the notion comprehended under each separate word, <lb/>
            in order to be able to refer to it, as to a certain criterion, the <lb/>
            conceptions which emanate from ourselves, the ulterior re- <lb/>
            searches and the difficulties; otherwise the judgment has no <lb/>
            foundation. One goes on from demonstration to demonstration <lb/>
            ad infinitum ; or else one gains nothing beyond mere words. <lb/>
            In fact, it is absolutely necessary that in every word we should <lb/>
            perceive directly, and without the assistance of any demonstra- <lb/>
            tion, the fundamental notion which it expresses, if we wish to <lb/>
             <pb n="438"/>
            have any foundation to which we may refer our researches, our <lb/>
            difficulties, and our personal judgments, whatever in other <lb/>
            respects may be the criterion which we adopt, whether we take <lb/>
            as our standard the impressions produced on our senses, or <lb/>
            the actual impression in general; or whether we cling to the <lb/>
            idea by itself, or to any other criterion.</p>
          <p>"We must also note carefully the impressions which we <lb/>
            receive in the presence of objects, in order to bring ourselves <lb/>
            back to that point in the circumstances in which it is ne- <lb/>
            cessary to suspend the judgment, or even when the question <lb/>
            is about things, the evidence of which is not immediately per- <lb/>
            ceived.</p>
          <p>" When these foundations are once laid we may pass to the <lb/>
            study of those things, the evidence of which is not immediate. <lb/>
            And, first of all, we must admit that nothing can come of that <lb/>
            which does not exist; for, were the fact otherwise, then every <lb/>
            thing would be produced from everything, and there would be <lb/>
            no need of any seed. And if that which disappeared were so <lb/>
            absolutely destroyed as to become non-existent, then every <lb/>
            thing would soon perish, as the things with which they would <lb/>
            be dissolved would have no existence. But, in truth, the <lb/>
            universal whole always was such as it now is, and always <lb/>
            will be such. For there is nothing into which it can change ; <lb/>
            for there is nothing beyond this universal whole which can <lb/>
            penetrate into it, and produce any change in it."</p>
          <p>(And Epicurus establishes the same principles at the <lb/>
            beginning of the great Abridgment; and in the first book <lb/>
            of his treatise on Nature.)* “ Now the universal whole is a <lb/>
            body; for our senses bear us witness in every case that bodies <lb/>
            have a real existence ; and the evidence of the senses, as I <lb/>
            have said before, -ought to be the rule of our reasonings about <lb/>
            everything which is not directly perceived. Otherwise, if that <lb/>
            which we call the vacuum, or space, or intangible nature, had <lb/>
            not a real existence, there would be nothing on which the <lb/>
            bodies could be contained, or across which they could move, as <lb/>
            we see that they really do move. Let us add to this reflection <lb/>
            that one cannot conceive, either in virtue of perception, or of <lb/>
            any analogy founded on perception, Any general quality pe- <note type="footnote"> * This sentence is a remarkof Diogenes' himself. There are several <lb/>

            culiar to all beings which is not either an attribute, or an <lb/>
            accident of the body, or of the vacuum."</p>
          <p>(The same principles are laid down in the first, and four- <lb/>
            teenth, and fifteenth book of the treatise on Nature ; and also <lb/>
            in the Great Abridgment.)</p>
          <p>" Now, of bodies, some are combinations, and some the <lb/>
            elements out of which these combinations are formed. These <lb/>
            last are indivisible, and protected from every kind of trans- <lb/>
            formation ; otherwise everything would be resolved into non- <lb/>
            existence. They exist by their own force, in the midst of the <lb/>
            dissolution of the combined bodies, being absolutely full, and <lb/>
            as such offering no handle for destruction to take hold of. It <lb/>
            follows, therefore, as a matter of absolute necessity, that the <lb/>
            principles of things must be corporeal, indivisible elements.</p>
          <p>" The universe is infinite. For that which is finite has an <lb/>
            extreme, and that which has an extreme is looked at in relation <lb/>
            to something else. Consequently, that which has not an <lb/>
            extreme, has no boundary; and if it has no boundary, it must be <lb/>
            infinite, and not terminated by any limit. The universe then is <lb/>
            infinite, both with reference to the quantity of bodies of which <lb/>
            it is made up, and to the magnitude of the vacuum ; for if <lb/>
            the vacuum were infinite, the bodies being finite, then, the <lb/>
            bodies would not be able to rest in any place ; they would be <lb/>
            transported about, scattered across the infinite vacuum for <lb/>
            want of any power to steady themselves, or to keep one another <lb/>
            in their places by mutual repulsion. If, on the other hand, <lb/>
            the vacuum were finite, the bodies being infinite, then the <lb/>
            bodies clearly could never be contained in the vacuum.</p>
          <p>"Again: the atoms which form the bodies, these full elements <lb/>
            from which the combined bodies come, and into which they <lb/>
            resolve themselves, assume an incalculable variety of forms, <lb/>
            for the numerous differences which the bodies present cannot <lb/>
            possibly result from an aggregate of the same forms. Each <lb/>
            variety of forms contains an infinity of atoms, but there is not <lb/>
            for that reason an infinity of atoms; it is only the number of <lb/>
            them which is beyond all calculation."</p>
          <p>(Epicurus adds, a little lower down, that divisibility, ad in- <lb/>
            finitum, is impossible; for, says he, the only things which <lb/>
            change are the qualities; unless, indeed, one wishes to pro- <lb/>
            ceed from division to division, till one arrives absolutely at <lb/>
            infinite littleness.)</p><pb n="440"/>
            
          <p>" The atoms are in a continual state of motion."</p>
          <p>(He says, farther on, that they move with an equal rapidity <lb/>
            from all eternity, since the vacuum offers no more resistance <lb/>
            to the lightest than it does to the heaviest.)</p>
          <p>"Among the atoms, some are separated by great distances, <lb/>
            others come very near to one another in the formation of com- <lb/>
            bined bodies, or at times are enveloped by others which are <lb/>
            combining; but in this latter case they, nevertheless, preserve <lb/>
            their own peculiar motion, thanks to the nature of the vacuum, <lb/>
            which separates the one from the other, and yet offers them no <lb/>
            resistance. The solidity which they possess causes them, <lb/>
            while knocking against one another, to re-act the one upon <lb/>
            the other; till at last the repeated shocks bring on the disso- <lb/>
            lution of the combined body; and for all this there is no <lb/>
            external cause, the atoms and the vacuum being the only <lb/>
            causes."</p>
          <p>(He says, further on, that the atoms have no peculiar quality <lb/>
            of their own, except from magnitude and weight. As to colour, <lb/>
            he says in the twelfth book of his Principia, that it varies <lb/>
            according to the position of the atoms. Moreover, he does not <lb/>
            attribute to the atoms any kind of dimensions ; and, accordingly, <lb/>
            no atom has ever been perceived by the senses; but this <lb/>
            expression, if people only recollect what is here said, will by <lb/>
            itself offer to the thoughts a sufficient image of the nature of <lb/>
            things.)</p>
          <p>" But, again, the worlds also are infinite, whether they re- <lb/>
            semble this one of ours or whether they are different from it. <lb/>
            For, as the atoms are, as to their number, infinite, as I have <lb/>
            proved above, they necessarily move about at immense dis- <lb/>
            tances ; for besides, this infinite multitude of atoms, of which <lb/>
            the world is formed, or by which it is produced, could not be <lb/>
            entirely absorbed by one single world, nor even by any worlds, <lb/>
            the number of which was limited, whether we suppose them <lb/>
            like this world of ours, or different from it. There is, there- <lb/>
            fore, no fact inconsistent with an infinity of worlds.</p>
          <p>" Moreover, there are images resembling, as far as their form <lb/>
            goes, the solid bodies which we see, but which differ materially <lb/>
            from them in the thinness of their substance. In fact it is not <lb/>
            impossible but that there may be in space some secretions of <lb/>
            this kind, and an aptitude to form surfaces without depth, and <lb/>
            of an extreme thinness; or else that from the solids there <lb/>
             <pb n="441"/>
            may emanate some particles which preserve the connection, the <lb/>
            disposition, and the motion which they had in the body. I <lb/>
            give the name of images to these representations; and, indeed, <lb/>
            their movement through the vacuum taking place, without <lb/>
            meeting any obstacle or hindrance, perfects all imaginable <lb/>
            extent in an inconceivable moment of time; for it is the <lb/>
            meeting of obstacles, or the absence of obstacles, which pro- <lb/>
            duces the rapidity or the slowness of their motion. At all <lb/>
            events, a body in motion does not find itself, at any moment <lb/>
            imaginable, in two places at the same time; that is quite <lb/>
            inconceivable. From whatever point of infinity it arrives at <lb/>
            some appreciable moment, and whatever may be the spot in <lb/>
            its course in which we perceive its motion, it has evidently <lb/>
            quitted that spot at the moment of our thought; for this <lb/>
            motion which, as we have admitted up to this point, encounters <lb/>
            no obstacle to its rapidity, is wholly in the same condition as <lb/>
            that the rapidity of which is diminished by the shock of some <lb/>
            resistance.</p>
          <p>"It is useful, also, to retain this principle, and to know that <lb/>
            the images have an incomparable thinness; which fact indeed <lb/>
            is in no respect contradicted by sensible appearances. From <lb/>
            which it follows that their rapidity also is incomparable ; for <lb/>
            they find everywhere an easy passage, and besides, their infinite <lb/>
            smallness causes them to experience no shock, or at all events <lb/>
            to experience but a very slight one, while an infinite multitude <lb/>
            of elements very soon encounter some resistance.</p>
          <p>" One must not forget that the production of images is simul- <lb/>
            taneous with the thought; for from the surface of the bodies <lb/>
            images of this kind are continually flowing off in an insen- <lb/>
            3ible manner indeed, because they are immediately replaced. <lb/>
            They preserve for a long time the same disposition, and the <lb/>
            same arrangement that the atoms do in the solid body, <lb/>
            although, notwithstanding, their form may be sometimes <lb/>
            altered. The direct production of images in space is equally <lb/>
            instantaneous, because these images are only light substances <lb/>
            lestitute of depth.</p>
          <p>" But there are other manners in which natures of this kind <lb/>
            ire produced; for there is nothing in all this which at all <lb/>
            contradicts the senses, if one only considers in what way the <lb/>
            senses are exercised, and if one is inclined to explain the <lb/>
            -elation which is established between external objects and <lb/>
             <pb n="442"/>
            ourselves. Also, one must admit that something passes from <lb/>
            external objects into us in order to produce in us sight and <lb/>
            the knowledge of forms; for it is difficult to conceive that <lb/>
            external objects can affect us through the medium of the air <lb/>
            which is between us and them, or by means of rays, whatever <lb/>
            emissions proceed from us to them, so as to give us an im- <lb/>
            pression of their form and colour. This phenomenon, on the <lb/>
            contrary, is perfectly explained, if we admit that certain images <lb/>
            of the same colour, of the same shape, and of a proportionate <lb/>
            magnitude pass from these objects to us, and so arrive at <lb/>
            being seen and comprehended. These images are animated. <lb/>
            by an exceeding rapidity, and, as on the other side, the send <lb/>
            object forming a compact mass, and comprising a vast quantity <lb/>
            of atoms, emits always the same quantity of particles, the <lb/>
            vision is continued, and only produces in us one single per- <lb/>
            ception which preserves always the same relation to the <lb/>
            object. Every conception, every sensible perception which <lb/>
            bears upon the form or the other attributes of these images, is <lb/>
            only the same form of the solid perceived directly, either in <lb/>
            virtue of a sort of actual and continued condensation of the <lb/>
            image, or in consequence of the traces which it has left in us.</p>
          <p>Error and false judgments always depend upon the suppo- <lb/>
            sition that a preconceived idea will be confirmed, or at all <lb/>
            events will not be overturned, by evidence. Then, when it is <lb/>
            not confirmed, we form our judgment in virtue of a sort of <lb/>
            initiation of the thoughts connected, it is true with the per- <lb/>
            ception, and with a direct representation ; but still connected <lb/>
            also with a conception peculiar to ourselves, which is the <lb/>
            parent of error. In fact the representations which intelligence <lb/>
            reflects like a mirror, whether one perceives them in a dream, <lb/>
            or by any other conceptions of the intellect, or of any other of <lb/>
            the criteria, can never resemble the objects that one calls real <lb/>
            and true, unless there were objects of this kind perceived <lb/>
            directly. And, on the other side, error could not be possible, <lb/>
            if we did not receive some other motion also, a sort of initiative <lb/>
            of intelligence connected; it is true with direct representa- <lb/>
            tion, but going beyond that representative. These con- <lb/>
            ceptions being connected with the direct perception which <lb/>
            produces the representation, but going beyond it, in consequence <lb/>
            of a motion peculiar to the individual thought, produces error <lb/>
            when it is not confirmed by evidence, or when it is con- <lb/>
             <pb n="443"/>
            tradicted by evidence: but when it is confirmed, or when it is <lb/>
            not contradicted by evidence, then it produces truth.</p>
          <p>"We must carefully preserve these principles in order not to <lb/>
            reject the authority of the faculties which perceive truth <lb/>
            directly; and not, on the other hand, to allow what is false to <lb/>
            be established with equal firmness, so as to throw everything <lb/>
            into confusion.</p>
          <p>" Moreover, hearing is produced by some sort of current pro- <lb/>
            ceeding from something that speaks, or sounds, or roars, or in <lb/>
            any manner causes any sort of audible circumstance. And thin <lb/>
            current is diffused into small bodies resembling one another <lb/>
            in their parts ; which, preserving not only some kind of rela- <lb/>
            tion between one another, but even a sort of particular identity <lb/>
            with the object from which they emanate, puts Is, very fre- <lb/>
            quently, into a communication of sentiments with this object, <lb/>
            or at least causes us to become aware of the existence of some <lb/>
            external circumstance. If these currents did not carry with <lb/>
            them some sort of sympathy, then there would be no such per- <lb/>
            ception. We must not therefore think that it is the air which <lb/>
            receives a certain form, under the action of the voice or of <lb/>
            some other sound. For it is utterly impossible that the <lb/>
            voice should act in this manner on the air. But the per <lb/>
            cussion produced in us when we, by the utterance of a voice, <lb/>
            cause a disengagement of certain particles, constitutes a <lb/>
            current resembling a light whisper, and prepares an acoustic <lb/>
            feeling for us.</p>
          <p>“ We must admit that the case of smelling is the same as <lb/>
            that of hearing. There would be no sense of smell if there <lb/>
            did not emanate from most objects certain particles capable <lb/>
            of producing an impression on the smell. One class being <lb/>
            ill-suited to the organ, and consequently producing a disordered <lb/>
            state of it, the other being suited to it, and causing it no <lb/>
            distress.</p>
          <p>“ One must also allow, that the atoms possess no one of the <lb/>
            qualities of sensible objects, except form, weight, magnitude, <lb/>
            and anything else is unavoidably inherent in form ; in fact, <lb/>
            every quality is changeable, but the atoms are necessarily <lb/>
            unchangeable; for it is impossible but that in the dissolution <lb/>
            of combined bodies, there must be something which continues <lb/>
            solid and indestructible, of such a kind, that it will not <lb/>
            change either into what does riot exist, or out of what does <lb/>
             <pb n="444"/>
            not exist; but that it results either from a simple displace <lb/>
            ment of parts, which is the most usual case, or from the <lb/>
            addition or subtraction of certain particles. It follows from <lb/>
            that, that that which does not admit of any change in itself, <lb/>
            is imperishable, participates in no respect in the nature oi <lb/>
            changeable things, and in a word, has its dimensions and <lb/>
            forms immutably determined. And this is proved plainly <lb/>
            enough, because even in the transformations which take place <lb/>
            under our eyes, in consequence of the retrenchment of certain <lb/>
            parts, we can still recognise the form of these constituent <lb/>
            parts; while those qualities, which are not constituent parts, <lb/>
            do not remain like the form, but perish in the dissolution of <lb/>
            the combination. The attributes which we have indicated, <lb/>
            suffice to explain all the differences of combined bodies; for <lb/>
            we must inevitably leave something indestructible, lest every- <lb/>
            thing should resolve itself into non-existence.</p>
          <p>"However, one must not believe that every kind of magni- <lb/>
            tude exists in atoms, lest we find ourselves contradicted by <lb/>
            phenomena. But we must admit that there are atoms of <lb/>
            different magnitude, because, as that is the case, it is then <lb/>
            more easy to explain the impressions and sensations ; at all <lb/>
            events, I repeat, it is not necessary for the purpose of explain- <lb/>
            ing the differences of the qualities, to attribute to atoms <lb/>
            every kind of magnitude.</p>
          <p>“ We must not suppose either, that an atom can become <lb/>
            visible to us ; for, first of all, one does not see that that is the <lb/>
            case, and besides, one cannot even conceive, how an atom is <lb/>
            to become visible; besides, we must not believe, that in a <lb/>
            finite body there are particles of every sort, infinite in num- <lb/>
            ber ; consequently, one must not only reject the doctrine of in- <lb/>
            finite divisibility in parcels smaller and smaller, lest we should <lb/>
            be reducing everything to nothing, and find ourselves forced to <lb/>
            admit, that in a mass composed of a crowd of elements, exist- <lb/>
            ence can reduce itself to non-existence. But one cannot even <lb/>
            suppose that a finite object can be susceptible of transforma- <lb/>
            tions ad infinitum, or even of transformation into smaller <lb/>
            objects than itself; for when once one has said that there are <lb/>
            in an object particles of every kind, infinite in number, there <lb/>
            is absolutely no means whatever of imagining that this object <lb/>
            can have only a finite magnitude; in fact, it is evident that <lb/>
            these particles, infinite in number, have some kind of dimen- <lb/>
             <pb n="445"/>
            sion or other, and whatever this dimension may be in other <lb/>
            respects, the objects which are composed of it will have an <lb/>
            infinite magnitude; in presenting forms which are deter- <lb/>
            mined, and limits which are perceived by the senses, one con- <lb/>
            ceives, easily, without its being necessary to study this last <lb/>
            question directly, that this would be the consequence of the <lb/>
            contrary supposition, and that consequently, one must come to <lb/>
            look at every object as infinite.</p>
          <p>" One must also admit, that the most minute particle per- <lb/>
            ceptible to the sense, is neither absolutely like the objects <lb/>
            which are susceptible of transformation, nor absolutely differ- <lb/>
            ent from them. It has some characteristics in common with <lb/>
            the object which admit of transformation, but it also differs <lb/>
            from them, inasmuch as it does not allow any distinct parts <lb/>
            to be discerned in it. When then, in virtue of these common <lb/>
            characteristics, and of this resemblance, we wish to form an <lb/>
            idea of the smallest particle perceptible by the senses, in <lb/>
            taking the objects which change for our terms of comparison, <lb/>
            it is necessary that we should seize on some characteristic <lb/>
            common to these different objects. In this way, we examine <lb/>
            them successively, from the first to the last, not by themselves, <lb/>
            nor as composed of parts in juxtaposition, but only in their <lb/>
            extent; in other words, we consider the magnitudes by them- <lb/>
            selves, and in an abstract manner, inasmuch as they measure, <lb/>
            the greater a greater extent, and the smaller a smaller extent. <lb/>
            This analogy applies to the atom, as far as we consider it as <lb/>
            having the smallest dimensions possible. Evidently by its <lb/>
            minuteness, it differs from all sensible objects, still this <lb/>
            analogy is applicable to it; in a word, we establish by this <lb/>
            comparison, that the atom really has some extent, but we <lb/>
            exclude all considerable dimensions, for the sake of only <lb/>
            investing it with the smallest proportions.* <note type="footnote"> * This is the argument in its completed form : " We can only form <lb/>
            in idea of an atom by analogy, and analogy demonstrates to us that it <lb/>
            is not of infinite littleness. In fact, let us compare it to the smallest <lb/>
            particles recognisable by sense, and then let us endeavour to form an <lb/>
            idea of these last. To do this we must take a term of comparison in <lb/>
            complex objects, which are composed of various parts. Abstracting <lb/>
            'rom these all other characteristics but that of extent, we see that these <lb/>
            objects have dimensions, some greater and some less, measuring an ex- <lb/>
            cent which is greater or less as the case may be. The smallest sensible <lb/>
            particle will then have its dimensions; it will measure the smallest pes- </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="446"/>
            “ We must also admit, in taking for our guide, the reasoning <lb/>
            which discourses to us things which are invisible to the senses, <lb/>
            that the most minute magnitudes, those which are not com- <lb/>
            pound magnitudes, and which from the limit of sensible <lb/>
            extent, are the first measure of the other magnitudes which <lb/>
            are only called greater or less in their relation to the others. <lb/>
            For these relations which they maintain with these particles, <lb/>
            which are not subject to transformation, suffice to give them <lb/>
            this characteristic of first measure. But they cannot, like <lb/>
            atoms, combine themselves, and form compound bodies in <lb/>
            virtue of any motion belonging to themselves.</p>
          <p>" Moreover, we must not say (while speaking of the infinite), <lb/>
            that such or such a point is the highest point of it, or the <lb/>
            lowest. For height and lowness must not be predicated of the <lb/>
            infinite. We know, in reality, that if, wishing to determine <lb/>
            the infinite, we conceive a point above our head, this point, <lb/>
            whatever it may be, will never appear to us to have the cha- <lb/>
            racter in question: otherwise, that which would be situated <lb/>
            above the point so conceived as the limit of the infinite, would <lb/>
            be at the same moment, and by virtue of its relation to the <lb/>
            same point, both high and low; and this is impossible to <lb/>
            imagine.</p>
          <p>" It follows that thought can only conceive that one single <lb/>
            movement of transference, from low to high, ad infinitum; <lb/>
            and one single movement from high to low. From low to <lb/>
            high, when even the object in motion, going from us to the <lb/>
            places situated above our heads, meets ten thousand times with <lb/>
            the feet of those who are above us; and from high to low, <lb/>
            when in the same way it advances towards the heads of those <lb/>
            who are below us. For these two movements, looked at by <lb/>
            themselves and in their whole, are conceived as really opposed <lb/>
            the one to the other, in their progress towards the infinite.</p>
          <p>" Moreover, all the atoms are necessarily animated by the <lb/>
            same rapidity, when they move across the vacuum, or when no <lb/>
            obstacle thwarts them. For why should heavy atoms have a <lb/>
            more rapid movement than those which are small and light, <lb/>
            since in no quarter do they encounter any obstacle ? Why, on <note type="footnote"> sible sensible extent, that is to say, it will not be infinitely smalL <lb/>
            Applying this analogy to an atom, one comes to conceive it as measur- <lb/>
            ing the smallest extent possible, but not as having no extent at all, <lb/>
            which was what Epicurus wished to prove.”- French Translator. </note> <pb n="447"/>
             <unclear/><lb/>
            e other hand, should the small atoms have a rapidity superior <lb/>
            that of the large ones, since both the one and the other <lb/>
            nd everywhere an easy passage, from the very moment that <lb/>
            o obstacle intervenes to thwart their movements ? Move- <lb/>
            lent from low to high, horizontal movement to and fro, in <lb/>
            irtue of the reciprocal percussion of the atoms, movement <lb/>
            ownwards, in virtue of their weight, will be all equal, for in <lb/>
            hatever sense the atom moves, it must have a movement as <lb/>
            ipid as the thought, till the moment when it is repelled, in <lb/>
            irtue of some external cause, or of its own proper weight, by <lb/>
            he shock of some object which resists it.</p>
          <p>" Again, even in the compound bodies, one atom does not <lb/>
            love more rapidly than another. In fact, if one only looks <lb/>
            t the continued movement of an atom which takes place in <lb/>
            a indivisible moment of time, the briefest possible, they all <lb/>
            ave a movement equally rapid. At the same time, an atom <lb/>
            as not, in any moment perceptible to the intelligence, a con- <lb/>
            inued movement in the same direction; but rather a series <lb/>
            f oscillating movements from which there results, in the last <lb/>
            nalysis, a continued movement perceptible to the senses. <lb/>
            f then, one were to suppose, in virtue of a reasoning on <lb/>
            hings invisible, that, in the intervals of time accessible to <lb/>
            bought, the atoms have a continued movement one would <lb/>
            eceive one's self, for that which is conceived by the thought is <lb/>
            rue as well as that which is directly perceived.</p>
          <p>" Let us now return to the study of the affections, and of the <lb/>
            ensations; for this will be the best method of proving that <lb/>
            he soul is a bodily substance composed of slight particles, <lb/>
            iffused over all the members of the body, and presenting a <lb/>
            reat analogy to a sort of spirit, having an admixture of heat, <lb/>
            esembling at one time one, and at another time the other of <lb/>
            hose two principles. There exists in it a special part, endowed <lb/>
            rith an extreme mobility, in consequence of the exceeding <lb/>
            lightness of the elements which compose it, and also in <lb/>
            eference to its more immediate sympathy with the rest of the <lb/>
            ody. That it is which the faculties of the soul sufficiently <lb/>
            rove, and the passions, and the mobility of its nature, and <lb/>
            he thoughts, and, in a word, everything, the privation of which <lb/>
            s death. We must admit that it is in the soul most especially <lb/>
            hat the principle of sensation resides. At the same time, it <unclear/> <lb/>
            ould not possess this power if it were not enveloped by the <lb/>
             <pb n="448"/>
            rest of the body which communicates it to it, and in its turn <lb/>
            receives it from it; but only in a certain measure; for there <lb/>
            are certain affections of the soul of which it is not capable.</p>
          <p>“ It is on that account that, when the soul departs, the body <lb/>
            is no longer possessed of sensation ; for it has not this power, <lb/>
            (that of sensation namely) in itself; but, on the other hand, <lb/>
            this power can only manifest itself in the soul through the <lb/>
            medium of the body. The soul, reflecting the manifestations <lb/>
            which are accomplished in the substance which environs it, <lb/>
            realises in itself, in a virtue or power which belongs to it, the <lb/>
            sensible affections, and immediately communicates them to the <lb/>
            body in virtue of the reciprocal bonds of sympathy which unite <lb/>
            it to the body ; that is the reason why the destruction of a part <lb/>
            of the body does not draw after it a cessation of all feeling in <lb/>
            the soul while it resides in the body, provided that the senses <lb/>
            still preserve some energy ; although, nevertheless, the disso- <lb/>
            lution of the corporeal covering, or even of any one of its <lb/>
            portions, may sometimes bring on with it the destruction of <lb/>
            the soul.</p>
          <p>" The rest of the body, on the other hand, even when it <lb/>
            remains, either as a whole, or in any part, loses all feeling by <lb/>
            the dispersion of that aggregate of atoms, whatever it may be, <lb/>
            that forms the soul. When the entire combination of the body <lb/>
            is dissolved, then the soul too is dissolved, and ceases to retain <lb/>
            those faculties which were previously inherent in it, and espe- <lb/>
            dally the power of motion ; so that sensation perishes equally <lb/>
            as far as the soul is concerned ; for it is impossible to imagine j <lb/>
            that it still feels, from the moment when it is no longer in the1 <lb/>
            same conditions of existence, and no longer possesses the same <lb/>
            movements of existence in reference to the same organic system; <lb/>
            from the moment, in short, when the things which cover and <lb/>
            surround it are no longer such, that it retains in them the <lb/>
            same movements as before.</p>
          <p>(Epicurus expresses the same ideas in other works, and adds <lb/>
            that the soul is composed of atoms of the most perfect light- <lb/>
            ness and roundness ; atoms wholly different from those of fire. <lb/>
            He distinguishes in it the irrational part which is diffused over <lb/>
            the whole body, from the rational part which has its seat in <lb/>
            the chest, as is proved by the emotions of fear and joy. He <lb/>
            adds that sleep is produced when the parts of the soul diffused <lb/>
            over the whole of the body concentre themselves, or when they <lb/>
             <pb n="449"/>
            disperse and escape by the pores of the body; for particles <lb/>
            emanate from all bodies.)</p>
          <p>" It must also be observed, that I use the word incorporeal <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀσώματος</foreign>) in the usual acceptation of the word, to express <lb/>
            that which is in itself conceived as such. Now, nothing can- <lb/>
            be conceived in itself as incorporeal except the vacuum; but <lb/>
            the vacuum cannot be either passive or active; it is only the <lb/>
            condition and the place of movement. Accordingly, they who <lb/>
            pretend that the soul is incorporeal, utter words destitute of <lb/>
            sense; for, if it had this character, it would not be able either <lb/>
            to do or to suffer anything ; but, as it is, we see plainly enough <lb/>
            that it is liable to both these circumstances.</p>
          <p>" Let us then apply all these reasonings to the affections and <lb/>
            sensations, recollecting the ideas which we laid down at the <lb/>
            beginning, and then we shall see clearly that these general <lb/>
            principles contain an exact solution of all the particular cases.</p>
          <p>" As to forms, and hues, and magnitudes, and weight, and the <lb/>
            other qualities which one looks upon as attributes, whether it <lb/>
            be of every body, or of those bodies only which are visible and <lb/>
            perceived by the senses, this is the point of view under which <lb/>
            they ought to be considered : they are not particular sub- <lb/>
            stances, having a peculiar existence of their own, for that <lb/>
            cannot be conceived ; nor can one say any more that they have <lb/>
            no reality at all. They are not incorporeal substances inherent <lb/>
            in the body, nor are they parts of the body. But they consti- <lb/>
            tute by their union the eternal substance and the essence of <lb/>
            the entire body. We must not fancy, however, that the body <lb/>
            is composed of them, as an aggregate is formed of particles of <lb/>
            the smallest dimensions of atoms or magnitudes, whatever <lb/>
            they may be, smaller than the compound body itself; they <lb/>
            only constitute by their union, I repeat, the eternal substance <lb/>
            of the body. Each of these attributes has ideas and particular <lb/>
            perceptions which correspond to it; but they cannot be per- <lb/>
            ceived independently of the whole subject taken entirely; the <lb/>
            union of all these perceptions forms the idea of the body. <lb/>
            Bodies often possess other attributes which are not eternally <lb/>
            inherent in them, but which, nevertheless, cannot be ranged <lb/>
            among the incorporeal and invisible things. Accordingly, it is <lb/>
            sufficient to express the general idea of the movement of <lb/>
            transference to enable us to conceive in a moment certain <lb/>
            Distinct qualities, and those combined beings, which, being <note type="footnote"> G G </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="450"/>
            taken in their totality, receive the name of bodies; and the <lb/>
            necessary and eternal attributes without which the body cannot i <lb/>
            be conceived.</p>
          <p>" There are certain conceptions corresponding to these attri- <lb/>
            butes ; but, nevertheless, they cannot be known abstractedly, <lb/>
            and independently of some subjects ; and further, inasmuch <lb/>
            as they are not attributes necessarily inherent in the idea of a <lb/>
            body, one can only conceive them in the moment in which <lb/>
            they are visible ; they are realities nevertheless ; and one <lb/>
            must not refuse them being an existence merely because they <lb/>
            have neither the characteristic of the compound beings to <lb/>
            which we give the name of bodies, nor that of the eternal <lb/>
            attributes. We should be equally deceived if we were to <lb/>
            suppose that they have a separate and independent existence ; <lb/>
            for that is true neither of them nor of the eternal attributes. <lb/>
            They are, as one sees plainly, accidents of the body ; accidents <lb/>
            which do not of necessity make any part of its nature; which <lb/>
            cannot be considered as independent substances, but still to <lb/>
            each of which sensation gives the peculiar character under <lb/>
            which it appears to us.</p>
          <p>" Another important question is that of time. Here we <lb/>
            cannot apply any more the method of examination to which <lb/>
            we submit other objects, which we study with reference to a <lb/>
            given subject; and which we refer to the preconceptions which <lb/>
            exist in ourselves. We must seize, by analogy, and going <lb/>
            round the whole circle of things comprised under this general, <lb/>
            denomination of time—we must seize, I say-that essential <lb/>
            character which causes us to say that a time is long or short. <lb/>
            It is not necessary for that purpose to seek for any new forms <lb/>
            of expression as preferable to those which are in common use ; <lb/>
            we may content ourselves with those by which time is usually <lb/>
            indicated. Nor need we, as certain philosophers do. affirm <lb/>
            any particular attribute of time, for that would be to suppose <lb/>
            that its essence is the same as that of this attribute. It is <lb/>
            sufficient too seek for the ingredients of which this particular <lb/>
            nature which we call time is composed, and for the means by <lb/>
            which it is measured. For this we have no need of demon- <lb/>
            stration; a simple exposition is sufficient. It is, in fact, <lb/>
            evident, that we speak of time as composed of days and nights, <lb/>
            and parts of days and nights ; passiveness and impossibility, <lb/>
            movement and repose, are equally comprised in time. In <lb/>
             <pb n="451"/>
            short, it is evident that in connection with these different <lb/>
            states, we conceive a particular property to which we give the <lb/>
            name of time.</p>
          <p>(Epicurus lays down the same principles in the second book <lb/>
            of his treatise on Nature, and in his great Abridgment.)</p>
          <p>" It is from the infinite that the worlds are derived, and all <lb/>
            the finite aggregates which present numerous analogies with <lb/>
            the things which we observe under our own eyes. Each of <lb/>
            these objects, great and small, has been separated from the <lb/>
            infinite by a movement peculiar to itself. On the other hand, <lb/>
            all these bodies will be successively destroyed, some more, and <lb/>
            others less rapidly ; some under the influence of one cause, and <lb/>
            others because of the agency of some other.</p>
          <p>(It is evident, after this, that Epicurus regards the worlds <lb/>
            as perishable, since he admits that their parts are capable of <lb/>
            transformation. He also says in other places, that the earth <lb/>
            rests suspended in the air.)</p>
          <p>“ We must not believe that the worlds have of necessity all <lb/>
            one identical form.</p>
          <p>(He says, in fact, in the twelfth book of his treatise on the <lb/>
            World, that the worlds differ from one another ; some being <lb/>
            spherical, other elliptical, and others of other shapes.)</p>
          <p>" Nevertheless, there are not worlds of every possible form <lb/>
            md shape.</p>
          <p>" Let us also beware of thinking that animals are derived <lb/>
            rom the infinite ; for there is no one who can prove that the <lb/>
            germs from which animals are born, and plants, and all the <lb/>
            )ther objects which we contemplate, have been brought from the <lb/>
            exterior in such a world, and that this same world would not <lb/>
            have been able to produce them of itself. This remark applies <lb/>
            particularly to the earth.</p>
          <p>" Again, we must admit that in many and various respects, <lb/>
            nature is both instructed and constrained by circumstances <lb/>
            hemselves; and that reason subsequently makes perfect and <lb/>
            nriches with additional discoveries the things which it has <lb/>
            lorrowed from nature; in some cases rapidly, and in others <lb/>
            acre slowly. And in some cases according to periods and <lb/>
            imes greater than those which proceed from the infinite; in <lb/>
            ther cases according to those which are smaller. So, originally <unclear/> <lb/>
            t was only in virtue of express agreements that one gave <lb/>
            ames to things. But men whose ideas and passions varied <note type="footnote"> G G 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="452"/>
            according to their respective nations, formed these names of! <lb/>
            their own accord, uttering divers sounds produced by each <lb/>
            passion, or by each idea, following the differences of the <lb/>
            situations and of the peoples. At a later period one established <lb/>
            in each nation, in a uniform manner, particular terms intended <lb/>
            to render the relations more easy, and language more concise. <lb/>
            Educated men introduced the notion of things not discover- <lb/>
            able by the senses, and appropriated words to them when' <lb/>
            they found themselves under the necessity of uttering their; <lb/>
            thoughts; after this, other men, guided in every point by <lb/>
            reason, interpreted these words in the same sense.</p>
          <p>" As to the heavenly phenomena, such as the motion and <lb/>
            course of the stars, the eclipses, their rising and setting, and, <lb/>
            all other appearances of the same kind, we must beware of <lb/>
            thinking that they are produced by any particular being which <lb/>
            has regulated, or whose business it is to regulate, for the <lb/>
            future, the order of the world, a being immortal and perfectly <lb/>
            happy; for the cares and anxieties, the benevolence and the <lb/>
            anger, far from being compatible with felicity, are, on the con- <lb/>
            trary, the consequence of weakness, of fear, and of the want <lb/>
            which a thing has of something else. We must not fancy <lb/>
            either that these globes of fire, which roll on in space, enjoy <lb/>
            a perfect happiness, and give themselves, with reflection <lb/>
            and wisdom, the motions which they possess. But we must <lb/>
            respect the established notions on this subject, provided, <lb/>
            nevertheless, that they do not all contradict the respect due <lb/>
            to truth; for nothing is more calculated to trouble the soul <lb/>
            than this strife of contradictory notions and principles. We <lb/>
            must therefore admit that from the first movement impressed <lb/>
            on the heavenly bodies since the organization of the worli <lb/>
            there is derived a sort of necessity which regulates their <unclear>course</unclear> <lb/>
            to this day.</p>
          <p>" Let us be well assured thatit is to physiology that it belongs <lb/>
            to determine the causes of the most elevated phænomena, and <lb/>
            that happiness consists, above all things, in the science of the <lb/>
            heavenly things and their nature, and in the knowledge of <lb/>
            analogous phænomena which may aid us in the comprehension <lb/>
            of the ethics. These heavenly phænomena admit of several <lb/>
            explanations; they have no reason of a necessary character, <lb/>
            and one may explain them in different manners. In a word, <lb/>
            they have no relation-a moment's consideration will prove <lb/>
             <pb n="453"/>
            this by itself—with those imperishable and happy natures <lb/>
            which admit of no division and of no confusion. As for the <lb/>
            theoretical knowledge of the rising and setting of the stars, <lb/>
            )f the movement of the sun between the tropics, of the <lb/>
            eclipses, and all other similar phenomena, that is utterly <lb/>
            useless, as far as any influence upon happiness that it can <lb/>
            have. Moreover, those who, though possessed of this know- <lb/>
            edge, are ignorant of nature, and of the most probable causes <lb/>
            of the phenomena, are no more protected from fear than if <lb/>
            ;hey were in the most complete ignorance; they even ex- <lb/>
            perience the most lively fears, for the trouble, with which the <lb/>
            knowledge of which they are possessed inspires them, can find <lb/>
            ao issue, and is not dissipated by a clear perception of the <lb/>
            reasons of these phenomena.</p>
          <p>" As to us, we find many explanations of the motions of the <lb/>
            sun, of the rising and setting of the stars, of the eclipses and <lb/>
            similar phenomena, just as well as of the more particular <lb/>
            phenomena. And one must not think that this method of <lb/>
            explanation is not sufficient to procure happiness and tran- <lb/>
            quillity. Let us content ourselves with examining how it is <lb/>
            that similar phenomena are brought about under our own eyes, <lb/>
            and let us apply these observations to the heavenly objects <lb/>
            and to everything which is not known but indirectly. Let us <lb/>
            despise those people who are unable to distinguish facts sus- <lb/>
            ceptible of different explanations from others which can only <lb/>
            exist and be explained in one single way. Let us disdain those <lb/>
            men who do not know, by means of the different images which <lb/>
            result from distance, how to give an account of the different <lb/>
            appearances of things ; who, in a word, are ignorant what are <lb/>
            the objects which can excite any trouble in us. If, then, we <lb/>
            know that such a phenomenon can be brought about in the <lb/>
            same manner as another given phenomenon of the same cha- <lb/>
            racter which does not inspire us with any apprehension ; and <lb/>
            if, on the other hand, we know that it can take place in many <lb/>
            different manners, we shall not be more troubled at the sight <lb/>
            of it than if we knew the real cause of it.</p>
          <p>" We must also recollect that that which principally con- <lb/>
            tributes to trouble the spirit of men is the persuasion which <lb/>
            they cherish that the stars are beings imperishable and per- <lb/>
            fectly happy, and that then one's thoughts and actions are in <lb/>
            contradiction to the will of these superior beings; they also, <lb/>
             <pb n="454"/>
            being deluded by these fables, apprehend an eternity of evils, <lb/>
            they fear the insensibility of death, as that could affect them. <lb/>
            What do I say ? It is not even belief, but inconsiderateness <lb/>
            and blindness which govern them in every thing, to such <lb/>
            a degree that, not calculating these fears, they are just as much <lb/>
            troubled as if they had really faith in these vain phantoms. <lb/>
            And the real freedom from this kind of trouble consists in <lb/>
            being emancipated from all these things, and in preserving <lb/>
            the recollection of all the principles which we have esta- <lb/>
            blished, especially of the most essential of them. Accordingly, <lb/>
            it is well to pay a scrupulous attention to existing phenomena <lb/>
            and to the sensations, to the general sensations for general <lb/>
            things, and to the particular sensations for particular things. <lb/>
            In a word, we must take note of this, the immediate evidence <lb/>
            with which each of these judicial faculties furnishes us ; for, if <lb/>
            we attend to these points, namely, whence confusion and fear <lb/>
            arise, we shall divine the causes correctly, and we shall deliver <lb/>
            ourselves from those feelings, tracing back the heavenly phæ- <lb/>
            nomena to their causes, and also all the others which present <lb/>
            themselves at every step, and inspire the common people with <lb/>
            extreme terror.</p>
          <p>" This, Herodotus, is a kind of summary and abridgment <lb/>
            of the whole question of natural philosophy. So that, if this <lb/>
            reasoning be allowed to be valid, and be preserved carefully in <lb/>
            the memory, the man who allows himself to be influenced by <lb/>
            it, even though he may not descend to a profound study of its <lb/>
            details, will have a great superiority of character over other <lb/>
            men. He will personally discover a great number of truths <lb/>
            which I have myself set forth in my entire work ; and these <lb/>
            truths being stored in his memory, will be a constant assistance <lb/>
            to him. By means of these principles, those who have descended <lb/>
            into the details, and have studied the question sufficiently, <lb/>
            will be able, in bringing in all their particular knowledge <lb/>
            to bear on the general subject, to run over without difficulty <lb/>
            almost the entire circle of the natural philosophy ; those, on <lb/>
            the other hand, who are not yet arrived at perfection, and <lb/>
            who have not been able to hear me lecture on these subjects, <lb/>
            will be able in their minds to run over the main of the <lb/>
            essential notions, and to derive assistance from them for the <lb/>
            tranquillity and happiness of life."</p>

          <p>XXV. About the heavenly bodies he writes thus :—</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">EPICURUS TO PYTHOCLES, WISHING HE MAY DO WELL.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>" Cleon has brought me your letter, in which you continue <lb/>
            to evince towards me an affection worthy of the friendship <lb/>
            which I have for you. You devote all your care, you tell me, to <lb/>
            engraving in your memory those ideas which contribute to the <lb/>
            happiness of life ; and you entreat me at the same time to <lb/>
            send you a simple abridgment and abstract of my ideas on <lb/>
            the heavenly phenomena, in order that you may without <lb/>
            difficulty preserve the recollection of them. For, say you, <lb/>
            what I have written on this subject in my other works is <lb/>
            difficult to recollect, even with continual study.</p>
          <p>" I willingly yield to your desire, and I have good hope, <lb/>
            that in fulfilling what you ask, I shall be useful too to many <lb/>
            others, especially to those who are as yet novices in the real <lb/>
            knowledge of nature, and to those to whom the perplexities <lb/>
            and the ordinary affairs of life leave but little leisure. Be <lb/>
            careful then to seize on those precepts thoroughly, engrave <lb/>
            them deeply in your memory, and meditate on them with the <lb/>
            abridgment addressed to Herodotus, which I also send you.</p>
          <p>" Know then, that it is with the knowledge of the heavenly <lb/>
            phænomena, both with those which are spoken of in contact <lb/>
            with one another, and of those which have a spontaneous exist- <lb/>
            ence, as with every other science ; it has no other aim but <lb/>
            that freedom from anxiety, and that calmness which is derived <lb/>
            from a firm belief.</p>
          <p>"It is not good to desire what is impossible, and to endeavour <lb/>
            to enunciate a uniform theory about everything ; accordingly, <lb/>
            we ought not here to adopt the method, which we have fol- <lb/>
            lowed in our researches into Ethics, or in the solution of <lb/>
            problems of natural philosophy. We there said, for instance; <lb/>
            that there are no other things, except bodies and the vacuum, <lb/>
            that the atoms are the principles of things, and so of the rest. <lb/>
            In a word, we gave a precise and simple explanation of every <lb/>
            fact, conformable to appearances.</p>
          <p>"We cannot act in the same way with respect to the hea- <lb/>
            venly phenomena; these productions may depend upon several <lb/>
            different causes, and we may give many different explanations on <lb/>
            this subject, equally agreeing with the impressions of the senses. <lb/>
            Besides, it is not here a question about reasoning on new prin- <lb/>
             <pb n="456"/>
            ciples, and of laying down, a priori, rules for the interpreta- <lb/>
            tion of nature ; the only guides for us to follow are the <lb/>
            appearances themselves ; for that which we have in view is <lb/>
            not a set of systems and vain opinions, but much rather a. life <lb/>
            exempt from every kind of disquietude.</p>
          <p>" The heavenly phænomena do not inspire those who give <lb/>
            different explanations of them, conformable with appearances, <lb/>
            instead of explaining them by hypothesis, with any alarm. <lb/>
            But if, abandoning hypothesis, one at the same time re- <lb/>
            nounces the attempt to explain them by means of analogies <lb/>
            founded on appearances, then one is placing one's self alto- <lb/>
            gether at a distance from the science of nature, in order to <lb/>
            fall into fables.</p>
          <p>" It is possible that the heavenly phenomena may present <lb/>
            some apparent characters which appear to assimilate them <lb/>
            to those phenomena which we see taking place around our- <lb/>
            selves, without there being any real analogy at the bottom. <lb/>
            For the heavenly phænomena may depend for their production <lb/>
            on many different causes; nevertheless, we must observe the <lb/>
            appearances presented by each, and we must distinguish the <lb/>
            different circumstances which attach to them, and which can <lb/>
            be explained in different manners by means of analogous <lb/>
            phenomena which arise under our eyes.</p>
          <p>“ The world is a collection of things embraced by the heaven, <lb/>
            containing the stars, the earth, and all visible objects. This <lb/>
            collection, separated from the infinite, is terminated by an <lb/>
            extremity, which is either rare, or dense, or revolving, or in a <lb/>
            state of repose, or of a round, or triangular, or of some shape <lb/>
            or other in fact, for it may be of any shape, the dissolution of <lb/>
            which must bring the destruction of everything which they <lb/>
            embrace. In fact, it can take place in every sort of way, since <lb/>
            there is not one of those things which are seen which testifies <lb/>
            against this world in which we cannot detect any extremity; <lb/>
            and that such worlds are infinite in number is easily seen, and <lb/>
            also that such a world can exist both in the world and in the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεταϰόσμιον</foreign>, as we call the space between the worlds, being a <lb/>
            huge space made up of plenum and vacuum, but not, as some <lb/>
            philosophers pretend, an immensity of space absolutely empty. <lb/>
            This production of a world may be explained thus : seeds <lb/>
            suitably appropriated to such an end may emanate either from <lb/>
            one or from several worlds, or from the space that separates <lb/>
             <pb n="457"/>
            them; they flow towards a particular point where they become <lb/>
            collected together and organized; after that, other germs come <lb/>
            to unite them together in such a way as to form a durable <lb/>
            whole, a basis, a nucleus to which all successive additions <lb/>
            unite themselves.</p>
          <p>" One must not content one's self in this question with saying, <lb/>
            as one of the natural philosophers has done, that there is a <lb/>
            re-union of the elements, or a violent motion in the vacuum <lb/>
            under the influence of necessity, and that the body which is <lb/>
            thus produced increases until it comes to crash against some <lb/>
            other; for this doctrine is contrary to appearances.</p>
          <p>" The sun, the moon, and the other stars, were originally <lb/>
            formed separately, and were afterwards comprehended in the <lb/>
            entire total of the world. All the other objects which our <lb/>
            world comprises, for instance, the earth and the sea, were also <lb/>
            formed spontaneously, and subsequently gained size by the <lb/>
            addition and violent movement of light substances, composed <lb/>
            of elements of fire and air, or even of these two principles at <lb/>
            once. This explanation, moreover, is in accordance with the <lb/>
            impressions of the senses.</p>
          <p>"As to the magnitude of the sun and of the other stars, it is, <lb/>
            as far as we are concerned, such as it appears to us to be.</p>
          <p>(This same doctrine is reproduced, and occurs again in the <lb/>
            eleventh book of his treatise on Nature; where he says, " If <lb/>
            the distance has made it lose its size, a fortiori, it would take <lb/>
            away its brilliancy; for colour has not, any more than size, the <lb/>
            property of traversing distance without alteration.")</p>
          <p>" But, considered by itself, the sun may be a little greater or <lb/>
            a little smaller than it appears; or it may be just such as it <lb/>
            looks; for that is exactly the case with the fires of common <lb/>
            occurrence among men, which are perceived by the senses at <lb/>
            a distance. Besides, all the difficulties on this subject will be <lb/>
            easily explained if one attends to the clear evidence of the <lb/>
            perceptions, as I have shown in my books about Nature.</p>
          <p>" The rising and setting of the sun, of the moon, and of the <lb/>
            stars, may depend on the fact of their becoming lighted up, <lb/>
            and extinguished alternately, and in the order which we behold. <lb/>
            One may also give other reasons for this phenomenon, which <lb/>
            are not contradicted by any sensible appearances ; accordingly, <lb/>
            me might explain them by the passage of the stars above and <lb/>
             <pb n="458"/>
            below the earth, for the impressions of the senses agree also <lb/>
            with this supposition.</p>
          <p>"As to their motion, one may make that depend on the <lb/>
            circular movement of the entire heaven. One may also sup- <lb/>
            pose that the stars move, while the heaven itself is immove- <lb/>
            able ; for there is nothing to prevent the idea that originally, <lb/>
            before the formation of the world, they may have received, by <lb/>
            the appointment of fate, an impulse from east to west, and <lb/>
            that now their movement continues in consequence of their <lb/>
            heat, as the fire naturally proceeds onwards in order to seek <lb/>
            the aliment which suits it.</p>
          <p>" The intertropical movements of the sun and moon may <lb/>
            depend, either on the obliquity impressed by fate on the heaven <lb/>
            at certain determined epochs, or on the resistance of the air, <lb/>
            or on the fact that these ignited bodies stand in need of being <lb/>
            nourished by a matter suitable to their nature, and that this <lb/>
            matter fails them ; or finally, they may depend on the fact of <lb/>
            their having originally received an impulse which compels <lb/>
            them to move as they do describing a sort of spiral figure. <lb/>
            The sensible evidence does not in the least contradict these <lb/>
            different suppositions, and all those of the same kind which <lb/>
            one can form, having always a due regard to what is possible, <lb/>
            and bringing back each phenomenon to its analogous appear- <lb/>
            ances in sensible facts, without disquieting one's self about the <lb/>
            miserable speculations of the astronomers.</p>
          <p>., The evacuations and subsequent replenishings of the moon <lb/>
            may depend either on a conversion of this body, or on the <lb/>
            different forms which the air when in a fiery state can adopt, <lb/>
            or perhaps to the interposition of another body, or lastly, to <lb/>
            some one of the causes by which one gives account of the <lb/>
            analogous phænomena which pass under our eyes. Provided, <lb/>
            however, that one does not obstinately adopt an exclusive <lb/>
            mode of explanation ; and that, for want of knowing what is <lb/>
            possible for a man to explain, and what is inaccessible to his <lb/>
            intelligence ; one does not throw one's self into interminable <lb/>
            speculations.</p>
          <p>" It may also be possibly the case that the moon has a light <lb/>
            of her own, or that she reflects that of the sun. For we see <lb/>
            around us many objects which are luminous of themselves, and <lb/>
            many others which have only a borrowed light. In a word, <lb/>
             <pb n="459"/>
            one will not be arrested by any of the celestial phenomena, <lb/>
            provided that one always recollects that there are many <lb/>
            explanations possible; that one examines the principles and <lb/>
            reasons which agree with this mode of explanation, and that <lb/>
            one does not proceed in accounting for the facts which do not <lb/>
            agree with this method, to suffer one's self to be foolishly carried <lb/>
            away, and to propose a separate explanation for each phæno- <lb/>
            menon, sometimes in one way, and sometimes in another.</p>
          <p>" The appearance of a face in the orb of the moon, may <lb/>
            depend either on a displacement of its parts, or on the inter- <lb/>
            position of some obstacle, or on any other cause capable of <lb/>
            accounting for such an appearance. For one must not neglect <lb/>
            to apply this same method to all the heavenly phenomena ; <lb/>
            for, from the moment when one comes to any point of contra- <lb/>
            diction to the evidence of the senses, it will be impossible to <lb/>
            possess perfect tranquillity and happiness.</p>
          <p>" The eclipses of the sun and moon may depend either on <lb/>
            the fact that these stars extinguish themselves, a phænome- <lb/>
            non which we often see produced under our eyes, or on the <lb/>
            fact of other bodies, the earth, the heaven, or something else <lb/>
            of the same kind interposing, between them and us. Besides, <lb/>
            we must compare the different modes of explanation appro- <lb/>
            priate to phænomena, and recollect that it is not impossible <lb/>
            that many causes may at one and the same time concur in <lb/>
            their production.</p>
          <p>(He says the same thing in the twelfth book of his treatise <lb/>
            &gt;n Nature; and adds that the eclipses of the sun arise from <lb/>
            :he fact that it penetrates into the shade of the moon, to quit <lb/>
            .t again presently ; and the eclipses of the moon from the fact <lb/>
            )f its entering into the shade of the earth. We also find the <lb/>
            same doctrine asserted by Diogenes, the Epicurean, in the <lb/>
            irst book of his Select Opinions.)</p>
          <p>" The regular and periodical march of these phenomena has <lb/>
            nothing in it that ought to surprise us, if we only attend to <lb/>
            ,he analogous facts which take place under our eyes. Above <lb/>
            all things let us beware of making the Deity interpose here, <lb/>
            or that being we ought to suppose exempt from all occupation <lb/>
            ,nd perfectly happy; otherwise we shall be only giving vain <lb/>
            explanations of the heavenly phenomena, as has happened <lb/>
            Iready to a crowd of authors. Not being able to recognize <lb/>
            rhat is really possible, they have fallen into vain theories, in <lb/>
             <pb n="460"/>
            supposing that for all phenomena there was but one single <lb/>
            mode of production, and in rejecting all other explanations <lb/>
            which are founded on probability; they have adopted the <lb/>
            most unreasonable opinions, for want of placing in the front <lb/>
            the study of the heavenly phenomena, and of sensible facts, <lb/>
            which ought to serve to explain the first.</p>
          <p>" The differences in the length of nights and days may arise <lb/>
            from the fact that the passage of the sun above the earth <lb/>
            is more or less rapid; and more or less slow, according to <lb/>
            the length of the regions which it has to pass through. Or, <lb/>
            again, to the fact that certain regions are passed through more <lb/>
            rapidly than others, as is seen to be the case by our own eyes, <lb/>
            in those things to which we can compare the heavenly phæ- <lb/>
            nomena. As to those who on this point admit only one <lb/>
            explanation as possible, they put themselves in opposition to <lb/>
            facts, and lose sight of the bounds set to human knowledge.</p>
          <p>“ The prognostics which are derived from the stars may, like <lb/>
            those which we borrow from animals, arise from a simple <lb/>
            Coincidence. They may also have other causes, for example. <lb/>
            some change in the air; for these two suppositions both <lb/>
            harmonize equally with facts ; but it is impossible to distinguish <lb/>
            in what case one is to attribute them to the one cause or to <lb/>
            the other.</p>
          <p>“ The clouds may be formed either by the air condensed <lb/>
            under the pressure of the winds, or by the agency of atoms <lb/>
            set apart for that end, or by emanations from the earth and <lb/>
            waters, or by other causes. For there are a great number <lb/>
            which are all equally able to produce this effect. When the <lb/>
            clouds clash with one another, or undergo any transformation, <lb/>
            they produce showers ; and the long rains are caused by the <lb/>
            motion of the clouds when moved from places suitable to them <lb/>
            through the air, when a more violent inundation than usual <lb/>
            takes place, from collections of some masses calculated to <lb/>
            produce these effects.</p>
          <p>" Thunder possibly arises from the movement of the winds <lb/>
            revolving in the cavities of the clouds ; of which we may see <lb/>
            an image in vessels in our own daily use. It may also arise <lb/>
            from the noise of fire acted upon by the wind in them, and <lb/>
            from the tearings and ruptures of the clouds when they have <lb/>
            received a sort of crystaline consistency. In a word, experi- <lb/>
            ence drawn from our senses, teaches us that all these phæno- <lb/>
             <pb n="461"/>
            mena, and that one in particular, may be produced in many <lb/>
            different manners.</p>
          <p>" One may also assign different causes to the lightning; <lb/>
            either the shock and collision of the clouds produce a fiery <lb/>
            appearance, which is followed by lightning; or the lighting <lb/>
            up of the clouds by the winds, produces this luminous appear- <lb/>
            ance ; or the mutual pressure of the clouds, or that of the <lb/>
            wind against them, disengages the lightning. Or, one might <lb/>
            say, that the interception of the light diffused from the stars, <lb/>
            arrested for a time in the bosom of the clouds, is driven from <lb/>
            them subsequently by their own movements, and by those of <lb/>
            the winds, and so escapes from their sides ; that the light- <lb/>
            ning is an extremely subtile light that evaporates from the <lb/>
            clouds ; that the clouds which carry the thunder are collected <lb/>
            masses of fire ; that the lightning arises from the motion of <lb/>
            the fire, or from the conflagration of the wind, in consequence <lb/>
            of the rapidity and continuousness of its motion. One may <lb/>
            also attribute the luminous appearance of lightning to the <lb/>
            rupture of the clouds under the action of the winds, or to the <lb/>
            fall of inflammable atoms. Lastly, one may easily find a <lb/>
            number of other explanations, if one applies to sensible facts, <lb/>
            in order to search out the analogies which they present to the <lb/>
            heavenly phænomena.</p>
          <p>" Lightning precedes thunder, either because it is produced <lb/>
            at the same moment that the wind falls on the cloud, while <lb/>
            the noise is only heard at the instant when the wind has <lb/>
            penetrated into the bosom of the cloud ; or, perhaps, the two <lb/>
            phænomena being simultaneous, the lightning arrives among <lb/>
            us more rapidly than the noise of the thunder-bolt, as is in <lb/>
            fact remarked in other cases when we see at a distance the <lb/>
            clash of two objects.</p>
          <p>"The thunderbolt may be produced either by a violent con- <lb/>
            densation of the winds, or by their rapid motion and confla- <lb/>
            gration. It may arise from the fact of the winds meeting in <lb/>
            places which are too dense, in consequence of the accumulation <lb/>
            of clouds, and then a portion of the current detaches itself and <lb/>
            proceeds towards the lower situations; or else it may be caused <lb/>
            by the fire which is contained in the bosom of the clouds pre- <lb/>
            cipitating itself downwards. As one may suppose that an <lb/>
            immense quantity of fire being accumulated in the clouds <lb/>
            dilates, violently bursting the substance which envelops it, <lb/>
             <pb n="462"/>
            because the resistance of the centre hinders it from proceeding <lb/>
            further. This effect is especially produced in the neighbour- <lb/>
            hood of high mountains; and, accordingly, they are very <lb/>
            frequently struck with the thunderbolts. In short, one may <lb/>
            give a number of explanations of the thunderbolt; but we <lb/>
            ought, above all things, to be on our guard against fables, and <lb/>
            this one will easily be, if one follows faithfully the sensible <lb/>
            phenomena in the explanation of these things, which are not <lb/>
            perceived, except indirectly.</p>
          <p>"Hurricanes (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πϱηστη̃ϱες</foreign>) may be caused either by the presence <lb/>
            of a cloud, which a violent wind sets in motion and precipitates <lb/>
            with a spiral movement towards the lower regions, or by a <lb/>
            violent gust which bears a cloud into the neighbourhood of <lb/>
            some other current, or else by the mere agitation of the wind <lb/>
            by itself, when air is brought together from the higher regions <lb/>
            and compressed without being able to escape on either side, in <lb/>
            consequence of the resistance of the air which surrounds it; <lb/>
            when the hurricane descends towards the earth, then there <lb/>
            result whirlwinds in proportion to the rapidity of the wind <lb/>
            that has produced them; and this phenomenon extends over <lb/>
            the sea also.</p>
          <p>" Earthquakes may arise from the wind penetrating into the <lb/>
            interior of the earth, or from the earth itself receiving in- <lb/>
            cessantly the addition of exterior particles, and being in <lb/>
            incessant motion as to its constituent atoms, being in con- <lb/>
            sequence disposed to a general vibration. That which per- <lb/>
            mits the wind to penetrate is the fact that falls take place in <lb/>
            the interior, or that the air being impressed by the winds <lb/>
            insinuates itself into the subterraneous caverns. The move- <lb/>
            ment which numberless falls and the re-action of the earth <lb/>
            communicate to the earth, when this motion meets bodies of <lb/>
            greater resistance and solidity, is sufficient to explain the <lb/>
            earthquakes. One might, however, give an account of them <lb/>
            in several other ways.</p>
          <p>“ Winds are caused, either by the successive and regular <lb/>
            addition of some foreign matter, or else by the re-union of <lb/>
            a great quantity of water; and the differences of the winds <lb/>
            may arise from the fact that some portions of this same matter <lb/>
            fall into the numerous cavities of the earth, and are divided <lb/>
            there.</p>
          <p>“ Hail is produced by an energetic condensation acting on <lb/>
             <pb n="463"/>
            the ethereal particles which the cold embraces in every direc- <lb/>
            tion ; or, in consequence of a less violent condensation acting <lb/>
            however on aqueous particles, and accompanied by division, in <lb/>
            such a manner as to produce, at the same time, the re-union <lb/>
            of certain elements and of the collective masses; or by the <lb/>
            rupture of some dense and compact mass which would explain <lb/>
            at the same time, the numerousness of the particles and their <lb/>
            individual hardness. As to the spherical form of the hail, one <lb/>
            may easily account for that by admitting that the shocks <lb/>
            which it receives in every direction make all the angles <lb/>
            disappear, or else that at the moment when the different <lb/>
            fragments are formed, each of them is equally embraced on all <lb/>
            sides by aqueous or ethereal particles.</p>
          <p>" Snow may be produced by a light vapour full of moisture <lb/>
            which the clouds allow to escape by passages intended for that <lb/>
            end, when they are pressed, in a corresponding manner, by <lb/>
            other clouds, and set in motion by the wind. Subsequently, <lb/>
            these vapours become condensed in their progress under the <lb/>
            action of the cold which surrounds the clouds in the lower <lb/>
            regions. It may also be the case that this phenomenon is <lb/>
            produced by clouds of a slight density as they become con- <lb/>
            densed. In this case the snow which escapes from the clouds <lb/>
            would be the result of the contact, or approximation of the <lb/>
            aqueous particles, which in a still more condensed state produce <lb/>
            hail. This effect is most especially produced in the air. Snow, <lb/>
            again, may result from the collection of clouds previously con- <lb/>
            densed and solidified ; or from a whole army of other causes. '</p>
          <p>" Dew proceeds from a re-union of particles contained in the <lb/>
            air calculated to produce this moist substance. These particles <lb/>
            may be also brought from places which are moist or covered <lb/>
            with water (for in those places, above all others, it is that <lb/>
            dew is abundant). These then re-unite, again resume their <lb/>
            aqueous form, and fall down. The same phenomenon takes <lb/>
            place in other cases before our own eyes under many analogies.</p>
          <p>" Hoar-frost is dew congealed by the influence of the cold <lb/>
            air that surrounds it.</p>
          <p>" Ice is formed either by the detrition of round atoms con- <lb/>
            tained in the water, and the re-union at scalene and acute <lb/>
            angles of the atoms which exist in the water, or by an addition <lb/>
            from without of these latter particles, which, penetrating into <lb/>
             <pb n="464"/>
            the water, solidify it by driving away an equal amount of round <lb/>
            atoms.</p>
          <p>“ The rainbow may be produced by the reflection of the solar <lb/>
            rays on the moist air; or it may arise from a particular pro- <lb/>
            perty of light and air, in virtue of which these particular <lb/>
            appearances of colour are formed, either because the shades <lb/>
            which we perceive result directly from this property, or because, <lb/>
            on the contrary, it only produces one single shade, which, <lb/>
            reflecting itself on the nearest portions of the air, communi- <lb/>
            cates to them the tints which we observe. As to the circular <lb/>
            form of the rainbow, that depends either on the fact of the <lb/>
            sight perceiving an equal distance in every direction, or the <lb/>
            fact of the atoms taking this form when re-uniting in the air ; <lb/>
            or it may be caused by its detaching from the air which moves <lb/>
            towards the moon, certain atoms which, being re-united in the <lb/>
            clouds, give rise to this circular appearance.</p>
          <p>" The lunar halo arises from the fact of the air, which moves <lb/>
            towards the moon from all quarters, uniformly intercepting the <lb/>
            rays emitted by this star, in such a way as to form around it <lb/>
            a sort of circular cloud which partially veils it. It may also <lb/>
            arise from the fact of the moon uniformly rejecting from all <lb/>
            quarters, the air which surrounds it, in such a manner as to <lb/>
            produce this circular and opaque covering. And perhaps this <lb/>
            opaqueness may be caused by some particles which some <lb/>
            current brings from without; perhaps also, the heat communi- <lb/>
            cates to the moon the property of emitting by the pores in <lb/>
            its surface, the particles by which this effect is produced.</p>
          <p>" Comets arise either from the fact, that in the circumstances <lb/>
            already stated, there are partial conflagrations in certain points <lb/>
            of the heaven; or, that at certain periods, the heaven has <lb/>
            above our heads a particular movement which causes them to <lb/>
            appear. It may also be the case, that being themselves <lb/>
            endowed with a peculiar movement, they advance at the end <lb/>
            of certain periods of time, and in consequence of particular <lb/>
            circumstances, towards the places which we inhabit. The <lb/>
            opposite reasons explain their disappearance.</p>
          <p>" Certain stars return to the same point in accomplishing <lb/>
            their revolutions ; and this arises, not only as has been some- <lb/>
            times believed, from the fact of the pole of the world, around <lb/>
            which they move, being immoveable, but also from the fact <lb/>
            that the gyrations of the air which surrounds them, hinder <lb/>
             <pb n="465"/>
            them from deviations like the wandering stars. Perhaps also, <lb/>
            this may be caused by the fact, that except in the route in <lb/>
            which they move, and in which we perceive them, they do not <lb/>
            ind any material suitable to their nature. One may also <lb/>
            explain this phenomenon in many other manners, reasoning <lb/>
            according to sensible facts; thus, it is possible that certain <lb/>
            stars may be wandering because that is the nature of their <lb/>
            novements, and, for the same reason, others may be immove- <lb/>
            able It is also possible, that the same necessity which has <lb/>
            originally given them their circular movement, may have <lb/>
            compelled some to follow their orbit regularly, and have <lb/>
            objected others to an irregular progress; we may also suppose <lb/>
            hat the uniform character of the centre which certain stars <lb/>
            xaverse favour their regular march, and their return to a certain; <lb/>
            .nd that in the case of others, on the contrary, the differences <lb/>
            ofthe centre produce the changes which we observe. Besides, <lb/>
            o assign one single cause to all these phenomena, when the <lb/>
            experience of our senses suggests us several, is folly. It is <lb/>
            he conduct of ignorant astronomers covetous of a vain know- <lb/>
            edge, who, assigning imaginary causes to facts, wish to leave <lb/>
            whollyto the Deity the care of the government of the universe.</p>
          <p>“Some stars appear to be left behind by others in their <lb/>
            rogress ; this arises either from the fact of their having a <lb/>
            lower motion, though traversing the same circle; or, because, <lb/>
            hough they are drawn on by the same propelling power, they <lb/>
            ave, nevertheless, a movement proper to themselves in a <lb/>
            ontrary direction; or it may be caused by the fact that, <lb/>
            hough all are placed in the same sphere of movement, still <lb/>
            ome have more space to traverse, and others less. To give <lb/>
            ne uniform and positive explanation of all these facts, is not <lb/>
            onsistent with the conduct of any people but those who love <lb/>
            o flash prodigies in the eyes of the multitude.</p>
          <p>" Falling stars may be particles detached from the stars, or <lb/>
            ragments resulting from their collision; they may also be <lb/>
            produced by the fall of substances which are set on fire by the <lb/>
            ction of the wind; by the re-union of inflammable atoms <lb/>
            which are made to come together so as to produce this effect <lb/>
            y a sort of reciprocal attraction; or else by the movement <lb/>
            which is produced in consequence of the re-union of atoms in <lb/>
            he very place where they meet. It may also happen that <lb/>
            he light vapours re-unite and become condensed under the <note type="footnote"> H H </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="466"/>
            form of clouds, that they then take fire in consequence of their <lb/>
            rotatory motion, and that, bursting the obstacles which surround <lb/>
            them, they proceed towards the places whither the force by <lb/>
            which they are animated drags them. In short, this phæno- <lb/>
            menon also may admit of a great number of explanations.</p>
          <p>" The presages which are drawn from certain animals arise <lb/>
            from a fortuitous concourse of circumstances ; for there is no <lb/>
            necessary connection between certain animals and winter. They <lb/>
            do not produce it; nor is there any divine nature sitting <lb/>
            aloft watching the exits of these animals, and then accom- <lb/>
            plishing signs of this kind. Nor can such folly as this occur <lb/>
            to any being who is even moderately comfortable, much less <lb/>
            to one which is possessed of perfect happiness.</p>

          <p>XXVI. Such are his sentiments on the heavenly pheno- <lb/>
            mena, But concerning the rules of life, and how we ought to <lb/>
            choose some things, and avoid others, he writes thus. But <lb/>
            first of all, let us go through the opinions which he held, and <lb/>
            his disciples held about the wise man.</p>
          <p>He said that injuries existed among men, either in con. <lb/>
            sequence of hatred, or of envy, or of contempt, all which the <lb/>
            wise man overcomes by reason. Also, that a man who has <lb/>
            once been wise can never receive the contrary disposition, nor <lb/>
            can he of his own accord invent such a state of things as that <lb/>
            he should be subjected to the dominion of the passions; nor <lb/>
            can he hinder himself in his progress towards wisdom. That <lb/>
            the wise mail, however, cannot exist in every state of body, <lb/>
            nor in every nation. That even if the wise man were to be <lb/>
            put to the torture, he would still be happy. That the wise <lb/>
            man will only feel gratitude to his friends, but to them equally <lb/>
             <pb n="467"/>
            whether they are present or absent. Nor will he groan and <lb/>
            howl when be is put to the torture. Nor will he marry a wife <lb/>
            whom the laws forbid, as Diogenes says, in his epitome of the <lb/>
            Ethical Maxims of Epicurus. He will punish his servants, <lb/>
            but also pity them, and show indulgence to any that are <lb/>
            virtuous. They do not think that the wise man will ever be <lb/>
            in love, nor that he will be anxious about his burial, nor that <lb/>
            love is a passion inspired by the Gods, as Diogenes says in <lb/>
            his twelfth book. They also assert that he will be indifferent <lb/>
            to the study of oratory. Marriage, say they, is never any good <lb/>
            to a man, and we must be quite content if it does no harm ; <lb/>
            and the wise man will never marry or beget children, as <lb/>
            Epicurus himself lays it down, in his Doubts and in his <lb/>
            :reatises on Nature. Still, under certain circumstances of life, <lb/>
            he will forsake these rules and marry. Nor will be ever <lb/>
            ndulge in drunkenness, says Epicurus, in his Banquet, nor <lb/>
            vill he entangle himself in affairs of state (as he says in his <lb/>
            irst book on Lives). Nor will he become a tyrant. Nor will <lb/>
            ie become a Cynic (as he says in his second book about Lives). <lb/>
            Nor a beggar. And even, though he should lose his eyes, he <lb/>
            will still partake of life (as he says in the same book).</p>
          <p>The wise man will be subject to grief, as Diogenes says, in <lb/>
            he fifth book of his Select Opinions; he will also not object <lb/>
            3 go to law. He will leave books and memorials of himself <lb/>
            ehind him, but he will not be fond of frequenting assemblies. <lb/>
            Ie will take care of his property, and provide for the future. <lb/>
            Ie will like being in the country, he will resist fortune, and <lb/>
            ill grieve none of his friends. He will show a regard for a fair <lb/>
            eputation to such an extent as to avoid being despised ; and <lb/>
            a will find more pleasure than other men in speculations</p>
          <p>All faults are not equal. Health is good for some people, <lb/>
            ut a matter of indifference to others. Courage is a quality <lb/>
            hich does not exist by nature, but which is engendered by a <lb/>
            consideration of what is suitable. Friendship is caused by <lb/>
            ne's wants; but it must be begun on our side. For we sow <lb/>
            ne earth; and friendship arises from a community of, and <lb/>
            articipation in, pleasures. Happiness must be understood in <lb/>
            TO senses; the highest happiness, such as is that of God, <lb/>
            hich admits of no increase; and another kind, which admits <lb/>
            the addition or abstraction of pleasures. The wise man may <lb/>
            ise statues if it suits his inclination, if it does not it does <note type="footnote"> H H 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="468"/>
            not signify. The wise man is the only person who can con- <lb/>
            verse correctly about music and poetry; and he can realise <lb/>
            poems, but not become a poet.</p>
          <p>It is possible for one wise man to be wiser than another. <lb/>
            The wise man will also, if he is in need, earn money, but only <lb/>
            by his wisdom ; he will propitiate an absolute ruler when <lb/>
            occasion requires, and will humour him for the sake of cor- <lb/>
            recting his habits ; he will have a school, but not on such a <lb/>
            system as to draw a crowd about him ; he will also recite in a <lb/>
            multitude, but that will be against his inclination ; he will <lb/>
            pronounce dogmas, and will express no doubts ; he will be the <lb/>
            same man asleep and awake ; and he will be willing even to <lb/>
            ' die for a friend.</p>
          <p>These are the Epicurean doctrines.</p>
          <p>XXVII. We must now proceed to his letter :—</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">EPICURUS TO MENÆCEUS GREETING.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>" Let no one delay to study philosophy while he is young, <lb/>
            and when he is old let him not become weary of the study <lb/>
            for no man can ever find the time unsuitable or too late to <lb/>
            study the health of his soul. And he who asserts either that <lb/>
            it is not yet time to philosophize, or that the hour is passed, <lb/>
            is like a man who should say that the time is not yet come to <lb/>
            be happy, or that it is too late. So that both young and old <lb/>
            should study philosophy, the one in order that, when he is old, <lb/>
            he may be young in good things through the pleasing recollec- <lb/>
            tion of the past, and the other in order that he may be at the <lb/>
            same time both young and old, in consequence of his absence <lb/>
            of fear for the future.</p>
          <p>" It is right then for a man to consider the things which pro- <lb/>
            duce happiness, since, if happiness is present, we have every- <lb/>
            thing, and when it is absent, we do everything with a view to <lb/>
            possess it. Now, what I have constantly recommended to you, <lb/>
            these things I would have you do. and practise, considering <lb/>
            them to be the elements of living well. First of all, believe <lb/>
            that God is a being incorruptible and happy, as the common <lb/>
            opinion of the world about God dictates; and attach to your <lb/>
            idea of him nothing which is inconsistent with incorruptibility <lb/>
            or with happiness ; and think that he is invested with every- <lb/>
            thing which is able to preserve to him this happiness, in <lb/>
            conjunction with incorruptibility. For there are Gods; for <lb/>
             <pb n="469"/>
            our knowledge of them is indistinct. But they are not of the <lb/>
            character which people in general attribute to them ; for they <lb/>
            do not pay a respect to them which accords with the ideas that <lb/>
            they entertain of them. And that man is not impious who <lb/>
            discards the Gods believed in by the many, but he who applies <lb/>
            to the Gods the opinions entertained of them by the many. <lb/>
            For the assertions of the many about the Gods are not antici- <lb/>
            pations (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πϱολήψεις</foreign>). but false opinions (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπολήψεις</foreign>). And in <lb/>
            consequence of these, the greatest evils which befall wicked <lb/>
            men, and the benefits which are conferred on the good, are all <lb/>
            attributed to the Gods; for they connect all their ideas of <lb/>
            them with a comparison of human virtues, and everything <lb/>
            which is different from human qualities, they regard as incom- <lb/>
            patible with the divine nature.</p>
          <p>" Accustom yourself also to think death a matter with which <lb/>
            we are not at all concerned, since all good and all evil is in <lb/>
            sensation, and since death is only the privation of sensation. <lb/>
            On which account, the correct knowledge of the fact that <lb/>
            death is no concern of ours, makes the mortality of life pleasant <lb/>
            to us, inasmuch as it sets forth no illimitable time, but relieves <lb/>
            us for the longing for immortality. For there is nothing <lb/>
            terrible in living to a man who rightly comprehends that there <lb/>
            is nothing terrible in ceasing to live; so that he was a silly <lb/>
            man who said that he feared death, not because it would grieve <lb/>
            him when it was present, but because it did grieve him while <lb/>
            it was future. For it is very absurd that that which does not <lb/>
            distress a man when it is present, should afflict him when only <lb/>
            expected. Therefore, the most formidable of all evils, death, <lb/>
            is nothing to us, since, when we exist, death is not present to <lb/>
            us; and when death is present, then we have no existence. <lb/>
            It is no concern then either of the living or of the dead ; since <lb/>
            to the one it has no existence, and the other class has no <lb/>
            existence itself. But people in general, at times flee from <lb/>
            death as the greatest of evils, and at times wish for it as a rest <lb/>
            from the evils in life. Nor is the not living a thing feared, <lb/>
            since living is not connected with it: nor does the wise man <lb/>
            think not living an evil; but, just as he chooses food, not <lb/>
            preferring that which is most abundant, but that which is <lb/>
            nicest; so too, he enjoys time, not measuring it as to whether <lb/>
            it is of the greatest length, but as to whether it is most agree- <lb/>
            able. And he who enjoins a young man to live well, and an <lb/>
             <pb n="470"/>
            old man to die well, is a simpleton, not only because of the <lb/>
            constantly delightful nature of life, but also because the care <lb/>
            to live well is identical with the care to die well. And he <lb/>
            was still more wrong who said :— <lb/>
            " 'Tis well to taste of life, and then when born <lb/>
            To pass with quickness to the shades below.*</p>
          <p>“For if this really was his opinion why did he not quit life ? <lb/>
            for it was easily in his power to do so, if it really was his <lb/>
            belief. But if he was joking, then he was talking foolishly in <lb/>
            a case where it ought not to be allowed; and, we must recollect, <lb/>
            that the future is not our own, nor, on the other hand, is it <lb/>
            wholly not our own, I mean so that we can never altogether <lb/>
            await it with a feeling of certainty that it will be, nor alto- <lb/>
            gether despair of it as what will never be. And we must con- <lb/>
            sider that some of the passions are natural, and some empty; <lb/>
            and of the natural ones some are necessary, and some merely <lb/>
            natural. And of the necessary one's some are necessary to <lb/>
            happiness, and others, with regard to the exemption of the <lb/>
            body, from trouble ; and others with respect to living itself; for <lb/>
            a correct theory, with regard to these things, can refer all <lb/>
            choice and avoidance to the health of the body and the freedom <lb/>
            from disquietude of the soul. Since this is the end of living <lb/>
            happily; for it is for the sake of this that we do everything, <lb/>
            wishing to avoid grief and fear; and when once this is the <lb/>
            case, with respect to us, then the storm of the soul is, as I may <lb/>
            say, put an end to; since the animal is unable to go as if to <lb/>
            something deficient, and to seek something different from that <lb/>
            by which the good of the soul and body will be perfected.</p>
          <p>" For then we have need of pleasure when we grieve, because <lb/>
            pleasure is not present; but when we do not grieve, then we <lb/>
            have no need of pleasure ; and on this account, we affirm, that <lb/>
            pleasure is the beginning and end of living happily; for we <lb/>
            have recognized this as the first good, being connate with <lb/>
            us; and with reference to it, it is that we begin every choice <lb/>
            and avoidance; and to this we come as if we judged of all good <lb/>
            by passion as the standard; and, since this is the first good <lb/>
            and connate with us, on this account we do not choose every <lb/>
            pleasure, but at times we pass over many pleasures when any <lb/>
            difficulty is likely to ensue from them; and we think many <note type="footnote"> * This is a quotation from Theognis. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="471"/>
            pains better than pleasures, when a greater pleasure follows <lb/>
            them, if we endure the pain for a time.</p>
          <p>" Every pleasure is therefore a good on account of its own na- <lb/>
            ture, but it does not follow that every pleasure is worthy of being <lb/>
            chosen; just as every pain is an evil, and yet every pain must <lb/>
            not be avoided. But it is right to estimate all these things by <lb/>
            the measurement and view of what is suitable and unsuitable; <lb/>
            for at times we may feel the good as an evil, and at times, on <lb/>
            the contrary, we may feel the evil as good. And, we think, <lb/>
            contentment a great good, not in order that we may never have <lb/>
            but a little, but in order that, if we have not much, we may <lb/>
            make use of a little, being genuinely persuaded that those <lb/>
            men enjoy luxury most completely who are the best able to do <lb/>
            without it; and that everything which is natural is easily <lb/>
            provided, and what is useless is not easily procured. And simple <lb/>
            flavours give as much pleasure as costly fare, when everything <lb/>
            that can give pain, and every feeling of want, is removed ; and <lb/>
            corn and water give the most extreme pleasure when any one <lb/>
            in need eats them. To accustom one's self, therefore, to simple <lb/>
            and inexpensive habits is a great ingredient in the perfecting <lb/>
            of health, and makes a man free from hesitation with respect <lb/>
            to the necessary uses of life. And when we, on certain occa- <lb/>
            sions, fall in with more sumptuous fare, it makes us in a <lb/>
            better disposition towards it, and renders us fearless with <lb/>
            respect to fortune. When, therefore, we say that pleasure is <lb/>
            a chief good, we are not speaking of the pleasures of the <lb/>
            debauched man, or those which lie in sensual enjoyment, as <lb/>
            some think who are ignorant, and who do not entertain our <lb/>
            opinions, or else interpret them perversely; but we mean the <lb/>
            freedom of the body from pain, and of the soul from confusion. <lb/>
            For it is not continued drinkings and revels, or the enjoyment <lb/>
            of female society, or feasts of fish and other such things, as a <lb/>
            costly table supplies, that make life pleasant, but sober con- <lb/>
            templation, which examines into the reasons for all choice <lb/>
            and avoidance, and which puts to flight the vain opinions <lb/>
            from which the greater part of the confusion arises which <lb/>
            troubles the soul.</p>
          <p>" Now, the beginning and the greatest good of all these <lb/>
            things is prudence, on which account prudence is something <lb/>
            more valuable than even philosophy, inasmuch as all the other <lb/>
            virtues spring from it, teaching us that it is not possible to <lb/>
             <pb n="472"/>
            live pleasantly unless one also lives prudently, and honourably, <lb/>
            and justly; and that one cannot live prudently, and honestly, <lb/>
            and justly, without living pleasantly; for the virtues are <lb/>
            connate with living agreeably, and living agreeably is in- <lb/>
            separable from the virtues. Since, who can you think better <lb/>
            than that man who has holy opinions respecting the Gods, and <lb/>
            who is utterly fearless with respect to death, and who has <lb/>
            properly contemplated the end of nature, and who compre- <lb/>
            bends that the chief good is easily perfected and easily pro- <lb/>
            vided; and the greatest evil lasts but a short period, and <lb/>
            causes but brief pain. And who has no belief in necessity, <lb/>
            which is set up by some as the mistress of all things, but he <lb/>
            refers some things to fortune, some to ourselves, because ne- <lb/>
            cessity is an irresponsible power, and because he sees that <lb/>
            fortune is unstable, while our own will is free; and this freedom <lb/>
            constitutes, in our case, a responsibility which makes us en- <lb/>
            counter blame and praise. Since it would be better to follow <lb/>
            the fables about the Gods than to be a slave to the fate of the <lb/>
            natural philosopher; for the fables which are told give us a <lb/>
            sketch, as if we could avert the wrath of God by paying him <lb/>
            honour; but the other presents us with necessity who is <lb/>
            inexorable.</p>
          <p>" And he, not thinking fortune a goddess, as the generality <lb/>
            esteem her (for nothing is done at random by a God), nor a <lb/>
            cause which no man can rely on, for he thinks that good or <lb/>
            evil is not given by her to men so as to make them live happily, <lb/>
            but that the principles of great goods or great evils are supplied <lb/>
            by her; thinking it better to be unfortunate in accordance <lb/>
            with reason, than to be fortunate irrationally; for that those <lb/>
            actions which are judged to be the best, are rightly done in <lb/>
            consequence of reason.</p>
          <p>".Do you then study these precepts, and those which are akin <lb/>
            to them, by all means day and night, pondering on them by <lb/>
            yourself, and discussing them with any one like yourself, and <lb/>
            then you will never be disturbed by either sleeping or waking <lb/>
            fancies, but you will live like a God among men; for a man <lb/>
            living amid immortal Gods, is in no respect like a mortal <lb/>
            being."</p>
          <p>In other works, he discards divination ; and also in his <lb/>
            Little Epitome. And he says divination has no existence; <lb/>
             <pb n="473"/>
            but, if it has any, still we should think that what happens <lb/>
            according to it is nothing to us.</p>
          <p>These are his sentiments about the things which concern <lb/>
            the life of man, and he has discussed them at greater length <lb/>
            elsewhere.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. Now, he differs with the Cyrenaics about pleasure. <lb/>
            For they do not admit that to be pleasure which exists as a <lb/>
            condition, but place it wholly in motion. He, however, admits <lb/>
            both kinds to be pleasure, namely, that of the soul, and that <lb/>
            of the body, as he says in his treatise on Choice and Avoid- <lb/>
            ance ; and also in his work on the Chief Good; and in the <lb/>
            first book of his treatise on Lives, and in his Letter against <lb/>
            the Mitylenian Philosophers. And in the same spirit, Dioge- <lb/>
            nes, in the seventeenth book of his Select Discourses, and <lb/>
            Metrodorus, in his Timocrates, speak thus. “But when <lb/>
            pleasure is understood, I mean both that which exists in <lb/>
            motion, and that which is a state ...." And Epicurus, <lb/>
            in his treatise on Choice, speaks thus : " Now, freedom from <lb/>
            disquietude, and freedom from pain, are states of pleasure; <lb/>
            but joy and cheerfulness are beheld in motion and energy."</p>
          <p>XXIX. For they make out the pains of the body to be <lb/>
            worse than those of the mind ; accordingly, those who do <lb/>
            wrong, are punished in the body. But he consid ers the pains <lb/>
            of the soul the worst; for that the flesh is only sensible to <lb/>
            present affliction, but the soul feels the past, the present, and <lb/>
            the future. Therefore, in the same manner, he contends that <lb/>
            the pleasures of the soul are greater than those of the body ; <lb/>
            and he uses as a proof that pleasure is the chief good, the fact <lb/>
            that all animals from the moment of their birth are delighted <lb/>
            with pleasure, and are offended with pain by their natural <lb/>
            instinct, and without the employment of reason. Therefore, <lb/>
            too, we, of our own inclination, flee from pain ; so that <lb/>
            Hercules, when devoured by his poisoned tunic, cries out:- <lb/>
            Shouting and groaning, and the rocks around <lb/>
            Re-echoed his sad wails, the mountain heights <lb/>
            Of Locrian lands, and sad Eubæa's hills.*</p>
          <p>XXX. And we choose the virtues for the sake of pleasure, <lb/>
            and not on their own account; just as we seek the skill of <lb/>
            the physician for the sake of health, as Diogenes says, in the <note type="footnote"> * From the Trachinæ of Sophocles, 1784. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="474"/>
            twentieth book of his Select Discourses, where he also calls <lb/>
            virtue a way of passing one's life (<foreign xml:lang="grc">διαγωγή</foreign>). But Epicurus <lb/>
            says, that virtue alone is inseparable from pleasure, but that <lb/>
            every thing else may be separated from it as mortal.</p>
          <p>XXXI. Let us, however, now add the finishing stroke, as <lb/>
            one may say, to this whole treatise, and to the life of the <lb/>
            philosopher; giving some of his fundamental maxims, and <lb/>
            closing the whole work with them, taking that for our end <lb/>
            which is the beginning of happiness.</p>
          <p>1. " That which is happy and imperishable, neither has <lb/>
            trouble itself, nor does it cause it to anything; so that it is <lb/>
            not subject to the feelings of either anger or gratitude; for <lb/>
            these feelings only exist in what is weak.</p>
          <p>(In other passages he says that the Gods are speculated on <lb/>
            by reason, some existing according to number, and others <lb/>
            according to some similarity of form, arising from the con- <lb/>
            tinual flowing on of similar images, perfected for this very <lb/>
            purpose in human form.)</p>
          <p>2. " Death is nothing to us ; for that which is dissolved is <lb/>
            devoid of sensation, and that which is devoid of sensation is <lb/>
            nothing to us.</p>
          <p>3. " The limit of the greatness of the pleasures is the <lb/>
            removal of everything which can give pain. And where <lb/>
            pleasure is, as long as it lasts, that which gives pain, or that <lb/>
            which feels pain, or both of them, are absent.</p>
          <p>4. " Pain does not abide continuously in the flesh, but in <lb/>
            its extremity it is present only a very short time. That pain <lb/>
            which only just exceeds the pleasure in the flesh, does not <lb/>
            last many days. But long diseases have in them more that is <lb/>
            pleasant than painful to the flesh.</p>
          <p>5. " It is not possible to live pleasantly without living <lb/>
            prudently, and honourably, and justly; nor to live prudently, <lb/>
            and honourably, and justly, without living pleasantly. But he <lb/>
            to whom it does not happen to live prudently, honourably, and <lb/>
            justly, cannot possibly live pleasantly.</p>
          <p>6. " For the sake of feeling confidence and security with <lb/>
            regard to men, and not with reference to the nature of govern- <lb/>
            ment and kingly power being a good, some men have wished <lb/>
            to be eminent and powerful, in order that others might attain <lb/>
            this feeling by their means; thinking that so they would secure <lb/>
            safety as far as men are concerned. So that, if the life of <lb/>
             <pb n="475"/>
            such men is safe, they have attained to the nature of good ; <lb/>
            but if it is not safe, then they have failed in obtaining that for <lb/>
            the sake of which they originally desired power according to <lb/>
            the order of nature.*</p>
          <p>7. " No pleasure is intrinsically bad: but the efficient <lb/>
            causes of some pleasures bring with them a great many per- <lb/>
            turbations of pleasure.</p>
          <p>8. “ If every pleasure were condensed, if one may so say, <lb/>
            and if each lasted long, and affected the whole body, or the <lb/>
            essential parts of it, then there would be no difference between <lb/>
            one pleasure and another.</p>
          <p>9. " If those things which make the pleasures of debauched <lb/>
            men, put an end to the fears of the mind, and to those which <lb/>
            arise about the heavenly bodies, and death, and pain; and if <lb/>
            they taught us what ought to be the limit of our desires, we <lb/>
            should have no pretence for blaming those who wholly devote <lb/>
            themselves to pleasure, and who never feel any pain or grief <lb/>
            (which is the chief evil) from any quarter.</p>
          <p>10. " If apprehensions relating to the heavenly bodies did <lb/>
            not disturb us, and if the terrors of death have no concern <lb/>
            with us, and if we had the courage to contemplate the bounda- <lb/>
            ries of pain and of the desires, we should have no need of <lb/>
            physiological studies.</p>
          <p>11. " It would not be possible for a person to banish all <lb/>
            fear about those things which are called most essential, unless <lb/>
            he knew what is the nature of the universe, or if he had any <lb/>
            idea that the fables told about it could be true ; and therefore, <lb/>
            it is, that a person cannot enjoy unmixed pleasure without <lb/>
            physiological knowledge.</p>
          <p>12. " It would be no good for a man to secure himself <lb/>
            safety as far as men are concerned, while in a state of appre- <lb/>
            hension as to all the heavenly bodies, and those under the <lb/>
            earth, and in short, all those in the infinite.</p>
          <p>13. Irresistible power and great wealth may, up to a certain <lb/>
            point, give us security as far as men are concerned; but the <lb/>
            security of men in general depends upon the tranquillity of <lb/>
            their souls, and their freedom from ambition. <note type="footnote"> * There is some hopeless corruption in the text here. Nor has any <lb/>
            one succeeded in making it intelligible. The French translator divides <lb/>
            it into two maxims. </note></p><pb n="476"/>
            
          <p>14. " The riches of nature are defined and easily procur- <lb/>
            able ; but vain desires are insatiable.</p>
          <p>15. " The wise man is but little favoured by fortune; but <lb/>
            his reason procures him the greatest and most valuable goods, <lb/>
            and these he does enjoy, and will enjoy the whole of his life.</p>
          <p>16. " The just man is the freest of all men from dis- <lb/>
            quietude ; but the unjust man is a perpetual prey to it.</p>
          <p>17. " Pleasure in the flesh is not increased, when once the <lb/>
            pain arising from want is removed ; it is only diversified.</p>
          <p>18. “ The most perfect happiness of the soul depends on <lb/>
            these reflections, and on opinions of a similar character on all <lb/>
            those questions which cause the greatest alarm to the mind.</p>
          <p>19. " Infinite and finite time both have equal pleasure, <lb/>
            if any one measures its limits by reason.</p>
          <p>20. " If the flesh could experience boundless pleasure, it <lb/>
            would want to dispose of eternity.*</p>
          <p>21 " But reason, enabling us to conceive the end and <lb/>
            dissolution of the body, and liberating us from the fears <lb/>
            relative to eternity, procures for us all the happiness of which <lb/>
            life is capable, so completely that we have no further occasion <lb/>
            to include eternity in our desires. In this disposition of <lb/>
            mind, man is happy even when his troubles engage him to <lb/>
            quit life; and to die thus, is for him only to interrupt a life <lb/>
            of happiness.</p>
          <p>22. " He who is acquainted with the limits of life knows, <lb/>
            that that which removes the pain which arises from want, and <lb/>
            which makes the whole of life perfect, is easily procurable ; so <lb/>
            that he has no need of those things which can only be attained <lb/>
            with trouble.</p>
          <p>23. " But as to the subsisting end, we ought to consider it <lb/>
            with all the clearness and evidence which we refer to whatever <lb/>
            we think and believe; otherwise, all things will be full of <lb/>
            confusion and uncertainty of judgment.</p>
          <p>24. " If you resist all the senses, you will not even have <lb/>
            anything left to which you can refer, or by which you may be <lb/>
            able to judge of the falsehood of the senses which you con- <lb/>
            demn.</p>
          <p>25. " If you simply discard one sense, and do not distinguish <lb/>
            between the different elements of the judgment, so as to know <note type="footnote"> * There in some great corruption here again. The French translator <lb/>
            takes 19, 20, and 21 all as one. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="477"/>
            on the one hand, the induction which goes beyond the actual <lb/>
            sensation, or, on the other, the actual and immediate notion; <lb/>
            the affections, and all the conceptions of the mind which lean <lb/>
            directly on the sensible representation, you will be imputing <lb/>
            trouble into the other sense, and destroying in that quarter <lb/>
            every species of criterion.</p>
          <p>26. " If you allow equal authority to the ideas, which, <lb/>
            being only inductive, require to be verified, and to those <lb/>
            which bear about them an immediate certainty, you will not <lb/>
            escape error; for you will be confounding doubtful opinions <lb/>
            with those which are not doubtful, and true judgments with <lb/>
            those of a different character.</p>
          <p>27. " If, on every occasion, we do not refer every one of <lb/>
            our actions to the chief end of nature, if we turn aside from <lb/>
            that to seek or avoid some other object, there will be a want <lb/>
            of agreement between our words and our actions.</p>
          <p>28. " Of all the things which wisdom provides for the hap- <lb/>
            piness of the whole life, by far the most important is the <lb/>
            acquisition of friendship.</p>
          <p>29. " The same opinion encourages man to trust that no <lb/>
            evil will be everlasting, or even of long duration; as it sees <lb/>
            that, in the space of life allotted to us, the protection of friend- <lb/>
            ship is most sure and trustworthy.</p>
          <p>30. "Of the desires, some are natural and necessary, some <lb/>
            natural, but not necessary, and some are neither natural nor <lb/>
            necessary, but owe their existence to vain opinions.</p>
          <p>(Epicurus thinks that those are natural and necessary which <lb/>
            put an end to pains, as drink when one is thirsty; and that <lb/>
            those are natural but not necessary which only diversify plea- <lb/>
            sure, but do not remove pain, such as expensive food; and <lb/>
            that these are neither natural nor necessary, which are such <lb/>
            as crowns, or the erection of statues.)</p>
          <p>31. " Those desires which do not lead to pain, if they are not <lb/>
            satisfied, are not necessary. It is easy to impose silence on <lb/>
            them when they appear difficult to gratify, or likely to produce <lb/>
            injury.</p>
          <p>32. "When the natural desires, the failing to satisfy which <lb/>
            is, nevertheless, not painful, are violent and obstinate, it is a <lb/>
            proof that there is an admixture of vain opinion in them; for <lb/>
            then energy does not arise from their own nature, but from the <lb/>
            vain opinions of men.</p><pb n="478"/>
            
          <p>33. " Natural justice is a covenant of what is suitable, lead- <lb/>
            ing men to avoid injuring one another, and being injured.</p>
          <p>34. “Those animals which are unable to enter into an argu- <lb/>
            ment of this nature, or to guard against doing or sustaining <lb/>
            mutual injury, have no such thing as justice or injustice. And <lb/>
            the case is the same with those nations, the members of which <lb/>
            are either unwilling or unable to enter into a covenant to <lb/>
            respect their mutual interests.</p>
          <p>35. "Justice has no independent existence; it results from <lb/>
            mutual contracts, and establishes itself wherever there is a <lb/>
            mutual engagement to guard against doing or sustaining mu- <lb/>
            tual injury.</p>
          <p>36. " Injustice is not intrinsically bad; it has this character <lb/>
            only because there is joined with it a fear of not escaping those <lb/>
            who are appointed to punish actions marked with that cha- <lb/>
            racter.</p>
          <p>37. " It is not possible for a man who secretly does anything <lb/>
            in contravention of the agreement which men have made with <lb/>
            one another, to guard against doing, or sustaining mutual <lb/>
            injury, to believe that he shall always escape notice, even if <lb/>
            he have escaped notice already ten thousand times; for, till <lb/>
            his death, it is uncertain whether he will not be detected.</p>
          <p>38. " In a general point of view, justice is the same thing to <lb/>
            every one; for there is something advantageous in mutual <lb/>
            society. Nevertheless, the difference of place, and divers other <lb/>
            circumstances, make justice vary.</p>
          <p>39. " From the moment that a thing declared just by the <lb/>
            law is generally recognized as useful for the mutual relations <lb/>
            of men, it becomes really just, whether it is universally re- <lb/>
            garded as such or not.</p>
          <p>40. " But if, on the contrary, a thing established by law is <lb/>
            not really useful for the social relations, then it is not just; <lb/>
            and if that which was just, inasmuch as it was useful, loses this <lb/>
            character, after having been for some time considered so, it is <lb/>
            not less true that, during that time, it was really just, at least <lb/>
            for those who do not perplex themselves about vain words, but <lb/>
            who prefer, in every case, examining and judging for them- <lb/>
            selves.</p>
          <p>41. " When, without any fresh circumstances arising, a <lb/>
            thing which has been declared just in practice does not agree <lb/>
            with the impressions of reason, that is a proof that the thing <lb/>
             <pb n="479"/>
            was not really just. In the same way, when in consequence <lb/>
            of new circumstances, a thing which has been pronounced just <lb/>
            does not any longer appear to agree with utility, the thing <lb/>
            which was just, inasmuch as it was useful to the social rela- <lb/>
            tions and intercourse of mankind, ceases to be just the moment <lb/>
            when it ceases to be useful.</p>
          <p>42. " He who desires to live tranquilly without having any <lb/>
            thing to fear from other men, ought to make himself friends; <lb/>
            those whom he cannot make friends of, he should, at least, <lb/>
            avoid rendering enemies ; and if that is not in his power, he <lb/>
            should, as far as possible, avoid all intercourse with them, and <lb/>
            keep them aloof, as far as it is for his interest to do so.</p>
          <p>43. " The happiest men are they who have arrived at the <lb/>
            point of having nothing to fear from those who surround them. <lb/>
            Such men live with one another most agreeably, having the <lb/>
            firmest grounds of confidence in one another, enjoying the ad- <lb/>
            vantages of friendship in all their fulness, and not lamenting, <lb/>
            as a pitiable circumstance, the premature death of their <lb/>
            friends."</p><pb n="480"/>
