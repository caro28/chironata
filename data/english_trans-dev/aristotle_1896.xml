          </head>
          <p>THE Metaphysics of Aristotle (if we except Kant's Critique, <lb/>
            and certain portions of the works of the Scholastics) embody, <lb/>
            perhaps, the only formal Treatise on the Science yet in the <lb/>
            possession of mankind. They, therefore, must be considered <lb/>
            as one of the most precious remnants of antiquity; but <lb/>
            their intrinsic worth can only be appreciated by those who <lb/>
            have read them through with care. And this the student <lb/>
            will discover, when, after climbing up the rugged mountain­ <lb/>
            side of abstract speculation, he finds himself standing on one <lb/>
            of its summits, beholding far and wide the vales of thought <lb/>
            spread before him in expanded glory. In evidence of this, <lb/>
            he may at the outset be reminded that the subjects treated <lb/>
            of are those which have exercised the highest faculties of the <lb/>
            human reason; and that he will there find an able Review <lb/>
            of the Greek Philosophy; a Refutation, most complete and <lb/>
            elaborate, of Scepticism; a Demonstration, à priori and <lb/>
            à posteriori, of God's existence; an Examination into the <lb/>
            relation of Metaphysics to the other Sciences; an Overthrow <lb/>
            of the Ideal Hypothesis of Plato, as well as of the Theory <lb/>
            of Pythagoras; an Elucidation of the nature of the Infinite ; <lb/>
            and an Investigation into Truth, in relation to man's faculties <lb/>
            for the attainment of it.</p>
          <p>The present Translation was written before I had an <lb/>
            opportunity of consulting the labours of my only predecessor <lb/>
             <pb n="VI"/>
            in the same field, Thomas Taylor. Though by no means <lb/>
            intending to disclaim the obligations subsequently incurred <lb/>
            by his translation being placed in my hands, and most <lb/>
            sincerely inclined to award Mr. Taylor considerable merit, I <lb/>
            cannot help qualifying it with some censure ; but hope I shall <lb/>
            not be deemed ungenerous towards one whose indefatigable <lb/>
            exertions contributed so much in his day to the extension of <lb/>
            Greek literature.</p>
          <p>The great imperfection of Taylor's Version consists in <lb/>
            obscurity-consequent, principally, upon little or no care <lb/>
            being taken, by a proper arrangement of the text, to notify <lb/>
            transitions to new subjects of inquiry. This is a grave omis­ <lb/>
            sion in the Metaphysics, above all other of Aristotle's works, <lb/>
            because the several clauses of this Treatise, it is by many <lb/>
            thought with good reason, have been somewhat arbitrarily <lb/>
            grouped together. But, independent of this, I cannot but <lb/>
            impute to Taylor the want of sufficient accuracy in the verbal <lb/>
            niceties of his author, evinced by his too frequent suppression <lb/>
            of the force of the smaller particles; a defect probably <lb/>
            arising from having allowed his attention to wander too <lb/>
            much from the Greek original to the Latin Version. Now, <lb/>
            in a translator-whose province it is not to slur over any <lb/>
            words contained in his text-such an absence of precision <lb/>
            must be acknowledged as at least injudicious; but it becomes <lb/>
            a very serious error, fraught with hurtful consequences, <lb/>
            to the student of such an author as Aristotle, who seldom <lb/>
            uses a word devoid of emphasis, and who seems designedly <lb/>
            to have sacrificed all exuberance to the stern demands of <lb/>
            scientific brevity. A style so terse and idiomatic, and at <lb/>
            the same time so perfect a model of the inherent capabilities <lb/>
            of the Greek language, will, therefore, be deprived of much <lb/>
            cf its peculiar excellence, if its entire power, as an engine <lb/>
            of abstract thought, be not preserved unimpaired under the <lb/>
            new forms in which the translator arrays it. Now in the <lb/>
            pages of Taylor we search in vain for a realization of the <lb/>
             <pb n="VII"/>
            philosophic spirit, and the bold, argumentative, decisive. <lb/>
            almost abrupt tone, which pervade the original.</p>
          <p>Practically speaking, then, Taylor is almost useless to the <lb/>
            student who, with a desire to construe the original with <lb/>
            proper accuracy, is at the same time anxious to acquire a <lb/>
            knowledge of the several doctrines established, and the mode <lb/>
            of arriving at them. These imperfections I have attempted <lb/>
            to remedy in the present Translation, by a close scrutiny of the <lb/>
            Greek, and the assignment to each word of its proper force; by <lb/>
            adopting the scholastic renderings of the technical words (in <lb/>
            opposition to Taylor, who often discards them for others not <lb/>
            so good); by a scrupulous attention to secure for each para­ <lb/>
            graph an intelligible opening; and, lastly, by Notes and <lb/>
            Marginal References. In the Marginal References I have <lb/>
            endeavoured to string together the various links of Aristotle's <lb/>
            argument, so as to form one unbroken chain; and thus sought <lb/>
            to unravel for the student the perplexities in which he is <lb/>
            likely to become entangled. As to the Notes, I trust I may <lb/>
            not be accused of presumption in laying claim to some small <lb/>
            originality in them. I can, at any rate, disown being indebted <lb/>
            for them to Taylor, whose labours in this department are <lb/>
            quite unavailable for any useful purpose. Keeping in view, <lb/>
            however, the great length to which the text itself runs, the <lb/>
            notes have not been needlessly multiplied, and I have only <lb/>
            introduced them where some doctrine or allusion abso­ <lb/>
            lutely required elucidation.</p>
          <p>I may add, that in the execution of my task, I have fol­ <lb/>
            lowed the text of Bekker; occasionally deviating in favour <lb/>
            of Didot, more particularly in the matter of punctuation ; <lb/>
            and have derived much assistance from the works of Thomas <lb/>
            A quinas, Brandis, Tennemann, Archbishop Whately, the Rev. <lb/>
            F. D. Maurice, and others mentioned more at large at the <lb/>
            end of the Analysis. But I might have despaired at ever <lb/>
            overcoming the obstacles lying across my path, were it not <lb/>
            for the access which I enjoyed to the many scarce exegetical <lb/>
             <pb n="VIII"/>
            works bearing on Aristotle found in the magnificent library <lb/>
            of Trinity College, Dublin.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, I have to tender my thanks to William S. <lb/>
            Bohn, Esq., for his unwearied vigilance in watching the pro­ <lb/>
            gress of this work through the press, and for the many <lb/>
            improvements suggested by him from time to time; the <lb/>
            adoption of which has enhanced the value of the Translation <lb/>
            to the Classical as well as English reader.</p>

          <p>" - THE Metaphysics of Aristotle," says Mr. Maurice,1 <lb/>

            petitions which occur in them, partly from the difficulty <lb/>

            be read by any student who wishes to investigate the questions which <lb/>
            have occupied men in later times."</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding, however, their bearing on modem <lb/>
            systems of Ontology, and their being occupied in the <lb/>
            discussion of questions of vast importance, in specula- <lb/>

            ed. <lb/>
            tion, at least, the Metaphysics have almost since the Middle Ages <lb/>
            been buried in obscurity, and, with a few brilliant exceptions in <lb/>
            Germany,2 have been quite forgotten. This neglect has been growing <lb/>
            greater and greater from the time of Cudworth and More, but has <lb/>
            been quite confirmed in the present century; and in England, at <lb/>
            least, the Metaphysics of Aristotle have been consigned to utter <lb/>
            oblivion. One cause, amongst others, that undoubtedly <lb/>
            has contributed to bring this odium upon the Meta­ <lb/>
            physics, and thus to contract their circulation within <lb/>
            3. Partial <lb/>
            cause of this <lb/>
            neglect. <lb/>
            a narrow sphere in our country, is the absence of any work that <lb/>
            would assist the student in the entire labour of mastering the <lb/>
            difficulties, which confessedly he must make up his mind to en­ <lb/>
            counter in such a task. No English translation, for instance, that <lb/>
            can be said really to have answered such an end as this, has as <lb/>
            yet appeared; 3 and thus, whilst other portions of Aristotle's works <lb/>
            have been illustrated in this way, the Metaphysics have been left to <lb/>
            moulder in the dust of our public Libraries, and have encountered <lb/>
            contempt disproportionate to their literary value-disproportionate <lb/>

          <p>1. The Preface <lb/>
            Chap. I. <lb/>
            Book I.</p>
          <p>THE Metaphysics open with a short Preface, in which <lb/>
            Aristotle seeks to introduce his readers to the philo­ <lb/>
            sophy that he is now about to develop for them, and <lb/>
            which he implies is quite distinct in its aim from that found in the <lb/>
            other portions of his works; though at the same time inseparably <lb/>
            connected with them, as pieces of that vast edifice of knowledge, <lb/>
            practical as well as speculative, which it was his ambition to build up <lb/>
            and leave behind him for the service of mankind.</p>
          <p>2. Aristotle's <lb/>
            object in this <lb/>
            Preface.</p>
          <p>For this purpose he endeavours to exalt* as much as <lb/>
            possible the nature of the inquiry undertaken in this <lb/>
            Treatise, and he thereby calculated on enlisting the <lb/>
            sympathy of his readers in its behalf. Moreover, by thus arraying <lb/>
            Metaphysics in an attractive garb, he was enabled to answer indi­ <lb/>
            rectly the objections that were afloat in the popular mind against the <lb/>
            practicability of their study. Now both of these ends assuredly were <lb/>
            answered in this Preface; for whatever would have a tendency to <lb/>
            promote the dignity of Metaphysics as a science, would necessarily <lb/>
            exercise a reflex influence in giving a decided answer to all the <lb/>
            sneers that might be levelled against it by the ignorant and presuming <lb/>
            Sophists.</p>
          <p>3. Positive and <lb/>
            negative de­ <lb/>
            fence of Onto­ <lb/>
            ogy.</p>
          <p>Thus Aristotle defends Ontology positively and nega­ <lb/>
            tively: positively, by a bold analysis of the nature and <lb/>
            objects of the science; and negatively, by making this <lb/>
            analysis substrve as a plain answer to all the cavils of <lb/>
            the sceptics. <note type="footnote">(1) This is apparent from his imposition of the term Sophia, or Wisdom, to desig <lb/>
            gate the science under investigation in this Treatise. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Towards the end of chapter i. </note> <pb n="XI"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="margin">BOOK I.] </note> In this Preface, therefore, to the Metaphysics, we <lb/>
            may lay it down that the chief aim of Aristotle is to <lb/>
            invest Ontology with its peculiar attributes as a science, <lb/>
            4. Aristotle's <lb/>
            chief aim in <lb/>
            this Preface. <lb/>
            and this, too, for the purpose that thereby it should be elevated to <lb/>
            its proper position amongst the other sciences; and this he conceived <lb/>
            to be the most effectual refutation against all misconceptions as to its <lb/>
            expediency, or scope, or general utility.</p>
          <p>The course, then, which Aristotle pursues to accom­ <lb/>
            plish all this is as follows: he aims to establish that <lb/>
            5. How this <lb/>
            aim is attained. <lb/>
            Ontology, or, as he calls it, Wisdom, was the science properly so <lb/>
            called. Viewed in relation to the other sciences, it contained their <lb/>
            most absolute generalizations. The science of Metaphysics might be <lb/>
            said to bear the same relation to physical or natural science which <lb/>
            logic has to psychology. As logic exhibits the reasoning process1 of <lb/>
            the mind, and thus illustrates its capabilities for the attainment of <lb/>
            knowledge, so Metaphysics, as a science, is conversant about the <lb/>
            highest and purest deductions from experimental philosophy, and its <lb/>
            province is to exemplify those abstract notions and fundamental3 <lb/>
            principles which establish the certainty of knowledge itself. Sense <lb/>
            and experience merely3 deal with individual instances, but Ontology <lb/>
            lays hold on what is the universal element therein, and thus gradually <lb/>
            mounts up to be, what it is, a science about causes and first principles.</p>
          <p>And this very fact, that Metaphysics is a science of <lb/>
            causes, it is that invests it with its dignity and import­ <lb/>
            ance, and draws the line of demarcation between it and <lb/>
            all other sources of information. The senses merely <lb/>
            bear their testimony to the particular fact of a particular <lb/>
            6. What it is <lb/>
            that invests <lb/>
            Metaphysics <lb/>
            with its dignity; <lb/>
            chap. L <lb/>
            sensation, but say nothing about the cause. The practical or expe­ <lb/>
            rienced-the common workman, for instance,-understand the doing <lb/>
            of a thing, but they have no perception as to the principle or cause <lb/>
            of it; and for this reason we estimate the architect above the handi­ <lb/>
            craftsman, inasmuch as the one is, whereas the other is not, conversant <lb/>
            with the principle or cause of what is being constructed. To attri­ <lb/>
            bute, indeed, an acquaintance with the cause to an handicraftsman, <lb/>
            would be as absurd as if we were to do so in the case of one of the <lb/>
            brute creation; for both fulfil their functions, whilst acting, wholly <lb/>
            irrespective of a knowledge of causes, and what the latter does from <lb/>
            blind instinct, the former accomplishes from the mere impulse of <lb/>
            habit; so that, in short, what sheds such lustre on Metaphysics as a <lb/>
            science, what imparts such elevation to it, is its being a science con­ <lb/>
            versant with causes and first principles. <note type="footnote">(1) For a most lucid explanation of this point the student is referred to Arch­ <lb/>
            bishop Whately's " Elements of Logic," Analytical outline, where the nature and <lb/>
            province of the science are placed beyond the possibly of misapprehension for the <lb/>
            future. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) This connexion between apodeiktic principles and the science of metaphysics <lb/>

            of this from the <lb/>
            kindred <lb/>

          <p>But, indeed, it may be also said that the origin of the <lb/>
            sciences kindred to Metaphysics bears the completes! <lb/>
            testimony to its dignity and value as a science, that <lb/>
            calls into play the loftiest faculties of the human mind, <lb/>
            and elevates them above things sensual and grovelling. The sciences <lb/>
            kindred to Metaphysics, from their very earliest dawn, were pursued <lb/>
            not for the sake of any extrinsic advantages; for they sprang up in <lb/>
            places where increasing civilization had supplied the necessary and <lb/>
            8 e.g. mathe­ <lb/>
            matics. <lb/>
            even superfluous wants of the inhabitants. Thus it was <lb/>
            that the mathematical sciences took their rise in Egypt1 <lb/>
            amongst the priests; for the sacerdotal caste, having <lb/>
            their worldly expenses defrayed for them out of the public purse, <lb/>
            were permitted to enjoy leisure, and thus were induced to cultivate <lb/>
            the abstract sciences, not from their mere utility, but from the pure <lb/>
            love of knowledge itself, as such.</p>
          <p>9. Why Ontology <lb/>
            has its claims <lb/>
            upon us.</p>
          <p>And this fact it is which, in the most eminent degree, <lb/>
            evinces the claim which Metaphysics, as a science, has <lb/>
            upon our sympathies, because it is a purely speculative <lb/>
            science; that is, a science cultivated for the sake of <lb/>
            the knowledge it furnishes its votaries with. And, indeed, beside the <lb/>
            particular instance in the case of the Egyptians just mentioned, that <lb/>
            Metaphysics, or any high order of science, is pursued for the sake of <lb/>
            knowledge, as such, is in general proved from the origin of specula­ <lb/>
            tion itself. For mankind, from wonder,2 first forms systems of philo­ <lb/>
            sophy ; and wonder is attended with a feeling of ignorance, as well <lb/>
            as a desire to remove that ignorance. Now this desire to remove <lb/>
            ignorance, wherever it exists, at the same time manifests the most <lb/>
            unmistakeable love of knowledge for its own sake. In short, what is <lb/>
            the love of knowledge, but, in other words, the desire to be liberated <lb/>
            from the bondage of ignorance ?</p>

            Detailed proof <lb/>
            of the value of <lb/>
            Metaphysics as <lb/>
            a science, com­ <lb/>
            pared with the <lb/>
            other sciences.</p>
          <p>In this way Aristotle strives to place Ontology in its <lb/>
            true position of importance amongst the other sciences. <lb/>
            As we say, that a man is free who is so for his own <lb/>
            sake and not for the sake of another; so Ontology is <lb/>
            pursued for its own sake,-for the sake, as such, of the <lb/>
            glorious knowledge which it unfolds. And, indeed. <lb/>
            After all, such is its dignity, that we can hardly consider it as of <lb/>
            human origin; for allowing it this characteristic of freedom just <lb/>
            awarded to it, we can with very little probability on our side <lb/>
            attribute it to such a source as that of the invention of man, seeing <lb/>
            that human nature is in itself so generally servile; and, besides <lb/>
            this, being a science of causes, and God being the chief amongst <lb/>
            causes3-now this is the view of the Divine nature that has ever <lb/>
            prevailed amongst mankind,-it would accordingly seem that <note type="footnote">(I) Towards the end of chap. i. </note><note type="footnote">(2) Vide chap. ii. </note><note type="footnote"> (3) '0 <foreign xml:lang="grc">τ τἁρ</foreign> <unclear>ioicei</unclear> TO <unclear/>., W40M 4irau ' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁρϰἡἠ</foreign> Tit.

            such a science as this is should be what God would be in pos­ <lb/>
            session of, as a sort of prerogative of His Almighty power and <lb/>
            perfection.</p>
          <p>And, further, Aristotle shows how worthy of our <lb/>
            attention and study metaphysical science in reality was, <lb/>
            inasmuch as this Wisdom, or Ontology, was, in its own <lb/>
            11. Ontology as <lb/>
            a ruler amongst <lb/>
            the sciences. <lb/>
            nature, fitted to be a regulator-so to speak-to all other systems <lb/>
            of knowledge. As in the external world, mind rules rightfully over <lb/>
            matter; and, as in ourselves, intellect-if its sway be not usurped <lb/>
            by passion-exercises dominion over the body ;1 so, according to <lb/>
            this constitution of things, should the science investigated in this <lb/>
            present Treatise be honoured as the queen of the other sciences,-as <lb/>
            that science to which the rest should do homage, because it is con­ <lb/>
            versant about those subjects that are most intellectual in their <lb/>
            essence. And, therefore, on the principle just enunciated, of the <lb/>
            subordination of the immaterial to the corporeal, decidedly the most <lb/>
            qualified to stand at the top of the material and moral, and, in <lb/>
            short, the whole order of mental sciences, is the science of the <lb/>
            Ontologist or Metaphysician.</p>
          <p>Now, in all the foregoing reasonings, doth Aristotle's <lb/>
            negative defence of Metaphysics reside by implication; <lb/>
            for the completest answer to all objections is furnished <lb/>
            in the proof of the reality and importance of its subject- <lb/>
            matter, and its bearing upon the most dignified portions <lb/>

            defence. <lb/>
            of Human .Nature. His master, Plato, for example, in <lb/>
            the Georgias, objects to metaphysical pursuits, in their <lb/>
            tendency to incapacitate men for active life. And <lb/>
            Aristotle himself notices how sciences, akin to Meta- <lb/>
            13. Some of the <lb/>
            objections <lb/>
            answered. <lb/>
            physics, were invented and cultivated amongst the sacerdotal caste <lb/>
            of a nation, 2 merely from the fact of their not being engaged in <lb/>
            active life, but their being allowed to live, by the liberality of the <lb/>
            State, in the enjoyment of leisure. But, admitting this, is not specu. <lb/>
            lation a higher region for the range and exercise of man's intellectual <lb/>
            faculties than action ? It develops the more noble portions of his <lb/>
            nature than can be done by the wear and tear of the world; it holds <lb/>
            up to his contemplation the purest and most serene objects that the <lb/>
            mind of man can rivet itself upon. And, accordingly, the more <lb/>
            speculative, in the higher sense of that word, a science is-and <lb/>
            what can be more speculative than Metaphysics ?-the more entitled <lb/>
            is it, as a science, to the respect and approval and genuine admira­ <lb/>
            tion of the world.2 And as to the exclusive profession of knowledge <lb/>
            by any one class in contradistinction to any other, no system of <lb/>
            knowledge can be considered as the peculiar possession of any <lb/>
            particular section of mankind: because Aristotle triumphantly shows <note type="footnote"> (1) As he lays down in the Politics, book I. chap. v. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) This has been shown in chap. i- </note><note type="footnote">(3) Vide chap. ii</note> <pb n="XIV"/>

            attention of all who wish really to act up to the law of their being, <lb/>
            and to march onwards towards that perfection of their social ari <lb/>
            intellectual principles to which Nature points them and God calls <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>If. The high­ <lb/>
            est objects of <lb/>
            human know­ <lb/>
            ledge the sub­ <lb/>
            ject-matter of <lb/>
            Metaphysics.</p>
          <p>Now seeing that knowledge for its own sake is thus <lb/>
            agreeable to man, and is held out to him by Nature as <lb/>
            a pursuit suitable to his faculties and yearnings, surely <lb/>
            that science which contemplates the highest objects of <lb/>
            knowledge ought to be valued, and cultivated, and <lb/>
            prized the more dearly, and to be esteemed amongst <lb/>
            men as the most worthy of their study and veneration. And these <lb/>
            highest objects of knowledge-the highest to which we can soar in <lb/>
            this our state of probation-these form the subject-matter about <lb/>
            which metaphysical science, is conversant, and may be contemplated <lb/>
            under the heads of causes, universals,3 entity, materiality, immateri­ <lb/>
            ality, existence, from the most insignificant traces of it up to absolute <lb/>
            existence,-that is, the Supreme Being.</p>
          <p>15. Its subject- <lb/>
            matter deter­ <lb/>
            mines its <lb/>
            subdivisions.</p>
          <p>And it is this very subject-matter which determines the <lb/>
            direction in which Metaphysics moves, and gives rise to <lb/>
            those subdivisions of the science which Aristotle, it <lb/>
            must be allowed, very confusedly4 hints at in the present <lb/>
            Treatise. From this subdivision, however, of the subject-matter of <lb/>
            metaphysical science we derive its threefold division into Theology, <lb/>
            as it regards immateriality; into Ætiology,5 or the First Philosophy, as <lb/>
            it regards first principles; and, thirdly, into Metaphysics properly so <lb/>
            called, that is, into Ontology, as it regards being and its several con­ <lb/>
            comitants or species, such as unity, plurality, capacity, and actuality.</p>
          <p>16. About what <lb/>
            sort of causes <lb/>
            Metaphysics is <lb/>
            conversant; <lb/>
            chap. ii.</p>
          <p>Having thus determined the ætiological aspect of <lb/>
            Metaphysics, that is, that its essential distinction as a <lb/>
            science consists in its being concerned with the subject <lb/>
            of causes, Aristotle proceeds to inquire about what sort <lb/>
            of causes Ontology is conversant; and he lays down that <lb/>
            the sort of causes about which it is employed are such as are <lb/>
            primary and universal in the most eminent degree.</p>
          <p>17. This shown <lb/>
            from an ana-</p>
          <p>And this Aristotle shows to be the case by an analysis <lb/>
            of our notions of what the qualifications of the " wise <note type="footnote"> </note><note type="footnote">(1) For the aim of Aristotle in these opening chapters, the student is referred to <lb/>

            man" are, as well as by a definition of " wisdom." We <lb/>
            view the " wise man " as endowed with universal know­ <lb/>
            ledge, and the knowledge which he has acquired we <lb/>
            lysis of the <lb/>
            "wise man " <lb/>
            and of wisdom <lb/>
            regard as difficult of attainment, and beyond the ordinary powers os <lb/>
            his fellow-creatures. Further, we regard his wisdom as evinced in <lb/>
            his accuracy of reasoning on scientific subjects, and in his ability to <lb/>
            impart his knowledge to his ignorant brethren. And respecting <lb/>
            “ wisdom " itself, we must define it as a science eligible for its own <lb/>
            sake; that is, for the sake of the knowledge that it furnishes, and not <lb/>
            for the sake of the results that flow therefrom. And further, as ob­ <lb/>
            served above, the science of Metaphysics, such as this Wisdom is <lb/>
            described to be, is fitted for pre-eminence above the rest of the <lb/>
            sciences.</p>
          <p>And to apply all this to the matter in hand, we must <lb/>
            remember, according to these notions of the ideal of the <lb/>
            " wise man," that the science professed by him, that is, <lb/>
            Sophia, or Wisdom, or Metaphysics, call it which you <lb/>
            may, must be a science conversant with what is uni- <lb/>
            18. Application <lb/>
            of these ana­ <lb/>
            lyses to the <lb/>
            science of <lb/>
            Ontology. <lb/>
            versal; for what, it may be asked, is there more difficult for men as a <lb/>
            subject of knowledge than the universal? for universals are most <lb/>
            remote from the common perceptions of sense. And as to accuracy <lb/>
            of reasoning, which must needs, it is expected, be found in Meta­ <lb/>
            physics, what can involve more accuracy and certainty than those <lb/>
            reasonings that are connected with what is primary ? And if this <lb/>
            science is to be one which is to be capable of affording instruction to <lb/>
            others, as such, then, it must be a science of causes; for persons who <lb/>
            understand causes are the persons that really can convey knowledge <lb/>
            to their fellow-creatures. And what is true of persons in this respect, <lb/>
            is true also of Metaphysics as an ætiological science; for the know­ <lb/>
            ledge it can furnish is the knowledge of causes, and the knowledge <lb/>
            of causes is knowledge in the best and highest sense of that word. <lb/>
            And, moreover, if one should define Sophia, or Wisdom, to be a <lb/>
            science that is eligible for its own sake, nothing is more worthy of the <lb/>
            choice of the philosopher than the highest objects of scientific know­ <lb/>
            ledge ; and the highest objects of scientific knowledge are universals, <lb/>
            things primary, and first principles.</p>
          <p>And from all these statements it is demonstrated that, <lb/>
            admitting Metaphysics to be an ætiological science, that is, <lb/>
            a science conversant with causes, that those causes must <lb/>
            needs be in themselves primary causes, and universal in <lb/>
            the most eminent and strict acceptation of that term.</p>
          <p>19. Metaphy­ <lb/>
            sics therefore <lb/>
            concerned with <lb/>
            primary and <lb/>
            universal <lb/>
            causes.</p>
          <p>Now this conclusion that Metaphysics is a science <lb/>
            conversant about causes and first principles, points out <lb/>
            the development of the science of Ontology in a direction <lb/>
            contrary to the other sciences. For whereas the pri- <lb/>
            20. This deter. <lb/>
            mines its order <lb/>
            of develop­ <lb/>
            ment, as show. <lb/>
            in chap. ii. <lb/>
            mitive sciences rose up amongst men from wonder, that is., in reality <lb/>
            from an ignorance about causes, and a desire to be rid of their per. <pb n="XVI"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I. </note> <lb/>
            plexity, and attain unto a solution of the phenomenal difficulties; <lb/>
            whereas this was the case with the primitive sciences, it is quite <lb/>
            different as regards the science of the metaphysician. Ontology, or <lb/>
            the science of Metaphysics, on the other hand, starts out from well- <lb/>
            ascertained and admitted causes, and by leading men on to the very <lb/>
            topmost heights of knowledge, fills them with wonder, as the result <lb/>
            of their researches, and not as the stimulating motive to inquiry in <lb/>
            the first instance.</p>
          <p>21. Why Aris­ <lb/>
            totle's fourfold <lb/>
            enumeration <lb/>
            of causes is <lb/>
            adopted in the <lb/>
            Metaphysics; <lb/>
            chap. in.</p>
          <p>Aristotle having now shown that Ontology, or W isdom, <lb/>
            sets out on its investigations from the starting point of <lb/>
            an examination of certain well-ascertained causes, the <lb/>
            question immediately presents itself, what are we to <lb/>
            regard as well-ascertained causes? And, in the first <lb/>
            place, what do we mean, in a philosophic sense, by the <lb/>
            phrase "well-ascertained" causes? We mean, those causes that <lb/>
            have been generalized to the utmost, as far as they will go, and then <lb/>
            classified under the highest genera to which they can be extended. <lb/>
            This question leads Aristotle to lay before his readers his fourfold <lb/>
            classification of causes, which was adopted by his followers, and for <lb/>
            centuries after was acknowledged amongst the Peripatetics as a <lb/>
            scientific dogma whose authority dared not be impeached, and its <lb/>
            rein lasted down to the very age of the Scholastics.</p>
          <p>22. What these <lb/>
            four causes <lb/>
            are.</p>
          <p>Thus Aristotle, in the Metaphysics, makes the assump­ <lb/>
            tion of the same four causes as he had arrived at, after <lb/>
            successive generalizations in his physical inquiries; <lb/>
            namely, as the first cause he sets down the substance and the <lb/>
            essence, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τἡν οὺσἰαν καἰ τὀ τι ἠν εἰναι</foreign>; the second as the matter and the <lb/>
            subject., <foreign xml:lang="grc">τἡν ΰλην καὶ τὸ ὐποκεἰμενον</foreign> the third as the origin of the <lb/>
            principle of motion, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ϭθεν ἡ ἀρϰἠ</foreign> r<foreign xml:lang="grc">τη̑ς κἰνησεως</foreign>; and the fourth is that <lb/>
            which is opposed to this, namely, the good end answered by the <lb/>
            existence of anything, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τετἁρτην Ϭε τἡν ἀντικειμένην</foreign> acria. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταὐτη καἰ <lb/>
            τὀ οὺ ένεκεν, καὶ τὀἁγαθὀν</foreign>. Aristotle still has reason, now as ever, <lb/>
            to express himself satisfied with this division of causes, which is <lb/>
            based on the assumption of the completeness of the classification of <lb/>
            them into those that are formal, material, efficient, and final.</p>
          <p>23. Why a re­ <lb/>
            view of the <lb/>
            Greek philo­ <lb/>
            sophy is intro­ <lb/>
            duced.</p>
          <p>But, further, the decision of this question, that <lb/>
            Ontology, or Wisdom, is a science of causes, would seem <lb/>
            to assimilate it as a science with the speculations of the <lb/>
            early Greek philosophers, because the subject-matter of <lb/>
            their inquiries was manifestly after causes of some sort <lb/>
            or other. And independent of the kindred nature of the investiga­ <lb/>
            tions pursued in both cases, it will be of considerable service1 to <lb/>
            Aristotle's present Metaphysical Treatise, to take a review of the <lb/>
            Greek Philosophy, because, after all, this may lead to ulterior and <lb/>
            brighter discoveries; and even though it does not, yet it will afford <note type="footnote">(1) As is shown at the commencement of chap iii </note> <pb n="XVII"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK I.] </note> <lb/>
            the Stagyrite an opportunity, according to his custom,1 of embracing <lb/>
            whatever is true and useful in the scientific labours of others, and of <lb/>
            rejecting what is illusory and false.</p>
          <p>In this review of the Greek Philosophy,-a review <lb/>
            that testifies how completely the Stagyrite had mastered <lb/>
            the details, and penetrated into the spirit of the various <lb/>
            systems of his predecessors as well as contemporaries,­ <lb/>
            in this review, at the threshold of the inquiry, Aristotle <lb/>
            24. General <lb/>
            objection <lb/>
            against the <lb/>
            Greek philo­ <lb/>
            sophy. <lb/>
            states his conviction that the ancients entertained inadequate views <lb/>
            in Ætiology, and that the impression that an examination of their <lb/>
            works leaves on the mind is, that out of the four causes they merely <lb/>
            recognised the material one. This indubitably appears to be true of <lb/>
            the very early philosophers; but is to be received, perhaps, with some <lb/>
            modification in the case of those of more modern date; for instance, <lb/>
            the followers of Anaxagoras, the Pythagoreans, and the Platonists.</p>
          <p>But to prove his position Aristotle brings forward <lb/>
            an induction of particulars from the philosophic works <lb/>
            of his predecessors, thus adopting the most effectual <lb/>
            25. Inductive <lb/>
            proof of this <lb/>
            objection; <lb/>
            mode of proof, quite in accordance with his experimental method. <lb/>
            The first philosopher that he brings upon the stage is <lb/>
            Thales of Miletus, one of the most ancient speculators <lb/>
            that we have any account of, and, in fact, the founder <lb/>
            e.g. from the <lb/>
            works of <lb/>
            Thales. <lb/>
            of this description of philosophy.2 Now, this Thaletian philosophy is <lb/>
            decidedly materialistic, so far forth as its author endeavoured to fix <lb/>
            on some primary element as the cause and original source of all <lb/>
            things. But though there may be some foundation in Nature for the <lb/>
            dogma of Thales as regards the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ</foreign> vypov, yet Aristotle considers <lb/>
            that it labours under a radical defect arising from imperfect observa­ <lb/>
            tion ; and that it is, after alL but a partial statement of the truth.</p>
          <p>And to confirm this view, Aristotle brings forward <lb/>
            the system of the old Theogony, which represented <lb/>
            Oceanus and Tethys as the parents of generation, and <lb/>
            made water as an object of adjuration amongst the <lb/>
            gods, which of course was selected for such on account <lb/>
            26. The in­ <lb/>
            stance of <lb/>
            Thales con­ <lb/>
            firmed from the <lb/>
            Theogonists. <lb/>
            of its being the most ancient element amongst all. Passing over <lb/>
            Hippo, who is not worthy of any notice, Aristotle adduces the <lb/>
            systems of Anaximenes, Diogenes, Hippasus of Metapontum, and <lb/>
            Heraclitus of Ephesus, to demonstrate further the justice of this <lb/>
            criticism on the Ancient Philosophy.</p>
          <p>There were other systems, however, which almost <lb/>
            might be classed amongst these materialistic ones, <lb/>
            because although the germs of a wiser philosophy <lb/>
            might on a careful analysis be discovered there, yet <lb/>
            they lurked in those systems undiscovered by their <lb/>
            27. Further <lb/>
            proof from <lb/>
            systems semi­ <lb/>
            materialiastic, in <lb/>
            chap. in. <lb/>
            authors, who put forward these principles seemingly without any <note type="footnote">(1) The eclectic spirit of Aristotle is evidenced in many passages in the Meta <lb/>

            consciousness of their importance, or of their legitimate consequences, <lb/>
            but driven, as it were, into them from the nature of the subjects that <lb/>
            they meddled with, and by the pure force of reason. Now all this <lb/>
            e.g. Empedo­ <lb/>
            eles and others. <lb/>
            applies to such systems as those put forward by Empe­ <lb/>
            docles and Anaxagoras; the former in his theory 01 <lb/>
            Discord and Harmony, and the latter in his recognition <lb/>
            of the necessity of Mind as an efficient cause in the formation of the <lb/>
            Universe. And the case is the same with the Pythagoric doctrine <lb/>
            about numbers, and the Ideal Hypothesis of Plato.</p>
          <p>28. Impossi­ <lb/>
            bility of the <lb/>
            continuance of <lb/>
            a system of <lb/>
            materialism.</p>
          <p>And the account of the matter is simply this. When <lb/>
            these philosophers advanced in their systems, the <lb/>
            observation of the actual occurrence of so many physical <lb/>
            changes naturally forced upon their consideration the <lb/>
            question, why do these changes take place; what is the <lb/>
            efficient principle of these changes P These changes, it obviously <lb/>
            appeared to them, must presuppose an ultimate substance or body as <lb/>
            the subject of them; but yet this subject, they must have seen, <lb/>
            could not be instrumental in bringing about its own changes.</p>
          <p>29. From the <lb/>
            age of Panne­ <lb/>
            nides material­ <lb/>
            ism received a <lb/>
            check.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding this cogency of Reason and of <lb/>
            Nature, yet Aristotle is inclined to think that the only <lb/>
            philosopher who decidedly in this age recognised the <lb/>
            necessity of other causes besides material ones, was <lb/>
            Parmemdes, and that, after all, not even were his <lb/>
            perceptions very clear upon the subject.</p>
          <p>From this philosophic age onwards, Speculation, however, appeared <lb/>
            to take a different turn, to flow in a different channel, and the pure <lb/>
            force of truth and reason evidently was dragging men into the <lb/>
            proper paths of inquiry, as well as into an acknowledgment of the <lb/>
            fact that any division of causes which would ignore the existence of <lb/>
            the efficient principle of motion must be a grossly inadequate one, <lb/>
            and adopted from ignorance as well as imperfect observation. <lb/>
            Aristotle, at the same time, is constrained to admit that the dif. <lb/>
            ficulties of forming any right judgment about the philosophy of the <lb/>
            ancients were incalculable, consequent upon the obscurity with which <lb/>
            they have unfolded their several theories.</p>

            ducer of an <lb/>
            efficient princi­ <lb/>
            ple mentioned <lb/>
            in chap. IV.</p>
          <p>Although Aristotle seems inclined to award to Anax­ <lb/>
            agoras the credit of a discovery of the existence in <lb/>
            Nature of an efficient principle, yet he states that, prior <lb/>
            to the Anaxagorean philosophy, Hermotimus, a native of <lb/>
            Clazomenæ, was in actual possession of. an ætiological theory of this <lb/>
            kind. Aristotle, however, does not expect that all may agree with <lb/>
            him on this point, and therefore he mentions the surmise put forward <lb/>
            by some as to the introduction of the efficient cause by the Hes iodic <lb/>
            school, or that sect of philosophers which recognised the principle of <lb/>
            Love1 (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔρως</foreign>) as the paramount principle in creation. <note type="footnote">(1) The "Love" of the Theogonists is not the same as the “ Love " which Plate <lb/>

            lators to rest content with assigning one cause of the <lb/>
            phenomena of the universe ; that is, if they really ob­ <lb/>

            of this prin­ <lb/>

            tions of. Now the existence of opposite and antagonistic phenomena, <lb/>
            such as order and disorder, was plain to any observer; and this led to <lb/>
            the hypothesis of Empedocles, of a discord and harmony, the latter to <lb/>
            account for the order, and the former for the disorder of the Universe. <lb/>
            This, Aristotle maintains, is the true point of view from whence to <lb/>
            regard all systems of this kind; this duality of efficient principles was <lb/>
            adopted in order to furnish a key to unravel the mystery of the <lb/>
            actual existence of good and evil, and of the predominance of the <lb/>
            latter over the former.</p>
          <p>But still the whole subject was awkwardly handled by <lb/>
            these philosophers, who might be compared to undisci­ <lb/>
            plined soldiers in battle. They, no doubt, professed a <lb/>
            dualism of causes, but they expanded their theories with <lb/>
            obscurity; and the fact was that they did not appear to <lb/>
            have broached their opinions on scientific grounds, and <lb/>
            32. The effi­ <lb/>
            dent cause <lb/>
            handled awk­ <lb/>
            wardly by the <lb/>
            early philo­ <lb/>
            sophers. <lb/>
            the efficient principle that they put forward in their theories, they, in <lb/>
            reality, made use of but to a small extent. Witness, for instance, <lb/>
            Anaxagoras, who, though he brings into his philosophy the principle <lb/>
            of mind, yet he practically robs it of its essential causality by em­ <lb/>
            ploying it as a mere machine in the construction of this fabric of the <lb/>
            world. Witness, too, Empedocles, whose causes have activities assigned <lb/>
            to them by their author which, in nature, they do not really possess. <lb/>
            And the same mode of argument applies to unintelligible systems, <lb/>
            such as those brought forward by Leucippus and Democritus in their <lb/>
            theories about fulness and vacuity, as being elements, and of the <lb/>
            assimilation of the former to entity, and of the latter to nonentity.</p>
          <p>There is not much chronological connexion between <lb/>
            these philosophic schools and those two which Aristotle <lb/>
            next proceeds to examine; namely, those of the Pytha­ <lb/>
            goreans and the Platonists. The review of these systems, <lb/>
            however,is to proclaim the fact that the attention of <lb/>

            schools of Plate <lb/>
            and Pytha­ <lb/>

            amined into. <lb/>
            speculators began to be attracted towards a consideration of the <lb/>
            formal principle of things-the <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία καὶ</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">τι ἦν εἶναι</foreign>—another cause <lb/>
            taken from the fourfold classification already assumed.</p>
          <p>The well-known school of the Pythagoric philosophy, <lb/>
            in Aristotle's opinion, owes its theory about numbers to <lb/>
            the zeal with which the followers of Pythagoras applied <lb/>
            themselves to mathematical studies. From their par- <lb/>

            theory, in <lb/>
            chap. v. <lb/>
            tiality for these pursuits, as well as their constant examination into <lb/>
            the properties and relations of numbers, they transferred both to <lb/>
            external things, and in the phenomena of Nature they began to fancy <lb/>
            that they could discern several numerical similitudes. A nd so bewitched <lb/>
            were they with their favourite hypotheses, that they endeavoured to <pb n="XX"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I. </note> <lb/>
            establish the same in the case of the heavenly bodies; in fact, they <lb/>
            were for generating the whole heavens out of number.</p>
          <p>35. Their sys­ <lb/>
            tem illustrated.</p>
          <p>Now it will illustrate their system to mention the <lb/>
            grounds that they rested the last assumption upon; <lb/>
            which was as follows, that the perfection of the decade <lb/>
            was an a priori proof of the number of the heavenly bodies. And <lb/>
            when this dogma seemed to totter from a want of verification in the <lb/>
            case of the actual pheno nena, there being only nine apparent, they <lb/>
            were forced to throw in the Earth to constitute the tenth.</p>
          <p>36. What the <lb/>
            system of the <lb/>
            Pythagorics <lb/>
            really was.</p>
          <p>Now the view of things which these Pythagoreans <lb/>
            took, was t o regard number as a first principle, and as <lb/>
            constituting to things their matter and passive conditions. <lb/>
            And the elements of numbers they considered to be the <lb/>
            odd and the even; ot the odd and even they regarded the one as <lb/>
            finite, and the other as infinite; from both together they generated <lb/>
            unity, and number itself they generated from unity. There was <lb/>
            another sect amongst the Pythagoreans that recognised ten principles, <lb/>
            arranged according to a certain coordinate1 series. Akin to these <lb/>
            speculations were those put forward by Alemæon of Crotona, who, <lb/>
            by the way, derived his system probably from the Pythagoreans; for <lb/>
            he had reached mature age when Pythagoras was an old man. Per­ <lb/>
            haps, indeed, the truth was that the Pythagoreans were indebted to <lb/>
            Alemæon for their philosophy. Be this as it may, however, the latter <lb/>
            expressed his sentiments in a manner similar to the former.</p>
          <p>37. The philo­ <lb/>
            sophy of Py­ <lb/>
            thagoras an <lb/>
            evidence of <lb/>
            human inquiry <lb/>
            travelling in <lb/>
            a particular <lb/>
            direction.</p>
          <p>Now, as already stated, this Pythagoric school was <lb/>
            an evidence of human investigation busying itself in an <lb/>
            effort to discover the formal principle of things; but it <lb/>
            further bore testimony to the truth of another assertion <lb/>
            put forward by Aristotle, in regard of the dualism <lb/>
            said to be inherent in the efficient cause, and which <lb/>
            manifested itself in the production of contrary pheno. <lb/>
            mena; such as order and disorder, good and evil.</p>
          <p>38. Not so that <lb/>
            of Parmenides.</p>
          <p>As to the philosophy of Parmenides, which has been <lb/>
            alluded to above, Aristotle gives his opinion that it has <lb/>
            no bearing upon an investigation the object of which is <lb/>
            to discover the existence of some efficient cause, for it quite ignored <lb/>
            the phenomenon of motion in its dogma about the immobility of the <lb/>
            Universe.</p>
          <p>39. Who was <lb/>
            the author of <lb/>
            the theory of <lb/>
            the TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕν</foreign>?</p>
          <p>It is hardly, however, quite correct to ascribe the <lb/>
            invention of this dogma to Parmenides, though perhaps <lb/>
            he was the philosopher to whom we are indebted for an <lb/>
            elaborate application of it to the phenomena of the <lb/>
            Universe. Xenophanes (as Aristotle states) was the first person who <lb/>
            introduced it; and the unity (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἕν</foreign>) thus introduced was viewed in <lb/>
            the light of a rationalistic unity by Parmenides, and of- a sensualistio <lb/>
            unity by Melissus. This school, however, likewise labours under the <note type="footnote">(1) This is the famous <foreign xml:lang="grc">Συστοιχία</foreign> of the Pythagoreans. </note> <pb n="XXI"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK I.] </note> <lb/>
            defect of an obscure elucidation of its theories; and none of its <lb/>
            speculators can we regard as likely to illumine Metaphysics by reason <lb/>
            of their researches, if we are to except Parmenides, who was more <lb/>
            judicious, seemingly, than either Xenophanes or Melissus.</p>
          <p>Again, we find Aristotle, at the termination of this <lb/>
            review of the Pythagoric systems, asserting his con­ <lb/>
            viction, that, amongst the earliest philosophers, we can <lb/>
            only discover a materialistic principle, the source of one <lb/>
            or more principles materialistic like itself; that, at a <lb/>
            subsequent age, we find speculators not merely putting <lb/>

            of the mate­ <lb/>
            rialism of the <lb/>

            sophy, end of <lb/>
            chap. v. <lb/>
            forward this principle, but along with it a different one, namely, such <lb/>
            a one as would account for the origin of motion; and this efficient <lb/>
            principle with some was considered as single, and with others as <lb/>
            twofold. And this might be regarded as the extent to which the <lb/>
            science of Metaphysics had advanced, in those ages, in the schools of <lb/>
            those philosophers who had put forward the theories attributed to <lb/>
            them; and some of these philosophers, on examination it will he <lb/>
            found, flourished up to the period of the Italic sects, and even inde­ <lb/>
            pendent of them.</p>
          <p>The chief value, however, of the Pythagoric philo­ <lb/>
            sophy, as has been mentioned, consists in the specula­ <lb/>
            lions it sought to establish in regard of substance-of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ τί ἐστι</foreign>—of the formal cause. They handled this sub- <lb/>
            41. Chief value <lb/>

            sophy of <lb/>

            the definitions which they framed of substance were superficial, and <lb/>
            far from penetrating into the depth of things.</p>
          <p>Having thus brought forward the leading systems <lb/>
            of the Naturalists, and ascertained their merits and <lb/>
            defects, and also having reviewed in part the various <lb/>
            theories of the Supranaturalists, Aristotle now comes <lb/>
            42. Review of <lb/>
            the Platonic <lb/>
            school in <lb/>
            chap. vi. <lb/>
            to the consideration of what with him was modem philosophy-the <lb/>
            ideal hypothesis of Plato. Platonism he regards as, in most of its <lb/>
            tenets, in harmony with the Pythagorean philosophy; but still there <lb/>
            were many peculiarities to be found therein, which were not shared <lb/>
            in common with the Italic sects. The origin of the Platonic philo­ <lb/>
            sophy, Aristotle is of opinion, lay in a sort of reaction against the <lb/>
            Heraclitics, in their theory about the continual flux of things cognisant <lb/>
            to the senses. The Theory itself of Ideas seems to have been sug­ <lb/>
            gested by the speculations of Socrates, and to have been a mere <lb/>
            extension of the conclusions he had arrived at in regard of universal <lb/>
            definitions.</p>
          <p>As to the points of contact between the Platonic and <lb/>
            the Pythagoric schools, Aristotle remarks that they <lb/>
            developed their systems pretty similarly in the main, <lb/>
            save that what the latter denominated imitation, the <lb/>
            brmer called participation; though in reality the same <lb/>

            between the <lb/>
            systems of <lb/>

            thing was meant by these two technical words, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μίμησις</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέθεξις</foreign>, <lb/>
            Plato recognised the existence, beside sensibles and forms, of <lb/>
            mathematical entities, as intermediate between both; the sensibles <lb/>
            were regarded merely as substantive representations of the forms­ <lb/>
            the forms were the causes of these and all other objects-the <lb/>
            elements of the one were the elements of the other; the assimilation <lb/>
            of forms to numbers, and of unity to substance, as well as the recog­ <lb/>
            nition of the causality of numbers in respect of tie essence of other <lb/>
            things,-these assertions of the Platonists were parallel with those <lb/>
            of the Pythagoreans. Whereas, however, the Platonic school sought <lb/>
            to establish the existence of numbers independent of sensible objects, <lb/>
            the Pythagories, on the other hand, affirmed that the former entirely <lb/>
            constituted the latter, and they did not contend for the existence of <lb/>
            those mathematical media which the Platonists did. These diverge <lb/>
            encies of the philosophy of Plato from that of Pythagoras, Aristotle <lb/>
            considers resulted from the logical investigations which were pursued <lb/>
            by the former, and totally neglected in the schools of the latter.</p>
          <p>44. Service <lb/>
            conferred by <lb/>
            Plato on philo­ <lb/>
            sophy.</p>
          <p>But now, if the question should be asked, what ser­ <lb/>
            vice Plato performed for the progress of metaphysical <lb/>
            science, Aristotle replies, that it is comprehended in his <lb/>
            ætiological system, in which the existence of two dis­ <lb/>
            tinct genera of causes is acknowledged, namely, the formal and <lb/>
            material, because the forms were the causes of the substance of <lb/>
            things, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ τί ἐστι</foreign>, and unity, as matter was the cause that consti­ <lb/>
            tuted the forms; so that if this be the case, what novelties are to be <lb/>
            found in Platonism that may not be discovered in the systems of the <lb/>
            Italics in equal perfection ? But, further, as regards their theory, to <lb/>
            account for the phenomena of good and evil, the Platonists came <lb/>
            short of systems quite anterior to them, namely, those of Empedocles <lb/>
            and Anaxagoras.</p>
          <p>45. Summary <lb/>
            of this review <lb/>
            of the Greek <lb/>
            philosophy in <lb/>
            chap. vii.</p>
          <p>We have now a valuable summary presented to us by <lb/>
            Aristotle of the results of the foregoing review. In the <lb/>
            first place, the Stagyrite reiterates the justice of the <lb/>
            assertion made in the very outset of the inquiry; namely, <lb/>
            that all schools, ancient and modern, prosecuted their <lb/>
            etiological investigations on the assumption of a fourfold classifi­ <lb/>
            cation of causes-the very same that Aristotle has already established <lb/>
            in his Physics. Still, however, their treatment of these causes has <lb/>
            been, in general, obscure, and, indeed, partial, for one or two have <lb/>
            been exalted above the rest; and thus a complete examination of the <lb/>
            entire four has been nullified in the several theories of these philo­ <lb/>
            sophers. The material cause has had abundance of attention bestowed <lb/>
            upon it, and by some it has been considered as single, but by others <lb/>
            as manifold. And this may be observed in Platonism, where it is <lb/>
            assimilated with the great and the small—<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ μέγα καὶ</foreign> TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">μικρό</foreign>v—in <lb/>
            the Italic schools, who fixed upon the Infinite, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἀπειρον</foreign>, as <lb/>
            such, in the theory of Empedocles about the four elements, and in <pb n="XXIII"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK I.]</note> <lb/>
            that of Anaxagoras, about his favourite hypothesis of an infinite <lb/>
            Homœomeriæ. But still the efficient cause has not been entirely <lb/>
            forgotten in the Ancient Philosophy, and faint gleams of it may be <lb/>
            discovered in the adoption by certain speculators of such principles <lb/>
            into their systems as Harmony, Discord, Soul, and Mind. Still less <lb/>
            notice has been vouchsafed to the formal cause, and the only traces <lb/>
            of it are to be found in the Pythagoric system of numbers, and in the <lb/>
            Ideal Hypothesis of Plato. But, after all, even these two schools <lb/>
            laboured under the defects of being partial statements of truth, and it <lb/>
            is not so easy to discern in them the material and efficient causes; <lb/>
            at least in the Ideal Theory, Plato does not make the forms as matter <lb/>
            for objects cognisant by the senses, and, far from the efficient prin­ <lb/>
            ciple being discoverable therein, the forms he views as causes of <lb/>
            immobility rather. And as to the treatment of the final cause in the <lb/>
            hands of the ancient philosophers, Aristotle considers that it likewise <lb/>
            has come in but for a small share of attention, and that its nature <lb/>
            has been imperfectly examined into in such systems as put forward <lb/>
            the principles of Harmony, or Mind, or Entity and Unity both together, <lb/>
            as such. There is nothing, however, definite in their theories, and <lb/>
            any statement of the truth seems purely accidental with them. <lb/>
            Thus Aristotle finds reason again to congratulate himself upon the <lb/>
            correct view he has taken of the Ancient Philosophy, as to its treat­ <lb/>
            ment of causes, and, further, as to his own classification of causes, as <lb/>
            well as the mode of inquiry adopted in regard of them.</p>
          <p>In connexion with this review of Platonism, Aristotle <lb/>
            glances at the systems of those who contended for the <lb/>
            unity of the material cause, and that, too, to the exclu­ <lb/>
            sion of the other three, and endeavours to point out <lb/>
            46. Those who <lb/>
            recognised one <lb/>
            material cause <lb/>
            in chap. vili. <lb/>
            some of their numerous misapprehensions. Amongst the rest of their <lb/>
            errors are stigmatized that of nullifying the principle of motion, and <lb/>
            that of not attributing to things their formal cause. And, moreover, <lb/>
            when they might have invested with the attribute of unity what we <lb/>
            would naturally expect to find thus arrayed, by not taking this <lb/>
            course, they have involved themselves in inextricable difficulties. <lb/>
            This is shown in the case of the four elements, earth, air, water, and <lb/>
            fire; and as regards the last, this instance brings these philosophers <lb/>
            into collision with antiquity, as is proved by the testimony of Rested. <lb/>
            Nor would the inconsistencies of such a system of aetiology be dimin­ <lb/>
            ished by substituting a plurality of material causes in the place o&lt; <lb/>
            merely one, as Empedocles does, nor even by a dualism of such prin <lb/>
            ciples, as in the theory of Anaxagoras.</p>
          <p>And here, again, Aristotle has to repeat the grand <lb/>
            lurking imperfection in all such systems, namely, that <lb/>
            they are completely buried in matter; that they are <lb/>
            immersed in material speculations, to the exclusion of <lb/>
            47. The grand <lb/>
            imperfection o. <lb/>

            others equally important, and they have failed to observe, what it <lb/>
            quite apparent in the philosophy of others, that beside those object: <pb n="XXIV"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I. </note> <lb/>
            which fall under the notice of sense, there are others that are cogni. <lb/>
            sant by the mind, and that the latter are as real-in fact more real­ <lb/>
            as causes than the former. And this school of the Supranaturalists <lb/>
            has achieved much more towards an advancement of metaphysical <lb/>
            science than that of these Naturalists or Physicists but just men­ <lb/>
            tioned.</p>
          <p>48. This funda­ <lb/>
            mental defect <lb/>
            absent from <lb/>
            the systems of <lb/>
            the Supra- <lb/>
            naturalist.</p>
          <p>Now this fundamental absurdity of the Physicists <lb/>
            finds no place in the systems of the Supranaturalists; <lb/>
            for although those of the latter are loaded with incon. <lb/>
            sistencies peculiar to themselves, and 1 hough they may <lb/>
            appear to put forward strange causes, yet they avoid the <lb/>
            gross error of the former, who are mere Materialists, <lb/>
            and this they do because they derive their principles from supra- <lb/>
            sensual sources. And this tells upon their philosophy in general, and <lb/>
            is apparent in the wideness of their speculations, and in the boldness <lb/>
            with which they have penetrated into the secrets of Nature. And, <lb/>
            above all, what fixes a chasm-not to be bridged over-between the <lb/>
            schools of the Naturalists and the Supranaturalists is this, that in the <lb/>
            latter there is secured, from the nature of their principles, a necessary <lb/>
            transition to a higher order of phenomena; and this is the charm of <lb/>
            their philosophy, that it opens up to our view a glimpse into the <lb/>
            glorious legions of transcendentalism.1</p>
          <p>49. This review <lb/>
            closed by one of <lb/>
            the Ideal Hypo­ <lb/>
            thesis in chap. <lb/>
            ix.</p>
          <p>The whole of the foregoing review of the philosophy <lb/>
            of the ancients is drawn to a close by an examination <lb/>
            into the Ideal Hypothesis of Plato. The inconsistencies <lb/>
            of this hypothesis are unsparingly exposed; the very <lb/>
            arguments brought forward by its advocates in its <lb/>
            favour are in reality subversive of it; it is quite insufficient to ac­ <lb/>
            count for actual phenomena; it brings nothing forward that can <lb/>
            advance the interests of science; and therefore for each and all of <lb/>
            these reasons is by no means to be received with unhesitating assent.</p>
          <p>and other <lb/>
            Platonic tenets.</p>
          <p>Likewise is the theory of Plato, in regard of the <lb/>
            assimilation of forms with numbers, attacked, and that of <lb/>
            the generation of mathematical substances. As to the <lb/>
            former, he shows the absurdity of investing numbers with the attri <lb/>
            bute of causality,2 which they cannot possess. Again, how will you <lb/>
            secure the production of one form from many, as is the case with the <lb/>
            generation of numbers; and besides all this, such a theory pre­ <lb/>
            supposes the necessity of the existence of some other description of <lb/>
            number, besides that which falls within the province of arithmetic. <lb/>
            In his attack on the latter, he stigmatises the over-partiality of the <lb/>
            Platonists for mathematics, and their making these studies paramount <lb/>
            to all others, though they profess to prosecute them merely in sub­ <lb/>
            lenience to and for the promotion of the rest of the sciences <note type="footnote">(1) Fide concluding remarks of this Analysis. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Vide book XIII. chapter vi </note></p><pb n="XXV"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> BOOK I.] <lb/>
            </note>But, in fact, the Platonic system of first principles in general may be said to strike at the roots of all Know­ <lb/>
            ledge whatever, because it is based on the assumption <lb/>
            of the discoverability of the elements of all things, <lb/>

            tonic a<foreign xml:lang="grc">ρχαὶ</foreign> <lb/>
            essentially de­ <lb/>
            ficient. <lb/>
            irrespective of their many distinctions and divisions. But how is <lb/>
            this to be the case ?-how is one to learn the elements of all things P <lb/>
            for, in such an attempt, it is evident that he must disclaim any pre­ <lb/>
            vious knowledge of the matter in hand. A person, e. g., learning <lb/>
            geometry may be acquainted witn other things previously, but not so <lb/>
            with those about which the science is immediately conversant. He <lb/>
            must then admit the impossibility of his acquaintance with any pre- <lb/>
            existent principles; and yet on these, as an essential basis, rests <lb/>
            every acquired system of science. Every science, in the mode of <lb/>
            acquiring it, is attainable by means of previous data furnished by <lb/>
            demonstration and definition. For as to any innate knowledge inde­ <lb/>
            pendent of induction and definition, it is quite contrary to our own <lb/>
            experience to say that we possess any such; or, supposing that we <lb/>
            do, it is then quite astonishing that we should ever have been wholly <lb/>
            unconscious of our possession of such a treasure.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, Aristotle once more appeals to the <lb/>
            history of the Greek philosophy as a vindication of his <lb/>
            division of causes. He repeats that the ancient or even <lb/>
            modern speculators, with all their ingenuity, could not <lb/>

            fix on any other species of cause which would not fall under the <lb/>
            category of one or other of these; and no argument lies against this, <lb/>
            from the obscurity or imperfection of the early systems. That is to <lb/>
            be anticipated. The dawn of Philosophy may be compared to one <lb/>
            whose articulation is not very finished or matured; and for this very <lb/>
            reason, because it is its dawn, when we cannot expect to find its <lb/>
            principles enunciated with the same confidence and precision as when <lb/>
            men have advanced in speculation, and thus achieved, at the same <lb/>
            time, the passage of Philosophy from its early child-like simplicity <lb/>
            into the gravity of a more advanced period of its existence.</p>

            which will occupy us now,—in order to show this con­ <lb/>

            behold Ontology from this point of view. Accordingly, we are now <lb/>
            favoured with a short synopsis of the relations subsisting between <lb/>
            truth and scientific knowledge in general, and of the influence exer­ <lb/>
            cised by the nature of the former on the progress and destinies of <lb/>
            the latter.</p>
          <p>2. An inquiry <lb/>
            about truth, <lb/>
            partly easy and <lb/>
            partly difficult, <lb/>
            ,apter L</p>
          <p>An inquiry into the subject of truth is partly difficult <lb/>
            and partly easy: this dogma is capable of verification. <lb/>
            The difficulty that attends philosophers in their pursuit <lb/>
            of truth, is evinced in the fact that no adequate system <lb/>
            of it has been successfully formed; and yet this implies, <lb/>
            in a certain sense, the facility of such a search. For it shows that <lb/>
            many attempts of the sort have been made from time to time, which, <lb/>
            though they have turned out to be incomplete, as far as regards the <lb/>
            full attainment of truth, yet have contained in themselves some <lb/>
            portion of it, however inconsiderable.1</p>
          <p>3. This shows <lb/>
            the value of <lb/>
            previous philo­ <lb/>
            sophic labours.</p>
          <p>And this it is which should teach us the precise <lb/>
            degree of value to be attached to the labours of those <lb/>
            who toil along with as in the paths of knowledge. <lb/>
            The results of their research, when viewed separately in <lb/>
            reference to the speculators individually, amongst those who have <lb/>
            brought them forward-the results may, in this point of view, appear <lb/>
            insignificant; and yet the entire labours of all together, in their <lb/>
            aggregate condition, may amount to something of considerable mag­ <lb/>
            nitude. It is under the influence of this very principle that Aristotle <lb/>
            himself is careful ever to pierce into the very centre of the philo­ <lb/>
            sophic systems of others, in order that he may, on the one hand, dis­ <lb/>
            engage therefrom whatever falsehood may lurk therein, and stigmatise <lb/>
            it; and that, on the other hand, by a careful analysis, he may discover <lb/>
            whatever truth they contain, and appropriate that to himself.</p>
          <p>4. An impor­ <lb/>
            tant principle <lb/>
            as regards <lb/>
            truth.</p>
          <p>One very important principle is laid down in reference <lb/>
            to the difficulties of speculative truth in general, and <lb/>
            it is this-that the cause of these difficulties may reside <lb/>
            not so much in the things themselves as in the imper- <lb/>
            Section of the faculties of the searchers after truth. And this <lb/>
            Aristotle illustrates, with so much reality and beauty, by the case of <unclear/> <lb/>
            bats, whose powers of vision, he says, bear the same proportion to <lb/>
            the brightness of the noonday as do the principles of the soul and <lb/>
            intellect to the splendour of the phenomena of Nature. And, more­ <lb/>
            over, upon this subject we should remember how, from age to age, <lb/>
            successive improvements are being made towards the formation of <lb/>
            a system of truth in the world; how one generation avails itself of the <lb/>
            scientific discoveries that have accumulated together from preceding <lb/>
            ages; and how all this stamps on truth itself its noble character of <lb/>
            progressiveness.</p>
          <p>5. How Aris­ <lb/>
            totle comes to</p>
          <p>Now, Aristotle, having already established the fact <lb/>
            that Metaphysics was a science concerned with causes; <note type="footnote">(1) Vide Dr. Whewell's Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, book II. chap. L</note> <pb n="XXVII"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK I.] <lb/>
            </note>in order, therefore, from this to demonstrate the reality <lb/>
            of Ontology, he proceeds next to show how, in dealing <lb/>
            with ætiological speculations, we have something definite <lb/>
            to treat about, because we must arrive at some ultimate <lb/>
            treat about an <lb/>
            infinite pro­ <lb/>
            gression of <lb/>
            causes. <lb/>
            principle, otherwise we would go upon the absurd assumption of all <lb/>
            infinite progression of causes. The impossibility of this <lb/>
            infinite progression,1 Aristotle demonstrates in the case <lb/>
            of the material, efficient, final, and formal causes. In <lb/>
            6. This infinite <lb/>
            progression <lb/>
            disproved. <lb/>
            respect of the final cause, he proves, with much ability, how that <lb/>
            such a supposition would exclude the notion of design from the <lb/>
            phenomena of the Universe; and, by destroying the nature of the <lb/>
            good (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ</foreign>), would undermine the entire fabric of God's moral <lb/>
            government over the world. And again, in respect of the formal <lb/>
            cause, the same supposition would overturn the reality of all scientific <lb/>
            knowledge; for knowledge cannot be attained without one's first <lb/>
            being conversant with individual objects: and how can this be done, <lb/>
            if those objects are infinite ?</p>
          <p>Thus having combated the objection2 against the <lb/>
            science of the metaphysician, as though it were merely <lb/>
            vague and indeterminate, and the creature of his own <lb/>
            fancy, Aristotle glances at what he conceives should be <lb/>
            7. How we <lb/>
            must prosecute <lb/>
            our search <lb/>
            after truth <lb/>
            the mode of prosecuting the search after truth, chiefly as a pattern <lb/>
            for the imitation of the ontologist; and for this purpose he points <lb/>
            out the dangerous extremes, on the one hand, of demanding more <lb/>
            precision than the subject requires, and, on the other, of resting <lb/>
            satisfied with less accuracy than is essential for the interests of truth. <lb/>
            Thus, some demand exactness in everything, and some in nothing, as <lb/>
            being what is to them painful and irksome. This dislike of accuracy, <lb/>
            perhaps, may spring from the weakness of their mental powers, in not <lb/>
            being able to connect together their thoughts with sufficient close­ <lb/>
            ness. But a great deal of this is traceable to the influence of habit <lb/>
            upon our speculative systems, and to the fact that opinions may be <lb/>
            rejected on account of their strangeness by persons who, were they <lb/>
            more familiar with them, might be more inclined to adopt them. And <lb/>
            all this is borne out by experience; for instance, in the case of the laws <lb/>
            where usage reconciles men with fictions and puerilities. So that the <lb/>
            chief point to bear in mind on the subject is this, that different <lb/>
            degrees of accuracy are to be adopted in the different sciences; and <lb/>
            that, for example, what is suitable for the mathematician in the <note type="footnote">(1) Vide Dr. Clarke in bis Essay on the Being and Attributes of God, where ne <lb/>

            seems to recognise the distinction that has been established in reference to his <lb/>

          <p>BUT, previous to his entering directly upon this meta­ <lb/>
            physical investigation that he has undertaken, Aristotle, <lb/>
            in accordance with the usage of disputants, deems it <lb/>
            requisite first to clear the way of whatever doubts there <lb/>
            are that may, in connexion with Metaphysics, require a previous <lb/>
            solution. And, after all, this is a wise way of proceeding in this and <lb/>
            in all sciences; for judicious doubting will conduct us to the dis­ <lb/>
            covery of truth, because knowledge is often the result of previous <lb/>
            doubt;1 for persons labouring under doubt feel like captives that are <lb/>
            loaded with chains, and that desire to snap them in sunder. But, at <lb/>
            any rate, for scientific investigators to refuse to entertain any doubts <lb/>
            in the outset of their inquiries, would entirely cut off all prospects of <lb/>
            advancement; for such might be compared to travellers commenc­ <lb/>

            to constitute the legitimate subjects of doubt in con­ <lb/>
            nexion with Ontology or Metaphysics. And, first, the <lb/>
            question may be asked, Is Ontology, as a science of causes, single or <lb/>
            manifold ?—is it conversant about the principles of substance merely, <lb/>
            or also about those from whence all demonstrative reasoning is <lb/>
            derived ? And again, Is the science of the metaphysician concerned <lb/>
            with substance; and if so, is it with one or many ? And as regards <lb/>
            substances themselves, are these merely those that are cognisant to <lb/>
            the senses, or are there, besides these, others, such as forms and <lb/>
            mathematical entities ? And again, is Ontology concerned with the <lb/>
            accidents of substances, as well as the substances themselves ?</p>
          <p>S. Further <lb/>
            doubts stated.</p>
          <p>Further, a doubt arises as to whether it falls within <lb/>
            the province of the metaphysician to examine into <lb/>
            identity and diversity, similarity and dissimilarity, and <lb/>
            such other topics as the Dialecticians strive to arrive at some con­ <lb/>
            clusion upon, by drawing their investigations from probable opinions. <lb/>
            And again, there is the question as to whether genera are first prin­ <lb/>
            ciples, and whether, beside matter, there is any absolute cause or <lb/>
            not; and if so, whether it is capable of a separate subsistence there­ <lb/>
            from or not, and is single or manifold ? And again, whether there <lb/>
            exists anything beside entirety, or not?—what is the number of first <note type="footnote">(1) Bacon has a similar remark in his observations on Hypothesis, m the De Aug­ <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> BOOK II.] </note> <lb/>
            principles ? are they even limited in number ? And again, are the <lb/>
            principles of corruptibles and incorruptibles the same, or whether <lb/>
            are all incorruptible, or of the corruptible are the principles merely <lb/>
            corruptible? Farther arises the question,-one most difficult tc <lb/>
            give a reply to,-as to whether entity and unity constitute the sub­ <lb/>
            stance of things P And, again, are first principles universal, or do <lb/>
            they subsist as singulars, and if so, whether in potentiality or in <lb/>
            energy? And, again, are numbers, and lengths, and figures, and <lb/>
            points, certain substances or not ? and if so, are they in a state of <lb/>
            actual separation from sensibles or not, or do they subsist as being <lb/>
            inherent in them ?1</p>
          <p>Now all these questions are discussed in detail to the <lb/>
            end of the Second Book. But even the discussion of <lb/>
            the first may be regarded as prolonged throughout the <lb/>
            entire of the third. And, indeed, it may be observed, <lb/>
            that the examination of these several doubts reappears <lb/>
            4. The dis­ <lb/>
            cussion of <lb/>
            these <lb/>
            not confined to <lb/>
            book II. <lb/>
            in various parts of the Metaphysics, up to the very close of the <lb/>
            entire Treatise. These questions, likewise, are mooted merely in <lb/>
            this book; the reasons for and against are fairly stated, and nothing <lb/>
            decisive pronounced thereupon; but, whenever they reappear in the <lb/>
            advanced portions of the Metaphysics, it is in order that Aristotle <lb/>
            may pronounce his final judgment upon them. The discussion which <lb/>
            they do receive in this book is in the order in which they are stated, <lb/>
            with the exception of the last doubts, where such is inverted.</p>
          <p>The questions, from the first to that in regard of the <lb/>
            genera of substances, we have examined in chapter ii. <lb/>
            In chapter iii. we have that discussed, in regard to <lb/>
            whether genera are first principles and elements. In <lb/>
            5. The order of <lb/>
            discussion <lb/>
            adopted in <lb/>
            book II. <lb/>
            chapter IV. Aristotle examines as to whether anything subsists inde­ <lb/>
            pendent of singulars; whether there is anything in existence besides <lb/>
            entirety, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ σύνολον</foreign>; whether the principles of corruptibles and <lb/>
            incorruptibles are the same; whether entity and unity constitute the <lb/>
            substance of things. In chapter v. we commence with the question, <lb/>
            Are numbers, and bodies, and surfaces, and points, substances or <lb/>
            not ? And this occupies the entire chapter. There has been a sort <lb/>
            of anticipation in the order of discussion observed; and in chapter <lb/>
            vi., which is the last in book II., Aristotle investigates the remainder <lb/>
            of the doubts. For instance, as to whether, besides sensibles and <lb/>
            media, there subsist forms; how first principles are disposed in <lb/>
            regard of their Lumber ;2 as to the mode of their subsistence; and <lb/>
            as to whether they are as universals or singulars.</p>
          <p>These questions are all worthy of or attention; <lb/>
            though at the same time some are more so than others. <lb/>
            Chapter iv. decidedly contains the most valuable dis­ <lb/>
            cussions in the entire of book II.; and which, on <lb/>
            6. Relative <lb/>
            importance of <lb/>
            these several <lb/>
            questions. <lb/>
            examination, will be found to have an intimate bearing upon Meta <note type="footnote">(1) Vide book XII. </note><note type="footnote">(2) Vide book XI. chap. viii. </note> <pb n="XXX"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK II. </note> <lb/>
            physics. This chapter opens with the discussion of the question, as <lb/>
            to the existence of an absolute cause independent of matter; and he <lb/>
            hows the absurdity of supposing that there is not, which would be <lb/>
            involved in the necessary consequence therefrom, of there being <lb/>
            nothing in existence that could be cognisable by the mind, but that <lb/>
            all things would fall under the notice of the senses. And this would <lb/>
            exclude the possibility of any thing like scientific knowledge; for <lb/>
            you cannot call a mere exercise of sense, science. But, besides this, <lb/>
            such a supposition ends in positive Atheism, for we thereby ignore <lb/>
            the possibility of the existence of an eternal and ingenerable sub <lb/>
            stance. And this is most absurd, because generation presupposes a <lb/>
            generator; and this process cannot go on in a progression ad <lb/>
            infinitum, but we must ultimately arrive at what is everlasting and <lb/>
            7. The most <lb/>
            important <lb/>
            question of all <lb/>
            these, in <lb/>
            chap. iv. <lb/>
            ingenerable. But the most interesting question of all, <lb/>
            because it illustrates the connexion between Ontology <lb/>
            and Theology, is one discussed likewise in this fourth <lb/>
            chapter; namely, as to whether the principles of <lb/>
            things corruptible and incorruptible are one or dif. <lb/>
            ferent. Aristotle complains that this question, though of vast <lb/>
            importance, has been overlooked both by ancient and modem phi­ <lb/>
            losophers.</p>
          <p>8. Discussion <lb/>
            of this ques­ <lb/>
            tion.</p>
          <p>Now, if we suppose that the principles of mortals <lb/>
            and eternals are the same, how are we to account for <lb/>
            the difference in kind that subsists between the two,­ <lb/>
            what is the cause of this difference ? The old Theogonists gave a <lb/>
            silly solution of this difficulty, in the essential difference which they <lb/>
            sought to establish between gods and men; for it really, after all, <lb/>
            secured no distinction at all between them, and in their system we in <lb/>
            vain look for the existence of immortal natures.</p>
          <p>9. Attempted <lb/>
            solution of <lb/>
            this difficulty <lb/>
            by Empedocles.</p>
          <p>And the solution put forward by Empedocles is <lb/>
            equally irreconcilable; though one is hardly prepared <lb/>
            for this in the case of a philosopher whose theories <lb/>
            have at least the merit of being consistent with them­ <lb/>
            selves. Now, Empedocles fancies that he has discovered an adequate <lb/>
            cause of this difference in his theory of Harmony and Discord, for he <lb/>
            is for producing all things from the operation of the latter principle <lb/>
            save the Deity. But this notion is quite subversive of tne essence <lb/>
            of the Divine Nature, for it would set God infinitely below any of <lb/>
            his creatures in wisdom and prudence; e.g. He would not have a <lb/>
            knowledge of the elements consequent upon the non-residence of <lb/>
            tO. It is con­ <lb/>
            trary to expe­ <lb/>
            rience. <lb/>
            discord in his nature, for like is known by like. But <lb/>
            is this theory borne out by experience ? Certainly not: <lb/>
            in Nature the principles of Harmony and Discord have <lb/>
            often results flowing from them quite opposite to those assigr ed by <lb/>
            Empedocles. In short, they do not account at all for the cause why <lb/>
            some things are corruptible and others are incorruptible; and yet <lb/>
            this constitutes the entire difficulty of the assumption, that the <pb n="XXXI"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK III.] </note> <lb/>
            principles of corruptibles and incorruptibles, of mortal and immortal <lb/>
            natures, are the same.</p>
          <p>Now this question, as has been remarked, is a most <lb/>
            important one indeed, on account of its theological <lb/>
            character; but still Aristotle displays no more than <lb/>
            ordinary interest in the discussion of it;1 takes no pains, <lb/>
            11. The Im­ <lb/>
            portance of <lb/>
            this question <lb/>
            explained. <lb/>
            as a Christian metaphysician would do, to make this an opportunity <lb/>
            for showing the connexion between Metaphysics and Theology, and <lb/>
            for explaining the chief points of his religious system. This we find, <lb/>
            however, is the course always2 adopted by Aristotle; he demonstrates <lb/>
            the inevitable necessity of the existence of a First Cause; having done <lb/>
            so, he does not conceive that he is, as a philosopher, called upon to do <lb/>
            any more; and thus he omits, perchance he disdains, to enumerate <lb/>
            the practical consequences flowing from the establishment of the <lb/>
            dogma, that there exists a Supreme Being over all from the <lb/>
            beginning.</p>
          <p>It must, notwithstanding, be confessed that the <lb/>
            Stagyrite has handled the question with immense <lb/>
            ability, and his refutation of the solution put forward <lb/>
            by the Natural Philosophers is characterised by that <lb/>
            12. This ques­ <lb/>
            tion skilfully <lb/>
            examined in <lb/>
            this chapter iv. <lb/>
            plain good common sense which Aristotle possessed in so eminent a <lb/>
            degree. Do you acknowledge, Aristotle would ask such, the exist­ <lb/>
            ence of things eternal ? You must do so; but then, at the same time, <lb/>
            to account for their existence you must assume different principles <lb/>
            from those that you put forward. You must abandon your present <lb/>
            theories. They are very ingenious; but speculation must yield to <lb/>
            truth; systems must harmonise with actual phenomena. We cannot <lb/>
            do away with facts because inadequate causes are brought forward to <lb/>
            account for them.</p>

          <p>HAVING thus laid before his readers these several ques­ <lb/>
            tions, Aristotle, in the Third Book, proceeds to institute <lb/>
            such inquiries about the subject-matter of Metaphysics, <lb/>
            1. Aim of <lb/>
            book III. <lb/>
            as not merely in themselves render more clear the precise objects and <lb/>
            limits of the science, but are also virtual decisions of some of the <lb/>
            problems that were proposed for solution in the Second Book.</p>
          <p>So that whereas what has gone before is disputative,3 <lb/>
            what follows now is explanatory. And as an elucidation of <lb/>
            2. Book II. <lb/>
            disputative; <note type="footnote"> (1) There have been found several opportunities of making this same remark in <lb/>
            other parts of this Analysis; for example, book V. chap. i.; book XI. chaps. VII., <lb/>
            viii.; and at the end of the Analysis itself, where Aristotle's Theology is briefly <lb/>
            examined. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) This, in all likelihood, arose from the fact that Aristotle viewed Theology <lb/>
            physically in contradistinction to Plato, who viewed Physics theologically. </note><note type="footnote"> (3) This is the expression of Thomas Aquinas </note> <pb n="XXXII"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK III. </note> <lb/>

            getical. <lb/>
            the position that entity, as such, is the subject-matter of <lb/>
            Metaphysics, he in the first place proceeds to show that <lb/>
            although the ens, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ὄν</foreign>, admits of manifold subdivisions, yet that <lb/>
            the unity of ontological science is not destroyed thereby, because its <lb/>
            inquiries are prosecuted in reference to entity in one general aspect; <lb/>
            that is, to entity so far forth as it is entity. And this it is which is <lb/>
            the grand characteristic difference between Metaphysics and all other <lb/>
            sciences, that whereas the latter merely institute a partial inquiry into <lb/>
            entity-that is, they have only some fragment of it for their subject- <lb/>
            matter severally—the former, on the other hand, deals with it uni­ <lb/>
            versally, and contemplates entity, so far forth as it is entity, as wel <lb/>
            as whatsoever things as are essentially inherent therein.</p>
          <p>3. Analogical <lb/>
            proof that <lb/>
            Metaphysics is <lb/>
            a science of en­ <lb/>
            tity: chap. ii.</p>
          <p>Thus, to contend that entity, as far forth as it is <lb/>
            entity, is the subject-matter of Metaphysics, or, in other <lb/>
            words, that it has a subject-matter, is merely what is <lb/>
            done in every system of science, as might be shown in <lb/>
            the case of astronomy, grammar, dialectics, and me­ <lb/>
            chanics. Perhaps the best illustration that can be offered to explain <lb/>
            the connexion between Ontology and the rest of the sciences, might <lb/>
            be drawn from the relation between pure mathematics and any of <lb/>
            those sciences where there is made an application of mathematics to <lb/>
            the phenomena of Nature, as in mechanics and astronomy.</p>
          <p>4. Entity and <lb/>
            unity are inter­ <lb/>
            changeable <lb/>
            terms.</p>
          <p>It is in this place likewise that Aristotle announces <lb/>
            the synonymous nature of entity with unity, and how <lb/>
            that to speak of a science of entity is the same thing as <lb/>
            to speak of a science of unity. And this will explain <lb/>
            why it is the ontologist, in the prosecution of his <lb/>
            inquiries, comes to deal with privation and contrariety. But still all <lb/>
            this need not shake our conviction of the unity of metaphysical philo­ <lb/>
            sophy, because all such are examined into merely as the affections or <lb/>
            passive states of the TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄνο</foreign>r TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔν</foreign>. Just as in the science of num­ <lb/>
            bers, oddness, evenness, equality, proportion, are investigated into by <lb/>
            the arithmetician on the common ground of their all being properties <lb/>
            of number as such.</p>
          <p>5. An appa­ <lb/>
            rent objection <lb/>
            a real proof of <lb/>
            the foregoing.</p>
          <p>And there is another analogy which at first sight <lb/>
            would seem to argue the superffuousness of ontological <lb/>
            science, but which in reality strongly confirms the <lb/>
            foregoing view; and such is to be looked for in the <lb/>
            sciences of the sophist and the dialectician. But, indeed, if there <lb/>
            was no other argument to prove the necessity of some such science <lb/>
            as Metaphysics, one might say with truth that this instance would be <lb/>
            sufficient for that purpose. For though entity is the subject-matter <lb/>
            of both, and both are thus seemingly elevated to the same position <lb/>
            with Ontology, yet their treatment of entity is so very imperfect, so <lb/>
            fantastic, so false, that it quite stultifies any speculations they may <lb/>
            put forward about the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ὂν</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">τ᾽ ἕν</foreign>. <note type="footnote">(1) This is controverted by Henricus More, in his “ Enchiridion Metaphysicum "</note> <pb n="XXXIII"/>
             </p>
          <p><note type="margin">BOOK III. </note> Aristotle now approaches the settlement of a ques­ <lb/>
            tion, both sides of which have been already discussed in <lb/>
            book II,—and that is in reference to how far demon­ <lb/>
            strative or apodeiktic principles fall under the depart­ <lb/>
            ment of the science of Metaphysics. And there can be <lb/>
            6. Discussion <lb/>
            in regard of <lb/>
            apodeiktic pun­ <lb/>
            ciples; chap. <lb/>
            iii. <lb/>
            no doubt, Aristotle thinks, but that these do come within the pro­ <lb/>
            vince of the ontologist to inquire into, not merely from their belong­ <lb/>
            ing to all entities, as such, but also from their being wholly neglected <lb/>
            in the speculations of other sciences, such as those of the geometri­ <lb/>
            cian or arithmetician. The only exception to this statement is the <lb/>
            case of the physical philosophers, whose speculations naturally con­ <lb/>
            duct them to an inquiry into these principles; but even granting <lb/>
            that they do so, yet they can never investigate them from that point <lb/>
            of view from which Ontology beholds them. For, after all, physical <lb/>
            is merely a subordinate science when compared with metaphysics; <lb/>
            for we must admit that there subsists something that belongs to an <lb/>
            order higher up, than what is physical, in the scale of being.</p>
          <p>Consequent, then, upon this connexion between <lb/>
            Metaphysics and apodeiktic principles, Aristotle is led <lb/>
            to expose the folly of those sceptics who would endea­ <lb/>
            vour, like the Heraclitics, to subvert the fundamental <lb/>
            7. How Aris­ <lb/>
            totle is led into <lb/>
            a refutation of <lb/>
            scepticism. <lb/>
            axioms that are presupposed in every rational discussion, and upon <lb/>
            which, as its pillars, the mighty fabric of knowledge reposes. But <lb/>
            perhaps the best apology that can be made for these sceptics is their <lb/>
            ignorance; and ignorance they certainly do display in denying these <lb/>
            fundamental axioms, or, in other words, in supposing that there can <lb/>
            possibly be a demonstration of all things. If it be not ignorance not <lb/>
            to know where we are to look for demonstration, and where we are <lb/>
            not to expect to find it, if this be not ignorance,-and this is what <lb/>
            the sceptics are guilty of,-pray, Aristotle asks, what is ignorance ?</p>
          <p>Now the mere statement of what the fundamental <lb/>
            axiom is which these philosophers would call in question, <lb/>
            would almost be a sufficient refutation of the entire <lb/>
            system of their scepticism; for what can be more utterly <lb/>
            ridiculous, and subversive of every rational principle, <lb/>
            8. General <lb/>
            mode of refuta­ <lb/>
            tion as adopted <lb/>
            in book III. <lb/>
            chap.iv. <lb/>
            than to affirm that the same thing can be and not be at one and the <lb/>
            same time. Aristotle, however, proceeds to lay before his readers a <lb/>
            most elaboi ate confutation of this sceptical philosophy, and, as we <lb/>
            shall see, he adapts his modes of attack to the kind of adversary he <lb/>
            has to deal with.</p>
          <p>Now, persons who say that the same thing may and <lb/>
            may not be at one and the same time, affirm that con­ <lb/>
            tradictions are true; and that contradictions cannot be <lb/>

            both true, Aristotle den onstrates by seven arguments. And as a con­ <lb/>
            firmation of the entire, he proves, in chapter vii., that there cannet <lb/>
            subsist any mean between contradiction, uniess we choose to sweep <lb/>
            away the entire distinction that lies between truth and falsehood.</p><pb n="XXXIV"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> [BOOK III. <lb/>
            </note>tO First proof.</p>
          <p>And the first argument that Aristotle employs out <lb/>
            of the seven is founded on the absurdity into which he <lb/>
            drags his adversary, by insisting on his imposing some signification <lb/>
            or other on that which he says may be the same and not the same at the <lb/>
            same time. Now, if his adversary will not submit to this condition, <lb/>
            there is no use in arguing further with a man of such a frame of <lb/>
            mind, because any rational discussion with him would be impossible. <lb/>
            But if, on the other hand, he does submit to this condition, he must <lb/>
            abandon his position of the impossibility of there being anything <lb/>
            fixed or certain in reason, for his present admission amounts to demon­ <lb/>
            stration, because he allows of the existence of some definite object.</p>
          <p>1. Deductions <unclear/> <lb/>
            rom this proof.</p>
          <p>And from this argument Aristotle draws the two <lb/>
            following deductions; first, that the name of anything <lb/>
            must be significant with the unity of itself; and, secondly, <lb/>
            that to suppose at all that being and not being1 arc the same, whether <lb/>
            we assume such as being the case nominally or really, that such <lb/>
            a supposition is entirely repugnant to every human being who has <lb/>
            not thought proper to pervert his notions of right reason.</p>
          <p>12. Second <lb/>
            proof, &amp;c.</p>
          <p>The second argument which he brings against these <lb/>
            sceptics, is that their assertions are quite destructive of <lb/>
            the substance and formal principle of things; and this is <lb/>
            the same thing as to recognise the existence of nothing save what is <lb/>
            an accident. This, however, may be turned against themselves; <lb/>
            for if they admit the existence of what is accidental, they must <lb/>
            acknowledge what is substantive, for the former could not possibly, <lb/>
            in the nature of things, exist without the latter. The third argument <lb/>
            is drawn from the fact that the system of these sceptics, if followed <lb/>
            ap, must end in an irrational pantheism. The fourth argument rests <lb/>
            on the nature of affirmation and negation, and the fifth on that of <lb/>
            truth itself.</p>
          <p>13. The practi­ <lb/>
            cal argument <lb/>
            against the <lb/>
            sceptic.</p>
          <p>The sixth argument is entirely of a practical nature, <lb/>
            for by it Aristotle shows that the indifference which <lb/>
            these sceptics assume in their opinions they do not adopt <lb/>
            in their daily conduct. For why, he asks, does a man <lb/>
            in his journey to Megara not choose to remain still, and yet be of the <lb/>
            opinion that he is actually journeying thither ? If a man, too, walks <lb/>
            on the brink of a precipice, you will observe the caution which he <lb/>
            displays; it is quite plain that he, therefore, does not consider that <lb/>
            it would be equally for his advantage to fall down into it and not to <lb/>
            do so. So that this fact,, that men practically recognise one thing to <lb/>
            be more eligible than another, is a proof from experience against <lb/>
            these sceptics.</p>
          <p>14. Last proof <lb/>
            of the same <lb/>
            sort.</p>
          <p>And the seventh argument is of the same nature with <lb/>
            the sixth; for as the latter turns upon the nature of what <lb/>
            is better or worse, so does the former depend on what <lb/>
            IS more or less. A man who says that four and five are the same, <note type="footnote">(1) We have a brief examination into the subject of " non-ens " in book SII.</note> <pb n="XXXV"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK III.] <lb/>
            </note>toes not make a statement equally false with one who affirms that <lb/>
            four and a thousand are the same. So that, like these sceptics, to <lb/>
            lay down that one thing is not that thing more than another, is prac­ <lb/>
            tically negatived by this gradation in both falsehood and truth, which <lb/>
            Aristotle establishes by the foregoing illustration.</p>
          <p>And it is the adoption of this very absurdity, which <lb/>
            Aristotle has thus finished the refutation of in chapter <lb/>
            iv., that he considers has given rise to the Protagorean <lb/>
            system of the truth of the apparent, or, in other words, <lb/>
            15. The origin <lb/>
            of the system <lb/>
            of Protagoras, <lb/>
            in chap. v. <lb/>
            the dogma that all things are true and false at the same time. To <lb/>
            the refutation of Protagoras he accordingly proceeds, having first <lb/>
            premised that this controversy with the sceptics is modified by the <lb/>
            kind of sceptic you are dealing with; for some of them will be brought <lb/>
            over bv persuasion, and others by force. For example, if persons <lb/>
            entertain these opinions merely from want of knowing better, their <lb/>
            ignorance is remediable; but if they make these assertions merely for <lb/>
            talk's sake, you will have to compel them to resign these sentiments <lb/>
            for more correct ones, through an elenchtical1 argument.</p>
          <p>Before giving us a refutation of this Protagorean <lb/>
            dogma about the truth of the apparent, Aristotle points <lb/>
            out the source of this opinion as springing from sensibles. <lb/>
            16. This origin <lb/>
            explained. <lb/>
            For the same thing may appear sweet to some and bitter to others; <lb/>
            and in general, if all persons were sick or out of their mind except a <lb/>
            few, these few would appear to the others to labour under illness, or <lb/>
            an aberration of intellect. And this holds good in the case of several <lb/>
            of the animal creation, and even with a man himself the same things <lb/>
            do not appear the same at different times. So that all this would <lb/>
            seem to bear out the reality of the assertion, that it is what appears <lb/>
            to be true that is true. And further, it has produced in men's minds <lb/>
            a doubt as to what things are true and what are false. And this has <lb/>
            naturally and necessarily led philosophers into a despondency about <lb/>
            truth, so that Democritus used to say that there may, perhaps, be <lb/>
            3uch a thins as truth, but that to us it is wrapt in obscurity.</p>
          <p>But even after all, this inconsistency in the testimony <lb/>
            of our senses would, comparatively speaking, have been <lb/>
            powerless, had not the sceptical tendencies engendered <lb/>
            thereby been perpetuated by another opinion, coin­ <lb/>
            cident with this sensational origin of the Protagorean <lb/>
            17. The error <lb/>
            involved in <lb/>
            this origin <lb/>
            riveted by <lb/>
            another. <lb/>
            dogma; namely, that sense constituted wisdom and prudence, and <lb/>
            that, therefore, the judgment of the senses was decisive in the <lb/>
            matter of truth and falsehood.2 And all this is proved by a reference <lb/>
            to the writings of Democritus, Parmenides, and even Homer him- <note type="footnote">(1) For the nature of this sort of argument, the student is referred to a note on the <lb/>

            self; so that this system of scepticism naturally arose from confining <lb/>
            observation merely to objects of sense as one source, and from the <lb/>
            ideas which these sceptics had formed by seeing the entire system of <lb/>
            nature in motion; for the continued state of change, which was the <lb/>
            result of this, precluded the possibility, as they thought, of theie <lb/>
            being anything like truth at all.</p>
          <p>IS. The most <lb/>
            extreme school <lb/>
            of scepticism.</p>
          <p>But from this last source has proceeded far the most <lb/>
            extreme school of scepticism ; namely, that which num­ <lb/>
            bered amongst its adherents Cratylus and Heraclitus, <lb/>
            the latter of whom was rebuked by the former for saying that <lb/>
            he could not enter the same river twice, when he ought to have said <lb/>
            that he could not have done so once. But though there may be <lb/>
            some shade of truth in their notions about change, yea, even ad­ <lb/>
            mitting that they were entirely correct, yet they should remember <lb/>
            that there was a certain substance incapable of motion,1 and, there­ <lb/>
            fore, truth must be found there at least.</p>
          <p>19. Direct at­ <lb/>
            tack upon the <lb/>
            Protagorean <lb/>
            philosophy in <lb/>
            chap. v.</p>
          <p>And now, having shown the origin of this opinion of <lb/>
            the Protagoreans, Aristotle proceeds to offer a direct <lb/>
            refutation of it, first, in the difference between sensation <lb/>
            and imagination—<foreign xml:lang="grc">αἴσθησις καὶ φαντασια</foreign>—which prac­ <lb/>
            tically we must acknowledge; for if a man, while he is <lb/>
            in Lybia, dreams that he is at Athens, does he, when he awakes, <lb/>
            proceed to walk towards the Odeion P The second argument against <lb/>
            it may be found in the fact, that the senses themselves are not en­ <lb/>
            titled to equal authority under different circumstances; for example, <lb/>
            what falls under the sense of sight, the eye can decide upon more <lb/>
            effectually than the touch, and the distance as well as magnitude <lb/>
            of objects modify the sensations of them. And, thirdly, if this truth <lb/>
            of the apparent be allowed, it must inevitably end in a denial of the <lb/>
            substance of things and their formal principles; and this will con. <lb/>
            duct these sceptics to a system of nihilism.</p>
          <p>20. Protagoras <lb/>
            further refuted <lb/>
            in chap. vi.</p>
          <p>This same dogma Aristotle continues his attack <lb/>
            upon, in chapter vi.; first passing some remarks on the <lb/>
            practical absurdities of this form of scepticism, which, <lb/>
            indeed, the sceptics themselves are forced to acknowledge. The <lb/>
            mode of attack which he now pursues is to show that, if the truth <lb/>
            of the apparent be admitted, all absolute existences are thereby <lb/>
            denied; for the apparent may be true, but relatively only to the <lb/>
            person to whom it appears true; e. g. if one thrusts his finger beneath <lb/>
            his eye, objects will appear to him to be doubled, though, indeed, he <lb/>
            may prove this sensation to be false absolutely (though true rela­ <lb/>
            tively), by means of verifying it by the sense of touch. In addition <note type="footnote">(1) The necessity of Aristotle's investing the First Cause with immobility depends <lb/>
            on his principle of there being no infinite progression of causes, which there would <lb/>
            be if be did not, in his generation of the Universe, and the motion thereof, ultimately <lb/>
            strive at a stage where motion had its rise, and beyond which it was not to be fo... d <lb/>
            -now this was in the sphere of the immovable First Mover. </note> <pb n="XXXVII"/>
            <note type="margin"> BOOK IV.] </note> <lb/>
            to all the arguments that have been urged against this opinion <lb/>
            of Protagoras, about the truth of the apparent, Aristotle's general <lb/>
            ground of objection is, that it makes everything relative. And with <lb/>
            the statement of this objection he brings to a close his discussion <lb/>
            against those who maintained the possibility of opposite assertions <lb/>
            of the same thing at the same time; adding, that in the impossibility <lb/>
            of this being true was involved likewise the impossibility of con­ <lb/>
            traries being found inherent in the same thing at the same time.</p>
          <p>The question now discussed, according to the arrange­ <lb/>
            ment adopted, is as to whether there is a mean between <lb/>
            contradiction. And Aristotle decides this in the nega­ <lb/>
            tive ; first, from the nature of truth and falsehood; <lb/>
            secondly, from the change necessarily involved in the <lb/>
            21. Is there a <lb/>
            mean between <lb/>
            contradiction? <lb/>
            discussed in <lb/>
            chap. vii. <lb/>
            notion of contradiction; thirdly, from the relation between the <lb/>
            understanding, and what may become an object of the understand­ <lb/>
            ing,—which relation is manifested by definition. And this shows the <lb/>
            important bearing of definition upon a correct decision in the case of <lb/>
            this opinion, and in respect of all such sceptics the source of refuta­ <lb/>
            tion may be best drawn from definition.</p>
          <p>In bringing book III. to its conclusion, Aristotle <lb/>
            presents us with a sort of summary, or brief repetition, <lb/>
            of what has gone before in confutation of the sceptics. <lb/>
            22. Conclusion <lb/>
            of book III. <lb/>
            Some sceptics will have it that nothing is true; some, that all things <lb/>
            are true; and some, that all things are true and all things are false. <lb/>
            Heraclitus, for example, in affirming that all things are and are not, <lb/>
            seemed to make all things true; but Anaxagoras, in his tenet <lb/>
            of there being a mean between contradiction, would constitute all <lb/>
            things as false.</p>
          <p>As Aristotle, however, has stated at the very outset <lb/>
            of this investigation, in chapter iv., that we must affix <lb/>
            some signification or other to what is said to exist and <lb/>
            not to exist at the same time; so has he repeated this <lb/>
            23. Definition <lb/>
            as an instru­ <lb/>
            ment for refut­ <lb/>
            ing the sceptic. <lb/>
            in what he has said, in chapter vii., on the importance of definition: <lb/>
            and he now, in conclusion, reiterates this assertion, and puts forward <lb/>
            definition as the grand instrument to employ with these sceptics; <lb/>
            and he further illustrates his position from the phenomena of rest <lb/>
            and motion.</p>

            these terms.</p>
          <p>The numbers prefixed denote the chapters in which <lb/>
            these terms are severally defined: they are all most <lb/>
            important and worthy of our attention, particularly the <lb/>
            definitions of Nature and Necessity. The first term denned, namely, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχή</foreign>, or first principle, is one of the highest generalizations about <lb/>
            which metaphysical science is in the most eminent degree conversant. <lb/>
            Aristotle's analysis of this word is remarkable for the association <lb/>
            which he makes of it with the good, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἀγαθόν</foreign>, and free will. In <lb/>
            short, under the aspect of a first principle, he will view Nature, and <lb/>
            Intellect, and Free-will, and the Final Cause. As to the meaning of <lb/>
            the term Nature, one chief sense of it is the substance of those <lb/>
            things that contain in themselves the first principle of motion. The <lb/>
            chapter on Necessity, elsewhere stated,1 is most valuable, chiefly <lb/>
            from the ethical point of view from whence Aristotle beholds the <lb/>
            word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναγκα</foreign>î<foreign xml:lang="grc">ος</foreign> under definition. Worthy of note, too, is the <lb/>
            chapter on Priority and Subsequence, as well as that on Poten­ <lb/>
            tiality or Capacity; likewise the chapters on Relation, Entirety, and <lb/>
            Mutilation.</p>

          <p>1. Nature of <lb/>
            book V.</p>
          <p>AFTER this Book of Definitions, Aristotle proceeds to <lb/>
            enter more fully into the subject he has taken in hand; <lb/>
            and in resuming the consideration of it, which to a <note type="footnote">(I) In a note on chap. v. book IV.; vide Translation. </note> <pb n="XXXIX"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK V.] </note> <lb/>
            certain extent was interrupted by the last book, he reaffirms what <lb/>
            he has already proved, and that is, that entity, as such, is the subject. <lb/>
            matter of Metaphysics as a science. Other sciences may institute <lb/>
            an examination into some one genus of entity, but Ontology takes <lb/>
            cognisance of entity universally—entity, as such, simply considered.</p>
          <p>But an a fortiori proof of this may be derived from <lb/>
            physics, which, although it might seem, from its being; <lb/>
            a speculative science, to argue the superfluousness of <lb/>
            ontology,1 nevertheless proves that there must exist some <lb/>
            science to contemplate entity in its entirety, for that <lb/>
            2 A fortiori <lb/>
            proof that On­ <lb/>
            tology is a sci­ <lb/>
            ence of entity ; <lb/>
            chap. i. <lb/>
            only a certain genus of it comes under its own province; viz. that <lb/>
            sort of entity that is endued with the capacity of receiving the <lb/>
            motion that may be impressed upon it. And the same may be made <lb/>
            to appear in the mode of definition adopted by physical inquirers, for <lb/>
            the aspect in which they look at things is in that of their connexion <lb/>
            with matter; and therefore there must be some science to take <lb/>
            cognisance of the immaterial element in entities which will frame its <lb/>
            definitions in reference to the formal principles of things. Now <lb/>
            this science is the science of the ontologist. The foregoing reason­ <lb/>
            ing might be confirmed from the instance of mathematical science <lb/>
            likewise.</p>
          <p>But now the whole matter comes to this. We all <lb/>
            acknowledge that every science has its own proper <lb/>
            subject-matter. Physics deal with motive and mate- <lb/>
            3. Proper way <lb/>
            of settling this <lb/>
            question. <lb/>
            rial natures; mathematics with immobile but yet material substances; <lb/>
            and so forth in other sciences. Yet there is a something that is not <lb/>
            merely immovable, but eternal and immaterial, and yet there is ne <lb/>
            science to examine into it. Its existence is just as real, though <lb/>
            perhaps not quite so obvious as things movable and material, ana <lb/>
            therefore the science that takes cognisance of it is just as real too, <lb/>
            and this is the science of the metaphysician.</p>
          <p>And these comparisons between physical, mathe­ <lb/>
            matical, and metaphysical science bring into light the <lb/>
            threefold division of speculative philosophy into these <lb/>
            three very sciences; namely, Physics, Mathematics, and <lb/>
            Metaphysics. The last, however, which is conversant <lb/>

            with supra sensual things must of course institute an inquiry into <lb/>
            what may be discovered at the very summit of "Being," and that is <lb/>
            what is Divine, and so, in general, into the nature of God, and Meta­ <lb/>
            physics in this point of view may be styled a science of Theology.</p>
          <p>In thus admitting the theological character 2 of Meta­ <lb/>
            physics, and also that Metaphysics, in this point of view, <lb/>

            regards the <lb/>
            relation of <lb/>
            Theology to <lb/>
            Metaphysics. <lb/>
            the one most eligible and most entitled to our love and <lb/>
            reverence, Aristotle allows that the discussion of God's <lb/>
            existence and attributes falls necessarily within the pro­ <lb/>
            vince of the metaphysician. We might, then, expect to find an in­ <lb/>
            quiry of the sort in this portion of Aristotle's works, where so fitting <lb/>
            an opportunity presented itself of his saying something on the subject; <lb/>
            but one in vain tries to discover any such investigation. Aristotle <lb/>
            could have shown how some mediating principle might have been dis. <lb/>
            covered between man's mental and moral faculties, in the fact of our <lb/>
            ascending up to a knowledge of God through the exercise 1 of reason. <lb/>
            Several moral motives might be assigned as sure to act on the heart, <lb/>
            in consequence of this previous conclusion at the head. Thus Aris­ <lb/>
            totle might have gratified his propensity for system, by showing the <lb/>
            mutual bond of connexion between ethics and metaphysics through <lb/>
            the theological element in the science of the latter. That he did not <lb/>
            do so, however, is some proof of the vagueness, and looseness, and <lb/>
            scantiness of his Theology, and, therefore, for practical purposes, its <lb/>
            utter inutility.</p>
          <p>6. How Aris­ <lb/>
            totle would <lb/>
            defend himself <lb/>
            against a <lb/>
            modern.</p>
          <p>No doubt he would have said that he had sufficiently <lb/>
            discussed those subjects that affected the practical <lb/>
            interests of mankind in his ethical writings; but this <lb/>
            would be no apology for the omission complained of; <lb/>
            for though he has perhaps touched on this subject in <lb/>
            his Ethics and Politics, yet he has his eye fixed on man merely in his <lb/>
            social and congregative capacity to the total exclusion of him, con­ <lb/>
            sidered as a religious being.2</p>
          <p>7. Book V. <lb/>
            chap. ii. No <lb/>
            science of the <lb/>
            accident.</p>
          <p>But to return to the Metaphysics, from the point that <lb/>
            has given rise to this digression, will bring us to the <lb/>
            second chapter of book V. In this second chapter <lb/>
            Aristotle shows that though physics is conversant about <lb/>
            things that, in their mode of subsistence, admit of accidents, yet that <lb/>
            there cannot be a science of accidents; but the true way to state the <lb/>
            matter is, to say that there must be a science of that which is neces­ <lb/>
            sarily presupposed in accidents, that is, substance, and this science is <lb/>
            the science of Metaphysics.</p>
          <p>8. Why the <lb/>
            science of the <lb/>
            accident is <lb/>
            brought under <lb/>
            examination.</p>
          <p>It is on account of one of the denominations of entity <lb/>
            being according to the accident that Aristotle is led <lb/>
            into the inquiry about the science of the accidental; <lb/>
            and the result of this inquiry is, that consequent upon <lb/>
            there being no science of the accident, this is one of the <lb/>
            aspects of entity, the consideration of which will be omitted in the <lb/>
            Metaphysics. <note type="footnote">(1) This method has been adopted in many of the schools of German philosophy. <lb/>
            It is, in the present day, however, a settled question that the à priori demonstration <unclear/> <lb/>
            f God'a existence must necessarily be an impossibility. Vide Sir William Hamil­ <lb/>

            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> BOOK V.] </note> That there is no science of the accident, Aristotle <lb/>
            proves by induction from the other sciences, not one of <lb/>
            which, practical or speculative, is concerned with the <lb/>
            accident, as might be shown in the instances of geo- <lb/>
            9. That there <lb/>
            is no science of <lb/>
            the accident <lb/>
            proved. <lb/>
            metry and of architectural science : the former has nothing to do with <lb/>
            what may be accidental with geometric figures, and the latter with <lb/>
            what may be an accident to the buildings that are constructed. And <lb/>
            all is confirmed from the authority of Plato, who makes the science <lb/>
            of the sophist, which is not real but apparent science, to be a science <lb/>
            of the accident. Further, the very nature and cause of the accident <lb/>
            render it an impossibility that there should be a science of it, for in <lb/>
            its nature it approximates to nonentity,1 and its cause is not a cause <lb/>
            operating always or for the most part. Every science, however, is <lb/>
            conversant about some sort of entity or other, and about that which <lb/>
            subsists either always, or as it were for the most part; for this is <lb/>
            requisite for the formation of its definitions, as well as for the possi­ <lb/>
            bility of its knowledge being acquired or communicated to another.</p>
          <p>It is, then, as Aristotle has proved, a settled point, <lb/>
            that there is no science of the accident, and that entity, <lb/>
            from this point of view, may be omitted; but yet all <lb/>
            this is no argument against the accident itself, which <lb/>
            10. The non- <lb/>
            existence of the <lb/>
            accident an <lb/>
            absurdity. <lb/>
            has been already defined in book IV. chap. xxx. For to adopt the <lb/>
            hypothesis of the non-existence of what is accidental, would be to <lb/>
            say that all things arise from necessity, as Aristotle illustrates, by <lb/>
            asking the question, " Will such a man die by disease or violence ? <lb/>
            and shows the chain of contingencies that runs through the circum­ <lb/>
            stances that may bring about the one result or the other. The <lb/>
            accident itself, then, certainly exists, and it would be an interesting <lb/>
            investigation to determine under what class of cause we are to <lb/>
            arrange it, whether under that of the material cause, or the final, or <lb/>
            the efficient.</p>
          <p>But besides this aspect of entity, there is another of <lb/>
            it, which Aristotle omits the consideration of, but which <lb/>
            is acquiesced in by the Platonists, namely, its being <lb/>
            viewed as a sort of synonyme with truth, and nonentity <lb/>
            as the same with falsehood. But the truth and false- <lb/>

            aspects of the <lb/>

            in thisTreatise <lb/>
            chap. iv. <lb/>
            hood in this case is merely subjective, whereas the metaphysician <lb/>
            regards entity objectively; and besides, this consideration of entity <lb/>
            amounts to a view of it as of what is compound or discreet, whereas <lb/>
            Metaphysics, as a science, has to do with what is uncompounded <lb/>
            and pure. <figure type="illustration">

          <p>1. Importance <lb/>
            of book VI. in <lb/>
            regard of the <lb/>
            entire work.</p>
          <p>THIS brings us to book VI., which is a most impor­ <lb/>
            tant one indeed, and has an intimate relation with not <lb/>
            merely what has gone before, but with what follows; <lb/>
            and an understanding of the distinctions and principles <lb/>
            enunciated in this book is essential for the comprehension of the <lb/>
            scope and general reasoning of the Metaphysics as a whole. In order <lb/>
            to perceive the connexion between book V. and book VI., we must <lb/>
            bear in mind the fact of the multifarious predication of entity, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to accident, truth, and falsehood, and the ten categories. Entity, <lb/>
            under some of these aspects, has been already taken notice of, and <lb/>
            the further consideration of it under them designedly omitted alto­ <lb/>
            gether; yet the subject is far from being exhausted, for we may <lb/>
            divide entity according to the ten categories of substance, quality, <lb/>
            quantity, &amp;c. And Aristotle now proceeds to show that the first of <lb/>
            these, namely, substance, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ τί ἐστι</foreign>, is what Philosophy primarily <lb/>
            and chiefly has busied itself with, as might be proved by a reference <lb/>
            to Antiquity. And this is what one should expect; for the first of <lb/>
            the categories presupposes the rest as its qualities, and anything like <lb/>
            real knowledge of a thing is the knowledge of its substance, and not <lb/>
            of its qualities.</p>
          <p>2. Aim of <lb/>
            book VI.</p>
          <p>And this is important in determining what are to be <lb/>
            regarded as substances, and what are not; and the <lb/>
            value of a correct settlement of this question will be <lb/>
            evinced in the fixedness and definiteness of Untology as a science, the <lb/>
            subject-matter of which comprehends this very substance or <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸτί <lb/>
            ἐστι</foreign>. Accordingly, Aristotle proceeds to inquire what " substance" is; <lb/>
            and this being determined, it will be easy to frame distinctions and <lb/>
            definitions thereof, e.g. as to the number and genera of substances.</p>

            thing trans­ <lb/>
            cendental I <lb/>
            chap. ii.</p>
          <p>Now the most obvious and generally received accept­ <lb/>
            ation of the word substance, is that which would confine <lb/>
            it to mere objects of sense; but then the question may <lb/>
            be fairly asked, is there no other substance distinct in <lb/>
            kind from that which comes under the notice of our senses P And if <lb/>
            there is, what is its nature ? is it the same as the boundaries of <lb/>
            bodies, for instance, a surface, and a line, and a point, and so forth ? <lb/>
            or is it the same as forms or mathematical entities ? Or shall we <lb/>
            assume a plurality of such supra-sensual substances, starting, like <lb/>
            Speusippus, from unity, and assigning to each substance its own <lb/>
            first principles, as one set to number, and another to magnitudes ? <lb/>
            These, however, are not quite the questions that Aristotle proposes <lb/>
            to consider at present; they have already had their share of attention, <lb/>
            and another opportunity will present itself for such an examination.1 <note type="footnote">(1) As in books XII. and XIII. </note> <pb n="XLIII"/>
             </p>
          <p><note type="margin">BOOK VI.] </note> The precise object at present is to give a faithful re­ <lb/>
            presentation of what substance—<foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσια</foreign>—is, and there­ <lb/>
            fore, in chapter iii. we find Aristotle entering upon the <lb/>
            settlement of this question. Now there are four leading <lb/>
            4. Different <lb/>
            senses of the <lb/>
            word <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσια</foreign>, <lb/>
            chap. iii. <lb/>
            acceptations of the word " substance;" namely, the essence, or very <lb/>
            nature of a thing—<foreign xml:lang="grc">τό τι ἠν εἰναι</foreign>—the universal, the genus, and the <lb/>
            subject.</p>
          <p>This point of view, of the substance, as the subject, <lb/>
            Aristotle discusses first. What then, he asks, is the <lb/>
            subject ? Why, in one way it is the matter, and in another <lb/>
            5. What the <lb/>
            TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὐποκειμενον</foreign> <lb/>
            is, chap. ii. <lb/>
            the form, and in a third that which is made up of matter and form, <lb/>
            viz. the entire, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ σύνολον</foreign>. Now, we might at first suppose that <lb/>
            matter was the entire subject, and consequently constituted substance; <lb/>
            but there is something else essential to the phenomenal manifestation <lb/>
            of the matter, but inseparable from it, and that is the form; so that <lb/>
            when we speak of the subject as substance, we mean that it is sub­ <lb/>
            stance manifesting itself to us, not as it is in itself, but in the only <lb/>
            way possible for us to apprehend it by, namely, according as it is <lb/>
            matter moulded by form into what results therefrom, and that is <lb/>
            entirety, or the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ σύνολον</foreign>. Thus, take the case of a statue; the <lb/>
            statue is the TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">σύνολον</foreign>, made up of the matter of brass manifested <lb/>
            under the particular form of a statue. But we know nothing of the <lb/>
            substance in itself, except so far forth as it presents itself to us under <lb/>
            the appearance of a statue. Now, as to the relation to substance of <lb/>
            these three-the matter, the form, and that which results from both, <lb/>
            the TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">σύνολον</foreign>—as regards matter, Aristotle thinks that the case is <lb/>
            plain enough, and therefore will not require discussion; and, as <lb/>
            regards the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ σύνολον</foreign>; that will be investigated on another occasion.1</p>
          <p>The remaining inquiry, therefore, is about the <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶδος</foreign>, <lb/>
            the formal principle of things, the TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">τι ἦν εἶναι</foreign>; and <lb/>
            accordingly this inquiry is taken up at chapter iv. and <lb/>
            6. Investiga­ <lb/>

          <p>Therefore, we have an examination instituted in <lb/>
            chapter iv. into the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τό τι ἦν εἶναι</foreign>, or very nature of a <lb/>
            thing, and in the outset Aristotle justifies himself in <lb/>
            this proceeding, because, having attained unto a know­ <lb/>
            ledge of this, we will then be able to pass on to more <lb/>

            of an inquiry<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦν</foreign> <lb/>

            obvious topics; and this is the mode of acquiring information in <lb/>
            general, namely, through what is less known to what is more known.</p>
          <p>The <foreign xml:lang="grc">τό τιἦν εἶναι</foreign>, which, itself, is of a logical import, <lb/>
            is considered logically, because it and the absolute or <lb/>
            8. Chap. iv. <lb/>
            essential are the same; and this is what is proved in chapter iv. As <lb/>
            the discussion, however, is, perhaps, more subtle than instructive, it <lb/>
            is hardly necessary to give here what may be found in the Translation <lb/>

            a question as <lb/>
            regards deft­ <lb/>

          <p>In chapter v. we have another question of the same <lb/>
            nature as that in chapter iv.; namely, as to how definition, <lb/>
            supposing it not to be from addition, would belong to <lb/>
            things that are not simple, but that involve a connexion <lb/>
            with something else.1 And in the discussion of this question he is <lb/>
            conducted to the conclusion, that of substance merely may we expect <lb/>
            to find definition. Again, one may ask the question, Is the very nature <lb/>
            of a thing, and each thing of which it is the very nature, the same, or <lb/>
            different P and the answer given by Aristotle is this, that in the case <lb/>
            of things predicated absolutely, the affirmative of this is true, and <lb/>
            that in the case of things accidental the negative is true, and all this <lb/>
            may be employed for the overthrow of the Sophists.</p>
          <p>10. Illustration <lb/>
            of what has <lb/>
            been laid down <lb/>
            in regard of <foreign xml:lang="grc">λὕη</foreign> <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶδος</foreign>, <lb/>
            chap. vii.</p>
          <p>Aristotle now illustrates what he has laid down in re­ <lb/>
            gard of matter and form by the case of natural, artificial, <lb/>
            and spontaneous generations. All things that are being <lb/>
            generated are produced from something, that is, from <lb/>
            matter; by something, in this case the form; and into <lb/>
            something, that which results from both, the TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">σύνολσν</foreign> <lb/>
            -say a plant, or a man..Now, the aim of the Stagyrite in bringing <lb/>
            forward the subject of generation, is to confirm what he has <lb/>
            already proved; namely, that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶδος</foreign>, or form, is an efficient <lb/>
            principle operating in every object, to which that object is indebted <lb/>
            for the shape it has assumed; in short, it is the producing power, <lb/>
            acting on the matter of that object, and which makes it, to our per­ <lb/>
            ceptions, the object which it is. If this is the case with natural <lb/>
            generations, it is so with those that are artificial likewise, only that <lb/>
            herethe <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶδος</foreign>, or producing power, resides in the soul; for example, <lb/>
            the plan of a building pre-exists in the mind of the architect. And <lb/>
            here, also, we may observe two distinct stages in all this, which <lb/>
            Aristotle denominates by the two words, <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόησις</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποιησις</foreign>, and an <lb/>
            explanation of these words will show the process as it goes on. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νοησις</foreign> means the previous conception which the artist forms in his <lb/>
            mind, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποιησι</foreign>s is the application actually of this to the matter <lb/>
            11. The neces­ <lb/>
            sity of under­ <lb/>
            standing <lb/>
            chap. vii <lb/>
            to be worked upon. Moreover, that which is true in <lb/>
            artificial changes is true also in those that are spon­ <lb/>
            taneous, and this, as well as the whole subject of gene­ <lb/>
            ration, is elucidated in chapter vii, which is well <lb/>
            worthy of attention, and which if not thoroughly understood, it is <lb/>
            Quite visionary to hope that we can imbibe the spirit which breathes <lb/>
            through this truly noble portion of the Aristotelian philosophy. <lb/>
            This theory of Aristotle about the <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶδος</foreign> is the key to his refu­ <lb/>
            tation of the Ideal Hypothesis; and nothing so strongly illustrates <lb/>
            the difference between the Platonic ani Peripatetic philosophy in <lb/>
            general, as this diversity of opinion on the subject of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶδος</foreign> or <lb/>
            form. <note type="footnote">(1) Or, in oth er words, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τό σύνολον</foreign>. </note> <pb n="XLV"/>
             </p>
          <p><note type="margin">BOOK VI.] </note> But although generation necessarily presupposes a <lb/>
            something that is generated, yet we must not fall into <lb/>
            the error of imagining that this is the form, or that the <lb/>
            12. True <lb/>
            theory of forms, <lb/>
            chap. viii. <lb/>
            form is capable of generation at all; for example, to make a brazen <lb/>
            sphere is not to make the sphere, but this form in something else. <lb/>
            This spherical appearance arises either from Art, or from Nature, or <lb/>
            from Capacity, in the way explained above, that is, provided it has <lb/>
            some matter to operate upon. But to say this, is to say that form is <lb/>
            not generated, but that what is, is the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ σύνολον</foreign>, that which is made <lb/>
            up of matter and form. All this Aristotle is of opinion incontestably <lb/>
            shows the utter inutility of the Platonic forms for the purposes of <lb/>
            generation or towards the constitution of substances, because, in <lb/>
            their separation from matter, they are entirely destitute of causality; <lb/>
            whereas, causality is essential to them in the Ideal Hypothesis put <lb/>
            forward by the Peripatetics; so that forms are not the causes of gene­ <lb/>
            ration, either as generating causes or in the way of paradigms or <lb/>
            exemplars.</p>
          <p>The question of generation, however, suggests <lb/>
            another, namely, as to why some things are generated <lb/>
            from Art and from Chance, and why some things are <lb/>
            not. Now, the answer which Aristotle gives to this <lb/>
            13. A question <lb/>
            as regards <lb/>
            generation, <lb/>
            chap. ix. <lb/>
            question has been already hinted at above, and it is this: that some <lb/>
            things, in contradistinction to others which have not, are endued with <lb/>
            some latent capacities within themselves of bringing about certain <lb/>
            changes in regard of themselves ; for example, the wood and bricks <lb/>
            of a house do not mould themselves into the form of one, but this is <lb/>
            done by the builder from the operation of his art; but in the promo­ <lb/>
            tion of heat in the body by friction, say for medical purposes, it is <lb/>
            merely an emission of the warmth that naturally resides in the body. <lb/>
            If, however, we bear in mind the nature of substance and the defi­ <lb/>
            nitions that have been given of it, Aristotle considers that everything <lb/>
            will be plain on this subject, and what applies to the foremost of the <lb/>
            categories, may be said to hold good in the case of the other nine.</p>
          <p>Aristotle approaches the discussion of another ques­ <lb/>
            tion, the reply to which is to be found likewise in the <lb/>
            distinctions that have already been established: one, he <lb/>
            Bays, may ask the question how the relation between <lb/>
            the parts and the whole of anything affects the defini­ <lb/>
            tion of that thing. Now this question is obviously <lb/>
            14. Question as <lb/>
            to the relation <lb/>
            between the <lb/>
            parts and the <lb/>
            whole, chap. x. <lb/>
            suggested by the fact, that in the definition of some things no notice <lb/>
            is taken of the parts ; for example, in that of a circle; whereas, in the <lb/>
            definition of other things, for instance, a syllable, the parts are taken <lb/>
            into consideration. So that the reply to this question is as follows <lb/>
            that in some instances the definition of the parts is inherent in that <lb/>
            of the whole, and that in other cases it is not so.</p>
          <p>But what, it may be asked, gives rise to this ? Why, <lb/>
            that which gives rise to this difference involves the <lb/>
            15. What gives. <lb/>
            rise to the <pb n="XLVI"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK VI. </note> <lb/>
            solution of this <lb/>
            question. <lb/>
            solution of the question itself, and it is this, that in the <lb/>
            one instance we make use of definition by the material <lb/>
            parts, and in the other of definition by the formal parts..Now, this <lb/>
            will affect the parts themselves, because, in a formal or logical point <lb/>
            of view, we regard the parts as antecedent to the whole; whereas, <lb/>
            in a material sense, the whole is antecedent to its parts. Therefore, <lb/>
            the entire doubt has arisen from the ambiguity of the word pait; <lb/>
            and this ambiguity is produced because part may itself be viewed <lb/>
            either in reference to the matter or the form of that which is com­ <lb/>
            posed of both.</p>
          <p>16. This pre­ <lb/>
            pares the way <lb/>
            for another <lb/>
            question as <lb/>
            regards the <lb/>
            parts of form, <lb/>
            chap. xi.</p>
          <p>And this prepares the way for another question in <lb/>
            the next chapter-chapter xi.—what sort the parts of <lb/>
            form are, and what are not parts of form, but of that <lb/>
            which, bearing a certain form, involves a connexion <lb/>
            with matter. This question, however, seems only to be <lb/>
            another question (already discussed), but in a different <lb/>
            shape, namely, what is the difference between formal and material <lb/>
            definition. Now, the decision of the one, as well of the other, indeed, <lb/>
            will rest upon a distinction that we must always make allowance for <lb/>
            in such cases. If we observe one particular form assumed by <lb/>
            different sorts of matter-for example, in the case of a brazen circle <lb/>
            and a circle of stone-and if the question be asked, what are the <lb/>
            parts of the form that is the circle, 'tis plain that, be they what <lb/>
            they may, they have nothing to do with the wood or the stone, that <lb/>
            is, in a logical point of view; whereas, if one sort of matter, e. g. <lb/>
            brass, invariably assumed the form of a circle, then, in explaining <lb/>
            what the parts of the form were, it would be next to impossible-in <lb/>
            fact, it would be a contradiction in terms-to describe this form in a <lb/>
            state of isolation from the matter which it moulded. Take another <lb/>
            instance-a man, whose form always manifests itself in a combination <lb/>
            of flesh and bones, and so forth ; what are the parts of the form <lb/>
            here ? or, rather, is not that question wrongly put, and should we <lb/>
            not rather say, what are the parts of the flesh and bones taken in <lb/>
            connexion with that form which they have invariably assumed in the <lb/>
            person of a man P</p>
          <p>17. Difficulty <lb/>
            of logical or <lb/>
            formal deft. <lb/>
            nition.</p>
          <p>Hence then arises the difficulty of defining a thing <lb/>
            by its formal parts, without any reference to the matter <lb/>
            with which they are combined: for it is only under some <lb/>
            form or other that matter makes itself apparent to us. <lb/>
            The form is a productive energy that is essential to its phenomenal <lb/>
            manifestation: and all this is just what has been already laid down <lb/>
            and described, as the key to Aristotle's refutation of the Platonic <lb/>
            doctrine of Ideas.</p>
          <p>18. Why book <lb/>
            VI. is so much <lb/>
            taken up abo it <lb/>
            definition.</p>
          <p>The reason why Aristotle is so much busied with the <lb/>
            subject of definition here, is, because he is examining <lb/>
            into the subdivisions of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ούσια</foreign>, or substance, from a <lb/>
            logical point of view; and we shall see how that after <pb n="XLVII"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK VI.] </note> <lb/>
            wards an application is made of these logical principles to substance <lb/>
            regarded from another and different point of view. He is, therefore, <lb/>
            careful to say everything that can be said upon the subject; that is, <lb/>
            so far forth as it will not involve a repetition of the statements in <lb/>
            regard of definition which are to be found in the Analytics. There <lb/>
            remains, however, one question more on the subject; and that is, <lb/>
            How are we to account for the unity of definition ?</p>
          <p>The unity of definition would seem to be destroyed <lb/>
            by the multiplicity of the qualities of the thing defined. <lb/>
            The decision of this question Aristotle considers as of <lb/>
            vital importance to any inquiry in regard of substance. <lb/>
            19. As to the <lb/>
            unity of defi­ <lb/>
            nition, chap. <lb/>
            xii. <lb/>
            But the reply to this question seems simple enough, that whether <lb/>
            we regard definition in reference to the distinctions involved in <lb/>
            genus and difference, or not, yet that its unity, notwithstanding the <lb/>
            manifold qualities that are to be included therein, will always be <lb/>
            secured by the unity of the subject of those qualities. And let the <lb/>
            differential qualities be ever so numerous, yet we must arrive at <lb/>
            some ultimate distinction which will constitute the substance of the <lb/>
            thing, and, consequently, by its unity produce that of the definition.</p>
          <p>.Sut there remains another subject for consideration; <lb/>
            namely, the universal; for this comes under our notice <lb/>
            at present, consequent upon the subdivision of the <lb/>
            substance, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ούσια</foreign>, into subject, essence, entirety, and <lb/>
            20. Considera­ <lb/>
            tion of the <lb/>
            universal, <lb/>
            chap. xiii. <lb/>
            the universal; and with the first three we have been engaged <lb/>
            already, and decided upon their nature; and, therefore, lastly re­ <lb/>
            mains to be investigated " the universal." And what Aristotle chiefly <lb/>
            seeks to establish, in regard of the universal, is that it does not <lb/>
            constitute a substance, for substance is that about which all things <lb/>
            else are predicated, but itself is not predicated of a subject, whereas <lb/>
            the universal is always affirmed of a certain subject.</p>
          <p>And now Aristotle brings the whole of the foregoing <lb/>
            reasonings in this book, in their accumulated force, <lb/>
            upon the Ideal Hypothesis, when, in the beginning of <lb/>
            the 14th chapter, he exclaims, with an air of apparent <lb/>
            triumph, " All these statements lay bare the absurdities <lb/>
            that ensue unto those who affirm, both the existence of <lb/>
            21. All that <lb/>
            goes before <lb/>
            bears down <lb/>
            upon the Ideal <lb/>
            theory of Plato, <lb/>
            chap. xiv. <lb/>
            forms, and forms too in a condition of separability from things." <lb/>
            The intimate bearing of these discussions in the sixth book, on the <lb/>
            Ideal Theory of Plato, has been already pointed out more than once, <lb/>
            and need not be repeated here. Aristotle himself, moreover, merely <lb/>
            mentions the fact itself, but does not go into particulars, having <lb/>
            already furnished his readers with a demonstrat ion in detail of its <lb/>
            fallacy, and reserving the discussion of it to a future occasion, which <lb/>
            he actually does resume, as we shall see, in book XII., chaps, iv <lb/>
            and v.</p>
          <p>He repeats here, however, what, by implication at <lb/>
            least, he has already stated in other parts of book VI.; <lb/>
            22. The in­ <lb/>
            generability of <pb n="XLVIII"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK VI. </note> <lb/>
            forms, <lb/>
            chap. xv. <lb/>
            namely, the principle of the ingenerability of forms <lb/>
            and their incorruptibility. But this is not Platonism; <lb/>
            for the forms in connexion with matter-and that is the only know­ <lb/>
            ledge that we have of them-are capable of both. And this contin. <lb/>
            gent nature of matter itself, implied in the corruptibility of the <lb/>
            ro <foreign xml:lang="grc">σύνολον</foreign>, shows that there can be no definition of sensible singu­ <lb/>
            tars. Therefore, we are to bear in mind, when any person sets <lb/>
            down any definition of singulars, that it is always possible to over­ <lb/>
            throw such, on account of this very inadmissibility of definition <lb/>
            belonging unto what is singular. And what applies to singulars, <lb/>
            applies to the ideas which the Platcnists maintain, as capable of a <lb/>
            separable subsistence from singulars. They are indefinable likewise; <lb/>
            and, in the present case, there is the further reason against the <lb/>
            Platonic dogma, from the indefinability of what is eternal.</p>

          <p>And this would-be multiplication of substances by <lb/>
            the Ideal Hypothesis has led men into the error of con­ <lb/>
            founding substance with capacity, and of supposing <lb/>
            certain things to be substances, which in reality were <lb/>
            merely potentialities, or capacities. The unity of such, <lb/>
            e.g. of animal with its members, may have misled <lb/>
            speculators; but when they should have accomplished the separation <lb/>
            of which they were capable, one from another, they would then have <lb/>
            seen the true state of the case, and recognised, not substances, <lb/>
            but merely elements, or, in other words, matter under different <lb/>
            potentialities.</p>
          <p>24. A similar <lb/>
            defect in the <lb/>
            to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἓν</foreign> of the <lb/>
            Pythagorics, <lb/>
            chapter xvi.</p>
          <p>And, therefore, this exposes the Pythagorean theory <lb/>
            about unity being the substance of things; for there is <lb/>
            no use, in searching after the origin—<foreign xml:lang="grc">γένεσις</foreign>—of things <lb/>
            to adduce the component elements, no matter how <lb/>
            subtle or searching your analysis may be; because, unless <lb/>
            vou can point to some disposing or producing cause, you will never <lb/>
            arrive at the present phenomena. Accordingly, when people speak <lb/>
            of what are substances, they should bear in mind, to avoid mistakes, <lb/>
            that substance constitutes a causative principle, and that no amount <lb/>
            of potentiality is equipollent with it.</p>
          <p>25. How all <lb/>
            this settles <lb/>
            the question of <lb/>
            phenomenal <lb/>
            existence.</p>
          <p>And all this Aristotle draws to one conclusion in <lb/>
            regard of the existence of anything; namely, that the <lb/>
            phenomenon as such is to be regarded as a matter of <lb/>
            fact. There is to be no more questioning about it than <lb/>
            there would be of any other fact. To ask why this very <lb/>
            thing is this very thing which it is, is really to ask nothing at all. <lb/>
            What course then should an investigator adopt if guided by what <lb/>
            has been already laid down ? Why, assuming that the thing is what <lb/>
            it is to our senses, he should proceed to inquire into the cause of its <lb/>
            existence, <foreign xml:lang="grc">διά</foreign> or.. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ύπαρχει</foreign>. For example, take the case of thunder; <lb/>
            the phenomenon itself it would be a contradiction of the testimony of <lb/>
            our senses to suppose coul be different from what it is. Our busi- <pb n="XLIX"/>

            ness with it is to try and discover, if possible, the cause or first <lb/>
            principle of it.</p>
          <p>And this will explain all that has gone before in <lb/>
            reference to the logical inquiries that we have been <lb/>
            engaged in throughout the entire of this sixth book; for <lb/>
            if all philosophic speculation must ultimately conduct <lb/>

            an examination as to formal principles; for in the present case the <lb/>
            cause sought for is the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τό τι η</foreign>v e<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰ</foreign>va<foreign xml:lang="grc">ι</foreign>. This brings us to the close of <lb/>
            this very important book, which shows how Aristotle had penetrated <lb/>
            into the kernel of the principles that form the basis of our modern <lb/>
            systems of philosophy; and, perhaps, if the detractors from the <lb/>
            Stagyrite's genius and originality would deem it then luty to make <lb/>
            themselves a little more familiar with his works, perhaps, I say, they <lb/>
            would find abundant refutation here of the anti-experiential spirit <lb/>
            with which they have charged him.</p>

          <p>AT the commencement of book VII. we are favoured <lb/>
            with a sort of epitome of the results already attained <lb/>
            previous to entering upon an application of these logical <lb/>
            principles to the case of that substance which falls under <lb/>
            the notice of our senses. It is as well, however, to re­ <lb/>
            mind his readers, as Aristotle thinks, why it was that <lb/>
            1. Book VII. <lb/>
            contains an <lb/>
            application of <lb/>
            the logical <lb/>
            principles <lb/>
            established in <lb/>
            book VI. <lb/>
            he conducted them through the regions of speculation which he has <lb/>
            exposed to their view in book VI. But an account of <lb/>
            this matter is simply this. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">τό</foreign> or, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ή</foreign>v e<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰ</foreign>va<foreign xml:lang="grc">ι</foreign> is one <lb/>
            certain aspect of substance, its logical aspect. Now the <lb/>
            2. Chap. i. <lb/>
            book VII. <lb/>
            principle of this is to be found in definition; hence the various <lb/>
            inquiries about definition, and its parts, and those that followed in <lb/>
            the way of necessary consequence. Having despatched, however, this <lb/>
            logical inquiry about substance, we come now to deal more imme­ <lb/>
            diately with substance, and our business will be to try and find out <lb/>
            its nature, and the number of those things of which we may predicate <lb/>
            the term.</p>
          <p>Now in regard of the different sorts of substances, we <lb/>
            know that there are some whose existence is acknow­ <lb/>
            ledged by all such as sensibles; yet there are others <lb/>
            3. Different <lb/>
            sorts of sub­ <lb/>
            stances. <lb/>
            about which there is not the same uniformity of opinion, but in <lb/>
            regard of which individual speculators have put forward peculiar <lb/>
            sentiments of their own. However, as a more fitting opportunity <lb/>
            will present itself for the discussion of these latter theories, they are <lb/>
            for the present omitted, but are resumed in books XI. XII. and XIIL <pb n="L"/>

            chap. i.</p>
          <p>Our business at present, however, will be with those <lb/>
            substances about which there are no diversities of <lb/>
            opinion as to their existence; but which are acknow­ <lb/>
            ledged by aL; and these are those substances that are <lb/>
            cognisant by our senses. Now all these sensible sub­ <lb/>
            stances involve in themselves matter; and to say that a thing has <lb/>
            matter, is to say that it has a capacity for undergoing various <lb/>
            changes and affections. And these, of course, presuppose a some­ <lb/>
            thing that is the subject of them, which in the present instance <lb/>
            constitutes a substance.</p>
          <p>5. Chap. ii. <lb/>
            shows that <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰδος</foreign> <lb/>
            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνέργεια</foreign> <lb/>
            are of the <lb/>
            same nature.</p>
          <p>But this view of substance, as the subject of <unclear>certait</unclear> <lb/>
            material changes, identifies matter with capacity ; and, <lb/>
            therefore, Aristotle deems it requisite to state what that <lb/>
            is which may be set alongside as parallel with energy; <lb/>
            and this, undoubtedly, is the <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶδος</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">μόρφη</foreign>; that is, the <lb/>
            form; and it is the aim of the second chapter to show this. Now, no <lb/>
            doubt when we see anything subsisting in any particular condition, <lb/>
            e.g. water as ice, in a state of congelation, we make that condition to <lb/>
            serve as a proof of there being a certain subject of it. And when we <lb/>
            come to see what this subject is, as in the instance of ice as water, <lb/>
            we shall find that it is matter. Matter, however, after all merely <lb/>
            amounts to capacity; and if we cannot discover some productive <lb/>
            power to develop potentiality into actuality, we look in vain for the <lb/>
            manifestation of the phenomenon before us. The discovery, however, <lb/>
            of energy (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνέργεια</foreign>) as a principle of this description, is precisely what <lb/>
            we wanted, and a momentary glance at the circumstances of the case <lb/>
            will show its perfect identity with the <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶ</foreign>S<foreign xml:lang="grc">οςο</foreign>r form. For instance, <lb/>
            what is a calm? it is evenness in the surface of the sea: here the sea is <lb/>
            the subject; that is, the matter, in capacity, of the evenness; but the <lb/>
            evenness itself is the energy.</p>
          <p>6. Different <lb/>
            sorts of matter <lb/>
            have different <lb/>
            energies.</p>
          <p>It is also worthy of remark, that different sorts <lb/>
            of matter have different sorts of energies likewise; <lb/>
            for in some things energy amounts to a synthesis, <lb/>
            and in others to a mixture, and in others to something <lb/>
            else of this sort.</p>
          <p>7. Chap. iii. <lb/>
            contains a <lb/>
            question in re­ <lb/>
            gard of the <lb/>
            name of a <lb/>
            thing.</p>
          <p>In chapter in. we have a question discussed as to <lb/>
            whether the name of a thing bears reference to its <lb/>
            energy-that is, its form; or to that which is a com­ <lb/>
            pound of energy and capacity-that is, of matter and <lb/>
            form. But, however important this question may be in <lb/>
            other respects, yet it is entirely irrelevant as regards <lb/>
            the present investigation about substance cognisant by the senses. <lb/>
            But, nevertheless, it is quite plain that it is similar to a question <lb/>
            already discussed in book VI., as to the inherence of the parts <lb/>
            defined in the entire thing defined; and as capacity corresponds to <lb/>
            matter, and energy to form, it will be found to turn on the difference <lb/>
            already pointed out between material and formal definitions.</p><pb n="LI"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin">BOOR VII.] </note> And the discussion of this question conducts Aristotle <lb/>
            to a solution of the difficulties under which Anti­ <lb/>
            sthenes, and persons similarly uneducated, laboured; <lb/>
            namely, as to the non-definability of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ τί ἐστι</foreign>, or <lb/>
            very nature of a thing. Now, no doubt, the definition <lb/>
            8. Solution of <lb/>
            the paradox of <lb/>
            Antisthenes <lb/>
            about defi­ <lb/>
            nition. <lb/>
            of this, which is the logical or formal definition, has its difficulties, <lb/>
            as Aristotle admits in book VI.; but still we may define the TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">τι</foreign> <lb/>
            it, by making people acquainted with some quality or other of it <lb/>
            of a positive kind: for example, take the case of silver; we might <lb/>
            show not what it is, but what it is like, namely, that it resembles tin; <lb/>
            and that this quality, moreover, resides in a substance that has its <lb/>
            formal principles, and admits of definition, or, in other words, con <lb/>
            stitutes the compound of capacity and energy. And the same solution <lb/>
            is further illustrated in the case of the Pythagoric system of numbers <lb/>
            viewed as substances.</p>
          <p>Thus Aristotle has established the fact that substance <lb/>
            cognisant by the senses involves matter; yet on the <lb/>
            subject of material substance we must bear in mind­ <lb/>
            as is shown in chapter iv.—that although all things <lb/>
            necessarily spring primarily from some original matter, <lb/>
            9. Each thing <lb/>
            has its own pe­ <lb/>
            culiar matter, <lb/>
            shown in <lb/>
            chap. iv. <lb/>
            yet that each particular thing has its own peculiar or appropriate <lb/>
            matter. Though several systems of matter spring from the same <lb/>
            primary matter, this is no obstacle to their being different them­ <lb/>
            selves ; and this may be brought about through the intervention of <lb/>
            some efficient cause; for example, a chest and bed are both made <lb/>
            from wood. But still, where the things themselves are different, the <lb/>
            matter is different; as you cannot by any efficient means make a saw <lb/>
            from wood or wool. So that from the same matter we may make <lb/>
            different things; but where we know the things themselves to be <lb/>
            different, we may assume that they have arisen from different kinds <lb/>
            of matter; or, in other words, that, notwithstanding the existence of <lb/>
            some primary universal matter, yet that each thing may be said to <lb/>
            involve its own peculiar matter. This, however, may be ascribed <lb/>
            either to art, or some such efficient cause; but to be certain that we <lb/>
            assign an adequate reason for such, we should make it our business <lb/>
            to search through the entire category of causes.</p>
          <p>Now, this is what Aristotle wishes to lay down in <lb/>
            regard of substances such as are physical but generable; <lb/>
            yet all this does not equally apply to such as, though <lb/>
            tO. Two sorts <lb/>
            of physical <lb/>
            substances. <lb/>
            being physical or natural, are yet eternal substances: for these latter <lb/>
            do not involve matter, or, at least, such a description of matter as the <lb/>
            former, but matter capable merely of local or topical motion, as might <lb/>
            be illustrated from the science of astronomy.</p>
          <p>And, whilst on this subject, Aristotle thinks he may <lb/>
            remind his readers, that although some things do not <lb/>
            involve generation or corruption, yet that it is only <lb/>
            those that involve both that can be said also to involve <lb/>
            11. What it is <lb/>
            that alone in­ <lb/>
            volves a con­ <lb/>
            nexion with <pb n="LII"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK VIII. </note> <lb/>
            matter, <lb/>
            chapter <foreign xml:lang="grc">ν</foreign>. <lb/>
            matter; but this is just what has been implied in the <lb/>
            statement towards the close of the last chapter. And, <lb/>
            moreover, this holds good in the case of contraries; for they, in the <lb/>
            two cases, are generated palpably after different modes: for instance, <lb/>
            compare the generation of a white man from a black man, with that <lb/>
            of whiteness from blackness. But, further, the doubt still presents <lb/>
            itself as to how, in regard of these contraries, the matter of each <lb/>
            involves the principle of contrariety; whether through potentiality, or <lb/>
            through a corruption of a certain nabit or form usually worn by the <lb/>
            things themselves; as might be illustrated in the case of vinegar <lb/>
            and wine.</p>
          <p>12. Chap. vi. <lb/>
            contains a <lb/>
            doubt as re­ <lb/>
            gards defi­ <lb/>
            nition.</p>
          <p>The last chapter of this book opens with the mention <lb/>
            of a doubt that has been urged in respect of definitions <lb/>
            and numbers, why they should be one; e.g. in the defi­ <lb/>
            nition of man as a two-footed animal, why are not these <lb/>
            two qualities constitutive of plurality, instead of unity. <lb/>
            Now, if people choose to adopt the usual modes of denning and <lb/>
            distinguishing things, they will never arrive at a solution of these <lb/>
            difficulties. The case, however, will be different if they bear in mind <lb/>
            the distinctions that Aristotle has already established as resulting <lb/>
            from the difference of energy from capacity, and how matter is equi­ <lb/>
            pollent with capacity, and energy with form. And this will always be <lb/>
            found to be the case where matter is concerned, whether that matter <lb/>
            be cognisant by sense or by mind (<foreign xml:lang="grc">αἶσθητὴ ἦ νοητὴ ὖλη</foreign>). Of course, <lb/>
            if a thing does not involve matter, the question as to its unity would <lb/>
            be absurd; for the very fact of its immateriality is ample security for <lb/>
            its unity.</p>

          <p>1. Book VIII. <lb/>
            a continuation <lb/>
            of book VII.</p>
          <p>THE eighth book, whereon we now enter, may be con­ <lb/>
            sidered as strictly a continuation of book VII. and <lb/>
            accordingly we find it occupied with discussions about <lb/>
            the same subjects as the preceding, namely, as to what potentialities <lb/>
            are, and the relation subsisting between energy and potentiality. <lb/>
            And as to how it is that Metaphysics, as a science, comes to deal <lb/>
            with the subject of potentiality, Aristotle assigns the cause already <lb/>
            mentioned, namely, that it depends on the multifarious predication <lb/>
            of entity, and from one of these significations of it being what <lb/>
            subsists, according to potentiality and actuality — <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατἀ δύναμιν <lb/>

          <p>Now the subject of potentiality, as respects its vari­ <lb/>
            ous significations, has already come under our notice <lb/>
            in book IV. chapter xii., and the reader is referred to <lb/>
            that portion of the Metaphysics as a collateral stud, <pb n="LIII"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            with this. In the present survey of potentiality Aristotle will omit <lb/>
            the consideration of whatsoever is styled so homonymously or equivo­ <lb/>
            cally ; and this will exclude, amongst others, what is metaphorically <lb/>
            styled Potentiality in Geometry.</p>
          <p>.Now in any classification of the various existing <lb/>
            potentialities we must bear in mind that they must <lb/>
            be all ranged as under one primary potentialit y, which <lb/>
            may be considered as the original principle of change <lb/>
            in something else, and this in another body, and <lb/>
            3. Potentialities <lb/>
            of al l sorts fall <lb/>
            under one pri­ <lb/>
            mary capacity, <lb/>
            chap. i. <lb/>
            so on through several.1 And we may view potentiality either in <lb/>
            reference to habit, or passivity, or activity, and so forth; and to <lb/>
            potentiality in any of these respects there corresponds an impoten­ <lb/>
            tiality which may be regarded as a want or negation of those qualit.ies <lb/>
            or properties which we denominate as potentialities.</p>
          <p>But one broad line of demarcation may be drawn <lb/>
            between potentialities in general; namely, so far forth <lb/>
            as they are either rational or devoid of reason; and the <lb/>
            former will be found resident in animated beings pos. <lb/>
            sessed of a rational soul, whereas the latter are merely <lb/>
            4. One broad <lb/>
            line of demar­ <lb/>
            cation between <lb/>
            capacities in <lb/>
            general, <lb/>
            chap. ii. <lb/>
            mechanical, so to say. There are to be discovered in these, however <lb/>
            different productive energies, according as the subjects of the poten <lb/>
            tialities are rational or irrational; for example, the former may be <lb/>
            causative of several contraries, whereas one result merely can be <lb/>
            traced to the latter. And again, we are to remember that excellence <lb/>
            of condition or execution, the ro <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὖ</foreign>, is not necessarily involved in <lb/>
            the notion of potentiality as such; for although one who carries out <lb/>
            any course of action well must have acquired a certain capacity that <lb/>
            possesses excellence, yet a man may go through a certain course of <lb/>
            action and yet not do so either successfully or properly.</p>
          <p>But as the relation between potentiality and energy <lb/>
            is under examination, Aristotle draws our attention to <lb/>
            certain prevalent erroneous notions on this subject; for <lb/>
            example, amongst the Megaric school, as to energy <lb/>
            being a requisite condition for, or rather, as what was <lb/>
            identical with capacity; for example, a builder, if he <lb/>

            regard of the <lb/>
            relation of <lb/>
            energy and <lb/>
            capacity, <lb/>
            chap. iii. <lb/>
            does not actually build a house, cannot be said to have the capacity <lb/>
            of building. But this view of things is quite false, and might be <lb/>
            refuted from the instances of the arts; for, allowing a man to have <lb/>
            acquired any art whatsoever, could we say that he had lost it <lb/>
            because be was not actually engaged in the production of any <lb/>
            artistic results P</p>

            goras, who maintained the exclusive subjectivity of our <lb/>
            sensations, to the denial of their objectivity. Now really <lb/>
            such theories, if persisted in, will lead to the annihilation <lb/>
            of anything like generation or motion. But the fact is, that these per. <lb/>

            be a guide in <lb/>
            this question. <lb/>
            the distinction subsisting between energy aud capacity. <lb/>
            This distinction has been abundantly illustrated already, <lb/>
            and may be further discerned from the origin of the <lb/>
            term energy-its origin from the phenomena of motions <lb/>
            especially. Moreover, we may ask ourselves what is <lb/>
            the relation between capacity and actuality ? May not a thing, that <lb/>
            is endued with a capacity of being, nevertheless not exist at all ? <lb/>
            and, on the other hand, may not a thing be endued with the capacity <lb/>
            of not being, and yet exist after all? Surely this may be the case, <lb/>
            but there must ensue between being and non-being, or between non- <lb/>
            being and being, some such principle as energy or the motion which <lb/>
            is included in the idea of energy, in order to account for the transi­ <lb/>
            tion or change of either into other.</p>

            capacities ex­ <lb/>
            amined into in <lb/>
            chap. v.</p>
          <p>In chapter V.,1 which is the next following, we have <lb/>
            some important principles established as to rational <lb/>
            potentialities, compared with those that are devoid of <lb/>
            reason. Aristotle shows, in regard of those capacities <lb/>
            that are rational and resident in the rational soul, that their develop­ <lb/>
            ment depends upon habit,2 and that habit, of course, presupposes <lb/>
            various exercises of antecedent activity; still all these capacities are <lb/>
            worked in subservience to some one dominant principle, call it pro­ <lb/>
            pension or free-will, whichever you please, for appetite and volition <lb/>
            in their very nature involve the capacity of successfully accomplishing <lb/>
            their several ends or objects of pursuit. And this in general mav be <lb/>
            stated as the mode in which capacity passes into actuality: it is <lb/>
            through the medium of such principles as propension or free-will, and <lb/>
            that, too, on the grounds already mentioned, of the energy or motion, <lb/>
            involved in the condition of actual existence being the result of <lb/>
            capacity; but propension and free-will, we know, possess in them­ <lb/>
            selves the principle of originating motion in other things.</p>
          <p>9. Correct <lb/>
            views about <lb/>
            energy lead to <lb/>
            the same about <lb/>
            capacity, in <lb/>
            chap. vi.</p>
          <p>So that one advantage that we may reckon on attain­ <lb/>
            ing by our examination into the nature of energy, may <lb/>
            be said to consist in the definite views which we thereby <lb/>
            attain of what capacity really is. And therefore Aris. <lb/>
            totle shows us the nature of energy, not merely posi­ <lb/>
            tively, but also negatively; not merely what energy is, <note type="footnote">(1) In chapter iv. there is an illustration of the nature of possibility and impossi­ <lb/>
            bility, by means of unmeaning symbols, </note><note type="footnote"> (2) This chapter may be read along with chapter v. part I. of The Analogy” <foreign xml:lang="grc">α</foreign> <lb/>

             <note type="margin">BOOK VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            but what it is not. We cannot, however, affirm the subsistence of <lb/>
            all things in a state of energy, save either only analogically or rela. <lb/>
            tively. But, above all things, we should bear in mind that however <lb/>
            energy in its nature is connected with motion, it would be most <lb/>
            erroneous to confound it with motion. The difference between motion <lb/>
            and energy is this, that the former is merely the act of transition <lb/>
            towards a certain end, which end, when it is attained, entitles us to <lb/>
            assert the existence of energy. This point is elucidated by Aristotle <lb/>
            in chapter vi., in the portion of that chapter which (though the <lb/>
            greater part of it) has been called in question on the ground of its <lb/>
            SDuriousness.</p>
          <p>The next question in regard of potentiality which <lb/>
            Aristotle discusses, is, as to where we are to recog­ <lb/>
            nise the existence of potentiality, and where a thing <lb/>
            cannot be said to involve capacity at all; for example, <lb/>
            is earth a man in capacity, or not ? Now, once for all it <lb/>
            may be stated on this subject, that where there is no <lb/>
            10. Where <lb/>
            shall we say <lb/>
            there is capa­ <lb/>
            city, and where <lb/>
            not so, in <lb/>
            chap. vii. <lb/>
            hindrance in the nature of the thing itself, and where we can lay our <lb/>
            finger on some extrinsic efficient principle, we may reasonably infer <lb/>
            the existence of potentiality. But we can never say determinately <lb/>
            that potentiality exists objectively, save where we can pronounce that <lb/>
            a change has been accomplished thereby in something else. And this <lb/>
            may be illustrated in the case of compound things: for example, we <lb/>
            will not say that earth is a chest in capacity; but when the earth has <lb/>
            been instrumental in working a change,-for instance, in contributing <lb/>
            to the growth of a tree,-then we say that the wood is a chest in <lb/>
            capacity, and we call the chest not earth or earthy, but wooden or <lb/>
            made of wood. So that where we can resolve a composite nature <lb/>
            into its elementary parts, and through them into its ultimate matter, <lb/>
            carrying out the rule just given, we shall be enabled to discover where <lb/>
            the capacity exists, or if it exists at all.</p>
          <p>Another question which the relation of capacity to <lb/>
            energy suggests is as to which is prior; and as we shall <lb/>
            see in book XI., where Aristotle makes an application of <lb/>
            the settlement of this question to determine what the <lb/>
            11. Is poten­ <lb/>
            tiality prior to <lb/>
            energy ? <lb/>
            chap. viii. <lb/>
            Divine .Nature is, we shall see, J say, how important a use is made <lb/>
            there of what he now demonstrates, namely, that energy is prior to <lb/>
            capacity. Its priority Aristotle now establishes, not merely in defi­ <lb/>
            nition and in substance, but also in time, though not invariably in the <lb/>
            last. The very nature of energy would show us that its order of <lb/>
            development must be anterior to that of capacity, that is, as far as <lb/>
            substance is concerned; for the first capacity is a capacity of ener­ <lb/>
            gising. This, however, may be different in time; for the matter of <lb/>
            which a man is composed is prior to the man; and yet this statement <lb/>
            after all does not really clash with the principle of the priority of <lb/>
            energy to capacity, for the capacity of the matter to become a rian <lb/>
            would lie dormant, if there did not supervene some productive power er <pb n="LVI"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK VIII. </note> <lb/>
            and this is the same thing as to say, that not merely is energy prior <lb/>
            to capacity, but that, in the present case, if we do not admit this, <lb/>
            a man will not exist at all.</p>
          <p>12. Another <lb/>
            important use <lb/>
            of this principle <lb/>
            of the priority <lb/>
            of energy, <lb/>
            chap. viii.</p>
          <p>This principle, however, Aristotle makes another <lb/>
            important use of, in establishing the fact, that in order <lb/>
            to acquire particular habits, there must, in the first <lb/>
            instance, be an exercise of previous energy,1 and we <lb/>
            know from other parts of the Stagyrite's works, that it <lb/>
            is by repeated acts of such an energy, that practical <lb/>
            principles are formed, and the foundation laid, as Butler also shows, <lb/>
            for there being erected thereupon a superstructure of virtue and <lb/>
            personal religion. For example, one who wishes to learn music <lb/>
            must actually play certain pieces of music, whether vocal or instru­ <lb/>
            mental. And all this shivers into atoms the quibbles of the Sophists, <lb/>
            who would fain make out that a man who is not in possession of <lb/>
            scientific knowledge, will yet accomplish some of the objects of the <lb/>
            science, or master some of its difficulties. We might as well say that <lb/>
            a man is fit for a life of persevering virtue, who has never gone <lb/>
            through any course of discipline, or possessed himself of virtuous <lb/>
            principles of action through the exercise of habit.</p>
          <p>13. What is the <lb/>
            final cause of <lb/>
            potentiality, <lb/>
            chap. viii.</p>
          <p>But we may regard the subject in another point of <lb/>
            view; what is the final cause, we may ask, of poten­ <lb/>
            tiality ? Certainly, actuality. Animals do not actually <lb/>
            exercise the power of vision for the ulterior purpose of <lb/>
            their being furnished with a capacity of seeing; but they have this <lb/>
            capacity in order that they may actually use it. Now, does not this <lb/>
            likewise lend its testimony to the truth of the principle of energy <lb/>
            being prior to capacity? Besides this, however, do we ever recognise <lb/>
            the existence of capacIty-would we ever be brought to allow its <lb/>
            existence-except there could be previously pointed out to us some <lb/>
            form that the capacity had arrived at ? But what is form but energy <lb/>
            under another name ? And certainly the end proposed is prior to the <lb/>
            means through which it should be accomplished, and yet the end <lb/>
            and the energy are the same ; and this we see in the case of teachers, <lb/>
            who, if they can succeed in realizing to their pupils what the energy <lb/>
            is in a particular case, conceive that they have made them acquainted <lb/>
            with the end. Aristotle might have illustrated this by the case of a <lb/>
            drill-master or a dancing-master.</p>
          <p>14. The nature <lb/>
            of eternals the <lb/>
            best proof of <lb/>
            the priority of <lb/>
            energy.</p>
          <p>But after all, we must admit the priority of energy <lb/>
            to capacity in the strictest sense of the word, if we <lb/>
            choose to examine into the nature of what is eternal; <lb/>
            for what is eternal does not, nor cannot, subsist in <lb/>
            capacity, but yet its very essence consists in what con­ <lb/>
            stitutes energy. The notion of potentiality is excluded from the <lb/>
            Divine nature, for that would destroy the necessity of God's exist. <lb/>
            Mice, for it would recognise the possibility of His non-existence. <note type="footnote">'J) This previous energy seems parallel with what Cousin terms Spontaneity.</note> <pb n="LVII"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK VIlI. ] </note> <lb/>
            And all this may be illustrated in the motion of the <lb/>
            heavenly bodies, which, as those bodies are Divine, the <lb/>
            motion of them is eternal. Most certainly, the motion of <lb/>
            15. Ilustrated <lb/>
            from astro­ <lb/>
            nomy. <lb/>
            them has nothing to do with capacity, for then men would be justified <lb/>
            in the apprehension they have from time to time been shaken by, of <lb/>
            a suspension of the laws which rule the celestial phenomena. But <lb/>
            this is quite groundless; the sun, or moon, or stars, will never halt <lb/>
            in their heavenly courses; their periodic journeys will uninterruptedly <lb/>
            be renewed, because these bodies, like God Himself, have energy for <lb/>
            their essence, and, therefore, we may rest certain and contented that <lb/>
            their operations will never be suspended on account of the wearisome­ <lb/>
            ness engendered, or the system being impaired. Nay, even why <lb/>
            need we go beyond our own world in search of this truth, when the <lb/>
            phenomena of fire and of earth might have taught us the same truth <lb/>
            in the perpetuity of their energy ?</p>
          <p>This, Aristotle remarks, is an instance of mutual imi­ <lb/>
            tation between things heavenly and earthly, but makes <lb/>
            no further observation thereon, for he did not know <lb/>
            16. The prin­ <lb/>
            ciple of <lb/>
            symbolism. <lb/>
            what we know by revelation from Christ, how that all things external <lb/>
            are mere types of something inward and unseen, as all our Lord's <lb/>
            miracles show us, and were intended by our Redeemer to show us. <lb/>
            Now, what I mean is this, that Nature herself is one mighty symbol <lb/>
            of what is spiritual, and that the whole creation groaneth and tra­ <lb/>
            vaileth together to have this life, struggling within her womb, brought <lb/>
            to the birth, and her mystic meaning, that is buried within her, borne <lb/>
            forth and carried home to the bosoms of the human race, to be <lb/>
            nursed and cherished there !</p>
          <p>In the next chapter-chapter ix.—Aristotle's object is <lb/>
            to show that energy is more excellent than capacity; <lb/>
            and one chief reason of this is, that capacity presupposes <lb/>
            the possibility of change and corruption, whereas <lb/>
            17. Energy <lb/>
            more excellent <lb/>
            than capacity, <lb/>
            chap. ix. <lb/>
            this cannot take place in the case of energy, for it would be sub­ <lb/>
            versive of our notions of it as well as of its own nature. Corruption, <lb/>
            we know, is an alteration into what is worse; but if we allow the <lb/>
            existence of energy in the case of things having an evil tendency,' <lb/>
            we may give up the whole point about the superiority of energy, and <lb/>
            acknowledge its inferiority to capacity. But this certainly <lb/>
            would conflict so much with our notions of what is <lb/>
            eternal as quite to ignore its existence, because we have <lb/>
            18. This agrees <lb/>
            with our no­ <lb/>
            tions of God. <lb/>
            already seen how energy constitutes the very essence of the Divine <lb/>
            nature. And if we couple energy in any way with what is bad or <lb/>
            tends to worse, we shall be guilty of detracting from the Divine per­ <lb/>
            fections, and allowing evil to be mixed up along with them. But <lb/>
            this is impossible; for, although we may recognise the existence of <lb/>
            evil in things themselves, yet, to make it independent of them-to <note type="footnote">(1) This then would amount to a recognition of the independent existence of a <lb/>
            principle of evil. </note> <lb/>

            up either to God Himself as its source, or we must regard it as an inde­ <lb/>

            ix.</p>
          <p>This superiority of energy to capacity is confirmed <lb/>
            from the case of mathematical diagrams, where the <lb/>
            several properties reside in a dormant, unknown con. <lb/>
            dition, till the mind of the mathematician is brought to <lb/>
            bear upon them, and he discovers and makes known by <lb/>
            the mere energy of thought, those various relations <lb/>
            which constitute truth, and are inherent in those figures potentially <lb/>
            or in capacity.VIII.,</p>
          <p>20. Chap. x. <lb/>
            is concerned <lb/>
            with the rela­ <lb/>
            tion of truth <lb/>
            and falsehood <lb/>
            to energy and <lb/>
            capacity.</p>
          <p>In chapter x., which is the last one In book VIII., <lb/>
            Aristotle proceeds to show the relation subsisting <lb/>
            between truth and falsehood, as compared with that <lb/>
            subsisting between energy and capacity; and this rela­ <lb/>
            tion is explained as involving a further proof of the <lb/>
            superiority of energy to capacity. In things involving <lb/>
            capacity, deception is possible-an assertion about their existence <lb/>
            may be true or false;—but in the case of energy this cannot be the <lb/>
            fact, because, where actuality is concerned, there is an end of any­ <lb/>
            thing like an exercise of mind as to its reality or unreality. With <lb/>
            respect, then, to things potential, the same opinion may be at one <lb/>
            time true, and at another time false: with respect to things impoten­ <lb/>
            tial, this cannot be; but the same assertions are always true and <lb/>
            always false. And this depends, not on the things themselves, but <lb/>
            according as the mind connects together ideas where they are dis­ <lb/>
            joined in reality, or disjoins them where they are connected. Now, <lb/>
            this proclaims the purely subjective character of truth and falsehood, <lb/>
            at least according to Aristotle; but where we are concerned with <lb/>
            what is objective, as in energy, there is then no question about it, as <lb/>
            in the case of what is potential; for in the former instance the <lb/>
            thing is before you, and if you are furnished with the powers of <lb/>
            sense, there is no necessity for your calling into play the faculties of <lb/>
            the mind in such a way as you do when you predicate truth or false- <lb/>
            21. This rela­ <lb/>
            tion points to <lb/>
            the superiority <lb/>
            of energy to <lb/>
            capacity. <lb/>
            hood of anything. Now, as I take Aristotle to mean <lb/>
            here, this is another proof of the superiority of energy <lb/>
            to capacity, because, whereas capacity may furnish a" <lb/>
            matter of doubt, because its reality often depends on <lb/>
            the subjectivity of mind, yet, on the other hand, <lb/>
            energy possesses an objective existence, and it is outside the mind, <lb/>
            independent of its operations of compounding and dividing. There­ <lb/>
            fore, when a thing actually exists, it does not admit of being the <lb/>
            subject of a false opinion; a false opinion in regard of such amounts <lb/>
            to ignorance. If an object of sight was before a man who had not <lb/>
            the power of vision, any mental exercise on his part as to its exist­ <lb/>
            ence would be quite beside the question of its existence. The <lb/>
            thing is there, think as you may: you may not know it, because you <pb n="LIX"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK IX.] </note> <lb/>
            want the power of sensation to perceive it; but this is not the case <lb/>
            with others, who do not labour under this ignorance, but are supplied <lb/>
            with the means that Nature furnishes for this purpose. This brings <lb/>
            book VIII. to its close.</p>

          <p>BOOK IX. is by no means equal in importance with <lb/>
            book VIII., or, indeed, any of the foregoing; it is <lb/>
            entirely occupied with the consideration of unity-the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἐν</foreign>—which, to the metaphysician, is an interchange- <lb/>
            1. Book IX. <lb/>
            occupied with <lb/>
            unity, the " <lb/>
            able term with entity-the TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀν</foreign>. The subject of unity has already <lb/>
            been brought before our notice in book IV. chapter vi.; and in the <lb/>
            commencement of this book we have a sort of summary of the defini­ <lb/>
            tions given there, with this difference, however, that here no atten­ <lb/>
            tion is paid to anything save essential or absolute unity; whereas in <lb/>
            book IV. this sort, as well as unity according to accident, are taken <lb/>
            into consideration. Now, unity is predicated of what <lb/>
            is continuous and indivisible, especially so in regard <lb/>
            of its motion; but the strictest notion of unity is com- <lb/>
            2. Signification <lb/>
            of unity, cbap.i <lb/>
            prehended in its being a measure in quantity; and this we see in <lb/>
            the fact of the measurement of various magnitudes and dimensions <lb/>
            by means of number-their measurement, for instance, in length, <lb/>
            breadth, depth, weight, velocity, and so forth. Now, the measure <lb/>
            in general requisition is such a one as is uniform and indivisible; <lb/>
            and such, unity already has been defined to be. It is in itself simple, <lb/>
            and in its case we look in vain for the possibility of addition to, or <lb/>
            subtraction from it, as a measure; so that, all points considered, <lb/>
            unity-that is, number-is the most precise standard of measure we <lb/>
            could fix upon. Now, this may be seen in astronomy, where there <lb/>
            has been a sort of unity adopted as to the measurement of the <lb/>
            velocities of the heavenly bodies, and in music, and in grammar.</p>
          <p>And as the subject has been mentioned, Aristotle <lb/>
            sets down certain considerations in regard of measure, <lb/>
            and amongst others mentions a metaphorical or derived <lb/>
            signification of the word in the phrases that science <lb/>
            3. Certain con­ <lb/>
            siderations in <lb/>
            regard of <lb/>
            measure.. <lb/>
            was the measure of the objects of science, and sense the measure <lb/>
            of the objects of sensation. The case is just as if another person <lb/>
            were measuring us; we would be able to decide as to how large we <lb/>
            in reality were by the extent to which the rule of measurement <lb/>
            reached over our persons. But Aristotle would not <lb/>
            wish to be misunderstood in this matter; by all this he <lb/>
            did not mean to harmonise with the opinion of Prota- <lb/>
            4. Disavowal of <lb/>
            the dogma of <lb/>
            Protagoras. <lb/>
            goras, who held that man was the measure of all things, for it is <lb/>
            science, and not a scientific person—it is sense, and n)t a sentient <note type="footnote">e 2 </note> <pb n="LX"/>

            5. Is man the <lb/>
            measure of all <lb/>
            things ? <lb/>
            person, that he pronounces as a measure. Not that <lb/>
            Aristotle makes the remark here, but one may say that <lb/>
            this dogma of Protagoras has its spark of truth in it. <lb/>
            But when you come to apply it to things, you see how silly it is, and <lb/>
            Low false, for it would merge all objectivity into pure subjectivity. <lb/>
            I may add, that the tendency which people have to allow this element <lb/>
            of truth in the tenet of Protagoras to exercise its silent influence <lb/>
            over their philosophic reasonings, often weakens the argument, for <lb/>
            example, that has been urged from experience against miracles.1</p>
          <p>6. Chap. ii. <lb/>
            Is unity a sub­ <lb/>
            stance?</p>
          <p>Chapter ii. opens with the question as to whether <lb/>
            unity is a substance or subject; and this Pythagorean <lb/>
            and Platonic view of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὀ</foreign> —namely, considering it <lb/>
            equivalent with <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>, or substance-Aristotle, as already before, <lb/>
            expresses his dissent from. Now, for the present purpose we may <lb/>
            regard the TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν</foreign>as a term interchangeable with the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὀ ὀν</foreign>; and pro­ <lb/>
            ceeding on this, he illustrates the absurdity of this Pythagoric dogma <lb/>
            in the cases of colours, and music, and vocal sounds, and mathe­ <lb/>
            matical figures. And as to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὀ ἐν</foreign> and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὀ ὀν</foreign>being interchangeable <lb/>
            terms, we may assume this from the fact of their following upon the <lb/>
            categories in an equal number of ways with each other, and not being <lb/>
            found in any of them; thus the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὀ</foreign> *v in the case of substance and <lb/>
            quality is similarly disposed with the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὀ ὀν</foreign>.</p>
          <p>7. Chap. iii. <lb/>
            the modes of <lb/>
            opposition be­ <lb/>
            tween unity <lb/>
            and plurality.</p>
          <p>In chapter in. Aristotle treats of the modes of <lb/>
            opposition between unity and plurality, and thus is led <lb/>
            to treat of contradiction, contrariety, and so forth. In <lb/>
            tracing, however, this opposition, Aristotle points out <lb/>
            what he conceives to be the concomitants of unity; viz. <lb/>
            sameness, similarity, and equality; and of plurality; viz. diversity, <lb/>
            dissimilarity, and inequality; and he furnishes a brief notice of the <lb/>
            meanings of these several terms.</p>
          <p>8. Chap. iv. <lb/>
            on the greatest <lb/>
            difference, I. e. <lb/>
            contrariety.</p>
          <p>But now, as he shows in chapter iv., difference <lb/>
            presupposes a difference in a greater or smaller degree ; <lb/>
            and thus we ultimately come to the greatest possible <lb/>
            difference, and this Aristotle styles contrariety, which <lb/>
            he asserts to be evident from induction, and which he accordingly <lb/>
            proves in this way, proceeding on the assumption of the greatest <lb/>
            difference being in each instance the most perfect difference. Con­ <lb/>
            trariety thus constitutes the greatest difference, and the greatest <lb/>
            contrariety amounts to habit and privation. Though every con­ <lb/>
            trariety, however, amounts to privation, yet not every privation <lb/>
            constitutes contrariety, save that one which is perfect; and this <lb/>
            depends on the multifarious predication of privation. We have then <lb/>
            an examination into the various senses of contrariety, and into the <note type="footnote">(1) A popular illustration of this principle might be found in one of Sir Walter <lb/>
            Scott's Novels, “The Talisman," where an Oriental is represented as disbelieving in <lb/>
            the existence of ice, because contrary to his own experience, thereby making <unclear>h</unclear>.mtekj <lb/>
            the measure of things </note> <pb n="LXI"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK IX.] </note> <lb/>
            opposition subsisting in the cases of contradiction, privation, con <lb/>
            trariety, and relation, assigning the first place to contradiction. <lb/>
            These investigations, however, belong so palpably to the province of <lb/>
            the logician, that some have considered them quite out of place <lb/>
            here, and suspected that they have found their way from some logical <lb/>
            treatise of Aristotle, into the Metaphysics, and have been inserted in <lb/>
            them by some mismanagement or other.1</p>
          <p>We have a continuation of the same subject in chap­ <lb/>
            ter v., where Aristotle remarks that one may ask the <lb/>
            question, how unity is opposed to plurality, as well as <lb/>
            equality, to the great and small ? And the question as <lb/>
            9. The question <lb/>
            of opposition <lb/>
            continued in <lb/>
            chap. V. <lb/>
            to the opposition between equality and the great and the small <lb/>
            is discussed to the end of this chapter. In the beginning of <lb/>
            chapter vL we have the question examined as to the opposition <lb/>
            between unity and plurality; and Aristotle starts the surmise, as to <lb/>
            whether there may not prevail certain absurd consequences, as the <lb/>
            results of this opposition, depending on the opposition between plu­ <lb/>
            rality and the few. And in the course of this discussion he attacks <lb/>
            the Anaxagorean tenet of the subsistence of all things simultane­ <lb/>
            ously in a condition of infinity, both in multitude and in smallness. <lb/>
            This was not a correct or philosophic method of speaking for Anax­ <lb/>
            agoras to adopt; the infinity he should have affirmed as having <lb/>
            reference to smallness and fewness—<foreign xml:lang="grc">κ</foreign>a<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὶ μικρότητητι καὶ ὀλιγότητι</foreign>.</p>
          <p>In chapter vii. we have the doctrine inculcated of the <lb/>
            necessity of media, arising from contraries, on the sup­ <lb/>
            position of the admissibility of there being a medium <lb/>
            10. Chap. vii. <lb/>
            on the subject <lb/>
            of media. <lb/>
            between contrariety and some things else. And this leads to the <lb/>
            showing that media belong to the same genus, as well as being com­ <lb/>
            pounded of contraries.</p>
          <p>The discussions which occupy us to the end of book <lb/>
            IX. do indeed seem quite irrelevant to the subject in <lb/>
            hand, and from chapter viii. onwards we are busied with <lb/>
            investigations strictly logical, e.g. as to how things that <lb/>
            differ m species may be found in the same genus, on <lb/>
            account of some characteristic belonging to them in <lb/>
            common with each other; as, for example, man and <lb/>
            11. The in­ <lb/>
            quiries in book <lb/>
            IX. hardly <lb/>
            relevant to a <lb/>
            treatise on <lb/>
            Metaphysics, <lb/>
            chaps, viii. <lb/>
            and ix. <lb/>
            horse, though differing in species, belong to the same genus, namely, <lb/>
            animal. And this leads to the question, why difference of species is <lb/>
            not to be found in cases where contrariety is; as, for example, a man <lb/>
            and a woman do not differ in species, though it must be acknowledged <lb/>
            that contrariety is involved in the distinction of male from female. <lb/>
            Aristotle therefore proceeds to show what difference of species really <lb/>
            is, and why some things may involve this difference in species, and <lb/>
            some things may not. And all this, in chapter x., is <lb/>
            brought to bear on the nature of the relation between <lb/>
            12. Chap. x. <lb/>
            what is corruptible and incorruptible; in this way: contraries are <note type="footnote">(1) Vide Mr. Maurice's remarks on this book, in his Analysis. </note> <pb n="LXII"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK X. </note> <lb/>
            different in species; but corruptibles and incorruptibles are contraries; <lb/>
            and therefore we are to admit a generic difference as subsisting <lb/>
            between what is incorruptible and what is corruptible; and this quite <lb/>
            overthrows the Platonic dogma of forms. This does not clash with <lb/>
            what Aristotle says about things, though different in species, belong­ <lb/>
            ing to the same genus, because this only takes place where they <lb/>
            belong to the same co-ordinate series of the categories, which cer­ <lb/>
            tainly can never take place in the case of what is corruptible, com­ <lb/>
            pared with what is incorruptible. This brings book IX. to its <lb/>
            conclusion.</p>

          <p>I. Book X. <lb/>
            chiefly a re­ <lb/>
            capitulation.</p>
          <p>BOOK X. is chiefly a recapitulation of questions that <lb/>
            already have occupied our attention, and the implied <lb/>
            object of which is to establish the unity and complete­ <lb/>
            ness of Metaphysics as a science. One would doubt, says Aristotle, <lb/>
            in the very beginning of the first chapter, as to whether we ought to <lb/>
            consider Wisdom, that is, Ontology, to constitute one science or many. <lb/>
            And all of what follows converges towards the unity of ontological <lb/>
            science, for it takes notice of metaphysics as a science about apodeik­ <lb/>
            tic principles, that is, those principles which lie at the basis of all the <lb/>
            sciences. Again, which of the four causes is Ontology principally <lb/>
            concerned with ? not with the material causes, for it deals with imma­ <lb/>
            terial substances; not with the efficient cause, for it takes notice of <lb/>
            what is immovable; and not so much with the final cause, which has <lb/>
            its place in the case of things that are practical rather than specu­ <lb/>
            lative ; not so much, then, with the final as the formal cause-a fact <lb/>
            which is shown in book VI. chiefly.</p>
          <p>2. What sub­ <lb/>
            stances are the <lb/>
            subject-matter <lb/>
            of Ontology.</p>
          <p>But the recognition by the metaphysician of the <lb/>
            existence of supra-sensual substances suggests the ques­ <lb/>
            tion, what are supra-sensual substances P Are, for ex­ <lb/>
            ample, forms of this nature, and mathematical entities P <lb/>
            and are they to be regarded as the subject-matter of Metaphysics, or <lb/>
            not ?Metaphysics certainly are not conversant about mathematical <lb/>
            entities; for although they are immovable, yet they do not possess <lb/>
            a separable subsistence; and they are not conversant with objects that <lb/>
            fall under the notice of the senses, for these are subject to corruption. <lb/>
            3. This deter­ <lb/>
            mined by a re­ <lb/>
            ference to the <lb/>
            other sciences. <lb/>
            But at the same time, so far forth as the matter which <lb/>
            mathematics take cognisance of is immovable, and so <lb/>
            far forth as the question of its immobility is overlooked <lb/>
            by the mathematician, as lying beyond his province, so <lb/>
            far Ontology is a science speculative of that matter. It does not. <lb/>
            undoubtedly, fall under the department of Natural Philosophy to enter <lb/>
            into an examination of such, for it is concerned with what is mov­ <lb/>
            able, and capable of having motion impressed upon it from extrinsic <pb n="LXIII"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK X.] </note> <lb/>
            sources. About what sort of first principles likewise is the science <lb/>
            of Metaphysics conversant ?-about those that are primary and uni. <lb/>
            versal in the most eminent sense of that term, and denominated <lb/>
            generally elements. Again, do entity and unify, the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὀ ὀν</foreign>and TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν</foreign>, <lb/>
            fall under its notice as the primary genera of things ?</p>
          <p>Farther, must we admit the existence of a some­ <lb/>
            thing separable and independent of singulars ? Are <lb/>
            there any substances, beside those cognisant to sense, <lb/>
            4. Is there a <lb/>
            something that <lb/>
            is separable? <lb/>
            which subsist in a condition of actual separation ? This involves the <lb/>
            entire question as to the reality of metaphysical science, whose object <lb/>
            is to try and discover the existence of such, and make it manifest to <lb/>
            others. But the absurdity involved in supposing that there is no <lb/>
            such supra-sensual substance in existence is apparent from its recog <lb/>
            nition merely of the existence of matter. Now matter, <lb/>
            we know, merely subsists in capacity, and without the <lb/>
            operation of energy or the formal principle, its existence <lb/>
            would be to us a nonentity; its existence, however, <lb/>
            5. Matter pre <lb/>
            supposes the <lb/>
            existence of <lb/>
            such. <lb/>
            proves the presence of energy, and energy presupposes the subsist­ <lb/>
            ence of an Eternal Substance. Besides, if we deny the <lb/>
            existence of this Eternal Substance, we ignore the <lb/>
            existence of order and design in the Universe; but <lb/>
            this will amount to the practical absurdity of denying <lb/>
            6. Other argu­ <lb/>
            ments from the <lb/>
            nature of what <lb/>
            is eternal. <lb/>
            the reality of what are matters of fact. Again, are we to recognise <lb/>
            any identity as subsisting between the first principles of mortals and <lb/>
            immortals ?certainly not, as has been abundantly discussed in book <lb/>
            II., chapter iv. Again, what position are we to assign to entity and <lb/>
            unity in the category of first principles ? and are we to recognise the <lb/>
            subsistence of a something beside entirety?—the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὀ σύνολον</foreign>Farther, <lb/>
            are we to assign any limit to first principles, or not ?</p>
          <p>In chapter iii. Aristotle shows that the subject- <lb/>
            matter of Metaphysics is strictly and properly entity as <lb/>
            such; and he lays down what already he has demon­ <lb/>
            strated, namely, that the unity of metaphysical science <lb/>
            7. Chap. iii. <lb/>
            the subject- <lb/>
            matter of <lb/>
            Metaphysics. <lb/>
            is not destroyed by the multiplicity of the subjects which it em­ <lb/>
            braces, consequent upon the many subdivisions of entity. And this <lb/>
            he illustrates, as heretofore, by the case of medical science; and, in <lb/>
            general, we may take it for granted that all the various details of any <lb/>
            science are kept within the limits of unity, by being examined and <lb/>
            cultivated in reference to one certain genus, as well as one definite <lb/>
            purpose. And all this is confirmed from the instances of the sciences <lb/>
            of Geometry, Natural Philosophy, and Dialectics.</p>
          <p>But, though there is a wide divergence in the subject- <lb/>
            matter of Mathematics and Metaphysics, yet in some <lb/>
            points they intersect each other; for the mathematician <lb/>
            makes use of those apodeiktic principles which fall <lb/>
            under the notice of the ontologist likewise. After all, <lb/>
            8. Chap. iv. <lb/>
            compares Ma­ <lb/>
            thematics and <lb/>
            Metaphysics <lb/>
            together. <lb/>
            however, his use of them is peculiar to himself, and he leaves to the <pb n="LXIV"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK X. </note> <lb/>
            metaphysician to speculate into the principles of these. And further <lb/>
            we are to bear in mind, that although in some respects the subject- <lb/>
            matter of Mathematics and Metaphysics is the same, because they <lb/>
            both contemplate what is immovable, yet that the former science <lb/>
            merely views a certain portion of that which the latter investigates <lb/>
            into in its entirety.</p>
          <p>9. Reconsider­ <lb/>
            ation of the <lb/>
            systems of the <lb/>
            sceptics in <lb/>
            chapter v.</p>
          <p>The mention, however, of these apodeiktic principles <lb/>
            suggests the consideration of those few fundamental <lb/>
            axioms that lie at the bottom of all reasoning, and, <lb/>
            therefore, all systems of science. And this suggests the <lb/>
            reconsideration, in chapter v. of this book, of those <lb/>
            who ventured to deny the validity of these fundamental axioms- <lb/>
            reconsideration, I say; for the subject has been already treated of in <lb/>
            book III. In book X., however, we have the same topic brought <lb/>
            before us, and are furnished with a second, and somewhat more <lb/>
            elaborate, refutation of the sceptical philosophies1 of Protagoras <lb/>
            and Heraclitus. The course that Aristotle adopts, in his refutation <lb/>
            of these systems, in book X., is pretty much the same as he has fol­ <lb/>
            lowed in book III. He enlarges on the absurdity involved in the <lb/>
            denial of such a simple principle—nay, such a flat truism-as that <lb/>
            the same thing may and may not be at one and the same time, or <lb/>
            that contradictions may be both true. It subverts our notions of the <lb/>
            difference between negation and affirmation; and, accordingly, one <lb/>
            capital mode of refutation may be derived from the necessity that the <lb/>
            sceptic finds himself under, of assigning some meaning or other to <lb/>
            that, the existence or non-existence of which he affirms to be the <lb/>
            same. Now, when this meaning has been signalised by some name, <lb/>
            the folly of the sceptic will be made apparent even to himself; as is <lb/>
            shown more fully in book III. chapter iv. And all this Aristotle <lb/>
            deems would be sufficient to convict Heraclitus himself of his incon­ <lb/>
            sistency : but there is another adversary, to whose system the same <lb/>
            will be antagonistic, and that is Protagoras; as he proceeds to show <lb/>
            in chapter vi.</p>
          <p>10. The folly <lb/>
            of the sceptic <lb/>
            apparent in <lb/>
            Protagoras, <lb/>
            chapter vi.</p>
          <p>This denial of the fundamental axioms of all reasoning <lb/>
            has manifested itself in the dogma of Protagoras, about <lb/>
            man being the measure of all things. It may seem <lb/>
            absurd to reduce a theory of so pompous a title to <lb/>
            a class of systems so obviously silly as that refuted in <lb/>
            chapter v.; but, nevertheless, upon examination, they will be found <lb/>
            as springing from common sources, namely, the projection of our <lb/>
            subjective notions into the regions of objectivity, and a resolve not <lb/>
            to recognise truth, if it does not harmonise with our preconceived <lb/>
            notions. Now, this dogma of Protagoras, that man is a measure of <lb/>
            all things, is the same as that which already has come under our <note type="footnote">(1) Vide Hume's Essays, Essay xviii. vol. I and Essays i., iv. and xii. vol. 2; also <lb/>

             <note type="margin">BOOK X.] </note> <lb/>
            notice in book III., as embodied in the assertion of the truth of the <lb/>
            apparent; which assertion has been already refuted there.</p>
          <p>But as to the truth of the apparent, we may lay it <lb/>
            down as certain that the origin of this opinion, namely, <lb/>
            from the tenets of certain Natural Philosophers, who all <lb/>
            appeared to have arrived at the same scientific inferences <lb/>
            11. Origin of <lb/>
            the dogma of <lb/>
            the truth of <lb/>
            the apparent. <lb/>
            in regard of the generation of nothing out of nothing,-that this <lb/>
            origin is tantamount to a refutation of the paradox itself. And the <lb/>
            sensational origin of the paradox is likewise a refutation of it; for to <lb/>
            affirm the reality of what is apparent to the senses, is to take no <lb/>
            account of the possibility of the senses themselves being injured, or <lb/>
            otherwise incapacitated from deciding about truth; for example, just <lb/>
            as if one were to place the fingers under his eye, and make objects <lb/>
            seem double, which were single in point of fact. Here, at least, <lb/>
            would be an instance where the apparent-the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὀ φαίνομενον</foreign>—was <lb/>
            not true.</p>
          <p>But pray why permit the sceptic to pronounce dog­ <lb/>
            matically as regards phenomena which he himself allows <lb/>
            to be fleeting and uncertain, and on which, as such, he <lb/>

            must render impossible the attainment of truth at all, and therefore, <lb/>
            why has the sceptic any right to contend for the truth of his sceptis­ <lb/>
            ism P But apply this sceptical philosophy to the affairs <lb/>
            of common life, and see how completely it fails there­ <lb/>
            how entirely discordant it is with everything that it <lb/>
            finds there. When life and death are concerned, and <lb/>

            refutation of <lb/>
            the sceptics, <lb/>
            chapter vi. <lb/>
            when the doctor prescribes a particular sort of fcod, we take that <lb/>
            food according to his prescription, and we do not raise any subtle <lb/>
            questions as to whether it is the food that it seems to be, or whether <lb/>
            this is impossible, consequent upon the flux and motion of things. <lb/>
            And if things are in this continual state of change as regards the <lb/>
            sensations that make themselves apparent to us, why do the same <lb/>
            sensations always appear the same under the same circumstances ? <lb/>
            why do not they appear to us the same as they do to the sick P Why, <lb/>
            because we are not sick. Do we continue, then, during such times, in <lb/>
            a state in which our organs of sense are unimpaired by disease ? The <lb/>
            sceptic must say, Yes; but this is giving up the whole point, for it <lb/>
            is an admission that we continue the same for a certain period of <lb/>
            time, or, in other words, that things are not in that state of flux <lb/>
            which he contends they are.</p>
          <p>This constitutes the Aristotelian mode of attacking <lb/>
            the Philosophy of, the Sceptics, and he considers that <lb/>
            their whole system is shivered into fragments by this <lb/>
            method of refutation, which is the more ingenious, as it <lb/>
            is based on the principles of the sceptics themselves. <lb/>
            14. Character <lb/>
            of Aristotle's <lb/>
            overthrow cf <lb/>
            the sceptical <lb/>
            philosophy. <lb/>
            The overthrow, not so much of the speculative difficulties as of the <lb/>
            practical absurdities involved in the system of the sceptic, to which <pb n="LXVI"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK X. </note> <lb/>
            Aristotle has given such prominence, is called the argument from <lb/>
            Common Sense, and is the one, as is well known, which became <lb/>
            such a favourite with the school of the Scotch metaphysicians1 in <lb/>
            modem times. All the sceptics, however, we must bear in mind, <lb/>
            are not to be refuted by one and the same argument, and what will <lb/>
            prevail with one class will fail with another. For, according to <lb/>
            Aristotle, amongst the sceptics themselves we discover the existence <lb/>
            of different classes, and some are much easier refuted than others, <lb/>
            for some adopt their system from what they fancy rational grounds, <lb/>
            and therefore such may be foiled with the arms of reason; but others <lb/>
            are for ignoring the authority of reason altogether. The sceptics <lb/>
            belonging to this latter, which may be considered as the most ex­ <lb/>
            treme school of scepticism, will not allow that there is any reason in <lb/>
            things, or any truth at all: but how absurd, for if so, what reason <lb/>
            have they for their theory ? and if all things are false, how can they <lb/>
            demand of men to recognise the existence of truth in their own <lb/>
            philosophy P <lb/>
            15. Chap. vii. <lb/>
            argues in <lb/>
            favour of the <lb/>
            unity of <lb/>
            Metaphysics.</p>
          <p>In chapter vii. Aristotle again reverts to the topic <lb/>
            of the unity of metaphysical science, notwithstanding <lb/>
            the diversity and manifold nature of its subject-matter. <lb/>
            And precisely the same line of argument is adopted as <lb/>
            on a former occasion, when precisely the same topic comes under <lb/>
            our notice. The other sciences have their own appropriate subject- <lb/>
            matter, and why should not the science of the metaphysician have <lb/>
            the same ? Now persons need not think that metaphysical science <lb/>
            is unnecessary, nor that it speculates merely about what is examined <lb/>
            into by the other sciences, for it is this very circumstance that in <lb/>
            right earnest establishes the reality of the science of the ontologist; <lb/>
            for all the other sciences merely take up a fragment of entity and <lb/>
            examine it, whereas, the science of Metaphysics speculates into <lb/>
            entity, as such, so far forth as it is entity, that is, simply and univer­ <lb/>
            sally considered.</p>
          <p>16. Aristotle's <lb/>
            favourite argu­ <lb/>
            ment for the <lb/>
            existence of <lb/>
            such a science <lb/>
            as Meta­ <lb/>
            physics.</p>
          <p>And here we again meet with Aristotle s favourite <lb/>
            argument for the existence of such a science as Meta­ <lb/>
            physics, drawn from the existence of what is eternal <lb/>
            and separable, and immovable. All other sciences have <lb/>
            their respective subject-matter. Here is a something <lb/>
            that can be proved from an induction of all the sciences, <lb/>
            not to be taken notice of by any; therefore we must have a distinct <lb/>
            science to take notice of this, and this distinct science is that of the <lb/>
            17. This like­ <lb/>
            wise shows its <lb/>
            dignity. <lb/>
            metaphysician. And this very subject it is which test.. <lb/>
            fies to the fact of the dignity of Metaphysics as a <lb/>
            science,2 for this separable and supra-sensual substance, <lb/>
            what is it, as Aristotle will show in book XI., but the Divinity <note type="footnote">(1) It is hardly a correct use of the term Metaphysics, to predicate it cf the system <lb/>
            of the Scotch philosophers. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Vide book V. chaps, i. and ii. </note> <pb n="LXVII"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK X. ] </note> <lb/>
            under another name; therefore that science ought to command our <lb/>
            homage and reverence, the province of which is to take notice of <lb/>
            the nature of God. Here is another place in the Metaphysics where <lb/>
            Aristotle had another opportunity ot enlarging upon the subject of <lb/>
            Theology, and showing its proper place in, as well as connexion with, <lb/>
            the science of Metaphysics. But here, as elsewhere, he neglects to <lb/>
            follow up the subject, an omission that is taken notice of in the analysis <lb/>
            of that part of book XI. where Aristotle unfolds his notions of God's <lb/>
            Being and Attributes. The same point is likewise noticed in the <lb/>
            analysis of book V.</p>
          <p>In chapter viii., we again are brought into contact <lb/>
            with a subject already examined into, namely, as to <lb/>
            there being a science of the accident; and the same <lb/>
            statement is made here as elsewhere, of there being no <lb/>
            18. Chap. viii. <lb/>
            on the science <lb/>
            of the <lb/>
            accident. <lb/>
            such science, and the grounds put forward in both places for this are <lb/>
            the same. There is the same practical argument drawn from ex­ <lb/>
            perience, to show that there is no science of the accident; and the <lb/>
            same is shown from the nature of the accident itself, as well as the <lb/>
            cause of its subsistence. Now the nature of the accident, we know, <lb/>
            is what subsists neither always nor as for the most part, but science <lb/>
            is conversant about that which subsists always and for the most part. <lb/>
            And further, we must bear in mind that the cause of what is acci­ <lb/>
            dental, is not the same with the cause of what is absolute, otherwise <lb/>
            we must adopt a system of universal necessity. Wherefore, on these <lb/>
            grounds, in this metaphysical treatise, where entity, as such, is under <lb/>
            consideration, this is one of the aspects of it which, with certain <lb/>
            others of the same kind, are entirely left out of view by the Stagyrite.</p>
          <p>And it is worth while, Aristotle thinks, to notice the <lb/>
            connexion between accident and causality noticed in <lb/>
            what we call chance. But chance does not invalidate <lb/>
            19. The nature <lb/>
            of chance, end <lb/>
            of chap. viii. <lb/>
            the existence of things that are produced according to free-will as <lb/>
            some final cause. To say, however, that all causes operated merely <lb/>
            according to accident, would be to make them indefinite, which <lb/>
            would contradict the fourfold division of them, recognised by all <lb/>
            classes of philosophers, and, besides, it would involve the additional <lb/>
            absurdity of making the accidental prior to the essential. But, even <lb/>
            assume the phenomena before our eyes as the results of chance, yet <lb/>
            this will not in reality annihilate the existence of Mind, or even of a <lb/>
            settled constitution and course of Nature.</p>
          <p>Thus we see that book X. merely comprises what <lb/>
            already has been brought before us at large in books <lb/>
            II. and III.; there are, however, two subjects treated <lb/>
            20. Two specu­ <lb/>
            lations peculiar <lb/>
            to book X. <lb/>
            of in this book, which are peculiarly its own, namely, the nature of <lb/>
            motion, chiefly in its relation to energy and potentiality, and, also, <lb/>
            that of the Infinite, or TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂπειρον</foreign>.</p>
          <p>Now as to motion, we may assume that there are as <lb/>
            many species of motion as of entity, because motion is <lb/>
            21. The subject <lb/>
            of motion <pb n="LXVIII"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK X. </note> <lb/>
            treated of in <lb/>
            chap. ix. <lb/>
            not a thing that is independent of ent ties themselves. <lb/>
            The chief subdivision of entity, however, where motion <lb/>
            is plainly discoverable, is that one which subsists according to capa­ <lb/>
            city and actuality. But now take the case of a brazen statue, and <lb/>
            yourself, yourself, where has the motion come from that has moulded the <lb/>
            brass into the form of the statue, and in what does it reside ? Does <lb/>
            the capacity of the brass constitute this motion, or the energy pre­ <lb/>
            supposed in the productive powers of the art of the statuary ? The <lb/>
            reply to this seems to be as follows: That the motion does not <lb/>
            reside in the capacity, nor in the energy, and yet that it is that which <lb/>
            secures the transition of what subsists in capacity into a condition <lb/>
            of actuality; in short, " motion," as Aristotle defines it, " is the <lb/>
            entelecheia 1 of that which is endued with capacity, so far forth as it is <lb/>
            such." The whole of this chapter is occupied with an elucidation of <lb/>
            this principle from practical instances; for example, house-building. <lb/>
            He vindicates the view which he has thus taken of motion, reassert­ <lb/>
            ing that it constitutes an energy and yet an imperfect one; that we <lb/>
            must account for its indefiniteness from the fact of its being doubtful <lb/>
            as to whether it ought to be classed under capacity or energy; and <lb/>
            that all this enhances the difficulty of the matter in hand, though at <lb/>
            the same time Aristotle finds no reason to be dissatisfied with the <lb/>
            views he has just now put forward.</p>
          <p>22. Chap. x. on <lb/>
            “the Infinite."</p>
          <p>In the tenth chapter, Aristotle comes to treat of that <lb/>
            which had already before his time given rise to so much <lb/>
            speculation, namely, the Infinite—the TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂπειρον</foreign>. In the first place, <lb/>
            we are furnished with a sort of negative description of it; for as to a <lb/>
            positive definition of the Infinite, that would be out of the question.' <lb/>
            If, however, it is what is possessed of a separable subsistence, it is <lb/>
            not what is cognisant to our senses; and this we might expect, for <lb/>
            on the supposition of its constituting neither magnitude nor plurality, <lb/>
            and that the substance of it is the infinite and not what is accidental, <lb/>
            in such a case it will be indivisible; for if we allow it to be divisible, <lb/>
            it will, as a consequence, involve either magnitude or plurality. <lb/>
            23. Nature of <lb/>
            the Infinite. <lb/>
            But, besides the indivisibility of the Infinite, we may <lb/>
            also regard it as devoid of parts, for this would presup­ <lb/>
            pose its analysation into similar parts. As, for example, <lb/>
            a part of the air is air; but this, in the case of the Infinite, would be <lb/>
            absurd, for the notion we have of it is of what is essentially uncom­ <lb/>
            pounded. But that the Infinite should subsist in energy, for this <lb/>
            reason is impossible, for what part will we particularize as the sub­ <lb/>
            ject of this energy? for take whatever portion of the Infinite you wish, <lb/>
            and it will-it must-be infinite likewise. And, further, it is im­ <lb/>
            possible for it to subsist in a condition of actuality or entelecheia, for <note type="footnote">(1) ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εντελέχεια</foreign> is best translated by the word "actuality." </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Vide Cousin in his Psychology, on Locke s theory of the Infinite; Sir William <lb/>

             <note type="margin">BOOR X.] </note> <lb/>
            then it mast needs constitute some quantity or other; and this would <lb/>
            presuppose its subsistence in accordance with what is accidental.</p>
          <p>The next thing which Aristotle undertakes to prove <lb/>
            in regard of the Infinite is, that it does not reside in <lb/>
            objects that fall under the notice of our senses. And <lb/>
            this he proves in two ways: first, from the formal <lb/>
            24. The In­ <lb/>
            finite not to be <lb/>
            found in <lb/>
            sensible. <lb/>
            principle of body as what is denned by surfaces; and, secondly, from <lb/>
            physical considerations, namely, from the impossibility of its being a <lb/>
            composite nature, or even a simple one. We cannot suppose the <lb/>
            Infinite to constitute a composite nature; for how, as is essential <lb/>
            to our notion of what is compound, would the elements of the <lb/>
            Infinite, supposing it of this description, be limited in their number­ <lb/>
            how would we equalise them ? And, further, we are to bear in mind, <lb/>
            that body is that which involves an interval in every direction, but <lb/>
            that which is infinite must involve such an interval without any <lb/>
            limitation at all as to direction; so that if body be infinite, it is <lb/>
            infinite in every direction. And as to the unity of the Infinite, it is <lb/>
            just as fanciful as the unity which Natural Philosophies lay down as <lb/>
            existing beside the elements.</p>
          <p>But further, every body cognisant to our senses is in <lb/>
            place somewhere, and there is the same place for the <lb/>
            whole as for the part; take the case of the earth, for <lb/>
            example. Now apply this to the Infinite; if it is <lb/>
            uniform, it will be then immovable, or it will be always <lb/>
            25. Further <lb/>
            proof of this <lb/>
            from the rela­ <lb/>
            tions of body <lb/>
            and space. <lb/>
            in motion; out this IS impossible, for why should it have a motion in <lb/>
            any one direction more than another P upwards, more than downwards P <lb/>
            Suppose, however, the Infinite were like a clod on the earth's surface, <lb/>
            where will it be moved to, or where will it remain at rest ? for this <lb/>
            is merely a part of the whole, and the place of this clod which is con­ <lb/>
            genial with the substance of the whole earth will have a place of the <lb/>
            same sort with the whole, and therefore the place of part of the Infi­ <lb/>
            nite will be infinite as well as that of the Infinite itself; but this is <lb/>
            absurd. But even supposing the Infinite to be in place, that it <lb/>
            will comprise the entire of the place where it is—yet how will this <lb/>
            be the case ?—what will be its place of rest or of motion, or will it <lb/>
            be moved anywhere P If so, it will never come to a stand-still; or <lb/>
            suppose it to be at rest everywhere, in that case it will not be moved.</p>
          <p>If, on the other hand, we suppose that the Infinite is <lb/>
            not uniform, but dissimilar in its component parts, then <lb/>
            also will the places which they severally occupy be dis­ <lb/>
            similar likewise. And the consequence will be that <lb/>
            26. The In­ <lb/>
            finite uniform <lb/>
            or dissimilar <lb/>
            in its parts. <lb/>
            there will not be one body of the entire save in regard of contact. <lb/>
            Then these parts will be infinite or finite in species; it is not possible <lb/>
            for them to be all finite, for some of them will be infinite, and some <lb/>
            not so, or the entire must be infinite. And this will lead to an <lb/>
            infinity of the elements; but supposing this to be impossible, the <lb/>
            Universe must needs then be finite. <pb n="LXX"/>

          <p><note type="margin">[BOOK X. </note> 27. Body can­ <lb/>
            not be infinite.</p>
          <p>And again, it is, in short, impossible for body to be <lb/>
            infinite, as well as the place for body, if every body that <lb/>
            is cognisant to our senses involves gravity or lightness, <lb/>
            for it will be impelled either towards the centre or upwards; but it is <lb/>
            utterly impossible that any part of the Infinite, whether the half or <lb/>
            the whole, should undergo any passive condition whatsoever. For <lb/>
            how, pray, will you accomplish a division of the Infinite, or how will <lb/>
            there be of the Infinite an upper or lower region, or what is extreme <lb/>
            and central ? And, besides, what is cognisant to our senses, as just <lb/>
            now stated, resides in place; and there are six species of place, not <lb/>
            one of which could have any possible relation with what is infinite. <lb/>
            And all the foregoing may be confirmed from the fact that the Infinite <lb/>
            is not the same in magnitude, and m motion, and in duration, as if it <lb/>
            were one definite nature. This, I hope, makes somewhat intelligible <lb/>
            Aristotle's vagueness and studied obscurity on this remarkable <lb/>
            subject of the Infinite.</p>

            and 12th <lb/>
            chapters occu­ <lb/>
            pied with the <lb/>
            relation of <lb/>
            motion to <lb/>
            change.</p>
          <p>In the two remaining chapters of the tenth book <lb/>
            there is not to be found anything that can be considered <lb/>
            important, when compared with what has gone before, <lb/>
            and is about to follow in book XI. They are both <lb/>
            occupied with the subject of motion in relation to <lb/>
            change. There are three changes, either from a subject <lb/>
            into a subject, or from a non-subject into a subject, or from a subject <lb/>
            into a non-subject: the first is neither generation nor corruption, <lb/>
            the second amounts to generation, and the third to corruption. Now, <lb/>
            although every motion constitutes a certain change, yet not every <lb/>
            change constitutes motion, for generation and corruption are not <lb/>
            motions; it is only in regard of the change from a subject into a <lb/>
            subject that we can assume change as equivalent with motion. Now <lb/>
            these principles are clearing the way for what follows in book XI., <lb/>
            where he traces up all energy and activity primarily to the First <lb/>
            Substance.</p>

            According to <lb/>
            which of the <lb/>
            Categories <lb/>
            does motion <lb/>
            subsist ?</p>
          <p>The object which Aristotle has in view in chapter xii., <lb/>
            the last of book X., is to prove, in the case of which <lb/>
            of the ten categories motion can be said to have an <lb/>
            existence, and in the case of which of them it cannot. <lb/>
            And the conclusion that he comes to is this, that since, <lb/>
            for reasons which he states, there cannot be said to <lb/>
            exist motion belonging to substance or relation, or action and passion, <lb/>
            it remains that such should be found only in quality, quantity, and <lb/>
            the place where. The chapter concludes with some definitions sug. <lb/>
            rested by the point under discussion, namely, definitions of contact, <lb/>
            consecutiveness, and local contrariety.</p><pb n="LXXI"/>

          <p>WE now come to book XI., which is the more impor­ <lb/>
            tant, as it contains discussions bordering more on <lb/>
            Theology than any that have as yet been brought before <lb/>
            us. These occur chiefly towards the end, but all that <lb/>
            1. Why book <lb/>
            XI. more im­ <lb/>
            portant than <lb/>
            the others. <lb/>
            goes before it in the opening chapters, as we shall presently see, art <lb/>
            designed by Aristotle to prepare the way for the conclusions which <lb/>
            he seeks to establish there.</p>
          <p>This book opens with an assertion already made by <lb/>
            Aristotle as to substance, or the <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐϭία</foreign>, being a proper <lb/>
            object of speculation; for the truth of which he appeals <lb/>
            to the systems of the ancient schools of philosophy. <lb/>
            Qualities and passive states no doubt come in for a <lb/>
            share of inquiry; but still it is so in subservience to an <lb/>
            2. <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐϭία</foreign>, or <lb/>
            substance, the <lb/>
            proper subject <lb/>
            of speculation; <lb/>
            chap. i. <lb/>
            book XI. <lb/>
            investigation into substance, which they presuppose. But what <lb/>
            science is there that takes cognisance of substance in the way in <lb/>
            which Metaphysics does ? What science is there that investigates the <lb/>
            causes and first principles of substance, except that of the metaphysi­ <lb/>
            cian P And the generally received division of substances <lb/>
            into eternal, immovable, and those that fall under the <lb/>
            notice of our senses, this very division bears its witness <lb/>
            to the necessity of the existence of such a science as <lb/>
            that of Metaphysics; for though the physical sciences <lb/>
            3. Division of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐϭία</foreign>, proves <lb/>
            the necessity <lb/>
            of the science <lb/>
            of metaphysics. <lb/>
            have taken abundant notice of sensible substances, yet where have <lb/>
            we any system of philosophy conversant with what is immovable as <lb/>
            such, and with what is eternal as such ? There is a verging towards <lb/>
            such a science in the systems of mathematicians, as well as in the <lb/>
            Ideal Hypothesis of Plato; but the degree of development attained in <lb/>
            either of these cases falls far short of what is accomplished by the <lb/>
            metaphysician in transcendental science.</p>
          <p>Now, substance falling under the notice of our senses, <lb/>
            which is one of the three subdivisions of substance, is <lb/>
            that which admits of undergoing change. And change <lb/>
            4. Change and <lb/>
            causality; <lb/>
            chap. ii. <lb/>
            presupposes a something that is the subject of the change, and in <lb/>
            the present case, that is, the matter <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὓλη</foreign>. And this will appear at <lb/>
            once when we enumerate the various sorts of change; for we are to <lb/>
            bear in mind that there are in existence four modes of changes, <lb/>
            either according to substance or quiddity; or, secondly, according to <lb/>
            quantity; or, thirdly, according to quality; or, lastly, according to <lb/>
            the place where. Now simple generation and corruption belong <lb/>
            to the first, and increase and diminution to the third, and alteration <lb/>
            to the second, and such a thing as orbital motion to the fourth. Now <lb/>
            all things whatsoever that involve matter are susceptible of change; <pb n="LXXII"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK XL </note> <lb/>
            for matter itself is one of a threefold division of causes into contrariety, <lb/>
            privation, and matter.</p>

            tion of matter <lb/>
            and form; <lb/>
            chap. ii.</p>
          <p>We are not, however, to suppose that there is a <lb/>
            generation of matter and form that is of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ ἔϭχατα</foreign>, <lb/>
            or the ultimates, so to speak, of objects that fall undei <lb/>
            the notice of our senses. Matter, no doubt, admits of <lb/>
            change, and this presupposes a something as the cause of that <lb/>
            change, as well as something into which a transition is effected; but <lb/>
            this proves no generation of matter or form. Matter manifests itself <lb/>
            to our senses under a particular form; but this is brought about by <lb/>
            Art, or Nature, or Chance, or Spontaneity. And these merely work <lb/>
            on what they already find in existence, namely, matter, or the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὓλη</foreign>. <lb/>
            6. An apparent <lb/>
            exception to <lb/>
            this. <lb/>
            Perhaps, indeed, there may be a sense in which form <lb/>
            subsists separately from the matter which it moulds. <lb/>
            As in the case of a house, the form of which we in a <lb/>
            certain sense might say did subsist in the mind of the builder pre. <lb/>
            viously to the bricks and timbers assuming the shape of a house. <lb/>
            But Aristotle, as he shows at the end of this chapter, will not allow <lb/>
            that this is any admission of the reality of the Ideal system of Plato. <lb/>
            7. Twofold <lb/>
            difference in <lb/>
            causes. <lb/>
            There is a remark in this chapter worthy of note, in <lb/>
            which Aristotle expresses a twofold difference in causes <lb/>
            in respect of some being antecedent and some being <lb/>
            coincident with their effects. This distinction we know has been <lb/>
            brought forward in the modem controversies about the Theory of <lb/>
            Causation, as may be seen by a reference to the Dissertations of the <lb/>
            late Sir William Hamilton on that particular subject.</p>
          <p>8. How the <lb/>
            foregoing re­ <lb/>
            lates to what is <lb/>
            to follow.</p>
          <p>Now, what Aristotle has established thus far in these <lb/>
            three chapters of book XI. appears to be this, that <lb/>
            there is a something that exists as the subject of the <lb/>
            various changes that we observe; and at the same time, <lb/>
            that these very changes themselves presuppose some productive and <lb/>
            constructive power, which by its efficiency gives rise to them. This <lb/>
            plainly is laid down with the ulterior purpose of demonstrating the <lb/>
            necessity of the existence of a First Cause.</p>
          <p>9. Are the <lb/>
            principles of <lb/>
            things the <lb/>
            same or <lb/>
            different? <lb/>
            ehap. iv.</p>
          <p>Before proceeding, however, more immediately to <lb/>
            examine into this subject—I mean, the necessity of the <lb/>
            existence of a First Cause, some one original and <lb/>
            primary principle, whereon all things depend, and from <lb/>
            whence they flow—the question meets us at the <lb/>
            threshold, Are the principles of things the same, or <lb/>
            different P Are the elements of substances and relatives the same P <lb/>
            This question we know has already been discussed in book II. <lb/>
            Strictly speaking, they are not the same; but in one sense, perhaps, <lb/>
            they may, and that is <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναλογίαν</foreign>—analogically. But again, what <lb/>
            relation is there between elements and first principles P Are they the <lb/>
            same, or different ? Now we know that one chief merit of the Greek <lb/>
            philosophy, as developed by Plato and Aristotle, vas bringing forth <pb n="LXXIII"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK XI.] </note> <lb/>
            into a clear light this very relation between an element and first <lb/>
            principle, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭτοιχει̑ον</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">αρχή</foreign>. An element and a first <lb/>
            . principle in one respect are the same, and in another <lb/>
            they are different; they are the same in material things; <lb/>
            but- when one passes on to things that fall under the <lb/>
            10. Elements <lb/>
            threefold, <lb/>
            causes four­ <lb/>
            fold. <lb/>
            notice of the mind, they then are different, though even here they <lb/>
            agree in being both causes. What gives rise to the difference in the <lb/>
            latter case is that there intrudes a something that is not found in things <lb/>
            purely material, namely,-a motive principle. And thus will we be led <lb/>
            gradually up to the First Cause; and, moreover, will this give rise to a <lb/>
            fourfold division of causes, whereas that of elements is merely threefold.</p>
          <p>There is, however, another distinction in entities, and <lb/>
            it is this: that some of them do, whereas others of <lb/>
            them do not, involve a separable subsistence; and it is to <lb/>
            the former that we must ascribe the nature of substance, <lb/>
            and which, for this reason, we must regard as causes; <lb/>
            11. Some enti­ <lb/>
            ties separable, <lb/>
            and some in­ <lb/>
            separable ; <lb/>
            chap. v. <lb/>
            because, how can we conceive such a thing, e.g. as motion, or <lb/>
            passion, without presupposing substance as a condition of both ? <lb/>
            Now, as to universal causes, these, practically speaking, <lb/>
            have no existence-each thing has its own particular <lb/>
            cause-there is no universal man to be found in rerum <lb/>
            12. No uni­ <lb/>
            versal causes. <lb/>
            natura. Peleus, a particular individual, is the father of another <lb/>
            particular individual, Achilles. The true principle of causality is to <lb/>
            be looked for, not in mere mental abstractions, but in substances as <lb/>
            such-they are the causes of all things, and are the causes as ener­ <lb/>
            gies ; a principle which will be applied by Aristotle in his attempt <lb/>
            to explain the Being and Attributes of God. And on <lb/>
            examination it will be found that these may be arranged <lb/>
            under the same four heads of causes which Aristotle <lb/>
            13. Fourfold <lb/>
            division of <lb/>
            causes. <lb/>
            has already laid down as the divisions whereon all inquiry on ætiolo­ <lb/>
            gical subjects must be based. This fourfold enumeration of causes <lb/>
            is no obstacle to the truth of the threefold division of elements or <lb/>
            first principles, as already mentioned. The three principles, however, <lb/>
            may sometimes be further reduced; for in some cases the principles of <lb/>
            all things may be the same, that is, analogically, for the matter and <lb/>
            form, and privation, are often merged into unity, by being all alike <lb/>
            ar. index of efficiency or a moving principle somewhere.</p>
          <p>But now, having thus been engaged in the examina­ <lb/>
            tion of two sorts of substances out of the three; namely, <lb/>
            two substances of a physical nature, as they have been <lb/>
            described already; the third also now remains for consi- <lb/>
            14. Consider­ <lb/>
            ation of the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐϭία ἂκίνητος</foreign> ' <lb/>
            chap. vi. <lb/>
            deration, viz. the immovable one- the <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὺϭία ἀκίνητος</foreign>, which Aristotle <lb/>
            accordingly proceeds to examine in this and the following chapter.</p>
          <p>In the first place, then, it is requisite that this Im­ <lb/>
            movable Substance should constitute one that is Eternal, <lb/>
            as well from the nature of motion1 itself, as of sub­ <lb/>
            is. The eter­ <lb/>
            nity of this <lb/>
            substance. <note type="footnote"> (1) Vide a previous note in the Analysis, at p. xxxvi. </note> <note type="footnote"> f </note> <pb n="LXXIV"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK XL </note> <lb/>
            stance; that is, primary substance. For primary substances, if not <lb/>
            admitted as lying beyond the possibilities of being corrupted, will be <lb/>
            sufficient to ensure the corruptibility of all things else beside. And <lb/>
            as to motion, we know that it cannot admit of being generated or <lb/>
            corrupted, for it is what always existed ; and it is so with duration <lb/>
            likewise. And as the continuity of motion, that is, circular motion, <lb/>
            is what we must acknowledge, so must we admit the continuity of <lb/>
            time ; in fact, as Dr. Clarke in modern times argued, and as Aristotle <lb/>
            now implies, time and space 1 are in themselves infinite, and are to <lb/>
            be viewed as the attributes of an Infinite Being.</p>
          <p>16. The pri­ <lb/>
            mary substance <lb/>
            immaterial <lb/>
            likewise.</p>
          <p>Further, must these substances not merely be eternal <lb/>
            as being primary, but must be immaterial as being <lb/>
            eternal, and on their eternity and immateriality depend <lb/>
            the connexion of their essence in the energy. And in <lb/>
            general we may assume that the eternity or immateriality of these <lb/>
            primary substances would be of no practical importance to us, save <lb/>
            on the distinct understanding of their subsistence in a condition of <lb/>
            17. Defect in <lb/>
            the ancient <lb/>
            Theology. <lb/>
            pre-existent energy. This principle was quite over­ <lb/>
            looked by the old theogonists as well as the physicists <lb/>
            of antiquity, in their systems: for example, in gene­ <lb/>
            rating the Universe out of Night, as Theologians of those <lb/>
            ages did, or in the simultaneous subsistence of all things together, <lb/>
            which some of the natural philosophers maintained. This is a serious <lb/>
            error, and it may be remarked that the extravagances deducible from <lb/>
            these systems are a silent piece of homage to the truth of the philo­ <lb/>
            sophy which Aristotle at present is seeding to establish. Now all <lb/>
            these philosophers and theologians gave quite an inadequate view of <lb/>
            things-it was impossible for them to account for the phenomenon <lb/>
            of motion except they recognised the previous existence of energy. <lb/>
            18. The origin <lb/>
            of the theory of <lb/>
            the perpetuity <lb/>
            of motion. <lb/>
            Matter can never be the instrument in producing its <lb/>
            own motion, and it was this difficulty which led to the <lb/>
            origin of the theory of the perpetuity of energy, such as <lb/>
            was advocated by Plato and Leucippus, for these philo­ <lb/>
            sophers advocated the eternity of motion; but independent of the <lb/>
            utter incompleteness of such an account of things, precisely the same <lb/>
            objection lies against their theory as that of the theogonists just <lb/>
            alluded to; namely, that we cannot consistently perceive in what it <lb/>
            advances as the original of things, any efficiency or anything that <lb/>
            will produce motion in the first instance. So that, after all, the <lb/>
            reality of a pre-existent energy is recognised in these systems, as is <lb/>
            also made to appear by a reference to the philosophy of Anaxagoras, <lb/>
            who identifies mind and energy together, as well as to that of <lb/>
            Empedocles in his assertion of such principles as harmony and <lb/>
            discord.</p>
          <p>19. How this <lb/>
            bears on the</p>
          <p>Advancing forwards, then, on these principles, what <lb/>
            remains to be proved in regard of these primary sub* <note type="footnote">(1) Vids Stewart's Outlines of Moral Philosophy, Part II. chap. ii. article I.</note> <pb n="LXXV"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK XI.] </note> <lb/>
            stances as a oasis whereon to build the truth of God's <lb/>
            existence, what remains, then, is pretty obvious. These <lb/>
            primary substances, we have seen, involve an eternal <lb/>
            question of <lb/>
            God'a exist­ <lb/>
            ence. <lb/>
            motion—a mction that is circular, and between that which receives <lb/>
            this motion and that which imparts it we must recognise the inter­ <lb/>
            mediate existence of that which, though the source of motion, is <lb/>
            itself immovable ; and this constitutes what already has been implied <lb/>
            in the mention of the primary substances, and that is, the eternity of <lb/>
            one substance whose energy constitutes its essence. And as to the <lb/>
            energy of this first substance, that can hardly be called in question, <lb/>
            for we must bear in mind that a perpetuity of motion presupposes <lb/>
            an eternal cause of that motion.</p>
          <p>Having thus established the existence of this First <lb/>
            Substance, the source of all the motion in the Universe, <lb/>
            though at the same time itself being immovable, Aris­ <lb/>
            totle next examines into the sort of action to be found <lb/>
            20. What sort <lb/>
            of actions are <lb/>
            we to ascribe <lb/>
            to God? <lb/>
            in this Substance-that is, of course, so far as this subject is disco­ <lb/>
            verable to the weakness of our faculties; for, after all, we can only <lb/>
            look at the Divine Nature through the distorted medium of our own <lb/>
            subjectivity.1 And this is strongly illustrated in the views which <lb/>
            Aristotle puts forward about the mode of operation pursued by the <lb/>
            Deity.</p>
          <p>As to the mode of God's operation, Aristotle iden­ <lb/>
            tines it with that of the intellect or appetite in man; <lb/>
            God, the first importer of motion, moves that which <lb/>
            21. The mode <lb/>
            of God's <lb/>
            operation. <lb/>
            receives the motion as a thing that may be compared to an object of <lb/>
            human volition, or of the human understanding. A thing appears <lb/>
            fair; it excites a corresponding desire within us, and we strive to <lb/>
            attain it just because it is what appears fair. A truth is placed before <lb/>
            the understanding; it evokes or calls forth a corresponding intel­ <lb/>
            lectual effort to grasp this truth, and the mind rests satisfied with <lb/>
            the accomplishing of this end as the successful pursuit of its object. <lb/>
            And to apply this to the matter in hand, Aristotle would thus seem <lb/>
            to characterise the Divine energy as a manifestation of volition and <lb/>
            of mental activity on the highest and most stupendous scale that we <lb/>
            can form any conception of. And, certainly, there is <lb/>
            one element which can be disengaged from this analysis <lb/>
            of God's Nature, which emphatically is one which must <lb/>
            command the approbation of even Christian philoso­ <lb/>
            hers and therefore is the more remarkable as one to <lb/>
            22. The merit <lb/>
            of Aristotle's <lb/>
            analysis of <lb/>
            the Divine <lb/>
            Nature. <lb/>
            be found in the theories of a Pagan writer. This element alluded to <lb/>
            is the recognition by Aristotle of God as the independent source of <lb/>
            his own operations, within and by Himself-a truth faintly though <lb/>
            intelligibly mirrored to us in the freedom of the will, and the creative <note type="footnote">(1) This tendency is noticed by Cicero in the first book of the De Natura. The <lb/>
            student of Ecclesiastical History is fully aware ti its pernicious operation on </note> <lb/>
            Theology. <note type="footnote">f2 </note> <pb n="LXXVI"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK XI. </note> <lb/>
            energies of the human mind; and a truth, moreover, so glorious <lb/>
            that the Holy Scriptures of God teem with frequent avowals <lb/>
            of it!</p>
          <p>23. The final <lb/>
            cause of God'a <lb/>
            energy.</p>
          <p>And this of itself teaches us the final cause of the <lb/>
            Divine activity, and what it is that it proposes for itself <lb/>
            by this its display of energy. It is love that draws <lb/>
            forth the one, and a yearning after what is lovely that leads to a <lb/>
            display of the latter. In us frail mortals, though the will, when not <lb/>
            perverted, strains after what is good as an object of desire, yet it may <lb/>
            or may not attain such, however it may love it; and the same holds <lb/>
            good of the mind in its apperception of truth. In the case, how­ <lb/>
            ever, of God, the will and its object are not separate, and therefore, <lb/>
            when we say that God pursues the work of creation as an object that <lb/>
            is loved—<foreign xml:lang="grc">κινει̑ δὲ ὡς ἐρώμενον</foreign>—we mean, in other words, that the <lb/>
            essential quality of the Divine nature is love, or, as the Evangelist <lb/>
            St. John has it, that “ God is love."</p>
          <p>24. The justice <lb/>
            of the fore­ <lb/>
            going analysis <lb/>
            shown in what <lb/>
            follows.</p>
          <p>Now this might appear a somewhat fanciful inter­ <lb/>
            pretation of what we found in the text, but when what <lb/>
            follows is annexed, the analysis will not seem so unjusti­ <lb/>
            fiable on the ground of its exaggeration; for thereby will <lb/>
            we find Aristotle laying it down that God's existence is <lb/>
            what must be most excellent and happy, and therefore, as such, his <lb/>
            aim must be the promotion of general felicity in all parts of Creation, <lb/>
            and the actuating principle in his Divine perfections must be love, and <lb/>
            25. Vindicated <lb/>
            by a passage <lb/>
            from the <lb/>
            Metaphysics. <lb/>
            nothing else but love. Perhaps, however, it will be the <lb/>
            safest course to give the reader Aristotle's own words <lb/>
            literally translated. “ The mode of God's existence," <lb/>
            says Aristotle,1“ must be such a one as is most excellent, <lb/>
            and an analogy of which we have in our own short career. God <lb/>
            exists for ever in this condition of excellence, whereas, indeed, for us <lb/>
            this is impossible. His pleasure consists in the exercise of his essen­ <lb/>
            tial energy, and hence wakefulness and perception are what with <lb/>
            God are most agreeable. Now essential perception is the perception <lb/>
            of that which is most excellent, and the mind perceives itself by parti­ <lb/>
            cipation of its own object of perception; but indeed, it is a sort of <lb/>
            contact of both, that in the Divine Mind creates a regular identity <lb/>
            between these two,2 so that with God both are the same. And in <lb/>
            possession of this prerogative, He subsists in the exercise of energy; <lb/>
            and contemplation of his own perfections is what to God must be <lb/>
            most agreeable and best. And this condition of existence, after so <lb/>
            excellent a manner, is what is so astonishing to us when we examine <lb/>
            God's Nature; and the more we do so, the more wonderful that <lb/>
            Nature appears to us. And the mode of God's existence is essential <lb/>
            energy, and as such is a life that is most excellent and everlasting, so <note type="footnote">(1) In chap. vii. of book XI. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) This is not quite a literal translation of Aristotle's words in the passage that <lb/>

            that we must allow God Almighty to be possessed of such a life as <lb/>

          <p>Now, in these words, which are to be found towards <lb/>
            the close of book XI. chapter vii., may be said to be <lb/>

            question of his Theology is most important, and is briefly noticed <lb/>
            again in the remarks which follow after the actual analysis of the <lb/>
            Metaphysics has been brought to its close.</p>
          <p>And here Aristotle mentions an erroneous view preva­ <lb/>
            lent on this point amongst the Pythagoreans and Speu­ <lb/>
            sippus, which he but just notices, and the discussion of <lb/>
            27. Error in <lb/>
            Theology of the <lb/>
            Pythagoreans. <lb/>
            which, as we shall see, he resumes in the last Book of the Meta­ <lb/>
            physics. The Pythagoreans thought that what was excellent, and <lb/>
            what was most glorious, could not be discovered in the dawn of <lb/>
            Creation, but was a thing of subsequent growth in the way of natural <lb/>
            development; and in opposition to this false opinion, which has <lb/>
            reappeared on several occasions since the age of Pythagoras, and <lb/>
            especially in modern times,1 Aristotle contends for the existence <lb/>
            of perfection as what is original, and to be regarded as a paramount <lb/>
            principle in Creation.</p>
          <p>This remarkable chapter concludes with a further <lb/>
            delineation of the Divine Nature as that which is <lb/>
            devoid of parts, for magnitude cannot in any way in­ <lb/>
            volve this Divine Nature; for God imparts motion <lb/>
            28. Further <lb/>
            sketch of the <lb/>
            nature of <lb/>
            God. <lb/>
            throughout infinite duration, and nothing finite—as magnitude is­ <lb/>
            can be possessed of an infinite capacity. And, likewise, is God <lb/>
            devoid of passions, and unalterable—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπαθὴς καὶ ἀναλλοίωτον</foreign>— <lb/>
            for all such notions as are involved in passion or alteration are quite <lb/>
            outside the sphere, so to say, of the Divine existence. Now, this <lb/>
            representation added to that which recognises the necessary existence <lb/>
            of God, which is given in the early parts of the chapter, completes <lb/>
            the Aristotelian picture of the Divine Attributes. The <lb/>
            Stagyrite, therefore, beholds in God a Being whose <lb/>
            essence is love, manifested in eternal energy; and the <lb/>
            final cause of the exercise of his Divine perfections is <lb/>
            29. Summary <lb/>
            view of Aris­ <lb/>
            totle's notions <lb/>
            of God. <lb/>
            the happiness which He wishes to diffuse amongst all his creatures ; <lb/>
            and this happiness itself doth He participate in from all eternity. <lb/>
            Besides, His existence excludes everything like the notion of poten­ <lb/>
            tiality, which would presuppose the possibility of non-existence; and, <lb/>
            therefore, God's existence is a recessary existence. Further, also, He <lb/>
            is devoid of parts, and without passions or alterations, possessed of <note type="footnote">(1) This maybe seen In those treatises which place the modern discoveries in <lb/>

          <p>30. Chap. viii. <lb/>
            The unity or <lb/>
            plurality of <lb/>
            primary sub­ <lb/>
            stance proved <lb/>
            experiment­ <lb/>
            ally.</p>
          <p>And from this Aristotle passes on, in chapter viii, <lb/>
            to the subject, as to whether we are to recognise the <lb/>
            unity or plurality of such primary substances; and, in <lb/>
            determining for their plurality, he does not infringe <lb/>
            upon the doctrine already established in the last chapter <lb/>
            of the existence of one First Cause of all. For, although <lb/>
            in this chapter he puts forward these many primary substances, yet <lb/>
            they are endued with motion-albeit, eternal ;1 and this motion they <lb/>
            have received, in the first instance, from that which, though the <lb/>
            source of all motion in the Universe, is itself, notwithstanding, un­ <lb/>
            moved ; but this, with Aristotle, is God Himself. And here, too, we <lb/>
            see another example of Aristotle's eclectic spirit in his reference to <lb/>
            the works of others, and his custom of extracting therefrom what. <lb/>
            ever may be real and serviceable to truth. As to the Ideal hypothesis, <lb/>
            however, or the Pythagorean system of numbers, he leaves them out <lb/>
            of the way; for, after all, they have no bearing on the present <lb/>
            subject; but rather, in the theories of astronomers, does Aristotle <lb/>
            expect to discover the object of his pursuit.</p>
          <p>31. Reference <lb/>
            to the writings <lb/>
            of others on <lb/>
            this subject.</p>
          <p>He, accordingly, searches into the works of astro­ <lb/>
            nomers ; such as Eudoxus and Calippus, in order to <lb/>
            ascertain the generally received notions of scientific <lb/>
            men, as to the number of the orbital motions of the <lb/>
            heavenly bodies; and for this reason, because corresponding to these <lb/>
            several motions, there are so many substances belonging to the stars <lb/>
            -first, second, and so on, according to the arrangement adopted by <lb/>
            astronomers. For Aristotle's idea was, that the nature of the stars <lb/>
            constituted a certain eternal substance; and, though he thus re­ <lb/>
            cognises a number of eternal substances, yet he places one above <lb/>
            them all, from whence, as from a fountain, the others derive their <lb/>
            motion.</p>
          <p>32. Value of <lb/>
            this reference.</p>
          <p>This sketch, which is given us in this eighth <lb/>
            chapter, of the systems of Eudoxus and Calippus is <lb/>
            interesting, so far as it illustrates the condition of <lb/>
            astronomical science about the time of Anstotle ; and what we have <lb/>
            here is likely to be an extract from the Stagyrite's own work on <lb/>
            astronomy, in which he undertakes to amplify and improve the <lb/>
            labours of Eudoxus; and the loss of which must be regarded with <lb/>
            serious regret by all those interested in the learning of the ancients. <lb/>
            Having ascertained the number of the motions of the heavenly bodies, <lb/>
            and, therefore, of the bodies themselves, to amount to fifty and five, <lb/>
            or, exclusive of those of the sun and moon, forty-seven, he somewhat <lb/>
            too dogmatically pronounces about the completeness of this enume­ <lb/>
            ration, and concludes with an assertion of what he had already <lb/>
            proved in the De Coelo; namely, the existence of one heaven- <note type="footnote">(1) Revelation bas taught us of the eternal generation of the S in from the Father.</note> <pb n="LXXIX"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK XI.] </note> <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὶς οὐρανός</foreign>. The connexion between this assertion and Aristotle's <lb/>
            theological system will be briefly considered in the remarks to be <lb/>
            found at the end of this Analysis; to which, therefore, the reader is <lb/>
            referred.</p>
          <p>In thus investing the heaven and the stars with the <lb/>
            attribute of Divinity, Aristotle conceives himself called <lb/>
            upon to furnish some confirmation of his opinions on <lb/>
            this point; and he appeals to the authority of antiquity, <lb/>
            33. Confirms <lb/>
            his assertions <lb/>
            from ancient <lb/>
            tradition. <lb/>
            and to tradition, to bear him out in supporting his theory. Perhaps, <lb/>
            after all, this was merely a piece of flattery to the popular supersti­ <lb/>
            tion; for Aristotle, more than any other of the Greek philosophers, <lb/>
            viewed with contempt those long-cherished mythological notions <lb/>
            which had been bequeathed to his countrymen, from an age too dark <lb/>
            and remote for the lamp of history to shoot its ravs into. The <lb/>
            passage, however, is a most remarkable one, in which <lb/>
            the Stagyrite seeks to disencumber his opinions of any <lb/>
            novelty that they might at first sight appear to assume; <lb/>
            and runs somewhat as follows:—“ It has been tradi­ <lb/>
            tionally reported, as from the very earliest ages, and <lb/>
            has been left to posterity in the form of a myth, both <lb/>
            34. Repels the <lb/>
            charge of inno­ <lb/>
            vation, and the <lb/>
            passage quoted <lb/>
            in which this is <lb/>
            done. <lb/>
            that these celestial substances are gods, and that Divinity embraces <lb/>
            the entire system of Nature. There have been made, however, to <lb/>
            these, certain fabulous additions, for the purpose of winning the <lb/>
            belief of the multitude, and thus securing their obedience to the laws, <lb/>
            and their co-operation towards advancing the general welfare of the <lb/>
            state. These additions have been to the effect that these gods were <lb/>
            of the same form as men, and even that some of them were in appear­ <lb/>
            ance similar to certain others amongst the rest of the animal creation. <lb/>
            The wise course, however, would be for the philosopher to disengage <lb/>
            from these traditions the false element and to embrace that which is <lb/>
            true; and the truth lies in that portion of this ancient doctrine which <lb/>
            recognises the existence of these primary celestial substances, and <lb/>
            regards them as gods.”</p>
          <p>This brings to a close the proposed examination into <lb/>
            the existence and nature of tne First Cause; and inas­ <lb/>
            much as, in the unfolding of his theory on this point, <lb/>
            Aristotle has ascended up to the Absolute and Eternal <lb/>
            35. The sequel <lb/>
            to his theory of <lb/>
            the nature of <lb/>

            Mind, through the subjectivity of the human mind, and also had <lb/>
            demonstrated that the Divine Nature is what in itself must be essen­ <lb/>
            tially good, two questions apparently remain for discussion; the first <lb/>
            involving certain subjects of doubt as regards the Mind itself, which <lb/>
            are investigated in chapter ix., and the second as to whether the <lb/>
            Universe involves in its entire system this very excellence-this TO <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθόν</foreign>, which we found to be inherent in the Divinity.</p>
          <p>The question discussed in regard of mind is as to <lb/>
            what the essence of mind consists in, whether we must <lb/>
            assume its essence as being manifested in the capacity <lb/>
            36. Questions <lb/>

            Now, it is important to decide this question-for the settlement of <lb/>
            which the student is referred to chapter ix.; for the dignity of <lb/>
            mind Aristotle conceives depends very much upon correct views as to <lb/>
            its nature: the great danger to be avoided is the exaltation of the <lb/>
            objects of perception above the great percipient faculty itself. Such <lb/>
            will only tend to drag down mind from the eminence that it ought <lb/>
            always to occupy in our estimation.</p>

            of the TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυ­ <lb/>
            θϭν</foreign>; chap. x.</p>
          <p>The next question is, as to the nature of the Good <lb/>
            in its connexion with the system of the Universe <lb/>
            —a subject that is also discussed in chapters iv. and <lb/>
            v. book XIII. The inquiry which is mentioned in this tenth <lb/>
            chapter is, as to whether the nature of the entire of Creation consti­ <lb/>
            tutes what is good and excellent. How are we to account for the <lb/>
            existence of what is good ?-how are we to give a solution of the <lb/>
            orderly system of the Universe ? Is not the point in question best <lb/>
            illustrated by the case of an army, where the discipline and order <lb/>
            that prevail there, and give rise to its excellent condition, are the <lb/>
            result of the vigilance and strict command exercised by the general: <lb/>
            the general, certainly, does not preside over the army on account of the <lb/>
            subordination that is found there; but, vice versa. The application of <lb/>
            this to the matter in hand is obvious; and by it we see Aristotle <lb/>
            recognising what is good as a paramount principle in Creation. <lb/>
            38. Why men <lb/>
            were led to <lb/>
            deny the exist­ <lb/>
            ence of good. <lb/>
            And this, too, exposes the absurdities of any system <lb/>
            that would ignore the existence of what is good; and it <lb/>
            is easy to see why it was that they were led to adopt <lb/>
            such an hypothesis. They were for generating all things <lb/>
            from contraries; and would thus assume the active <lb/>
            influence at work therein of a principle of what is bad (<foreign xml:lang="grc">του̑ φαυλου̑</foreign>); <lb/>
            whereas had they thought as Aristotle did, and admitted the existence <lb/>
            of matter (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὓλη</foreign>), they would have recognised that as the prime source <lb/>
            of evil. It was quite absurd for them to insist on such principles as <lb/>
            these, because it was in reality a denial of what was matter of fact, <lb/>
            of what was plainly in existence before their very eyes, and that was <lb/>
            the operation of a certain power, which aimed at the promotion of <lb/>
            what is good as such, and succeeded likewise in the attainment of <lb/>
            this very purpose.</p>

            account of the <lb/>
            “origin of <lb/>
            evil."</p>
          <p>This, then, constitutes Aristotle's solution of the <lb/>
            origin of evil, and is put forward by its author as the <lb/>
            best refutation of such theories as those of Empedocles, <lb/>
            for example, and his school, in their recognition of the <lb/>
            principles of harmony and discord. The inconsistency of this system <lb/>
            -its utter insufficiency to account for the actual difficulty it proposes <lb/>
            to solve-has been already exposed by the Stagyrite in his Review of <lb/>
            the Greek Philosophy, and again in book II. chapter iv.</p>

            mental difficulty still remains as to how we can discover <lb/>
            any principle of efficiency in the Universe. Contraries <lb/>
            are mutually impassive, and whatever may be the results <lb/>

            of the conflict of two of them, such, certainly, cannot be equivalent <lb/>
            with motion. Motion must be communicated from some ir dependent <lb/>
            source. Grant the phenomenon of generation; but what is the cause <lb/>
            of generation ? And such is the force of this difficulty, that it pre­ <lb/>
            sented itself to the minds of the ancient philosophers, as we have <lb/>
            already seen; and they were thus compelled, by actual reason, to <lb/>
            recognise some gradation in their first principles, and the existence <lb/>
            of one as more dominant than the other. In general, <lb/>
            however, they fell into the absurdity of advancing the <lb/>
            existence of a something contrary to what was primary; <lb/>
            and this inconsistency is avoided by Aristotle, who has <lb/>
            41. The genera <lb/>

            against this <lb/>
            system. <lb/>

            mount to every other power or principle in the Universe. In vain, <lb/>
            then, are we to look for this, even in the systems of the Supra­ <lb/>
            naturalists: where, for example, will we discover the principle of <lb/>
            causality in the Ideal hypothesis of Plato, or in the numbers of <lb/>
            Pythagoras P Such is not to be found there; and this, too, amid <lb/>
            all their needless multiplication of first principles. And, further. <lb/>
            .Nature herself seeks to break loose from the bondage <lb/>
            fixed upon her by such speculations; and things them­ <lb/>
            selves cry out against the increase of their rulers: and <lb/>
            thus we find, not merely in the system of human <lb/>
            government, but also in the wide kingdoms of Creation, <lb/>
            42. Nature pro­ <lb/>

            primary <lb/>
            entities. <lb/>
            the one principle loudly proclaimed, of there being one sovereign <lb/>
            influence that presides over all, and that the dominion of many is not <lb/>
            what is advantageous either in the physical or social arrangements of <lb/>
            the world; and this truth is conveyed to us in the well-known line <lb/>
            from the Iliad: " The government of many is not a good thing; let <lb/>

            point of interest, however, in it relates to a refutation of the Ideal <lb/>
            hypothesis-more elaborate and more enlarged than that found in <lb/>
            book I. The first chapter of this book opens with a statement that <lb/>
            the nature of the substance of those objects that fall under the <lb/>
            notice of our senses has been declared, but that the inquiry proposed <lb/>
            in the Metaphysics is, as to whether, beside these sensible objects, <lb/>
            there is in existence a certain Immovable and Eternal Substance or <pb n="LXXXII"/>

            not. This point has been under investigation in the closing chap­ <lb/>

            opinions re­ <lb/>
            specting <lb/>
            Immovable <lb/>
            Substance.</p>
          <p>Now there are two leading opinions, Aristotle con­ <lb/>
            ceives, as regards this Substance; for the existence of <lb/>
            two sorts of substances are put forward, namely, mathe­ <lb/>
            matical entities, such as numbers, and lines and ideas; <lb/>
            and the difference is, that some identify both of these <lb/>
            together, whereas others constitute them as two distinct genera- <lb/>
            namely, ideas and mathematical numbers. The first point of in­ <lb/>
            quiry will be respecting these mathematical entities; as to whether <lb/>
            they exist at all or not; and if they do, as to the mode of their <lb/>
            subsistence. Next, the inquiry will extend itself to the subject <lb/>
            of ideas, and as to whether numbers constitute substances and first <lb/>
            principles.</p>
          <p>3. The pro­ <lb/>
            posed inquiry <lb/>
            as regards <lb/>
            mathematical <lb/>
            entities.</p>
          <p>Now the inquiry in regard of mathematical entities <lb/>
            is as to whether they subsist in objects that are cogni­ <lb/>
            sant by the senses, or are in a state of actual separation <lb/>
            from sensibles; or, supposing that they are found in <lb/>
            neither way, quere, do they exist at all; or if they do, <lb/>
            they must subsist after some different mode from either of these.</p>
          <p>4. The non- <lb/>
            inherence of <lb/>
            mathematical <lb/>
            entities in <lb/>
            sensible..</p>
          <p>Now as to the non-inherence of mathematical entities <lb/>
            in objects that fall under the notice of our senses, <lb/>
            Aristotle considers this to be proved from the non­ <lb/>
            divisibility of body and its non-separability from sen­ <lb/>
            sibles. It would, moreover, presuppose separable sur­ <lb/>
            faces, and so forth; and this multiplication of surfaces, &amp;c., may <lb/>
            be regarded as an obstruction towards a settlement of the question. <lb/>
            The same reasoning may be applied to numbers as well as to <lb/>
            mathematical entities. But a practical refutation of this entire <lb/>
            theory may be found in astronomy, optics, and harmonics; at least, <lb/>
            in doubts that might be raised in connexion with these sciences; <lb/>
            for we might as well, in the case of these, speak of the existence of <lb/>
            other sensible objects, and other powers of sensation, independent of <lb/>
            those about which these systems respectively are conversant. And <lb/>
            besides all this, even supposing this theory about the separate sub­ <lb/>
            sistence of mathematical entities to be true, the very contrary to <lb/>
            what is usually supposed to take place will in reality happen; for <lb/>
            it would be requisite that they should be prior to sensibles, when in <lb/>
            point of fact they are subsequent to them. And again, there is the <lb/>
            difficulty as to the mode in which these mathematical magnitudes <lb/>
            would be one, and if they do not happen to be one, there will ensue <lb/>
            dissolution in the case of many of them. To be sure, in a certain <lb/>
            sense they may be prior; for instance, in definition; but it does not <lb/>
            follow that things prior in definition should be also prior in substance. <pb n="LXXXIII"/>
             </p>
          <p><note type="margin">BOOK XII.] </note> In chapter iii. we have an assertion made in the <lb/>
            outset, of the existence of demonstrations and definitions <lb/>
            in the case of sensible magnitudes, and this would seem <lb/>
            to militate against the separability of mathematical <lb/>
            entities. Certainly this position cannot be established <lb/>
            by those who regard these mathematical entities from <lb/>
            5. Chap. IUi. <lb/>
            respecting the <lb/>
            separability of <lb/>
            these mathe­ <lb/>
            matical <lb/>
            entities. <lb/>
            the point of view from which they are usually beheld. And this <lb/>
            reasoning is again confirmed by a reference to harmonics and optics, <lb/>
            for they do not take cognisance of different objects from those that <lb/>
            fall within the province of our visual or vocal organs. It must, then, <lb/>
            be admitted, that if any separation takes place, it is one that is purely <lb/>
            mental, as is proved by a reference to the sciences of the geometrician <lb/>
            and the arithmetician.</p>
          <p>In the conclusion of this chapter Aristotle exposes <lb/>
            the error of supposing that the mathematical sciences <lb/>
            are in no way conversant with what is good and with what <lb/>
            is fair. But an immediate refutation of this false view <lb/>
            6. The Aristip­ <lb/>
            pic error in <lb/>
            regard of <lb/>
            mathematics. <lb/>
            in regard of mathematics may be found in this one fact, that it is with <lb/>
            the most important species of the fair-the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ καλόν</foreign>—namely, of <lb/>
            order and symmetry, or proportion and definition, that all these <lb/>
            sciences, in the most eminent degree, frame their demonstrations. So <lb/>
            that, from what is contained in both of these chapters, Aristotle is of <lb/>
            opinion that we have no reason for contending for the inherence of <lb/>
            mathematical entities in sensibles; and if, moreover, they do not involve <lb/>
            a separable subsistence, it is plain that they do not exist at all, or if <lb/>
            they do, it must be after some such mode, and, therefore, perhaps <lb/>
            the plain truth is, they do not exist at all.</p>
          <p>After the demolition of these mathematical entities, <lb/>
            Aristotle next proceeds to attack the Ideal hypothesis of <lb/>
            Plato, which already has been brought before our notice <lb/>
            in book I., yet not with the same completeness or finish <lb/>
            as here, though, indeed, most of the arguments found in <lb/>
            7. Chaps, iv. <lb/>
            and v. are an <lb/>
            attack on the <lb/>
            Ideal theory of <lb/>
            Plato. <lb/>
            book XII. can be pointed out likewise in book I. We are not, how­ <lb/>
            ever, to consider them as unworthy of attention because remarks of <lb/>
            a similar import have already found their place in other parts of the <lb/>
            Metaphysics; for, as Mr. Maurice observes, " Aristotle's repetitions <lb/>
            of himself, or the reports of his different pupils, generally clear away <lb/>
            many difficulties." It is to be also remembered, as Aristotle himself <lb/>
            states, that in his criticism upon the Ideal theory, he in no wise <lb/>
            connects the nature of ideas and of numbers together, as was done <lb/>
            by certain speculators who wished to blend the systems of Plato and <lb/>
            Pythagoras together.</p>
          <p>In the first place, then, as to the original of the <lb/>
            Ideal theory, Aristotle considers it to have been a <lb/>
            mere reaction against the Heraclitics, for the purpose <lb/>
            of securing the permanence of what those sceptics <lb/>
            8. Platonism a <lb/>
            reaction against <lb/>
            Heraclitism. <lb/>
            thought to sweep away in their theory of flux, All sensible objects <pb n="LXXXIV"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK XII.<lb/>
            </note>are in a state of continual flux, says the follower of Heraclitus; then <lb/>
            says the Platonist, if we are to have such a thing as scientific or even <lb/>
            prudential knowledge of anything at all, there must exist certain dif. <lb/>
            ferent natures, endued with qualities of permai.ence, independent of <lb/>
            those that fall under the notice of our senses; for it is quite plain that <lb/>
            there cannot subsist a science of things that are ever in a condition <lb/>
            resembling the waters of a river, flowing onwards. So far for the <lb/>
            relation of the system of Heraclitus to that of Plato.</p>
          <p>9.The influence <lb/>
            of the Socratic <lb/>
            on the Idealis­ <lb/>
            tic philosophy.</p>
          <p>There was, however, another philosopher who might <lb/>
            be said to have exercised a more palpable and immediate <lb/>
            influence upon the rise and growth of Idealism, and <lb/>
            that philosopher was Socrates. The inquiries which <lb/>
            Socrates pursued in regard of the moral virtues gave an impulse to <lb/>
            Idealism, because, in consequence of those inquiries, he was led into <lb/>
            investigations about universal definition; and this was the fore­ <lb/>
            runner of a more complete examination into the very nature of things <lb/>
            —the To <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί ἐϭτι</foreign>—which he already had partially pierced into in his <lb/>
            ethical speculations. Strictly speaking, indeed, Aristotle considers <lb/>
            that Socrates was not the first philosopher who busied himself in this <lb/>
            department of knowledge, for that already Democritus had done so, <lb/>
            though, to be sure, to a small extent; and the Pythagoreans, who <lb/>
            connected the formal or substantive principle of things with num­ <lb/>
            bers ; yet Socrates it was, undoubtedly, who, by bringing forward <lb/>
            plainly before men the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ τί ἐϭτι</foreign>, was the actuating cause in the <lb/>
            production of Idealism.</p>
          <p>10. This <lb/>
            influence was <lb/>
            the source to <lb/>
            the Platonists <lb/>
            of some of the <lb/>
            absurdities of <lb/>
            their system.</p>
          <p>Now, the Platonists thus borrowed their system from <lb/>
            Socrates; and in order to conceal their obligations in <lb/>
            this way, they imparted a separate subsistence to <lb/>
            the universals of the Socratics, which Socrates himself <lb/>
            had omitted to do, and they additionally invested them <lb/>
            with the appellation of ideas; and yet really this was <lb/>
            a source of absurdity in their system, for they thereby were forced <lb/>
            to acknowledge the existence of ideas in the case of all universals. <lb/>
            11. Illustration <lb/>
            of this. <lb/>
            And this mode of procedure was just as if a man were <lb/>
            to complain of the intricacies of numeration in the case <lb/>
            of a small sum, but when that sum was increased to <lb/>
            one many degrees higher, should boast of his ability to calculate the <lb/>
            entire consequent upon this disappearance of anterior difficulties! <lb/>
            These ideas or universals of the Platonists, in point of fact, were <lb/>
            more numerous than singulars—such as fall under the notice of the <lb/>
            senses; and in endeavouring to give an account of certain pheno­ <lb/>
            mena, and at the same time inveighing against the obstacles they <lb/>
            were obliged to encounter, they have regularly abandoned the real <lb/>
            subjects of inquiry, and passed on from these into regions of specu­ <lb/>
            lation where the perplexities they came in contact with were far <lb/>
            more complicated, but by themselves considered as more easy of <lb/>
            solution.</p><pb n="LXXXV"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin">BOOK XII.] </note> Thus the Ideal hypothesis would seem to prove too <lb/>
            much,1 for the ideas transcend the actual phenomena in <lb/>
            multitude; so that, what are we to say of the surplus ? <lb/>
            Must there not in such a case be ideas where there can <lb/>
            12. The Idea. <lb/>
            theory proves <lb/>
            too much, <lb/>
            be discovered nothing as corresponding with them in the nature of <lb/>
            things, in the sphere cf actuality ? But there is not a <lb/>
            single mode advanced by the Idealists as one according <lb/>
            to which the ideas subsist that can after all be shown <lb/>
            and fails in all <lb/>
            points. <lb/>
            by them to be such in reality, and thus this hypothesis may be said <lb/>
            signally to fail in its efforts to prop up its system. And more than <lb/>
            this; the very arguments which the Platonists would advance in <lb/>
            defence of their theory will be found on inspection, in point of fact, <lb/>
            to be quite destructive of its pretensions to truth.</p>
          <p>The utmost length to which we can go is to admit <lb/>
            the existence of ideas or forms in the case of those <lb/>
            things that may be classified severally under systems of <lb/>
            science as their objects; this confessedly is a method of <lb/>
            13. How far we <lb/>
            may admit the <lb/>
            system of the <lb/>
            Platonist. <lb/>
            dealing with the question that harmonises with the rational principles <lb/>
            deducible from the sciences. But, in short, the prin- 14. The Idealist <lb/>
            ciples the Idealists go upon quite overturn what they overturns his <lb/>
            themselves would desire the existence of, even in prefer- own theory. <lb/>
            ence to that of the forms; and what they say in regard of the forms <lb/>
            as participants of things, is only an assertion of the same absurdities <lb/>
            under the disguise of a different phraseology.</p>
          <p>But why, as he proceeds to show in chapter v., should <lb/>
            this Ideal hypothesis command our assent, when it is <lb/>
            palpably insufficient to account for the actual pheno­ <lb/>
            mena it professes to furnish a solution of. Has it not <lb/>
            been advanced by Plato, as what points to adequate <lb/>
            causes for the production of things Natural and Supra- <lb/>
            15. Total in­ <lb/>
            sufficiency of <lb/>
            the Ideal hypo­ <lb/>
            thesis for the <lb/>
            ends for which <lb/>
            it is advanced; <lb/>
            chap. v. <lb/>
            natural ? but what, in this way, do forms contribute either to the <lb/>
            generation or corruption of things cognisant to our senses, or to the <lb/>
            eternal elements that may be disengaged therefrom P In the Ideal <lb/>
            theory, we cannot put our finger upon a single efficient or alterative <lb/>
            principle, nor can its advocates show what service it is that they <lb/>
            propose conferring upon the interests of science in general by this <lb/>
            hypothesis about forms. They certainly cannot establish their asser­ <lb/>
            tion of these ideas constituting the substance of things; for if such <lb/>
            were true, they would be inherent in things; neither is it true to say <lb/>
            that they in any way are related to the existence-the esse—of <lb/>
            things; for if so, they would be discovered resident in their parti­ <lb/>
            cipants. Thus the Ideal hypothesis would seem to involve causality; <lb/>
            but it is a mere shadow of it, and the reasons advanced for the sup­ <lb/>
            port of such are capable of an easy refutation-reasons advocated <lb/>
            originally by Anaxagoras, and subsequently to his time by Eudoxus. <note type="footnote">(1) Ritter gives us an analysis of Aristotle'a refutation of the Ideal theory, <unclear>in</unclear> <lb/>

            involved in the <lb/>
            system of <lb/>
            Plato.</p>
          <p>But, after all, the Idealists put forth arguments to <lb/>
            prove their theory, which are entirely insufficient foi <lb/>
            that purpose; nor, indeed, can any of the usual methods <lb/>
            advanced for the establishment of their hypothesis be <lb/>
            demonstrated as competent for such an end. And, moreover, any <lb/>
            one who chose to apply himself to the subject would be able to <lb/>
            collect together many impossibilities in reference to an opinion such <lb/>
            as that adhered to by the Platonists, and quite sufficient to overrule <lb/>
            its claims upon the acquiescence of the philosophic world. For <lb/>
            instance, to speak of ideas as the models or paradigms of things is <lb/>
            quite absurd and silly. And again, how are the ideas substances of <lb/>
            things, if they at the same time are allowed by the Platonists to <lb/>
            subsist separately therefrom, as is admitted by Plato himself, in the <lb/>

            grand objection <lb/>
            against the <lb/>
            Ideal theory. <lb/>
            Phædo. But the grand objection against the Ideal <lb/>
            hypothesis, and one which the advocates of it can never <lb/>
            reply to, is that it entirety ignores the efficient prin­ <lb/>
            ciple, for that we quite fail to discern anything m it <lb/>
            like causality; and what renders the perception of this fundamental <lb/>
            fallacy in their system the more difficult is, that the Platonists them­ <lb/>
            selves have brought forward their doctrine as the wisest solution <lb/>
            that has yet been offered of the theory of causation. This last para <lb/>
            graph may be regarded as containing the sum and substance of <lb/>
            Aristotle's entire attack on the Idealism of Plato, and he now passes <lb/>
            on to the philosophy of Pythagoras, having completed his survey of <lb/>

          <p>The speculations which follow in chapter vi. are not <lb/>
            quite so interesting and instructive as those which have <lb/>
            gone before; for the obscurity is sufficiently dense, <lb/>
            indeed, with which Aristotle discusses the question, as <lb/>
            to whether we are to consider numbers as separable <lb/>
            substances, and the primary causes of things. For example, we are <lb/>
            favoured with inquiries such as these,-as to there being a difference <lb/>
            in species between what is primary and consecutive in number, as <lb/>
            to the effect of this upon monads, in making them incommensurable <lb/>
            or incomparable one with another, as to the different modes of <lb/>
            numeration, and the error of confounding ideal and mathematical <lb/>
            number together, as well as denying the monadic nature of number <lb/>
            in general, which last dogma was peculiar to the Pythagoreans, and <lb/>
            formed a difficulty peculiar to their philosophy.</p>

            of monads in <lb/>
            relation to each <lb/>
            other.</p>
          <p>In chapter vii. we have a discussion of the question, <lb/>
            as to whether monads are capable of comparison, or <lb/>

            needless to set down the discussion, which may be <lb/>
            examined by a reference to the chapter itself in the <lb/>
            Metaphysics; for it is not what admits of being put in any other <lb/>
            form more simple, or intelligible, than that which it wears in thai <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin"> BOOK XII.] </note> In chapter viii. we have another curious examination <lb/>
            into the difference between a number and a monad; a <lb/>
            difference that must subsist either according to quantity <lb/>
            or according to quality. Aristotle, also, inquires as to <lb/>
            20. Chap, viii <lb/>
            is levelled <lb/>
            against the <lb/>
            Pythagorics. <lb/>
            whether number be finite or infinite, and remarks upon the diffi­ <lb/>
            culties of fixing any limit thereto. He also enumerates certain intri­ <lb/>
            cate deductions consequent upon the system of the Pythagoreans; <lb/>
            and he then boldly challenges them to prove, if they can, their <lb/>
            Theory of Unity as the substance of things.</p>
          <p>In chapter ix. we have the same sort of investigations <lb/>
            still earned on; for instance, as to whether number is <lb/>
            compounded of unity and plurality. And this question <lb/>
            is connected with that of the unity or infinity of number, <lb/>
            examined into in chapter vii. Having brought these <lb/>
            discussions to a close, Aristotle sums up his remarks on <lb/>
            21. Chap. ix. <lb/>
            contains <lb/>
            further <lb/>
            speculations <lb/>
            regarding <lb/>
            numbers. <lb/>
            these schools of philosophy at the close of chapter ix.; and they are <lb/>
            well worthy of study in the original. He adduces the discordancy <lb/>
            prevalent amongst the earliest advocates of these theories as the <lb/>
            plainest indication of their fallacy, and of the confusion which really <lb/>
            lurkedat the bottom of their systems. There was a constant current <lb/>
            of vacillation ebbing and flowing throughout their entire philosophy : <lb/>
            what one school embraced the other discarded; and thus, in reality, <lb/>
            was truth sacrificed to the interests of party. Those <lb/>
            philosophers, for instance, of this Supranatural school, <lb/>
            who admitted the existence of mathematical number, <lb/>
            merely did so from a horror of the Ideal theory; and <lb/>
            thus unconsciously discarded the element of truth found <lb/>
            22. Different <lb/>
            Supranatural­ <lb/>
            ists accounted <lb/>
            for. <lb/>
            therein. On the other hand, those who were desirous of maintaining <lb/>
            the tenets of the Idealists as well as of the Pythagoreans, perceiving <lb/>
            no mode whereby they could account for the subsistence of mathe­ <lb/>
            matical independent of formal number, have identified both together <lb/>
            as regards their formal principles; but, indeed, in point of fact, they <lb/>
            have entirely abolished mathematical number from their theories, <lb/>
            which, however peculiar to themselves, are of a wholly unmathe. <lb/>
            matical tendency. After all, Plato is the only philo­ <lb/>
            sopher who argues either correctly or consistently on <lb/>
            these subjects; and the inconsistencies and falsehood <lb/>
            23. Plato alone <lb/>
            consistent. <lb/>
            discoverable throughout the entire philosophy of the Pythagoreans <lb/>
            may be considered generally as a positive proof against its truth <lb/>
            The foundation of this school is improperly laid,-their assumptions <lb/>
            in the first instance are false; and, as Epicharmus lays down <lb/>
            correctly enough, "We can never fairly make good any assertions <lb/>
            where our arguments are drawn from principles not fairly esta­ <lb/>
            blished." This brings the Aristotelian review of the Pythagoric <lb/>
            philosophy to its conclusion.</p>
          <p>The end of this book is taken up with a sort of <lb/>
            summary of what has gone before, in reference to the <lb/>

            Platonists and Pythagoreans. Aristotle remarks, as a <lb/>
            sort of apology for his examination of these systems, <lb/>
            that they properly belonged to metaphysics, and, there­ <lb/>
            fore, he has thus at some length been induced to dwell <lb/>
            upon them, to the exclusion of a consideration of mere <lb/>
            objects of sense; for these fall outside the province of the meta­ <lb/>
            physician, and within that of the physicist or natural philosopher. <lb/>
            The great line, too, of demarcation to be drawn across the Supra­ <lb/>
            natural philosophy, is one which subdivides it into two leading <lb/>
            sections; one of which contends for the ideas as constituting what <lb/>
            is supra-sensual, and the other for the numbers as such. Aristotle, <lb/>
            accordingly, offers some few remarks in this and the next chapter, <lb/>
            as regards the Idealistic hypothesis, and as regards the advocates of <lb/>
            number; that is, not formal number, which he has already examined, <lb/>
            but purely mathematical number. This discussion is reserved for the <lb/>

          <p>1. Aim of <lb/>
            book XIII.</p>
          <p>WE come now to book XIII. (al. XIV.), which brings <lb/>
            the Metaphysics to its close; and though some of the <lb/>
            speculations therein are devoid of interest, yet the <lb/>
            chapters on the existence of good in the world are well worthy of <lb/>
            our careful study; for they diffuse much light around the rest of the <lb/>
            speculations of the Stagyrite, especially the character of his theolo- <lb/>
            2. Chap. i. on <lb/>
            contrariety <lb/>
            as a first prin­ <lb/>
            ciple. <lb/>
            gical system, properly so called. Chapter 1. of this <lb/>
            book is taken up with an examination of the relation <lb/>
            subsisting between contrariety and causation; and the <lb/>
            student is referred to the text itself for information on <lb/>
            this topic, which is treated of with such obscurity as to make Taylor <lb/>
            believe that Aristotle was not expressing here his own genuine senti­ <lb/>
            ments. Such as they are, however, they may be better understood by <lb/>
            a reference to the commentaries of Syrianus, to be found in Brandis, <lb/>
            and a translation of which is given in Taylor.</p>
          <p>3. Chap. ii. <lb/>
            regarding <lb/>
            things eternal, <lb/>
            viewed as com­ <lb/>
            posite natures.</p>
          <p>Chapter ii. opens wnn the discussion 01 a very impor <lb/>
            tant question, as to whether we can predicate compose <lb/>
            tion of things that are eternal, or whether the consider­ <lb/>
            ation of things eternal as composite natures would not, <lb/>
            in point of reality, ignore their existence altogether. <lb/>
            Ana, further, for the decision of this question he appeals to a prin­ <lb/>
            ciple already established as to the essential nature of the Eternal <lb/>
            4. Our know­ <lb/>
            ledge of "non- <lb/>
            ens." <lb/>
            Substance consisting in energy. This leads him to an <lb/>
            examination into our knowledge of the "non-ens," sug­ <lb/>
            gested by a quotation from the writings of Parmenides <lb/>
            and from this he passes on to inquire how entity can constitul <unclear/> <pb n="LXXXIX"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK XIII.] </note> <lb/>
            plurality, or how relatives are plural. In fact, in general, it may be <lb/>
            stated that this inquiry in regard of plurality extends itself to the <lb/>
            other categories. And the chapter concludes with the investigation <lb/>
            of the grounds, if any, for the subsistence of numbers, whether ideal <lb/>
            or mathematical.</p>
          <p>In chapter iii. we have a sort of sketch of the <lb/>
            several systems prevalent amongst the advocates for <lb/>
            numbers as the substance of things. Some, for in- <lb/>

            regarding <lb/>
            numbers. <lb/>
            stance, identify ideas with numbers; some again, identify numbers <lb/>
            with things; and, again, some identify matuematical natures with <lb/>
            number; and we also are presented with a brief review of these <lb/>
            systems, which takes up the entire of this chapter. In <lb/>
            chapter iv., which contains a portion of what obviously <lb/>
            belongs to chapter iii., we have a most remarkable sub- <lb/>
            6. Chap. iv. as <lb/>
            regards the TO <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μ̓γαθόν</foreign>. <lb/>
            ject of inquiry touched upon; namely, how we are to account for <lb/>
            the existence of what plainly meets us on every side, viz. the Good­ <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἀγαθόν</foreign>. Various systems have been put forth on this vital <lb/>
            question; but they may be reduced to two, namely, those on the one <lb/>
            hand who maintain the antecedence of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἀγαθὸν</foreign> as an efficient <lb/>
            principle; and on the other, those who would make it out to be <lb/>
            nothing else than a mere result in the way of natural and necessary <lb/>
            development. This, undoubtedly, is the statement to be found in the <lb/>
            fourth chapter of this book; and the student will be reminded of the <lb/>
            identity of this controversy with that which has been perpetuated <lb/>
            from the age of Aristotle downwards to our own. Aris­ <lb/>
            totle adduces the authority of the Magi, and of the <lb/>
            Sages, the Sophoi,l of antiquity to support the theory of <lb/>
            the antecedence of the good, and of its being a para­ <lb/>
            mount principle of Creation. And in support of the <lb/>
            same, he appeals to the systems of the ancient poets, <lb/>
            7. Aristotle <lb/>
            supports his <lb/>
            theory about <lb/>
            the TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">μ̓γαθόν</foreign>, <lb/>
            by a reference <lb/>
            to antiquity. <lb/>
            who likewise agreed with the Magi, as is evidenced in their assigning <lb/>
            the sovereignty amongst their first principles, not to such negations <lb/>
            as Chaos or Night, but to Jupiter, whom they recognised as a source <lb/>
            of positive dominion. We have also in this chapter an examination <lb/>
            into the relation between the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἀγαθόν</foreign> and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ έν</foreign>. And that the <lb/>
            former does not, nor cannot, constitute the latter is illustrated by an <lb/>
            appeal to the Ideal Theory.</p>
          <p>In chapter v. we have a discussion as to the conse­ <lb/>
            quences of a non-classification of the Good — the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἀγαθόν</foreign>—amongst first principles, and it chiefly turns <lb/>
            on the fallacy of supposing the less perfect to be antece- <lb/>
            8. Chap. v. re­ <lb/>
            specting the TO <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μ̓γαθὸν</foreign> as a <lb/>
            first principle. <lb/>
            dent to what is more perfect. Also, Aristotle inquires as to the <lb/>
            mode after which numbers consist from first principles, whether by <lb/>
            mixture, or composition, or as a thing springs from seed. This leads <lb/>
            to a denial of the substantive character of numbers, and an asser- <note type="footnote">(1) This was the designation for scientific men previous to the age of Pythagoras, <unclear/> <lb/>

            system of <lb/>
            numbers. <lb/>
            And the next chapter, which is the last, continues a <lb/>
            discussion of the same topic, and tests the validity of <lb/>
            the theories about numbers as causes, by examining <lb/>
            some of the instances that have been brought forward <lb/>
            by the supporters of this system, and exposing the ab­ <lb/>
            surdity of the same. Chapters v. and vL are well <lb/>
            worthy of attention; as they touch upon certain departments of <lb/>
            speculation of the most vital importance, and the interest in which <lb/>
            continues unabated to the present day.</p>
          <p>10. Aim of the <lb/>
            foregoing <lb/>
            Analysis.</p>
          <p>Having thus brought this Analysis to its termination, <lb/>
            the hope is expressed that it may prove of assistance to <lb/>
            students desirous of becoming acquainted with the <lb/>
            metaphysical system of Aristotle. The plan pursued has been <lb/>
            to endeavour to show the thread of connexion that runs through <lb/>
            the Metaphysics, to explain the doctrines from time to time laid <lb/>
            down there, and in general to discover as far as possible the drift and <lb/>
            tendency of the entire Treatise. And all this seems more attainable by <lb/>
            Bekker's arrangement of the several books, which has been followed, <lb/>
            than that which has been proposed by Dr Gillies, probably in imitation <lb/>
            of Petiti,l and censured by Taylor,2 with every possible show of reason.</p>
          <p>11. Transcend­ <lb/>
            entalism of the <lb/>
            Metaphysics.</p>
          <p>From the Analysis it may be seen that the aim of the <lb/>
            Stagy rite is eminently transcendental, and the whole <lb/>
            work is based on the supposition of the existence <lb/>
            of a something that is capable of and actually involves a separable <lb/>
            subsistence, independent of and superior to those objects that <lb/>
            fall under the notice of our senses. And it is through the prin­ <lb/>
            ciple of causation that we are enabled to ascend upwards to this <lb/>
            supra-sensual substance; and, therefore, we may observe the con­ <lb/>
            stant struggle of Aristotle, in his metaphysical system, to dissipate <lb/>
            the obscurity that hung around the principle of efficiency in the philo­ <lb/>
            sophic world. This is quite apparent in his review of the Greek <lb/>
            philosophy, in his elucidation of the relation between matter and <lb/>
            form and between energy and capacity, and in his mode of refuting <lb/>
            12. Does this <lb/>
            amount to <lb/>
            an assertion <lb/>
            of God'a <lb/>
            existence ? <lb/>
            the Ideal Hypothesis of Plato. Still, however, his asser­ <lb/>
            tion of the necessity of the existence of a certain supra- <lb/>
            sensual substance may fall very far short of a demon­ <lb/>
            stration of God's existence; and the examination of this <lb/>
            point, of how far Aristotle had advanced in the develop­ <lb/>
            ment of his theological system, may form not an unsuitable conclusion <lb/>
            to the foregoing interpretation of his Ontology.</p>
          <p>13. Incon­ <lb/>
            sistency of <lb/>
            Aristotle in his</p>
          <p>Now, it has appeared from several portions of thia <lb/>
            Analysis,1 that whenever he has ventured to do so, the <lb/>

            imperfect <lb/>
            treatment of <lb/>
            Theology. <lb/>
            in a writer who really thought-as the Stagy rite did-that the pro. <lb/>
            vinces of Theology and Metaphysics intersected each other, nay, <lb/>
            occupied common ground. And this apathy for religious speculation <lb/>
            is, perhaps, the more inconsistent in Aristotle, because he not merely <lb/>
            in the very outset of the Treatise acknowledges that Theology is an <lb/>
            interchangeable term with Metaphysics, but that it is the former that <lb/>
            imparts such dignity tc the latter, and that sheds such lustre around <lb/>
            it as a science; so that the same complaint lies against the Meta­ <lb/>
            physics as against the Ethics, namely, the absence of the religious <lb/>
            element from both.</p>
          <p>As to the absence of the religious element from <lb/>
            the ethical system of Aristotle, the student is referred <lb/>
            to a Preface to " Selections from the Greek Text of the <lb/>
            Nicomachean Ethics," written by Dr. Fitzgerald, the <lb/>
            present Bishop of Cork, at a time when he tilled the <lb/>
            chair of Moral Philosophy in the University of Dublin. <lb/>

            element from <lb/>

            Ethics. <lb/>
            Nothing can be more eloquent than this short dissertation on the <lb/>
            advantages to be derived from a study of Aristotle's ethical writings; <lb/>
            and whilst the merits of his moral system are ably pointed out, at <lb/>
            the same time are exposed its defects, as the work of a mind not <lb/>
            impregnated with "the truth as it is in Jesus." The perusal of this <lb/>
            treatise is recommended as a guide towards the formation of a corre:t <lb/>
            judgment on the point in question, as well as " Essays on some of the <lb/>
            Peculiarities of the Christian Religion," Essay I. sections 3, 4, 5, 6.1</p>
          <p>The absence of the religious element, however cul­ <lb/>
            pable in the Ethics, is in the Metaphysics an omission <lb/>
            the more flagrant, because, though Aristotle might <lb/>
            have answered such an objection in the case of his <lb/>
            Ethics by saying that the object there was merely the <lb/>
            15. Its absence <lb/>
            from the <lb/>
            Metaphysics <lb/>
            grossly <lb/>
            inconsistent. <lb/>
            enumeration of those practical duties that rest on man s social and <lb/>
            individual nature, to the exclusion of anything in itself supra-mun­ <lb/>
            dane, yet no such apology is open for him in the case of his Meta­ <lb/>
            physics. Here he had the most ample opportunity for developing <lb/>
            his theological system; he must have felt how he was called upon to <lb/>
            do so from the relations which he confessed as subsisting between <lb/>
            Metaphysics and Theology, to such an extent as that the latter in its <lb/>
            importance quite overshadows the former. We look in vain, how­ <lb/>
            ever, for anything like an adequate treatment of this subject, and the <lb/>
            meagre outlines, therefore, which he has furnished us in this depart. <lb/>
            ment, are the only data that we have to go upon in the formation of <lb/>
            our opinions as to what Aristotle's precise notions on the Nature of <lb/>
            God were, viewed in relation to the character of His Divine govern­ <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin">[BOOK XIII. </note> 16. How far <lb/>
            Aristotle's <lb/>
            theology goes.</p>
          <p>As to Aristotle's notions about the Nature of God, <lb/>
            the foregoing <unclear>Aralysis</unclear> shows us what may be learned <lb/>
            on that head; but his Theology seems to stop here, and <lb/>
            there is no further amplification of the fact of God's existence into <lb/>
            the various relations in which that fact stands to man himself, and <lb/>
            into the various duties of love, and gratitude, and obedience, which <lb/>
            necessarily are suggested to a religious or even thinking mind on the <lb/>
            mention of it. And on aceount of Aristotle's silence as regards the <lb/>
            moral government of God, and his Divine Providence over the world, <lb/>
            in connexion with his First Cause, has he been stigmatized with the <lb/>
            brand of Atheism.</p>
          <p>17. General <lb/>
            omission in the <lb/>
            controversy <lb/>
            about Aris­ <lb/>
            totle's atheism.</p>
          <p>In the controversies, however, concerning the Stagy­ <lb/>
            rite's Theology, this very circumstance has been over­ <lb/>
            looked ; and admirers of the genius of Aristotle, from a <lb/>
            knowledge of his works, have been unable to restrain <lb/>
            their indignation at the accusations of Atheism,-from <lb/>
            persons perhaps who have never studied his writings,—that have been <lb/>
            hurled from all quarters upon the head of this remarkable mail <lb/>
            The rancour shown on either side would obviously have been mode­ <lb/>
            rated had both parties perceived the lurking ambiguity of the word <lb/>
            Atheism, and a strict definition of that term might perhaps be the <lb/>
            means of creating a perfect coincidence of opinion on the subject.</p>
          <p>Now, bearing this in mind, let us try and see how the case stands. <lb/>
            As far as the Metaphysics are concerned, let us try to discover <lb/>
            whether there may not be one sense in which Aristotle is, and <lb/>
            another in which he is not, an atheist; and whether the latter accep­ <lb/>
            tation may not be the one espoused by the advocates, and the former <lb/>
            by the enemies, of the Stagyrite's philosophy.</p>
          <p>IS. Can Aris­ <lb/>
            totle's account <lb/>
            of God free <lb/>
            him from the <lb/>
            imputation of <lb/>
            atheism ?</p>
          <p>Now, from the foregoing Analysis, as already stated, <lb/>
            is plain Aristotle's assertion of a supra-sensual sub­ <lb/>
            stance; (he makes the existence of this substance <lb/>
            an argument for the necessity of there being such a <lb/>
            science as Metaphysics;) but by his distinguishing <lb/>
            Physics from Metaphysics, and designating the chief <lb/>
            division or the latter as Theology, he obviously makes his description <lb/>
            of this substance to constitute his Theology, that is, his account of <lb/>
            God. The question, then, among theologians, is, or rather ought to <lb/>
            be, as to whether we are to accept such an account from Aristotle of <lb/>
            God's Nature, and at the same time to consider this account as sum­ <lb/>
            cient to release the Stagyrite from the imputation of being an <lb/>
            atheist.</p>
          <p>19. Aristotle's <lb/>
            First Cause.</p>
          <p>From the very start, indeed, in the Metaphysics, we <lb/>
            can discover the transcendental tendency of Aristotle'a <lb/>
            philosophy; we can observe how in his searching for <lb/>
            causes, in their utmost generalisation, he does so in subservience tc <note type="footnote"> (1) The student should above all consult the Fabricii Delectus. chap. 8, ii. </note> <pb n="XCIII"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK XIII.] </note> <lb/>
            the interests of Ontology ; we can see how he embraces such causes <lb/>
            as are competent to solve the phenomena of design, and regularity, <lb/>
            and excellence. We perceive him, too, ascending from these causes <lb/>
            upwards to a First Cause, and this First Cause we find him arraying <lb/>
            in many of the distinctive attributes ascribed by us to God.</p>
          <p>Let us further, however, examine as to what de­ <lb/>
            velopment this notion of God's existence receives at <lb/>
            Aristotle's hands, and whether he builds thereupon <lb/>
            the reality of God's providence over us as our Creator <lb/>
            and moral Governor ; and we will discover that such a <lb/>
            3carch will be made in vain, and that there is no trace­ <lb/>
            so. Does he <lb/>
            connect this <lb/>
            First Cause <lb/>
            with a system <lb/>
            of Divine <lb/>
            Providence ? <lb/>
            able connexion between his notion of a First Cause, and our depen­ <lb/>
            deuce upon that First Cause, as his creatures, and the subjects of <lb/>
            his dominion. Now, all that can be found is merely a demonstra­ <lb/>
            tion—partly a priori, and partly a posteriori—of the existence of a <lb/>
            First Cause, together with a short delineation of the nature of that <lb/>
            cause, and its mode of operation. The truth seems to be this, that <lb/>
            Aristotle, even as a theologian, did not really feel himself called <lb/>
            upon to go any further than he had done; and, accordingly, in the <lb/>
            non-formation of a system of moral and providential government upon <lb/>
            the fact of God's existence, the Stagyrite displays no consciousness <lb/>
            of his being guilty of a sad omission. And the cause of <lb/>
            all this arose from the peculiar constitution of his mind, <lb/>
            which, impatient of being curbed by received opinions, <lb/>
            21. The reason <lb/>
            of his not <lb/>
            doing so. <lb/>
            would have appeared following in the beaten track of other inquirers, <lb/>
            if he had attempted anything further beyond the mere statement of <lb/>
            God's existence as the logical conclusion from premises already <lb/>
            established. And this is exemplified in the fact, that Aristotle's <lb/>
            treatment of Theology was characterised by a violent swing from the <lb/>
            system of his master, Plato—a remark, indeed, that is applicable to his <lb/>
            entire philosophy. Aristotle viewed Theology physically, in contra­ <lb/>
            distinction to Plato, who viewed Physics theologically; and there­ <lb/>
            fore it is, that so broad a line may be drawn between the Academy <lb/>
            and the Peripatetics; between the warm aspirations of the one <lb/>
            after an ideal perfection, compared with the icy ratiocinations of the <lb/>
            others.</p>
          <p>Thus we may, from this, understand how it has come <lb/>
            to pass, that Aristotle should have been recognised as <lb/>
            an atheist. Does not he, one of his defenders would say, <lb/>
            acknowledge the existence of a first intelligent Cause ? <lb/>
            22. Why Ans­ <lb/>
            totle has been <lb/>
            called an <lb/>
            atheist. <lb/>
            Does not ne, moreover, array this First Cause in many of the <lb/>
            Divine attributes P How, then, can he be regarded as an atheist P <lb/>
            Simply, the assailant would reply, because he omits to enlarge <lb/>
            upon the idea of God, and elucidate His relation to us here in <lb/>
            the world, as the Lord of this earth, and the supreme Ruler of the <lb/>
            Universe.</p><pb n="XCIV"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> [BOOK XIII. </note> 23. Aristotle's <lb/>

            minable by a <lb/>
            definition of <lb/>
            the word <lb/>
            Atheist.</p>
          <p>The sum comes to this, then, as has been already <lb/>
            observed, that the wisest course far for the assailants <lb/>
            and defenders of Aristotle to pursue on the question of <lb/>
            his Theology, would be to settle beforehand what they <lb/>
            mean by the word Atheist; and thereby both parties will <lb/>
            discover that in a certain sense Aristotle is, and in a cer. <lb/>
            tain sense that he is not, an atheist. If we mean by an atheist one <lb/>
            who denies the existence of a perfect intelligence subsisting of itself, <lb/>
            and eternal therefore in its essence, and the cause of all things else, <lb/>
            Aristotle can hardly be called an atheist in this sense. If, on the <lb/>
            other hand, we mean by an atheist one who ignores the reality of <lb/>
            God's moral government, one who strips God of those attributes that <lb/>
            vital and practical religion rest upon, one who robs the fact of God's <lb/>
            existence of its vivifying element for us in producing holiness,-if, in <lb/>
            short, we mean by an atheist one who, though he may allow the bare <lb/>
            existence of a First Cause, yet invests that First Cause with none of <lb/>
            those Divine characteristics that adorn it as a proper object of wor­ <lb/>
            ship, and one to be propitiated by prayer, in such an acceptation of <lb/>
            the term most indubitably must Aristotle be acknowledged an <lb/>
            atheist.</p>
          <p>24. This <lb/>
            question <lb/>
            viewed here in <lb/>
            reference to the <lb/>
            Metaphysics.</p>
          <p>Now this may be considered a fair statement of the <lb/>
            question of the Stagyrite's theology; but whatever <lb/>
            views one may be inclined to adopt, the study of the <lb/>
            Metaphysics is indispensable towards the formation of a <lb/>
            sound judgment on this question. And it is in reference <lb/>
            to the Metaphysics chiefly that the controversy about his atheism has <lb/>
            been handled in the foregoing, and hardly any account has been taken <lb/>
            of other parts of his works which might be noticed as confirmations <lb/>
            of what has been laid down above. All dogmatism has been avoided, <lb/>
            the subject has been discussed without cringing under the prejudices <lb/>
            of either party in the controversy, and no more is needful to be said <lb/>
            beyond addressing a few words of caution to all disputants on such <lb/>
            a question.</p>
          <p>25. Certain <lb/>
            cautions set <lb/>
            down as to the <lb/>
            conduct of a <lb/>
            controversy of <lb/>
            this descrip­ <lb/>
            tion.</p>
          <p>All persons, then, who engage in such a controversy, <lb/>
            should be cautious of the injustice of affixing the stain <lb/>
            of Atheism to the memory of one living before the time <lb/>
            that God " became flesh and dwelt amongst us," because, <lb/>
            forsooth, we cannot find him forming an equally ade­ <lb/>
            quate idea of the Nature of God with ourselves, upon <lb/>
            whom has rolled such a flood of light as to the Divine perfection, <lb/>
            " by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who heth abolished <lb/>
            death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the <lb/>
            Gospel." Again, we should remember that a Pagan's belief in the <lb/>
            immortality of the soul is beside the question of his atheism, because <lb/>
            a heathen might have maintained the truth of God's existence <lb/>
            without a simultaneous assertion of the reality of a future state of <pb n="XCV"/>
             <note type="margin">BOOK XIII.] </note> <lb/>
            rewards and punishments. Further, the doctrine of the eternity of <lb/>
            the world,' with Aristotle at least, does not clash with a belief in the <lb/>
            existence of God; nay, however paradoxical such an assertion may <lb/>
            appear, this dogma might be urged as one of the arguments in <lb/>
            favour of the Theism of Aristotle. Again, we should not overlook <lb/>
            the utter incompatibility of a system of atheism with a system of <lb/>
            incorporealism; and therefore, in all disputes of this kind, we should <lb/>
            be careful to settle beforehand how far the ancient writer whose <lb/>
            atheism is under examination may be proved to acknowledge the <lb/>
            reality of an incorporeal substance. And lastly, we should endeavour <lb/>
            perfectly to understand in what sense it is that the ancient author, <lb/>
            whose theological opinions we are trying to ascertain, employs the word <lb/>
            "<foreign xml:lang="grc">θεός</foreign>," whether as a term to designate one dominative principle in <lb/>
            the Universe, or as a mere generic name designed as an appellation <lb/>
            for whatsoever is supra-sensual or transcendental in its nature.</p>
          <p>It may likewise be of service to the student to read <lb/>
            the Logics of Aristotle along with his Metaphysics: not <lb/>
            but that they are two distinct sciences in themselves. <lb/>
            This assertion, however, is not acquiesced in by all, for <lb/>
            it is controverted by Bacon and Bitter; though, on the <lb/>
            26. The Logics <lb/>
            should be <lb/>
            studied with <lb/>
            the Meta­ <lb/>
            physics. <lb/>
            other hand, its truth is affirmed by Kant, and Thompson, and Manse <lb/>
            and, above all, by Aristotle himself, who takes the earliest opportunity, <lb/>
            in the Metaphysics, to apprise his readers how that the subject that <lb/>
            he is there introducing to their notice, is one which has been as well <lb/>
            neglected by other speculators as hitherto unexplored by himself. <lb/>
            Many of the terms recurring in the Metaphysics are explained in the <lb/>
            Contraries, the Topics, and the Treatise on Interpretation, e. g. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ον̓σια, <lb/>
            λόγος, κινησις, ἀπόφασις, κατάφασις</foreign>, and so forth. Again, the subject <lb/>
            of Demonstration (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δεικνυσις</foreign>) is treated of in the first book of the <lb/>
            Posterior Analytics, as well as that of Media, and of First Principles <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχαί</foreign>). And in book ii. of this same Treatise we have an examina­ <lb/>
            tion into the nature and grounds of scientific knowledge. Instances <lb/>
            of reference of this kind, however, have been pointed out, from time <lb/>
            to time, in sufficient abundance, in the notes of the translation; and <lb/>
            the student is here merely reminded of the importance of prosecuting <lb/>
            this comparison for himself. The only available Translation of the. <lb/>
            Logical Treatises is that by Mr. Owen, in Bohn's Classical Librarv­ <lb/>
            a translation that deserves to be mentioned for its accuracy and the <lb/>
            clearness with which the work is put before an English reader by <lb/>
            means of the marginal notes.</p>
          <p>All that remains now is to point out, extrinsic to <lb/>
            Aristotle's works, some collateral studies with the <lb/>
            Metaphysics. There may, therefore, be mentioned, as <lb/>

              2 This, probably, is what Cicero means when he says, in the De <lb/>
              Officiis, I. 4,—" In primisque hominis est propria veri inquisitio atque <lb/>
              investigation The assertion, however, that all men desire know­ <lb/>
              ledge, has been objected to, on the ground that in some this desire is <lb/>
              wholly absent; but this absence merely amounts to a suppression of <lb/>
              the natural desire from various causes; e.g. want of leisure for intel­ <lb/>
              lectual pursuits, constitutional laziness, voluptuous habits. This natural <lb/>
              craving for knowledge leads to a concentration of individual abilities <lb/>
              on particular studies, and thus to a subdivision of intellectual labour. <lb/>
              Aristotle omits to notice here the connexion between this desire and <lb/>
              our social capacities, which ensures the mutual communication between <lb/>
              mankind of their mental and scientific discoveries. Vide Stewart's <lb/>
              Outlines of Moral Philosophy, part II. sect. iii. </note> <note type="footnote">3 Aristotle thus assigns two reasons for our love of the senses,-— <lb/>
              their utility, and their being sources of knowledge; or, as Thomas <lb/>
              Aquinas expresses it, " in quantum sunt utiles ac cognoscitivi." </note> <note type="footnote">S </note> <pb n="2"/>

              eminently above the rest, the sense of sight. For not only <lb/>
              for practical purposes, but also when not intent on doing <lb/>
              anything, we choose the power of vision in preference,1 so <lb/>
              to say, to all the rest of the senses. And a cause of this is <lb/>
              the following,-that this one of the senses particularly enables <lb/>
              us to apprehend2 whatever knowledge it is the inlet of, and <lb/>
              that it makes many distinctive3 qualities manifest. <note type="footnote">1 Aristotle's reasoning amounts to this. Man loves knowledge, and <lb/>
              loves the senses, therefore, for their own sakes; that is, so far forth as <lb/>
              they are the inlets of knowledge, and, consequently, the sense of sight <lb/>
              for the cause he assigns. The elevation of this sense above the others <lb/>
              was in accordance with the notions of the old philosophers, and of the <lb/>
              scholastics; and this superiority was grounded on the immediateness <lb/>
              of the perceptions afforded by the organ of vision, compared with <lb/>
              the others which came in through a medium. This notion is discarded <lb/>
              by the moderns. All the senses, as such, are equally the sources ot <lb/>
              knowledge, as is most satisfactorily proved by Brown, and with much <lb/>
              originality too, in his Philosophy of the Human Mind, voL IL chaps. <lb/>

              words. Taylor renders them thus,—" it, especially, of the rest makes <lb/>
              us to know something;" but in this translation the force of <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὶ</foreign> is quite <lb/>
              lost; whereas it is preserved in Bessarion's interpretation, who for the <lb/>
              Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὶ</foreign> has the Latin "quicquam." Taylor evidently did not consult <lb/>
              the Cardinal's version. There is another sense which the words could <lb/>
              possibly bear, namely,—"that the sense of sight is particularly instru­ <lb/>
              mental in furnishing us with whatever knowledge we have;" and this <lb/>
              would make Aristotle, as stated in the foregoing note, fall into the <lb/>
              vulgar error of the old philosophers,-that all knowledge originally <lb/>
              came in through the organ of vision. This, indeed, seems to have <lb/>
              been the sense put upon these words by the scholastici, as appears <lb/>
              from the objections that were made against Aristotle's assertion by his <lb/>
              commentators in the Middle Ages; namely, that, as Augustine Niphus <lb/>
              puts the objection, our tactual organs and the remaining senses were, <lb/>
              in an equal degree, sources of information. </note><note type="footnote"> If I were to suggest an emendation of the text as it stands in <lb/>
              Bekker, following some MSS., I should leave out the particle rl alto­ <lb/>
              gether, and render the passage thus,—" it, the sense of sight, enables us <lb/>
              to acquire the greatest amount of knowledge." And this would be sup­ <lb/>
              ported by the old Latin version, which Thomas Aquinas has preserved, <lb/>
              and which renders the words, simply, "maxime tacit cognoscere." <lb/>
              Aquinas, however, does not seem to think that <foreign xml:lang="grc">μάλιστα</foreign> refers to the <lb/>
              quantity of the knowledge afforded, but its quality; he renders it by the <lb/>

            are capable of receiving instruction as many as, in addition <lb/>

            denied by Brown; but that what we term memory in the human <lb/>
            species is found in brutes, is shown by Locke in the instance of birds, <lb/>
            after a few attempts, learning to warble particular airs of music. </note> <note type="footnote">2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">φαντασίαις</foreign>. Taylor translates this word " phantasy," which conveys <lb/>
            little or no meaning at all, and is conceived in defiance of <foreign xml:lang="grc">φανγασία</foreign> <lb/>
            being in the plural number. It is not, however, quite so easy to deter­ <lb/>
            mine the meaning of this word in the philosophic works of the <lb/>
            ancients. In the present case, Aristotle seems to mean those ideas <lb/>
            that are conveyed into the minds of animals by means of their repre­ <lb/>
            sentative power. This word occurs frequently in the writings of Sextus <lb/>
            Empiricus,—in the Pyrrhonian Institutes, and in his treatise, Contra <lb/>
            Mathematicos; but in the Latin version we have it translated merely <lb/>
            "phantasia." Quinctilian, in his interpretation of the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">φανγασία</foreign>, <lb/>
            uses the following language,—" per quas imagines rerum absentum ita <lb/>
            repræsentantur animo ut eas cernere oculis ac præsentes habere <lb/>
            videamur." Quinctilian thus improves on Cicero's translation, who <lb/>
            renders it by " visum" in various places, and by "visionem " in the <lb/>
            Lucullus. Plutarch's exposition of the word, in the De Placitis, is <lb/>
            curious: he derives <foreign xml:lang="grc">φαντασία</foreign> from <foreign xml:lang="grc">φω̑ς</foreign>, because, as light proves its <lb/>
            own existence, and that of the things it illustrates, so <foreign xml:lang="grc">φαντασία</foreign> brings <lb/>
            itself to light, and is constructive of itself. Thomas Aquinas, in his Com­ <lb/>
            mentary, defines <foreign xml:lang="grc">φαντασία</foreign> thus: "quæ est motus factus a sensu secundum <lb/>
            actum ;" which reminds us of Hobbes' definition of sensation itself. </note> <note type="footnote">B 2 </note></p><pb n="4"/>

          <p>But science and art result unto men by means <lb/>

            according to one species,-while labouring under this disease, <lb/>
            as, for instance, to the phlegmatic, or the choleric, or those <lb/>

            with expe­ <lb/>
            rience,in regard <lb/>
            of practice.</p>
          <p>As regards, indeed, practical purposes,2 there­ <lb/>
            fore, experience seems in no wise to differ from <lb/>
            art; nay, even we see the experienced com­ <lb/>
            passing their objects more effectually than those <lb/>
            who possess a theory3 without the experience. But a cause of <lb/>
            this is the following-that experience, indeed, is a knowledge <lb/>
            of singulars, whereas art, of universals; but all things in the <lb/>
            doing, and all generations, are concerned about the singular: <lb/>
            for he whose profession it is to practise medicine, does not <lb/>
            restore man to health save by accident, but Callias, or Socrates, <lb/>
            or any of the rest so designated, to whom it happens to be <lb/>
            a man. If, therefore, any one without the experience is <lb/>
            furnished with the principle, and is acquainted with the <lb/>
            universal, but is ignorant of the singular that is involved <lb/>
            therein, he will frequently fall into error in the case of his <lb/>
            medical treatment; for that which is capable of cure is rather <lb/>
            the singular.</p>
          <p>But, nevertheless, we are of opinion that, at least, knowledge <note type="footnote">1 This assertion is put into the mouth of Polus in the Georgias of <lb/>

            and understanding appertain to art rather than <lb/>

          <p>But this is so because some, indeed, are aware <lb/>
            of the cause, and some are not. For the expe­ <lb/>
            rienced, indeed, know that a thing is so, but they <lb/>
            do not know wherefore it is so; but others–I <lb/>

            the cause. Therefore, also, we reckon the chief artificers in <lb/>
            each case to be entitled to more dignity, and to the repu­ <lb/>
            tation of superior knowledge, and to be more wise than the <lb/>
            handicraftsmen, because the former are acquainted with the <lb/>
            causes of the things that are being constructed; whereas the <lb/>
            latter produce things, as certain inanimate things do, indeed; <lb/>
            yet these perform their functions unconsciously,-as the fire <lb/>
            when it burns. Things indeed, therefore, that are inanimate, <lb/>
            by a certain constitution of nature, perform each of these <lb/>
            their functions, but the handicraftsmen through habit; inas­ <lb/>
            much as it is not according as men are practical that they <lb/>
            are more wise, but according as they possess the reason of <lb/>
            a thing, and understand causes.</p>
          <p>And, upon the whole, a proof of a person’s <lb/>
            having knowledge is even the ability to teach;1 <lb/>
            and for this reason we consider art, rather than <lb/>
            Secondly, in <lb/>
            the ability to <lb/>
            teach. <lb/>
            experience, to be a science; for artists can, whereas the an­ <lb/>
            craftsmen cannot, convey instruction.</p>
          <p>And further, we regard none of the senses to <lb/>
            be wisdom, although, at least, these are the <lb/>
            most decisive sources of knowledge about singu­ <lb/>
            lars; but they make no affirmation of the where­ <lb/>
            fore in regard of anything,-as, for example, why <lb/>
            fire is hot, but only the fact that it is hot. <lb/>

              the rest of men. But when more arts are being discovered­ <lb/>
              both some, indeed, in relation to things that are necessary, <lb/>
              and others for pastime–we invariably regard such more wise <lb/>
              than those,1 on account of their sciences not being for bare <lb/>
              utility. Whence all things of such a sort having been already <lb/>
              procured, those sciences have been invented which were pur­ <lb/>
              sued neither for purposes of pleasure nor necessity, and first in <lb/>
              those places where the inhabitants enjoyed leisure: where­ <lb/>
              fore, in the neighbourhood of Egypt the mathematical arts <lb/>
              were first established; for there leisure was spared unto the <lb/>
              sacerdotal caste. It has then, indeed, been declared in the <lb/>
              Ethics2 what is the difference between an art and a science, <lb/>
              and the rest of the things of the same description.</p>
          <p>10. That wis­ <lb/>
            dom is a science <lb/>
            of causes, reaf­ <lb/>
            firmed, and <lb/>
            stated as the <lb/>
            object of the <lb/>
            present trea­ <lb/>
            tise.</p>
          <p>But, at present, the reason of our producing this <lb/>
            treatise is the fact, that all consider what is termed <lb/>
            wisdom to be conversant about first causes and <lb/>
            principles; so that-as has been said on a former <lb/>
            occasion-the experienced seem to be more wise <lb/>
            than those possessing any sense whatsoever, and <lb/>
            the artificer than the experienced, and the master-artist than <lb/>
            the handicraftsman, and the speculative rather than those that <lb/>
            are productive. That, indeed, wisdom, therefore, is a science <lb/>
            conversant about certain causes and first principles is obvious. <note type="footnote">the example of the Egyptian priests, who were enabled to construct <lb/>
            the speculative sciences of geometry and mathematics by having <lb/>
            enjoyed leisure from the laborious employments of life. They were <lb/>
            thus allowed an opportunity of contemplating the heavenly pheno* <lb/>
            mena, and, from such observations of experience, of deducing the <lb/>
            abstract sciences. The student will do well to consult Alexander's <lb/>
            Commentary on the passage, and the more elaborate explanation of <lb/>
            Asclepius, taken from Ammonius. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 That is, that those who knew the reason of things were more wise <lb/>

            foregoing remarks amounts to this,-that such are tantamount to <lb/>

            however, repels the imputation that he is using these words in the same <lb/>

          <p>Now, since we are engaged in investigating this <lb/>
            science, the following must form a subject for <lb/>
            our consideration; namely, about what kind of <lb/>
            causes, and what kind of first principles, is this <lb/>
            1. Wisdom <unclear>com</unclear> <lb/>
            versant about <lb/>
            primary and <lb/>
            universal <lb/>
            causes. <lb/>
            science–I mean wisdom–conversant. If, doubtless, one <lb/>
            would receive the opinions which we entertain concerning <lb/>
            the wise man, perhaps from this our proposed inquiry would <lb/>
            be evident the more.</p>
          <p>Now, in the first place, indeed, we go on the <lb/>
            supposition that the wise man, especially, is ac­ <lb/>
            quainted with all things scientifically, as far as <lb/>
            this is possible, not, however, having a scientific <lb/>
            2. Threefold <lb/>
            proof of this; <lb/>
            first, from defi­ <lb/>
            nition of wise <lb/>
            man. <lb/>
            knowledge of them singly. In the next place, a person <lb/>
            who is capable of knowing things that are difficult, and <lb/>
            not easy for a man to understand, such a one we deem wise <lb/>
            (for perception by the senses is common to all wherefore <lb/>
            it is a thing that is easy, and by no means wise). Further, <lb/>
            one who is more accurate, and more competent to give in­ <lb/>
            struction in the causes of things, we regard more wise about <lb/>
            every science. And of the sciences, also, that which <lb/>
            is desirable for its own account, and for the sake <lb/>
            of knowledge, we consider to be wisdom in pre- <lb/>
            Secondly, from <lb/>
            the definition <lb/>
            of wisdom. <lb/>
            ference to that which is eligible on account of its probable <lb/>
            results, and that which is more qualified for preeminence we <lb/>
            regard as wisdom, rather than that which is subordinate,–for <lb/>
            that the wise man ought not to be dictated to, but should <lb/>
            dictate unto others; and that this person ought not to be <lb/>
            swayed in his opinions by another, but one less wise by this <lb/>
            man. Respecting this wisdom and wise men2 do we enter­ <lb/>
            tain such and so many suppositions. <note type="footnote">1 Aristotle having shown, in the first chapter, that the science under <lb/>
            investigation-which he here calls wisdom, though elsewhere by a <lb/>
            different denomination-is conversant about causes, proceeds now to lay <lb/>
            down what sort these causes are, their nature, and number. </note><note type="footnote">2 The remarks of Alexander Aphrodisiensis upon Aristotle's analysis <lb/>

            the present <lb/>
            science.</p>
          <p>But of these characteristics the scientific know <lb/>
            ledge of all things must needs be found in him <lb/>
            most especially who possesses the universal <lb/>
            science ;1 for this person, in a manner, knows all <lb/>
            things that are subjects of it. But, also, the most <lb/>
            difficult nearly for men to know are the things that are <lb/>
            especially universal, for they are most remote from the <lb/>
            senses. But the most accurate of the sciences are those <lb/>
            respecting things that are primary, in the most eminent sense <lb/>
            of the word; for those from fewer principles are more accu­ <lb/>
            rate than those said to be from addition, as arithmetic than <lb/>
            geometry.2 But, also, that science, without doubt, is more <lb/>
            adapted towards giving instruction, at least, which speculates <lb/>
            about causes; for those do afford instruction who assign the <lb/>
            causes in regard of each individual thing. Now, under­ <lb/>
            standing and scientific knowledge, for their own sakes, most <lb/>
            especially reside in the science of that which is most par­ <lb/>
            ticularly fitted for being scientifically known. For he who <lb/>
            selects scientific knowledge, for its own sake, will especially <lb/>
            choose that which is preeminently science; but such is that <lb/>
            which is the science of that which is particularly fitting as an <lb/>
            object of scientific knowledge, and particularly fitting as objects <lb/>
            of scientific knowledge are first principles and causes; for on <lb/>
            account of these, and by means of these, are the other objects <lb/>
            of knowledge capable of being made known: but not these by <lb/>
            means of those things that are subordinate to them. Most <lb/>
            fit for preeminence likewise amongst the sciences, and fit for <lb/>
            preeminence 3 in preference to that which is subservient, is <lb/>
            the science which communicates the knowledge of that on <lb/>

            tokened a corresponding change in men's mode of thought; for thereby <lb/>
            an element hitherto undiscovered was brought into notice,-namely, the <lb/>

            speculative of first principles and of causes, for <lb/>

          <p>But that the science under investigation is not <lb/>
            a science employed in producing,l is evident from <lb/>
            the case of thosewho formed systems of philo­ <lb/>
            sophy in the earliest ages. For from wonder men, <lb/>

            4. What sort of <lb/>
            a science wis­ <lb/>
            dom is-not <lb/>
            active but spe­ <lb/>
            culative–proof <lb/>
            thereof. <lb/>
            phize, having felt astonishment originally at the things which <lb/>
            were more obvious, indeed, amongst those that were doubtful; <lb/>
            then, by degrees, in this way having advanced on wards, and, in <lb/>
            process of time, having started difficulties about more im­ <lb/>
            portant subjects,-as, for example, respecting the passive <lb/>
            conditions of the moon. and those brought to pass about <lb/>
            the sun and stars, and respecting the generation of the <lb/>
            universe. But he that labours under perplexity and wonder <lb/>
            thinks that he is involved in ignorance.2 Therefore, also, the <lb/>
            philosopher-that is, the lover of wisdom-is somehow a <lb/>
            lover of fables,3 for the fable is made up of the things that <lb/>
            are marvellous. Wherefore, if, for the avoidance of ignorance, <lb/>
            men from time to time have been induced to form systems <lb/>
            of philosophy, it is manifest that they went in pursuit of <note type="footnote">1 Aristotle shows that the science under investigation is speculative, <lb/>
            not active, from the fact that the earliest philosophy sprang from <lb/>
            wonder,-that wonder flows from ignorance,-that the removal of ignor­ <lb/>
            ance amounts to knowledge,-that this was accomplished by speculation <lb/>
            and not practice; and that therefore wisdom, the source of the highest <lb/>
            knowledge, was speculative and not active. Compare Alexander <lb/>
            Aphrodisiensis on the passage, and also Thomas Aquinas in his remarks <lb/>

            largely of the nature of the fabulous, on account of its being therewith <lb/>
            deeply tinged through the influence of poetry. This is manifest from <lb/>
            the works of Greek antiquity in the instances of Linus, Musæus, and <lb/>
            Orpheus. The subject is discussed by Cudworth; and, more at large, in <lb/>

            both ease and the management of life, prudence of such a sort <lb/>
            as this began to be in requisition. Therefore is it evident <lb/>
            that we seek scientific knowledge from no other actual ground <lb/>
            of utility save what springs from itself.</p>
          <p>5. This science <lb/>
            most liberal.</p>
          <p>But as we say a free man exists who is such <lb/>
            for his own sake, and not for the sake of another, <lb/>
            so, also, this alone of the sciences is free, for this alone subsists <lb/>
            for its own sake.</p>
          <p>6. Not human <lb/>
            in its origin.</p>
          <p>Wherefore, also, the acquisition of this science <lb/>
            may be justly regarded as not human, for, in <lb/>
            many instances, human nature is servile.</p>
          <p>Proof of this <lb/>
            from the poets.</p>
          <p>So that, according to Simonides, the Deity only <lb/>
            should enjoy this prerogative; yet that it is un­ <lb/>
            worthy for a man2 not to investigate the knowledge that is <lb/>
            in conformity with his own condition. But if, in reality, the <lb/>
            poets make any such assertion, and if the Godhead is in <lb/>
            its nature constituted so as to envy, in this respect it is <lb/>
            especially natural that it should happen, and that all those <lb/>
            that are over-subtle should be unfortunate :3 but neither does <lb/>
            the Divine essence admit of being affected by envy, but– <lb/>
            according to the proverb-the bards utter many falsehoods.</p>
          <p>7. This science <lb/>
            most honour­ <lb/>
            able.</p>
          <p>Nor ought we to consider any other science <lb/>
            more entitled to honour than such as that under <note type="footnote">1 Men often are the slaves of their nature on account of their super- <lb/>

            of its point, as Aug. Niphus shows. Aristotle's object, in bringing <lb/>
            forward Simonides, is to show that this wisdom, on account of the very <lb/>
            elevated speculations it contains, seems a thing of Divine growth, as <lb/>

            </note>investigation <unclear>at</unclear> present. For that which is most divine is also <lb/>
            most worthy of honour. But such will be so in only two <lb/>
            ways; for that which the Deity would especially possess is <lb/>
            a divine one amongst the sciences; and if there is any such <lb/>
            science, this would be the case with the science of things <lb/>
            divine. But this science, such as we have described it, alone <lb/>
            is possessed of both of these characteristics; for to all specu­ <lb/>
            lators doth the Deity appear as a cause, and a certain first <lb/>
            principle ;1and such a science as this, either God alone, or <lb/>
            he principally, would possess. Therefore, indeed, may all <lb/>
            sciences else be more requisite than this one; but none is <lb/>
            more excellent.</p>
          <p>It is, indeed, necessary, in a manner, to esta­ <lb/>
            blish the order2 of this science, in its develop­ <lb/>
            ment, in a direction contrary to the speculations <lb/>
            that have been carried on from the beginning. <lb/>
            8. This science <lb/>
            developed in an <lb/>
            order contrary <lb/>
            to the early <lb/>
            philosophy. <lb/>
            For, indeed-as we have remarked–all men commence <lb/>
            their inquiries from wonder whether a thing be so,-as in the <lb/>
            case of the spontaneous movements of jugglers' figures to <lb/>
            those who have not as yet speculated into their cause; or <lb/>
            respecting the solstices, or the incommensurability of the <lb/>
            diameter;3 for it seems to be a thing astonishing to all, if <lb/>
            any quantity of those that are the smallest is not capable of <lb/>
            being measured. But it is necessary to draw our inquiry to <lb/>

          <p>1. Fourfold <lb/>
            enumeration of <lb/>
            causes.</p>
          <p>BUT since it is manifest that one ought to <lb/>
            be in possession of a science of primary causes <lb/>
            (for then we say that we know each individual <lb/>
            thing when we think that we are acquainted with the first <lb/>
            cause); and since causes are denominated under four different <lb/>
            heads,2 the first of which we assert to be the substance and <lb/>
            the essence of a thing (for the inquiry of the wherefore, in the <lb/>
            first instance of a thing, is referred to the last reason,s but the <lb/>
            first wherefore of a thing is a cause and first principle); and <lb/>
            the second cause we affirm to be the matter and the subject; <lb/>
            and the third is the source of the first principle of motion; and <lb/>
            the fourth, the cause that is in opposition to this,–namely, <lb/>
            both the final cause and the good; for such is an end of every <lb/>
            generation;</p>
          <p>2. The labours <lb/>
            of his predeces-the <lb/>
            sors in <lb/>
            science of æti­ <lb/>
            ology.</p>
          <p>Therefore, although there has been a sum... <lb/>
            cient amount of speculation concerning these <lb/>
            in our treatise on Physics, let us, however, <lb/>
            bring forward those who before our time have <lb/>
            approached to an examination of entities, and have formed <lb/>
            systems of philosophy respecting truth. For it is obvious that <lb/>
            they also affirm that there are in existence certain first prin- <note type="footnote">I A ristotle now proceeds to examine into the labours of his prede. <lb/>
            cessors in the department of aetiology; and the course he pursues is <lb/>
            first to enumerate the opinions thereupon of the early schools of philo­ <lb/>
            sophy, and of individual speculators; and next, to set down arguments <lb/>
            for or against these theories, and show how far they are true, and how <lb/>
            far false. </note> <note type="footnote">2 This fourfold enumeration of causes is taken from the Physics, <lb/>

            ciples and causes; therefore will it, at ar y rate, be of service <lb/>
            to our present treatise should we take a review of these phi­ <lb/>
            losophers ; for either we shall thereby discover a certain dif­ <lb/>
            ferent description of cause, or we shall, in preference, repose <lb/>
            our confidence in those that have been already enumerated.</p>
          <p>Now, the majority of those who first formed <lb/>
            systems of philosophy consider those that subsist <lb/>
            in a form of matter to be alone1 the principles of <lb/>
            3. Their first <lb/>
            principle a ma­ <lb/>
            terial cause. <lb/>
            all things; for wherefrom all entities arise, and wherefrom they <lb/>
            are generated, as from an original, and whereto they are cor­ <lb/>
            rupted,–ultimately the substance, indeed, remaining perma­ <lb/>
            nent, but in its passive states undergoing a change,-this they <lb/>
            assert to be an element, and this a first principle of all things.</p>
          <p>And or this reason tney are of opinion that <lb/>
            nothing is either produced or destroyed,2 inas­ <lb/>
            much as such a constitution of nature is always <lb/>
            in a state of conservation ; as we say, that <lb/>
            4. Hence their <lb/>
            dogma: " nil <lb/>
            generari vel <lb/>
            corrumpi.” <lb/>
            Socrates neither is absolutely brought into being when he <lb/>
            may become handsome or musical, nor that he is destroyed <lb/>
            when he may throw aside these habits on account of the fact <lb/>
            of the subject,-namely, Socrates himself remaining perma­ <lb/>
            nent ; so neither is it the case with anything else that it is <lb/>
            either generated or corrupted anew. For it is necessary that <lb/>
            there should be a certain Nature-either one or more than <lb/>
            one-from which the other entities are produced, that re­ <lb/>
            maining in a state of conservation. The plurality, indeed, <lb/>
            and the species of such a first principle, all do not affirm to <lb/>
            be the same.</p>
          <p>But Thales,8 indeed,-the founder of this kind <lb/>
            of philosophy,–affirms the nature just mentioned <lb/>
            5. Material <lb/>
            cause held by <note type="footnote">1 Aristotle'B object–though, indeed, it is not very clearly set forth in <lb/>
            the Metaphysics, consequent upon the obscure arrangement which he <lb/>
            follows-seems to be to show that his predecessors, with a few excep­ <lb/>
            tions, merely busied themselves with a material cause, to the exclusion <lb/>
            of any other. </note><note type="footnote"><unclear/> 2 This dogma has been most fully illustrated by Cudworth in " The <lb/>

            ciple of all things); and doubtless for this reason, likewise, <lb/>
            holding such a theory, both from the fact of the seeds of all <lb/>

          <p>But there are some who suppose those who <lb/>
            lived in the most ancient1 times, and far previous <lb/>
            to the present generation, and who first formed <lb/>
            schemes of theology, to have also entertained opinions after <lb/>
            this manner concerning Nature; for these philosophers con­ <lb/>
            stituted both Oceanus and Tethys as the parents of gene­ <lb/>
            ration, and water2 as the object of adjuration amongst the <lb/>
            gods,-called Styx by the poets themselves; for most entitled <lb/>
            to respect is that which is most ancient,-now an object of <lb/>
            adjuration is a thing most entitled to respect. Whether, <lb/>
            therefore, there is this certain early and ancient opinion con­ <lb/>
            cerning Nature, in all likelihood would be an obscure point <lb/>
            to decide. Thales, indeed, is said to have declared his senti­ <lb/>

            however, is awkward and confused, and proves that he was but super­ <lb/>
            ficially informed in the deep researches of Aristotle thereupon. It is <lb/>
            manifestly from this portion of the works of the Stagyrite that all sub­ <lb/>
            sequent authors appear to have derived their speculations on aetiology. <lb/>
            This is quite perceptible in the case of the early apologists for Chris­ <lb/>
            tianity; e.g. Eusebius in his Demonstration, and Clemens Alexandrinus <lb/>
            in the Stromata and Adhortatio ad Gentes. </note> <note type="footnote">2 What Aristotle means by these words he put i into the form of an <lb/>

            for his doctrine of a <foreign xml:lang="grc">νοῦς</foreign>, or “mens," which he invested with the attri­ <lb/>

            are produced and destroyed by concretion and <lb/>
            dissolution merely; but that, in other respects, no entities were <lb/>
            either brought into existence, or caused to cease to exist, but <lb/>
            continued as things that are everlasting.</p>
          <p>From these things, indeed, therefore, one would suppose <lb/>
            that the only cause with these philosophers was that said to <lb/>
            exist in a form of matter.1</p>
          <p>9. Considera­ <lb/>
            tion of the effi­ <lb/>
            cient cause.</p>
          <p>But as these speculators advanced in this way, <lb/>
            the thing itself guided them, and constrained <lb/>
            them to investigate further; for though every <lb/>
            possible corruption and generation is from something sub­ <lb/>
            sisting, as one or more, yet why does this happen, and what <lb/>
            is the cause of this,-for undoubtedly the subject, at least, <lb/>
            itself is in no wise instrumental in making itself undergo <lb/>
            a change? Now, I say, for example, that neither the wood <lb/>
            nor the brass is the cause of either of these bodies under­ <lb/>
            going a change; neither does the wood, indeed, produce a bed, <lb/>
            and the brass a statue; but there is something else that is <lb/>
            a cause of change. But the investigation of this is the in­ <lb/>
            vestigation of a different principle, that is, the second cause,­ <lb/>
            as we have stated,-the principle of the origin of motion.</p>
          <p>10. Ignored by <lb/>
            the early specu­ <lb/>
            lators, except <lb/>
            Parmenides.</p>
          <p>Those, indeed, therefore, who from the earliest <lb/>
            times have altogether adopted such a method as <lb/>
            this, and affirm the subject to be one, have created <lb/>
            no difficulty for themselves; but some of these, <lb/>
            at least, who say that it is one, as if overpowered by this <lb/>
            investigation, assert that the one is immoveable, and the <lb/>
            entire of nature, not only according to generation and cor­ <lb/>
            ruption,–for this is an ancient dogma, and one which all <lb/>
            acknowledge,-but also according to every other change, <lb/>
            whatever; and this a tenet peculiar to themselves. Of those, <lb/>
            indeed, therefore, who affirm the universe to be one merely, <lb/>
            to none has it occurred to see clearly into a cause of such <lb/>
            a kind, unless, perhaps, to Parmenides,2 and to him so far as <note type="footnote">1Aristotle having now considered the treatment of the material <lb/>

            such a cause as the efficient cause,–I mean those who make <lb/>
            causes to be the hot and the cold or fire and earth ; for thev <lb/>

            have said, they investigated the principle next following, in <lb/>
            the way of a consequence. For of the excellent and beautiful <lb/>
            order of some things, and of the production of others of the <lb/>
            entities, it is not natural to assign, perhaps, either earth or <lb/>
            anything of this kind as a cause; nor is it natural that they <lb/>
            should think that it is; nor was it seemly, on the other hand. <lb/>
            attribute so important a part to chance and fortune.</p>
          <p>Now, whosoever affirmed mind, as in animals <lb/>
            so also in nature, to be the cause of the system <lb/>
            of the world, and of the entire harmony of it, <lb/>
            the same appeared, as it were, of sober tempera­ <lb/>

            however, has the credit assigned him of having put forward <lb/>
            a similar theory of causation at an earlier period.</p>
          <p>Those, indeed, therefore, who have entertained these <lb/>
            opinions have laid down as a first principle of entities, at <lb/>
            the same time the cause of their orderly arrangement, with <lb/>

          <p>1. Recognition <lb/>
            of the effi­ <lb/>
            cient cause by <lb/>
            Hesiod—as <lb/>
            some would <lb/>
            think-and <lb/>
            Parmenides.</p>
          <p>SOME one, however, might indulge in the sur­ <lb/>
            mise that Hesiod1 was the first to broach such <lb/>
            a description of cause as the above; and that this <lb/>
            is the case with whatsoever other speculator, if <lb/>
            any, that may have placed love or desire as a <lb/>
            first principle in entities; as, for instance, also Parmenides: <lb/>
            for this philosopher, likewise, in drawing up his scheme of <lb/>
            the generation of the universe, says,­ <lb/>
            " The first thing of all the gods, indeed, plann'd he Love." <lb/>
            But Hesiod's words are,­ <lb/>
            “First, indeed, of all was Chaos;2 but next in order, <lb/>
            Earth with her spacious bosom. Then <lb/>
            Love, who is pre-eminent amongst all the Immortals;" <lb/>
            just as if it were necessary that in entities there should sub­ <lb/>
            sist some cause which will impart motion, and hold bodies in <lb/>
            union together. How, indeed, then, in regard of these, one <lb/>
            ought to distribute them, as to their order of priority, can be <lb/>
            decided afterwards. <note type="footnote">1 Aristotle has suggested to others the opinion that the existence of <lb/>
            an efficient cause is recognised in the writings of Hesiod. It is quite <lb/>
            in this spirit that Cudworth strives to make the old Theogonies <lb/>
            systems of pure theology. It may, however, be remarked that the <lb/>
            good " mentioned in the theories of these cosmogonies, upon which is <lb/>
            grounded this particular view of the Hesiodic writings, may, in reality, <lb/>
            prove nothing towards settling the question how far an efficient cause <lb/>
            was discovered by the ancients. For “the good" may be regarded in the <lb/>
            light of a cause in two ways; either as physically producing good things, <lb/>
            or producing them for some purpose-and then it is a final cause. In <lb/>
            the latter sense it is not certainly found in the writings of the early <lb/>
            Physicists; and in the former, it is nothing more than a material cause, <lb/>
            and appears to be the point of view from which the ancients regarded <lb/>
            the nature of the good. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 There is a current, but erroneous, translation of the words quoted in <lb/>
            the above from Hesiod, which Cudworth adopts, in his over-anxiety to <lb/>
            establish his favourite hypothesis in regard of the religious element, <lb/>
            which he affirms to be mixed up in the entire philosophy of the <lb/>
            ancients. Cudworth makes " chaos " to be produced, and presupposes <lb/>
            a superior producing cause, and grounds his assertion on this passage <lb/>
            from Hesiod, but upon a mistranslation of it. It merely states the <lb/>
            existence of chaos—“chaos was” </note></p><pb n="19"/>

            are good appeared inherent in Nature, and not <lb/>
            only order and the beautiful, but also disorder <lb/>

            cause twofold, <lb/>
            and why. <lb/>

            rous than the good, and the worthless than the fair, accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, some one else introduced harmony and discord, as <lb/>
            a cause severally of each of these. For if any one would <lb/>
            follow the subject up, and form his opinion according to the <lb/>
            faculty of thought, and not according to the obscure assertions <lb/>
            of Empedocles,2 he will find harmony, indeed, to be a cause <lb/>
            of the things that are good, and discord of those that are <lb/>
            evil. Wherefore, if any should say that Empedocles both, <lb/>
            in a certain sense, affirms, and that he was the first to affirm, <lb/>
            that the evil and the good are first principles, perhaps he <lb/>
            would make such an assertion correctly, if the cause of all <lb/>
            things that are good be the good itself, and of those that are <lb/>
            evil the evil.</p>
          <p>These persons, indeed, therefore, as we have <lb/>
            said, even thus far have adopted into their sys­ <lb/>
            tems two causes, as we have defined them in <lb/>
            our Physics,- I mean the material cause, and the <lb/>
            3. The imper­ <lb/>

            principle of the origin of motion; that is, the efficient cause: <lb/>
            obscurely, no doubt, and by no means clearly, but, in a manner, <lb/>
            like the conduct of those who are unexercised in battles; for <lb/>
            these latter, also, advancing forwards against their adversaries, <lb/>
            strike frequently skilful blows: but neither do those combatants <lb/>
            act thus from a scientific system, nor do these early speculators <lb/>
            appear like men who understand that they are making the asser­ <lb/>
            tions which they actually are; for in no respect, almost, do they <lb/>
            appear to employ these first principles, save to a small extent. <note type="footnote">1 Aristotle now brings a new element into these ætiological dis­ <lb/>
            cussions, namely, contrariety; and sets forth Empedocles as the great <lb/>
            patron of this school. Tenets borrowed from this philosophy have <lb/>

            reason of discord, then fire is commingled into one and each <lb/>
            of the rest of the elements; but when all things, by reason of <lb/>

          <p>Empedocles then, indeed,-in contradistinction <lb/>
            to the early speculators,—first introduced this <lb/>
            cause, having divided it, not having constituted, <lb/>
            as single, the first principle of motion, but first principles <lb/>
            thereof which are different and opposite. But, moreover, <lb/>
            the reputed elements, in form of matter, he was the first to <lb/>
            assert the existence of as being four in number; he did not, <lb/>
            doubtless, employ at least four, but regarded them as if there <lb/>
            were only two; fire by itself, and those things that are opposed <lb/>
            to this, as one nature,-namely, both earth, and air, and water. <lb/>

            these affections, in the same manner these also affirm that dif­ <lb/>
            ferences are causes of the other things. They, indeed, say that <lb/>
            these are three, even figure, and order, and position; for they <lb/>
            affirm that entity differs merely in rhythm, and diathege, and <lb/>
            trope; out of these the rhythm is figure, and the diathege <lb/>
            order, and the trope position. For, indeed, the letter A differs <lb/>
            from the letter N in figure, and AN from NA in order, and Z <lb/>
            from N in position. But respecting motion, whence or how it <lb/>
            exists in entities, in like manner, with the rest of the early <lb/>

            bodies that are borne through the heaven are truly ten in <lb/>
            number; and whereas nine only are apparent, on this account <lb/>
            they constitute the confronting earth tenth. But respecting <lb/>
            these theorists, we have arrived at more accurate decisions in <lb/>
            other parts of our works.</p>
          <p>But the reason why we have gone in review <lb/>
            through these philosophers is this, in order that <lb/>
            we may receive also from them what they have <lb/>
            already laid down as being first principles, and <lb/>
            3. The theory <lb/>
            of the Pythago­ <lb/>
            reans on first <lb/>
            principles. <lb/>
            in what manner they fall in with the causes just enumerated. <lb/>
            Undoubtedly do these appear to consider number to be a first <lb/>
            principle, and, as it were, a material cause of entities, and as both <lb/>
            their passive conditions and habits, and that the even and the <lb/>
            odd are elements of number; and of these, that the one is <lb/>
            finite and the other infinite, and that unity, doubtless, is com­ <lb/>
            posed of both of these, for that it is both even and odd, and <lb/>
            that number is composed of unity, and that, as has been <lb/>
            stated, the entire heaven is composed of numbers.</p>
          <p>But others of these very philosophers affirm <lb/>
            that first principles are ten in number, denomi­ <lb/>
            nated in accordance with the following co-ordinate <lb/>
            series, namely:- <lb/>
            4 Another Py­ <lb/>

          <p>In the same manner seems Alcmæon of Crotona <lb/>
            to have formed his opinion; and this philosopher <lb/>
            certainly, either from those just named, or they <lb/>
            from this person, have derived this their theory; <lb/>
            5. A third <lb/>
            theory ascribed <lb/>
            to Alcmæon, <lb/>
            and skin to the <lb/>
            secor.d. <lb/>
            for Alcmæon had reached the age of manhood when Pytha­ <lb/>
            goras was an old man; but he enumerated his sentiments in <note type="footnote">1 As to the physical theories of the Pythagoreans, involved in their <lb/>
            systems of astronomy, the curious student, if desirous, may learn <lb/>
            much from the remarks of Alexander, and especially of Asclepius, upon <lb/>
            this section of the Metaphysics. Vide Brande's Scholia, p. 540 sqq. </note> <pb n="24"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I. </note> <lb/>
            a manner similar with the Pythagoreans. For he affirms that <lb/>
            the greater portion of things human may be reduced to two <lb/>
            classes, calling them contrarieties; not distinguished as these <lb/>
            had distinguished them, but such as were of any casual sort <lb/>
            whatever, as for example:- <lb/>
            White. Black. <lb/>
            Sweet. Bitter. <lb/>
            Good. Bad. <lb/>
            Small. Great. <lb/>
            This philosopher, indeed, then, has indefinitely thrown out his <lb/>
            opinions about the rest; but the Pythagoreans have declared <lb/>
            both how numerous, and which these contrarieties are.</p>
          <p>6. The reduc­ <lb/>
            tion of these <lb/>
            speculations to <lb/>
            a certain genus <lb/>
            of cause.</p>
          <p>From both of these, therefore, it is possible to <lb/>
            acquire thus much information,--that contraries <lb/>
            are first principles of entities; but how numerous, <lb/>
            and which these are, may be ascertained only <lb/>
            from other speculators. How, indeed, in respect of the causes <lb/>
            enumerated, it is possible to draw up a compendious appli­ <lb/>
            cation of their principles has not, in distinct terms, been <lb/>
            clearly declared by them; but they seem to arrange the <lb/>
            elements as in a form of matter: for of these, as inherent, they <lb/>
            say that the substance consists, and has been moulded.</p>
          <p>Of the ancients, therefore, indeed,-even of those who <lb/>
            assert the elements of Nature to be many,-it is sufficient <lb/>
            from these statements to examine into their intention.</p>
          <p>7. The theory <lb/>
            of the universe <lb/>
            a... one partly <lb/>
            irrelevant to <lb/>
            the present in­ <lb/>
            vestigation, and <lb/>
            partly not so.</p>
          <p>But there are some who have declared their <lb/>
            opinions about the universe as though it were <lb/>
            one Nature;' but all have not put forward their <lb/>
            theories in the same manner, either in regard <lb/>
            of that which is constituted in an orderly way, <lb/>
            or of that which is in accordance with the course of Nature. <lb/>
            With, indeed, then, the present investigation of causes does <lb/>
            this theory regarding them by no means adapt itself. For <lb/>
            they do not,-as some of the physiologers who supposed <lb/>
            entity to be one,-nevertheless, generate them from unity as <lb/>
            from matter; but these, who say that entity and unity are <lb/>
            the same, assert their production to take place after a dif­ <lb/>
            ferent manner; for those, indeed, have added motion, at <note type="footnote">1 Aristotle now enters upon a consideration of the Eleatic school, <lb/>

            least, in their generation of the universe; but these say that <lb/>
            it is immoval le.</p>
          <p>Of a truth, however, so far at least the theory of this <lb/>
            school is akin to our present investigation; for Parmenides, <lb/>
            indeed, appears to adopt a system of unity in accordance with <lb/>
            reason: whereas Melissus, a theory of it according to matter. <lb/>
            Wherefore, also, indeed, one says that the universe is finite, <lb/>
            and the other that it is infinite. Xenophanes, <lb/>
            first of these, however, having introduced this <lb/>
            The originator <lb/>
            of this system. <lb/>
            system of unity, (for Parmenides is said to have been his <lb/>
            pupil,) made nothing plain, neither did he seem to have appre­ <lb/>
            hended the nature of either of these; but looking wistfully <lb/>
            upon the whole heaven, he affirms that unity is God.</p>
          <p>These, indeed, therefore, as we have stated, <lb/>
            must be omitted in regard of our present investi­ <lb/>
            gation,1—two of them entirely,- even as being a <lb/>
            little too uncivilized; namely, Xenophanes and <lb/>

            theory of Par­ <lb/>
            menides bears <lb/>
            on the point in <lb/>
            question. <lb/>
            Melissus.2 Parmenides, however, appears to express himself, <lb/>
            in some passages, with more circumspection; for, with the <lb/>
            exception of entity-considering nonentity to have no ex­ <lb/>
            istence—he thinks entity to be necessarily one, and nothing <lb/>
            else. Concerning which philosopher, we have spoken with <lb/>
            more clearness in our Physics. Yet, compelled to follow the <lb/>
            phenomena, and supposing unity to subsist according to <lb/>
            reason, but plurality according to sense, he again lays down <lb/>
            two causes, and two first principles,—heat and cold; as, for <note type="footnote">1 If the student is anxious to have clear ideas as regards the bearing <lb/>
            of the Eleatic philosophy upon the inquiry undertaken by Aristotle, <lb/>
            and in respect of Aristotle's criticisms upon the systems of Parmenides <lb/>
            and Melissus, separately as well as compared with each other, he will <lb/>
            consult the commentary of Thomas Aquinas, who certainly, with vast <lb/>
            ability, strives to disentangle the intricacies of the exposition of the <lb/>
            Stagyrite. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Melissus flourished about B. c. 444 ; he was a native of Samoa, and <lb/>

            the early theo­ <lb/>
            ries of ætiology.</p>
          <p>From the statements, indeed, therefore, that <lb/>
            have been made, and from those who have already <lb/>
            devoted themselves to rational speculations, and <lb/>
            are wise men, we have derived these views; from the earliest <lb/>
            philosophers have we appropriated, indeed, both the corporeal <lb/>
            first principle, (for water and fire, and such like, are bodies,) and <lb/>
            from some of these one such, and from others many corporeal <lb/>
            principles; both, however, agreeing in classing them as forms <lb/>
            of matter. But from certain amongst these early speculators, <lb/>
            -who at the same time establish both this cause, and along <lb/>
            with this that of the origin of motion,—we have appropriated <lb/>
            even this very efficient cause; from some, indeed, as a single <lb/>
            principle, but from others, as one that is twofold. Up to the <lb/>
            period of the Italic sects,1 and independent of them, the rest <lb/>
            of the investigators have spoken with more moderation re­ <lb/>
            garding these first principles, except, as we have said, in the <lb/>
            case of those who happen to have employed two causes; and <lb/>
            one of these, the second cause-namely, the origin of motion­ <lb/>

            of the Pytha­ <lb/>
            goric system <lb/>
            on the present <lb/>
            inquiry.</p>
          <p>But the Pythagoreans, in the same manner, <lb/>
            have spoken of two first principles; but thus <lb/>
            much have they added,-which, also, is peculiar <lb/>
            to themselves,-namely, that they do not regard <lb/>
            the finite, and the infinite, and the one, to be certain if­ <lb/>
            ferent natures; as, for instance, fire, or earth, or any other <lb/>
            such thing: but that the infinite itself, and the one itself <lb/>
            constitute the substance of those things of which they are <lb/>
            predicated. Wherefore, also, they affirmed that number is <note type="footnote">1 The commentators on this passage-for example Alexander—contend <lb/>
            that the force of the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέχρι</foreign> is, that it is used by Aristotle to <lb/>
            denote those whose opinions may be classed exclusively of the Italics, <lb/>
            that is, of the Pythagoreans; for Pythagoras opened a school in Taren­ <lb/>

              the substance of all things. Respecting, then. these points <lb/>
              likewise, in this manner have they declared their opinions j <lb/>
              and respecting quiddity they began, indeed, to make asser. <lb/>
              tions and to frame definitions; but they treated of matters <lb/>
              with great simplicity. For they both framed their definitions <lb/>
              superficially, and in whatever first an alleged definition <lb/>
              should be inherent, this they considered to be the substance <lb/>
              of the thing; as if any one should think that twofold is the <lb/>
              same thing with the duad, since the twofold first is inherent <lb/>
              in the two; yet perhaps the being in what is twofold is not <lb/>
              the same thing as being in a duad; but if not, unity will be <lb/>
              plurality, which also was the result with them.</p>
          <p>From our predecessors, indeed, therefore, and from tho <lb/>
            rest, it is possible for us to acquire thus much information.</p>

          <p>AFTER the schools of philosophy enumerated, <lb/>
            supervenes the system of Plato;1 in most points <lb/>
            treading on the heels of these Pythagoreans: but <lb/>
            1. Plato’s ideal <lb/>
            theory, and the <lb/>
            source of its <lb/>
            adoption. <lb/>
            also having peculiar tenets of its own, differing from the phi­ <lb/>
            losophy of the Italics. For from a young man having at <lb/>
            the first been associated with Cratylus,2 and being conversant <lb/>
            with the opinions of Heraclitus,—that all sensible objects are <lb/>
            in a state of continual flux, and that scientific knowledge <lb/>
            concerning them had no existence,-he, indeed, subsequently <lb/>
            in this way came to entertain these suppositions. But while <note type="footnote">1 Plato was a native of Athens, being born there 430 years before <lb/>
            Christ. He belonged to the family of Solon. He was the great literary <lb/>
            opponent of Aristotle. Indeed from Aristotle we learn much about <lb/>
            the Platonic system. It has been dilated upon by many; but perhaps <lb/>
            more fully by Clemens Alexandrinus, in the first and second books of <lb/>
            the Stromata, than by any other writer. There is an Essay thereupon <lb/>
            by Sam. Parker, an author of the seventeenth century, and one by <lb/>
            Geddes, in the eighteenth. Far before these is Sleiermacher's In tro­ <lb/>
            duction to the Platonic Dialogues, who seems to have caught some of <lb/>
            the Platonic spirit. This last has been translated. </note> <note type="footnote">2 Of Cratylus little is known. According to Diogenes Laertius, after <lb/>
            the death of Socrates, Plato attached himself to Cratylus, a follower of <lb/>
            Heraclitus; this, however, does not harmonize with what is stated in <lb/>
            the text. </note> <pb n="28"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I. </note> <lb/>
            Socrates1 was engaged about the formation of systems of <lb/>
            Ethics, indeed, and that he broached no theory as regards <lb/>
            the entire of Nature, seeing that he was searching, doubtless, <lb/>
            in morals for the universal, and that he was the first to apply <lb/>
            his understanding to the subject of definitions, Plato, having <lb/>
            applauded him2 on account of this his investigation of uni­ <lb/>
            versals, was led to entertain thus much of his supposition,—as <lb/>
            that this took place in regard of other things, and not in <lb/>
            regard of certain of the objects that are cognisant by the <lb/>
            senses; for it is impossible, in his opinion, that there should <lb/>
            be a common definition of any of the sensible natures, seeing <lb/>
            that they are continually in a state of undergoing a change. <lb/>
            This philosopher, indeed, therefore, termed such things <lb/>
            amongst entities, ideas; and asserted that all things are styled <lb/>
            sensible according as they were different from these, or as <lb/>
            they subsisted in accordance with these: for his theory was <lb/>
            this,-that, according to participation, the most of things <lb/>
            synonymous are homonymous with the forms. Employing, <lb/>
            however, the import of the term participation, he changed <lb/>
            the name merely; for the Pythagoreans, indeed, affirm that <lb/>
            entities subsist by an imitation of numbers: but Plato, by <lb/>
            a participation of them, changing the name. At all events, as <lb/>
            to participation at least, or imitation, what it may be, in the <lb/>
            case of forms, they both in common omitted to investigate.</p>

            cerning mathe­ <lb/>
            matical sub­ <lb/>
            stances.</p>
          <p>But, moreover, besides sensibles and forms, he <lb/>
            affirms that mathematical entities are things of <lb/>
            an intermediate nature; differing, on the one hand, <lb/>
            from sensibles in being eternal and immovable; <note type="footnote"> 1 Socrates was born at Athens, B.C. 470, and gave such an impulse to <lb/>
            philosophy as to be the instrument of producing its subsequent forms <lb/>
            of development in Greece. His history being sufficiently well known, <lb/>
            does not require any remarks here. Much thereupon may be learned <lb/>
            by consulting the chapters of Grote which illustrate this period of <lb/>

            such are similar, but that every form itself constituted one <lb/>
            thing merely.</p>

            the elements of all these he supposed to be ele­ <lb/>

            with that of <lb/>
            Pythagoras. <lb/>
            by participation of unity, that the forms are numbers. That, <lb/>
            doubtless, unity at least is as substance, and that not any <lb/>
            other entity is denominated so, Plato affirmed, similarly <lb/>
            with the Pythagorics; and the dogma, that numbers are <lb/>
            causes to other things of their substance, he in like manner <lb/>
            asserted with them.</p>

            ference between <lb/>
            Pythagoras and <lb/>
            Plato. <lb/>
            was peculiar to him: and, moreover, Plato affirmed the <lb/>
            existence of numbers independent of sensibles; whereas the <lb/>
            Pythagoreans say that numbers constitute the things them­ <lb/>
            selves, and they do not set down mathematical entities as <lb/>
            intermediate between these.</p>
          <p>The principle of his having made unity, there­ <lb/>
            fore, and numbers, as different from things, and <lb/>
            Cause of this <lb/>
            difference. <lb/>
            not as the Pythagoreans, who regarded them the same, as well <lb/>
            as the introduction of forms, ensued on account of his logical1 <lb/>
            investigations; for his predecessors took no share in dia­ <lb/>
            lectical science. But the constituting a duad, as a different <lb/>
            nature from the one, arose from the fact that the numbers, <lb/>
            with the exception of those that are first, are suitably gene­ <lb/>
            rated from this as from a certain express image.</p>
          <p>And yet it happens in a contrary way; for it <lb/>
            would not be reasonable that it should take <lb/>
            The error of <lb/>
            Plato therein. <lb/>
            place thus: for, indeed, at present, from matter they make <lb/>
            many things, whereas form generates only once. And from <lb/>
            one matter there appears to be produced one table; but he <lb/>
            who introduces form, though being one, makes many tables. <note type="footnote">1 The logical system of Plato, which intertwines itself very closely <lb/>
            with his ethics, was held in admiration till supplanted by that of <lb/>
            Aristotle. Its outlines may be gathered from the Cratylus, the Parme- <lb/>

            In like manner, also, the male stands in relation to the female , <lb/>
            for the one is impregnated from a single copulation, whereas <lb/>
            the male impregnates many. These, however, are imitations <lb/>
            of those first principles. Plato, indeed, therefore, respecting <lb/>
            these objects of investigation, laid down distinctions in this <lb/>

          <p>But it is manifest, from the things that have <lb/>
            been stated, that Plato only employed two causes; <lb/>
            namely, both the formal cause and the material <lb/>
            cause: for, according to him, forms are the causes <lb/>
            of what anything is to the rest of the entities, and unity to <lb/>
            the forms; and that there is a certain cause which subsists <lb/>
            according to matter, which is that subject through which <lb/>
            the forms have a subsistence that are resident in sensibles, <lb/>
            and through which unity is said to be in the forms, because <lb/>
            the actual duad constitutes the great and the small. Further, <lb/>

            the several elements; which particular point we affirm certain <lb/>

            investigated more elaborately than the early speculators.</p>

          <p>CONCISELY, indeed, therefore, and by way of <lb/>
            summary,1 we have recounted both who they are <lb/>
            that have declared their opinions, and in what <lb/>
            manner they happen to have spoken concerning <lb/>
            both first principles and truth. Nevertheless, <lb/>
            however, we have received thus much information from them, <lb/>
            -that no one of those who have declared their sentiments, <lb/>
            concerning a first principle and a cause, has made any asser­ <lb/>
            tion beyond those definitions that have been set down in our <lb/>
            Physics; but notwithstanding that all of them have unfolded <lb/>
            their views with obscurity, indeed, yet in a manner they <lb/>
            appear as persons engaged in cursorily treating those four <lb/>
            causes enumerated above and elsewhere. <note type="footnote">I Aristotle again shows that the early speculators had not advanced <lb/>
            beyond the causes mentioned in the Physics; and that even their treat­ <lb/>

            sophers on the <lb/>
            material cause. <lb/>
            they consider it as body, and whether as a thing that is <lb/>
            incorporeal: as, for instance, Plato, indeed, in his mention of <lb/>
            the great and the small; and the Italics, in their theory of <lb/>
            the infinite; and Empedocles, in that of fire, and earth, and <lb/>
            water, and air; and Anaxagoras, in his system of the infinity <lb/>
            of homogeneous things. Now, truly, all these touched upon <lb/>
            a cause of this kind: and, further, as many as affirmed the <lb/>
            existence, as a first principle, of air, or fire, or water, or a <lb/>
            substance of greater density than fire, but of greater rarity <lb/>
            than air; for certain philosophers have also declared a thing <lb/>
            of this sort to be the first element. All these, indeed, there­ <lb/>
            fore, adopted this cause merely in a superficial way.</p>
          <p>But certain others introduce the second cause; <lb/>
            namely, the origin of the principle of motion: <lb/>
            as, for instance, as many as make a first principle <lb/>
            of harmony and discord, or mind or love. But <lb/>

            ries on the effi­ <lb/>

            the formal <lb/>

            of the essence1 and the substance- that is, of the formal <lb/>
            cause-not one, indeed, has rendered a clear account: most <lb/>
            especially do those make assertions respecting it who adopt <lb/>
            the hypothesis of forms, and the things inherent in forms; <lb/>
            for neither do they suppose that forms, and the things inhe­ <lb/>
            rent in forms, subsist as matter to sensibles; nor, as though <lb/>
            from thence were derived the principle of motion; (for, in <lb/>
            preference, they assert them to be causes of immobility, and <lb/>
            of things being in a state of rest;) but, in regard of the <lb/>
            essence, to each of the other things do forms supply this, <lb/>
            and unity imparts it to the forms.</p>
          <p>But the final cause of actions, and changes, <lb/>
            and motions, in a certain manner, they assert to <lb/>
            be a cause: yet in this way they do not assert it <lb/>
            to be a cause; nor do they speak of it. in a way <lb/>

            conformably to what it naturally is. For they, indeed, who <lb/>
            assign mind or harmony as such, have laid down these causes <lb/>
            as, doubtless, a something that is good ;2 they do not, however, <note type="footnote">1 Aristotle seems to think that the essence, or the formal cause, had <lb/>
            for its author Plato; and that Plato probably was indebted for his dis­ <lb/>
            covery to the philosophy of Pythagoras and Parmenides. </note><note type="footnote"> a As to viewing " the good" in the light of a final cause, we have</note> <pb n="32"/>

            entities either is in existence, or is being produced, but that, as <lb/>
            it were, from these the Emotions of these things were derived. <lb/>
            So, also, in like manner, they who say that either unity or <lb/>
            entity is such a nature of this kind, affirm it to be a cause <lb/>
            of substance, indeed; yet they do not, for a certainty, affirm <lb/>
            that anything either exists or is produced from this as a <lb/>
            final cause. Wherefore, it happens unto them, in a manner, <lb/>
            both to affirm, and not to affirm, that the good is a cause of <lb/>
            this sort; for they do not make the assertion absolutely, but <lb/>
            by accident.</p>

            division of <lb/>
            causes vindi­ <lb/>
            cated from the <lb/>
            foregoing.</p>
          <p>That, therefore, our distinctions have been laid <lb/>
            down correctly respecting causes, both as to how <lb/>
            numerous and what sort they are, do even all <lb/>
            these early philosophers appear to us to bear <lb/>
            witness, in not being able to fix upon any other cause. And, <lb/>
            in addition to the testimony of these speculators, it is evident <lb/>
            that first principles must be investigated, either all in this <lb/>
            way, or in some such mode as has been adopted by these <lb/>
            philosophers. Now, how each of these has declared his <lb/>
            opinions, and how the case stands, in regard of the possible <lb/>
            doubts respecting first principles, let us, after this, proceed to <lb/>
            pass through a review of such points.</p>

            First and <lb/>
            second.</p>
          <p>As many, indeed, therefore, as set down the <lb/>

            ruption, and drawing up, concerning all bodies in mature, <lb/>
            systems of physiology, they take away the cause of motion. <lb/>
            Further, the not positing also the substance as a cause of <lb/>
            anything, nor as such the formal principle, or the very essence <lb/>
            of a thing, this was erroneous.</p>
          <p>And, in addition to the foregoing, the assertion <lb/>
            that anything whatsoever might readily be a <lb/>
            first principle of simple bodies, except earth, <lb/>
            2. Third error <lb/>
            in the early <lb/>
            theories of aeti­ <lb/>
            ology. <lb/>
            but at the same time not examining into their mode of gene­ <lb/>
            ration one from another, how they are produced,-now <lb/>
            I mean fire and water, and earth and air, for partly by <lb/>
            concretion, and partly by separation, are things produced <lb/>
            from one another,—this was an error of theirs. But this, in <lb/>
            regard of the being prior and posterior, will involve the <lb/>
            greatest difference; for, indeed, earth would appear to be <lb/>
            a thing most elementary of all, from which, as a first prin­ <lb/>
            ciple, elements are produced by concretion: but a thing of <lb/>
            this kind would be most minute in its parts, and a thing <lb/>
            most refined amongst bodies. Wherefore, as many as esta­ <lb/>
            blish fire as a first principle would make assertions particularly <lb/>
            in consonance with this theory. But each philosopher also <lb/>
            acknowledges something of this sort to be an element of <lb/>
            other things,—I mean an element of bodies.</p>
          <p>No one, at least of subsequent speculators, <lb/>
            even of those who assert the universe to be one, <lb/>
            has thought fit to maintain earth to be an ele­ <lb/>

            system of a <lb/>
            single material <lb/>
            cause. <lb/>
            component particles, but each of the three elements has <lb/>
            obtained a certain umpire; for, indeed, some assert fire to be <lb/>
            this, but others, water, and some, air. Although why, pray, <lb/>
            do they not assert this of earth, as the majority of men do? <lb/>
            for they say that earth constitutes all things. But Hesiod, <lb/>
            also, says that earth was the first produced amongst bodies: <lb/>
            thus it has happened that the supposition is an ancient and <lb/>
            vulgar one. According, indeed, therefore, to this account, If <lb/>
            one affirms to be this either any one thing belonging to <lb/>
            these save fire, or if one lays down, as such, a thing denser <lb/>
            than air, indeed, but more refined than water, be would not <lb/>
            make such an assertion as this correctly. But if that which <lb/>
            is subsequent in generation be prior in Nature, and if that <lb/>
            which has been digested and compounded together be a thing <note type="footnote">D </note> <pb n="34"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I. </note> <lb/>
            that is subsequent in its production, there would take place <lb/>
            that which is the contrary of these,-water, for instance, <lb/>
            would be a thing prior to air, and earth, to water. With <lb/>
            regard to those who are for establishing one such cause as we <lb/>
            have declared, let these remarks be sufficient.</p>
          <p>4. Threefold <lb/>
            argument <lb/>
            against Empe­ <lb/>
            docles in his <lb/>
            theory of a plu­ <lb/>
            rality of mate­ <lb/>
            rial causes.</p>
          <p>But the same assertion may be made even if <lb/>
            any one posites these corporeal principles as being <lb/>
            many in number; as, for example, Empedocles, <lb/>
            who says that four bodies, elementarily, consti­ <lb/>
            tute matter. For, likewise, to this philosopher <lb/>
            partly, indeed, the same consequences, but partly those that <lb/>
            are peculiar to his own system, must needs happen. For, <lb/>
            also, we see, in the case of things that are being produced <lb/>
            one from another, that the fire and earth do not always con­ <lb/>
            tinue as of the same body. But we have spoken on these <lb/>
            subjects in our Physics. And respecting the cause of things <lb/>
            that are being moved, whether we must assign one or two <lb/>
            such, we should be inclined to think that we have not ex­ <lb/>
            pressed ourselves either correctly or altogether irrationally. <lb/>
            And, in short, must the principle of alteration be overturned <lb/>
            by those who make assertions in this way; for not from heat <lb/>
            will arise cold, nor from cold, heat. For what change the <lb/>
            contraries themselves would undergo, and what would be the <lb/>
            one nature which should become fire and water, that very <lb/>
            philosopher (I mean Empedocles) does not declare.</p>
          <p>5. The system <lb/>
            of Anaxagoras <lb/>
            examined: <lb/>
            shown to be <lb/>
            partly right <lb/>
            and partly <lb/>
            wrong.</p>
          <p>But if any one should suppose that Anaxa­ <lb/>
            goras mentions two elements, he would form his <lb/>
            opinion most especially in accordance with a <lb/>
            theory which, although that philosopher himself <lb/>
            did not enunciate distinctly, yet, indeed, would, as <lb/>
            a necessary consequence, follow in the footsteps of those who <lb/>
            introduced this dogma. For, otherwise, would even the <lb/>
            assertion be absurd,-that all things from the beginning have <lb/>
            been in a state of mixture; both on account of its happening <lb/>
            that all things prior to this should pre-exist in an unmixed <lb/>
            state, and on account of its not being consonant to Nature, <lb/>
            that anything at random should be mingled with anything at <lb/>
            random too; and, in addition to these reasons, we may add, <lb/>
            that, according to this doctrine, their passive states and acci­ <lb/>
            dents would be separated from substances, (for to the same <lb/>
            things belong mixture and separation.) If any one, how- <pb n="35"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            ever, follows up the subject, arranging into clauses together <lb/>
            those statements which he wishes to make, he would, in all <lb/>
            probability, utter assertions that would assume an air of <lb/>
            novelty. For when there was nothing in existence that has <lb/>
            been separated, it is obvious that no true assertion could be <lb/>
            put forward in regard of that substance; now, I say, for <lb/>
            instance, that it would not necessarily be a thing either <lb/>
            white, or black, or darkish, or any other colour, but a thing <lb/>
            necessarily colourless, for otherwise it would possess some <lb/>
            one of these colours. In like manner would it be with that <lb/>
            which is insipid, according to this same mode of reasoning: <lb/>
            nor could it be so with anything else of those things that are <lb/>
            similar; for neither is it possible that it could possess any <lb/>
            actual thing of a certain quality or quantity, or that any­ <lb/>
            thing else be so. For therein would be inherent something <lb/>
            of those termed partial forms; yet this is impossible when <lb/>
            all things have been in his system mingled together, for <lb/>
            already it would subsist in a state of separation: but, with <lb/>
            the exception of mind, he affirms all things to be mingled, <lb/>
            and that mind only is unmixed and pure. Now, from these <lb/>
            statements it is consequential with him that he should de­ <lb/>
            nominate, as the first principles, both unity (for this is simple <lb/>
            and unmixed) and another thing, as if it were an entity such <lb/>
            as we are for establishing—viz., the indefinite prior to its <lb/>
            having been defined, and to partaking of a certain form. <lb/>
            Therefore, the assertion is made neither correctly nor clearly, <lb/>
            notwithstanding that he intends something similar with both <lb/>
            those who subsequently make statements to this effect, and <lb/>
            more in harmony with the present phenomena. For these. <lb/>
            however, happen only to be familiar with the theories apper­ <lb/>
            taining to generation, and corruption, and motion for, also, <lb/>
            with regard to such a substance, they investigate almost only <lb/>
            both the first principles and the causes.</p>
          <p>But as many1 as frame their speculation re­ <lb/>
            specting all entities, but of entities have set <lb/>
            down some, indeed, as being cognisant by sense, <lb/>

            the suprana­ <lb/>
            turalists. <lb/>
            and others as not being sensibles, it is manifest that they <lb/>
            institute for themselves an inquiry concerning both kinds. <note type="footnote">1 Aristotle having considered the system of the naturalists in the <lb/>
            previous section, now proceeds to examine that of the supranaturalists <lb/>
            such as Pythagoras and Plato. </note><note type="footnote">D 2 </note> <pb n="36"/>

            Wherefore, one might be induced, in preference, to linger <lb/>
            upon an investigation respecting these, as to what they say, <lb/>
            well or not well, in regard of the examination of those specu­ <lb/>
            lations now proposed by us.</p>
          <p>7. Pythagoras, <lb/>
            his agreement <lb/>
            and difference <lb/>
            with the mate­ <lb/>
            rialists.</p>
          <p>Those, indeed, called Pythagoreans1 in a far <lb/>
            more outlandish manner employ their first prin­ <lb/>
            ciples and elements than the physiologists. But <lb/>
            the cause is, because they have not derived them <lb/>
            from sensibles; for those natures that are mathematical <lb/>
            amongst entities are without motion, except those pertaining <lb/>
            to astrology. They, however, discuss and treat of all points <lb/>
            concerning Nature; for they both generate the heaven, and <lb/>
            respecting the parts thereof, and the passive conditions and <lb/>
            the operations thereof, they closely observe that which takes <lb/>
            place; and upon these they lavish their first principles and <lb/>
            causes, as if acknowledging to the rest of the natural philo­ <lb/>
            sophers that whatsoever thing is such as is cognisant by the <lb/>
            senses, that this constitutes entity, and such as that which is <lb/>
            called heaven comprises. But the causes and the first prin­ <lb/>
            ciples—as we have said-they affirm are sufficient both to <lb/>
            secure a transition even to a higher order of entities, and <lb/>
            that they are more sufficient than those that are in harmony <lb/>
            with physical theories.</p>
          <p>8. Two objec­ <lb/>
            tions against <lb/>
            the Pythagoric <lb/>
            philosophy.</p>
          <p>From what mode, however, there will be <lb/>
            motion, merely on the supposition of the ex­ <lb/>
            istence of the subjects of finite and infinite, and <lb/>
            odd and even, they in no wise declare; or how <lb/>
            it may be possible, without motion and change, that there <lb/>
            should be generation and corruption, or the operations of <lb/>
            those bodies that are whirled along the heaven.</p>
          <p>But further, whether one grants to them that from these <lb/>
            results magnitude, or whether this should require to be <lb/>
            demonstrated, nevertheless, in a certain manner, some bodies <lb/>
            will be light, indeed, and some involving weight; for the <lb/>
            things from which they adopt for themselves their theories, <lb/>
            and make assertions, they in no respect affirm in regard of <lb/>
            sensibles in preference to mathematical bodies. Therefore, <lb/>
            concerning fire or earth, or the other bodies of such a kind. <note type="footnote">I As to the agreement and difference of the Pythagoric philosophy <lb/>
            with the materialistic system, consult the Commentary of Thornas <lb/>
            Aquinas upon this section. </note> <pb n="37"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. IX.] </note> <lb/>
            they have declared nothing whatsoever, inasmuch as affirming, <lb/>
            in my opinion, nothing that is peculiar to them concerning <lb/>
            sensible natures.</p>
          <p>But further, how must we receive as causes the <lb/>
            passive conditions of number, and the number <lb/>
            itself as the cause of entities which subsist in <lb/>
            the heaven, and of things that are being pro- <lb/>
            9. A third ob­ <lb/>
            jection against <lb/>
            Pythagoras, <lb/>
            suggested from <lb/>
            Plato. <lb/>
            duced there both from the beginning and at present, and at <lb/>
            the same time allow that there is no other number save this <lb/>
            number from which the order of the universe consists? For <lb/>
            since, indeed, in this portion of the creation (according to <lb/>
            these philosophers) there may be in existence opinion and <lb/>
            opportunity, but a little above, or a little below, injustice and <lb/>
            separation, or mixture; and since they may adduce a demon­ <lb/>
            stration that each one of these is number, and it happens, <lb/>
            from this mode of reasoning in this place, that there subsists <lb/>
            already a multitude of constituted magnitudes, from the fact <lb/>
            of these affections following each of these places respectively, <lb/>
            on the supposition of the foregoing we may ask whether, <lb/>
            therefore, is this owing to the same number as that which is <lb/>
            in the heaven, and which we ought to receive because that <lb/>
            each of these exists, or, besides this, is there another number? <lb/>
            For Plato says, indeed, that there is a different number: he, <lb/>
            however, also thinks both these, and the causes of these, to <lb/>
            be numbers, but numbers that are, indeed, intelligible causes; <lb/>
            whereas those are merely sensible, according to Plato. Re­ <lb/>
            specting then, indeed, the Pythagoreans,l let us leave off our <lb/>
            present discussions; for it is sufficient thus far to have touched <lb/>
            upon their system.</p>

            vocates in an <lb/>
            inconsistency. <lb/>
            causes of these entities, in the first place have <lb/>
            adduced other things equal in number to these; 1 <lb/>
            as if one, desiring to have reckoned certain things, when <lb/>
            these were less numerous, would consider this impossible, <lb/>
            but, by creating a greater number, should succeed in counting <lb/>
            them; for almost equal, or not less numerous, are the forms <lb/>
            than those things respecting which, in investigating their <lb/>
            causes, they have advanced from these to those: for, according <lb/>
            to each individual thing, there is a certain homonymous form, <lb/>
            and, in addition to the substances, also, of other things, there <lb/>
            is the unity involved in the notion of plurality, both in the <lb/>
            case of these and of things that are eternal.</p>
          <p>2. Aristotle's <lb/>
            three objections <lb/>
            against the Pla­ <lb/>
            tonic theory of <lb/>
            ideas.</p>
          <p>Moreover,2 in the ways in which it is demon­ <lb/>
            strated that there are forms, according to none <lb/>
            of these doth the subsistence of forms become <lb/>
            apparent; for, indeed, from some there is no <lb/>
            necessity, in the sequence of the reasoning, that a syllo­ <lb/>
            gism arise: but from other things, also,-not of such as we <lb/>
            should expect to find forms,-of these are there forms gene­ <lb/>
            rated. For according to the rational principles deducible <lb/>
            from the sciences will there be forms of all things, of as many <lb/>
            as there are sciences; and in accordance with the argument <lb/>
            for ideas founded on the notion of unity involved in plurality, <lb/>
            will there also be forms or ideas of negations: and according <lb/>
            to the ability to understand something of what has been <lb/>
            destroyed of things liable to decay will there also be forms, <lb/>
            for of these there is a certain phantasm.</p>
          <p>But further, as regards the most accurate of the argu­ <lb/>
            ments for the ideal theory, some of them, indeed, frame ideas <lb/>
            of things relative, of which they do not say that there is <lb/>
            an essential genus, whereas others speak of there being a <lb/>
            third man. <note type="footnote">1 Aristotle first complains of the inconsistency of Plato; for he con­ <lb/>
            tends that, in proposing to assign the causes of sensibles, he should <lb/>
            have kept the phenomena of sensibles before his eyes, and not have <lb/>
            devised, as he has done, a theory applicable to anything else save <lb/>
            sensibles. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Aristotle here details his objections against the ideal system of <lb/>
            Plato, which he strives to overthrow by turning the reasoning of k'late <lb/>

            and somewhat similar attack of his upon the idea theory, in book XIL <lb/>

             </p>
          <p><note type="margin">CH. IX.] </note> And, upon the whole, the theories respecting <lb/>
            forms overturn the things which they who affirm <lb/>
            the existence of forms would wish should have <lb/>
            a subsistence in preference to the subsistence of <lb/>
            3. Further ab­ <lb/>
            surdities in­ <lb/>
            volved in the <lb/>
            Platonic theory <lb/>
            of ideas. <lb/>
            the ideas; for it happens that the duad is not the first, but <lb/>
            that the number is, and that the relative is, before the essen­ <lb/>
            tial : and all those consequences ensue, as many as certain, <lb/>
            who have followed up the opinions respecting forms-have <lb/>
            set in contrariety to first principles. Further, also, according <lb/>
            to the supposition in virtue of which we speak of the ex­ <lb/>
            istence of the ideas, not only will there be forms of sub­ <lb/>
            stances, but of many other things also; for, also, there is the <lb/>
            one conception not only respecting substances, but also in <lb/>
            the case of other substances; and there are sciences not only <lb/>
            of substance, but of different things also, and innumerable <lb/>
            other things of this sort occur: but according to neces­ <lb/>
            sity, and the opinions respecting forms, it follows, on the <lb/>
            supposition that forms are things capable of participation, <lb/>
            that there should be ideas of substances only; for not ac­ <lb/>
            cording to accident are they participated in, but things <lb/>
            must participate in this respect in each idea, so far forth <lb/>
            as each idea is not predicated about the subject. Now, <lb/>
            I mean, for example, that if anything participates in <lb/>
            the twofold itself, this also is a participant in what is <lb/>
            eternal, but according to accident, for it is accidental for <lb/>
            the twofold to be eternal Therefore, the forms will be <lb/>
            substance.</p>
          <p>For the same things, both here and there, signify sub­ <lb/>
            stance; or what will be the meaning of the assertion of the <lb/>
            existence of a something that is independent of sensibles, <lb/>
            drawn from the argument founded on unity, involved in the. <lb/>
            notion of plurality; and if there be the same form of the ideas, <lb/>
            and of things that are participants of them, there will be <lb/>
            something in common ? for, by no means, in the case of <lb/>
            perishable duads-and, indeed, most duads, but such as are <lb/>
            eternal-is the duad said to be rather one and the same, <lb/>
            than in the case of this and one of some particular thing. <lb/>
            But if there be not the same form there would be an homo­ <lb/>
            nymy; and it will be just like as if one should call both <lb/>
            Callias and a piece of wood a man, discerning no community <lb/>
            whatever between them.</p><pb n="40"/>

            as to what at all1 the forms contribute, either to <lb/>
            those things that are eternal amongst sensibles, <lb/>
            or to things that are being produced and being <lb/>
            corrupted. For neither are they to them a cause <lb/>
            of any motion or change whatever. But, truly, neither are <lb/>
            they of any assistance towards the science of other things <lb/>
            (for neither are those the substance of these, for in such a <lb/>
            case they would be in these), nor do they contribute towards <lb/>
            the existence of other things, inasmuch as they are not in­ <lb/>
            herent in things that are their participants, at least; for so, <lb/>
            indeed, they would perhaps be supposed as causes, just as if <lb/>
            the white were mixed with the white it might be called the <lb/>
            cause of a white body. But, indeed, this theory is very easily <lb/>
            overthrown, which Anaxagoras, indeed, first, and Eudoxus <lb/>
            subsequently, and certain others, advanced; for it would be <lb/>
            easy to collect together, also, many impossibilities in reference <lb/>
            to such an opinion: but, truly, neither do other things sub­ <lb/>
            sist from forms in accordance with any mode of existence of <lb/>
            those that are wont to be mentioned.</p>
          <p>2. Three proofs <lb/>
            that forms are <lb/>
            not paradigms, <lb/>
            or models of <lb/>
            created things.</p>
          <p>But the assertion that these forms are exem­ <lb/>
            plars, and that the rest of entities participate in <lb/>
            them, is to speak vain words, and to utter poetic <lb/>
            metaphors. For in what respect, may I ask <lb/>
            does that which operates look towards the ideas as a model ? <lb/>
            for it is possible that anything whatever that is similar both <lb/>
            should exist and be produced, and yet that it be not made <lb/>
            like in reference to that to which it is similar. Wherefore, <lb/>
            also, on the supposition of the existence and non-existence of <lb/>
            Socrates, just such another one as Socrates is would be pro­ <lb/>
            duced. And, in like manner, is it evident that this would <lb/>
            follow, even though Socrates were eternal; and, besides, <lb/>
            there will be many exemplars of the same thing; wherefore, <lb/>
            also, the forms-for instance, of man, such as animal and <lb/>
            biped, and at the sams time, also, ideal man — will have a <lb/>
            subsistence. Further, not only of things sensible are forms <lb/>
            the exemplars, but also of forms themselves; as, for ex­ <lb/>

            wherefore, an exemplar and an image will be the same <lb/>
            thing.</p>
          <p>Further, it would seem impossible for the sub­ <lb/>
            stance to be separate from that of which it is <lb/>
            the substance; therefore, in what way can the <lb/>
            3. Forms can­ <lb/>
            not subsist se­ <lb/>
            parately from <lb/>
            things. <lb/>
            ideas, when they are substances of things, exist separately <lb/>
            from them?</p>
          <p>But in the Pheedo an assertion is made to this effect,-that <lb/>
            the forms are causes of existence and of production. On the <lb/>
            supposition, however, of the existence of forms, nevertheless, <lb/>
            those things that are participants will not be produced, if <lb/>
            there be not in existence that which is likely to be the origin <lb/>
            of motion; and many other things are produced, such as <lb/>
            a house and a ring, of which we do not say that there are <lb/>
            forms. Wherefore, it is evident that it is possible, also, for <lb/>
            other things both to exist and be produced from such causes, <lb/>
            likewise, on account of which, also, arise those entities men­ <lb/>
            tioned just now.</p>
          <p>§ 2. Moreover, if forms are numbers,1 how will <lb/>
            they be causes? whether is it because entities <lb/>
            are different numbers,-as, for instance, this par­ <lb/>
            ticular man is this particular number, indeed, <lb/>
            1. Six reasons <lb/>
            against Plato's <lb/>
            theory of forms <lb/>
            as numbers; — <lb/>
            first reason. <lb/>
            and Socrates another, and Callias another, different from <lb/>
            both,-in what respect are those, therefore, the causes of <lb/>
            these? for neither will it make any difference whether those <lb/>
            may be eternal, and these not so. But if it is because the <lb/>
            things here are proportions or ratios of numbers, - as, for <lb/>
            instance, a symphony,-it is obvious that there will be a <lb/>
            certain one thing, at least, amongst those of which there are <lb/>
            ratios or proportions. Now, if this is one thing--say matter <lb/>
            -it is palpable that the actual numbers, also, will be certain <lb/>
            proportions of one thing with another; but I say, for example, <lb/>
            if Callias is a proportion in numbers of fire, and earth, and <lb/>
            water, and air, to certain other subjects will belong the same <lb/>
            man likewise; and if the idea constitute a number, the ideal <note type="footnote">1 Aristotle still continues his attack upon the Platonic philosophy; <lb/>
            as yet confining himself to Plato's theory concerning the substances of <lb/>
            things, to the exclusion of that concerning the principles of things, <lb/>
            which he considers in the next section. At present he confines his <lb/>
            censures to Plato's assertion of ideas being numbers, and to his ether <lb/>
            theories respecting mathematical magnitudes. </note> <pb n="42"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I.</note> <lb/>
            many also,-whether the idea may be a certain number or <lb/>
            not,—nevertheless, will be a ratio in numbers of certain things <lb/>
            without being himself a number; nor will there be a certain <lb/>
            particular number on account of these things.</p>
          <p>2. Second rea­ <lb/>
            son, and an ob­ <lb/>
            jection thereto <lb/>
            answered.</p>
          <p>Further, out of many numbers one number <lb/>
            results; but from forms how is one form pro­ <lb/>
            duced? And if forms are not produced from <lb/>
            forms, but from the units that are in numbers­ <lb/>
            as, for instance, in the myriad-how is it with the subsistence <lb/>
            of the monads? for if they are of the same species, many <lb/>
            absurdities will ensue; but if they are not of the same spe­ <lb/>
            cies, neither will they be the same with one another, nor all <lb/>
            the rest the same with all: for wherein will they differ, since <lb/>
            they are impassive? for such statements as these are neither <lb/>
            rational nor consonant with the understanding. And, more­ <lb/>
            over, it is necessary to establish a certain other description <lb/>
            of number, regarding which arithmetic is conversant, and <lb/>
            all such things as are termed media by some; and how, or <lb/>
            from what principles, will these arise? or why will they be <lb/>
            media between the things here and these?</p>
          <p>3. Remaining <lb/>
            reasons.</p>
          <p>Further, the monads which are in each duad <lb/>
            are from some prior duad, although such is im­ <lb/>
            possible. Further, why is there an aggregated number, as <lb/>
            one thing? and further, in addition to the things that have <lb/>
            been stated, if the monads are different, they ought to declare <lb/>
            their opinions in this same way as those do, even as. many as <lb/>
            affirm the elements to be fourfold or twofold; for, also, each <lb/>
            one of these mentions not what is common as an element-­ <lb/>
            for example, body-but fire and earth, whether body is any <lb/>
            thing that is common or not. But now, an assertion is made <lb/>
            just as if the one were in existence as homogeneous fire or <lb/>
            water; but if this be the case, numbers will not be sub­ <lb/>
            stances ; it is, however, evident, that if unity itself be anything, <lb/>
            and if this be a first principle, that unity is expressed in <lb/>
            many ways, for that it should be otherwise is impossible.</p>
          <p>4. Two objec­ <lb/>
            tions against a <lb/>
            Platonic opi­ <lb/>
            nion respecting <lb/>
            mathematical <lb/>
            substances.</p>
          <p>But they who wish to refer substances to first <lb/>
            principles set down lengths, indeed, as consisting <lb/>
            from the long and the short, from something <lb/>
            small and large, and a superficies as from what <lb/>
            is broad and narrow, and a body from what is <lb/>
            deep and low. In what way, however, will the superficies <pb n="43"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. IX.] <lb/>
            </note>involve a line, or the solid a line and surface, for the wide <lb/>
            and the narrow are a different genus from deep and low? As, <lb/>
            therefore, neither number is inherent in these, because the <lb/>
            much and the few are different from these, so it is manifest <lb/>
            that neither will anything else of those superior natures be <lb/>
            inherent in those that are inferior. But, truly, neither is <lb/>
            the wide a genus of the deep; for body would be a certain <lb/>
            surface in this case. Further, may I ask from what will <lb/>
            points be compounded? This genus, indeed, then, did Plato <lb/>
            also oppose, as being a geometric dogma; but he used to call <lb/>
            it the first principle of a line: and this he often set down, <lb/>
            (I mean the existence of indivisible lines,) although of neces­ <lb/>
            sity there must be some limit to these; wherefore, from <lb/>
            whatever principle a line is, therefrom also is a point.</p>
          <p>§ 3. And upon the whole, 1 seeing that wisdom <lb/>
            Investigates into the cause, in respect of things <lb/>
            that are -manifest, this consideration, indeed, <lb/>
            have we omitted; for we say nothing regarding <lb/>
            1. Plato's <lb/>
            theory of first <lb/>
            principles re­ <lb/>
            futed in six <lb/>
            ways. <lb/>
            the cause of the origin of the principle of change: but, <lb/>
            thinking to mention the substance of these, we say that there <lb/>
            are different substances; but in what manner those may be <lb/>
            substances of these we ineffectually describe, for as to such <lb/>
            being accomplished by participation—as also we have stated <lb/>
            on a former occasion-there is no advantage gained in saying <lb/>
            this. Neither, truly, are ideas such causes as we see to be <lb/>
            a cause to the sciences, on account of which both every mind <lb/>
            and every nature operate; nor that cause which we affirm to <lb/>
            be one of the first principles do forms in anywise touch upon; <lb/>
            but to men, in the present age, mathematics have become the <lb/>
            philosophy; although they say that persons ought to culti­ <lb/>
            vate these sciences for the sake of other sciences.</p>
          <p>But, further, one may suppose the subject-substance to be <lb/>
            as matter that is more mathematical, and rather to be con­ <lb/>
            verted into a predicable, and to constitute a difference of <lb/>
            substance and of matter,-as, for instance, the great and the <lb/>
            small,-just as, also, the natural philosophers mention the rare <lb/>
            and the dense, saying that there are these primary differences <lb/>
            of the subject, for these are a certain excess and defect. <note type="footnote">1 Aristotle now proceeds to argue against Plato in his theory con. <lb/>
            cerning the first principles of things: first, "quoad principia essendi;2 <lb/>
            and secondly, " quoad principia cognoascendi. " </note> <pb n="44"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I. </note> <lb/>
            And respecting motion, if, indeed, these will constitute <lb/>
            motion, it is evident that the forms will be moved; but if <lb/>
            they are not, whence has motion originated? for thereby the <lb/>
            entire investigation about Nature has been abolished.</p>
          <p>And what seems to be easy-namely, the demonstration <lb/>
            that all things are one-does not tarn out to be so; for. <lb/>
            according to the interpretation, all things io not become one, <lb/>
            but a certain thing itself is one, if any one would grant that <lb/>
            all things are so: and neither would he allow this, unless <lb/>
            one would admit the existence of a universal as a genus; but <lb/>
            this, in some cases, is impossible.</p>
          <p>But neither have those things that are after the numbers <lb/>
            any grounds in reason,-namely, both lengths, and surfaces, <lb/>
            and solids; nor is it so in regard of the mode of how they <lb/>
            are, or shall be, or whether they involve any capacity; for <lb/>
            these cannot possibly be either forms (for numbers they are <lb/>
            not), or media (for those are mathematical), or things that <lb/>
            are corruptible: but these, again, appear as this certain other <lb/>
            fourth genus different from those other three.</p>
          <p>But, upon the whole, the investigation of the elements of <lb/>
            entities, seeing that they are expressed multifariously, it is <lb/>
            impossible for any persons to discover a solution of who have <lb/>
            not divided them; and, especially, if they investigate in this <lb/>
            manner from what sort of elements they are compounded. <lb/>
            For action, or passion, or the wide, it is not, doubtless, possible <lb/>
            to receive from some things of which these consist; but, if <lb/>
            this were the case, it would be possible to receive them as <lb/>
            subsisting from substances only. Wherefore, either to investi­ <lb/>
            gate or to think that you possess the elements of all entities <lb/>
            is not true.</p>
          <p>2. Plato's <lb/>
            theory of ideas <lb/>
            as the first <lb/>
            principlesofthe <lb/>
            sciences: four <lb/>
            reasons against <lb/>
            it.</p>
          <p>But how can any one learn the elements of all <lb/>
            things? for it is evident that it is not possible <lb/>
            that he should be previously a person having <lb/>
            prior knowledge thereof. For, as to one learning <lb/>
            geometry, it is, indeed, possible to see beforehand <lb/>
            other things; but of such things as the science consists of, and <lb/>
            concerning which he is about to receive instruction, he can <lb/>
            have no prior knowledge, so, also, is it in the case of other <lb/>
            things. Wherefore, if there is a certain science of all things, <lb/>
            as some affirm, nothing could this person know beforehand. <lb/>
            Every system of learning, however, subsists, or is attainable <pb n="45"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. IX.] <lb/>
            </note>by means of previous knowledge, either of all things, or of <lb/>
            certain particular things: and either by demonstration is this <lb/>
            accomplished, or by definitions; for those things whereof the <lb/>
            definition consists it is requisite to understand beforehand, <lb/>
            and that they be known. In like manner is it the case with <lb/>
            knowledge by induction. But, truly, if also it happens that <lb/>
            there is in our possession a congenital knowledge of things, <lb/>
            it is astonishing how we, in possession of the most excellent <lb/>
            of the sciences, are unconscious of such a treasure.</p>
          <p>Further, how will any one know from what particulars all <lb/>
            things consist, and how will this be manifest? for this also <lb/>
            involves perplexity; for one would feel a doubt, just AS also <lb/>
            concerning some syllable: for certain affirm that SMA is <lb/>
            composed of S and M and A, but others say that it possesses <lb/>
            a different sound from its components, and none of those <lb/>
            that are known.</p>
          <p>Moreover, those things of which there is perception by <lb/>
            sense, how could any one know if he were not furnished with <lb/>
            the capacity of perceiving by sense? although one ought, if <lb/>
            these are the elements of all things whereof they consist <lb/>
            just as the compound sounds arise from their own proper <lb/>
            elements.</p>
          <p>That, therefore, all seem1 to seek the causes <lb/>
            mentioned in our Physics, and, besides these, <lb/>
            that we have no other to adduce, is likewise from <lb/>
            the foregoing statements evident. But the early <lb/>
            3.Aristotle's ca­ <lb/>
            tegory of causes <lb/>
            again defended <lb/>
            by a reference <lb/>
            to antiquity. <lb/>
            philosophers, I admit, have treated of these causes,—ob­ <lb/>
            scurely, however; and, indeed, in a certain manner, all <lb/>
            such four causes have been enumerated by speculators of <lb/>
            an age prior to ours: and, in a certain manner, by no means <lb/>
            has this been the case; for the earliest system of philosophy2 <lb/>
            concerning all things was like unto one articulating with <note type="footnote">I In the French edition of Aristotle's works, published by Didot, <lb/>
            there is another chapter, namely chapter X, made to commence at <lb/>
            these words. </note><note type="footnote"> 2I have ventured to differ from Taylor in his translation of this <lb/>
            passage, on the authority of the old Latin versions, which, I admit, in <lb/>
            the case of Aristotle's works, is not a very firm foundation to build <lb/>
            upon. Taylor's translation, however, I conceive to be unsupported by <lb/>
            the Greek in Bokker's text. He regards the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποώτη φιλυσοφία</foreign> in <lb/>

            a stammer, inasmuch as it was new as regards first principles, <lb/>
            and a thing the first in its kind. For Empedocles says that <lb/>
            a bone exists from form by the principle of composition; but <lb/>
            this is the essence and the substance of that thing. But, <lb/>
            truly, if this be admitted, in like manner, also, is it necessary <lb/>
            that of both flesh, and everything else of the other things, <lb/>
            there should subsist this principle of concretion, or that it <lb/>
            should not subsist as a principle of anything at all; for on <lb/>
            account of this are both flesh and bone, and each of the <lb/>
            other things, in existence, and not on account of the matter, <lb/>
            which he says is fire, and earth, and water, and air. But, <lb/>
            also, with any other, indeed, who would make these assertions, <lb/>
            he would of necessity concur; but he has not expressed him­ <lb/>
            self with clearness respecting them. The case regarding such <lb/>
            points, therefore, has been made evident on a former occa­ <lb/>
            sion; but as many doubts as any one might indulge in <lb/>
            respecting these same, we will a second time enumerate; for <lb/>
            perhaps we shall thereby acquire a facility for having our <lb/>
            difficulties resolved in reference to subsequent questions on <lb/>
            doubt.</p><pb n="47"/>

          <p>SPECULATION respecting truth is partly difficult <lb/>
            and partly easy. And a proof is the following, <lb/>
            that, in the pursuit of truth, neither is any one <lb/>
            I. Speculative <lb/>
            pursuit of truth <lb/>
            partly easy. <lb/>
            philosopher, in a way worthy of the dignity of the subject, <lb/>
            able to attain this; nor can all investigators fail in reaching <lb/>
            it, but that each says something to the point concerning <lb/>
            Nature : and individually that, indeed, they add nothing <lb/>
            or but little, to this speculation respecting truth, but fron <lb/>
            allthese collected together that there ensues something on <lb/>
            magnitude. Wherefore, if, indeed, it so seems to be the case, <lb/>
            as we happen to say in the proverb, " Who will miss the <lb/>
            door1" in this way, truly, would the speculation of truth be <lb/>
            easy. <note type="footnote">1This book, as to the title of which all are not agreed, has given <lb/>
            rise to some discussion amongst the commentators. Alexander Aphro­ <lb/>
            disiensis and Asclepius seem to think that it is, as set down in the <lb/>
            Metaphysics, quite out of place; and Augustine Niphus appears to <lb/>
            regard it as a fragment of some larger work,—"propter exiguitatem." <lb/>
            That it is out of place here has been inferred from the fact of the conclu­ <lb/>
            sion of the first book and the beginning of this being wholly devoid of <lb/>
            connexion, whereas it is quite the reverse with the first and third <lb/>
            books compared with each other. It has been conjectured that it <lb/>
            belongs in some way or other to the Physics; chiefly from the words <lb/>
            which occur at the end,—" first must we investigate what Nature (<foreign xml:lang="grc">φύσις</foreign>) <lb/>
            is." But notwithstanding, as Thomas Aquinas reminds us, this book <lb/>
            is not entirely without reference to what has gone before. The science <lb/>
            under investigation in the first book is the science of sciences, and <lb/>
            makes universal truth the subject-matter of inquiry, which brings <lb/>
            Aristotle, in this, to the consideration of truth in general. Forasmuch, <lb/>
            however, as the term truth is employed in the same sense as theoretic <lb/>
            philosophy, the latter is compared with practical philosophy. But, <lb/>
            indeed, a further proof of its connexion with the foregoing may bo <lb/>
            found in the fact that d<foreign xml:lang="grc">ρχαι</foreign>, or first principles, are the theme of dis­ <lb/>
            cussion in both cases. Though, certainly, we must admit that the <lb/>
            discussion about the infinite progression of causes, with Aristotle, <lb/>
            should find its place in the physical rather than the metaphysical per­ <lb/>
            tion of his writings. Alexander. Asclepius, Niphus, and Thomas <lb/>
            Aquinas, are well worth being consulted on this question. </note></p><pb n="48"/>

            even these, likewise, contribute something, for they have pre­ <lb/>
            viously exercised our speculative habit.1 For if there had <lb/>
            not been a Timotheus. we would not have had much melody ; <lb/>
            and unless there had been a Phrynis, there would not have <lb/>
            been such a person as Timotheus. But, in the same manner, <lb/>
            also, it is in the case of those who have declared their senti­ <lb/>
            ments concerning truth; for, indeed, from some of them we <lb/>

          <p>But it is correct, also, that philosophy should <lb/>
            be styled a science, speculative of truth.2 For <lb/>
            of speculative science the end is truth, but of <lb/>
            practical science, a work; for even though they <lb/>

            we do not know the truth without the knowledge of cause. <lb/>
            But, especially, is each thing that amongst other things <lb/>
            according to which, also, there subsists in other things that <lb/>

            sary that the first principles of things, always existing, should <lb/>

            neither is anything the cause of being to those, but those are <lb/>
            the causes of being in other things. Wherefore, as each thing <lb/>

          <p>BUT, truly, that there is, at least, some first <lb/>
            principle, and that the causes of entities are not <lb/>
            infinite, either in a progress in a straight forward <lb/>
            direction, or according to form, is evident. For <lb/>
            1. No infinity <lb/>
            of causes- <lb/>
            either material, <lb/>
            efficient, final, <lb/>
            or formal. <lb/>
            neither, as of matter, is it possible that this particular entity <lb/>
            proceed from this to infinity; for instance, flesh, indeed, from <lb/>
            earth, and earth from air, and air from fire, and this without <lb/>
            ever coming to a stand-still. Nor can there an infinite pro­ <lb/>
            gression take place with the origin of the principle of motion; <lb/>
            as, for instance, that man should have been moved by the <lb/>
            air, and this by the sun, and the sun by discord; and of this <lb/>
            that there should be no end. Nor, in like manner, can this <lb/>
            infinite progression take place with the final cause,-that <lb/>
            walking, for instance, should be gone through for the sake of <lb/>
            health, and this for the sake of enjoyment, and this enjoyment <lb/>
            for the sake of something else; and, similarly, that one thing <lb/>
            invariably should subsist on account of another. And, in like <lb/>
            manner, is it the case with the formal cause. For of media, to <lb/>
            which externally there is something last and first, it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary that what is first should be a cause of those things which <lb/>
            are subsequent to it. For if we must declare what is the cause <lb/>
            of three things, we will assert that it is the first of the three; <lb/>
            for, doubtless, it is not the last, at least, for that is not, at any <lb/>
            rate, at the extremity of anything as a cause: but, truly, <lb/>
            neither is it the middle, for this is the cause of one thing only. <lb/>
            But it makes no difference whether one or many media be <note type="footnote">I This is an important chapter, and seem* to have suggested to <lb/>
            modern philosophers their phraseology, as well as mode of arguing, in <lb/>

             <note type="margin">[BOOK I. </note> <lb/>
            assumed, nor whether they are things infinite or finite; but in <lb/>
            this way all the portions of things infinite, and of the Infinite <lb/>
            in general, are similarly media up to the extremity; so that <lb/>
            if there is nothing that is the first, there is, in short, no cause.</p>
          <p>2. No progres­ <lb/>
            lion of causes <lb/>
            downwards.</p>
          <p>But neither, truly, is it possible, as regards a <lb/>
            progression downwards, to proceed on to infinity, <lb/>
            in case that which is in a progression upwards <lb/>
            involves a first principle; as, for example, that from fire, <lb/>
            indeed, water should be produced, but from this earth, and <lb/>
            so invariably that a certain different genus be produced. <lb/>
            For, in a twofold manner, 1 is one thing produced from another, <lb/>
            -not as this particular thing is said to take place after that; <lb/>
            for example, the Olympic games from the Isthmæan,—either <lb/>
            as a man is produced from a boy undergoing a change, 01 <lb/>
            air from water.</p>
          <p>3. Twofold dif­ <lb/>
            ference be­ <lb/>
            tween these.</p>
          <p>As, indeed, then, we say that a man is pro­ <lb/>
            duced from a boy as a thing that has been <lb/>
            from that which is in a process of formation, or <lb/>
            that which has been finished from that which is being <lb/>
            finished, or tends towards perfection, for always is there a <lb/>
            certain medium; as production is a medium between existence <lb/>
            and non-existence, so also is the thing that is being produced <lb/>
            between entity and nonentity: and a person receiving in­ <lb/>
            struction is one becoming scientifically learned. And this is <lb/>
            the meaning of what is affirmed,—that from a person learning <lb/>
            is produced one that is scientifically learned; and just as <lb/>
            water is generated from air on account of the air having <lb/>
            undergone corruption. Wherefore, in the former instance, the <lb/>
            things adduced, indeed, do not revert into one another, nor <lb/>
            is a child produced from a man; for that which is being pro­ <lb/>
            duced does not arise from the act of generation, but is sub­ <lb/>
            sequent to generation: for so, also, the day is generated from <lb/>
            the dawn, because it is posterior to this; wherefore, neither <lb/>
            is the dawn generated from the day : but the other instances <lb/>
            revert into each other.</p>
          <p>4. According to <lb/>
            neither of these <lb/>
            is there an in. <lb/>
            flnity of causes.</p>
          <p>In both these cases, however, it is impossible <lb/>
            to pursue the progress on to infinity; for, in the <lb/>
            one case, of those that are media there must <note type="footnote">1 In a twofold manner, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑλίκως παι πραγματο</foreign>e<foreign xml:lang="grc">ίδως</foreign> : that is, when one <lb/>
            system of matter is produced from another, and when that is a tran­ <lb/>
            sition from what is immature to what is finished. </note> <pb n="51"/>
             <note type="margin">CH. II.] </note> <lb/>
            needs be An end, and, in the other case, the things adduced <lb/>
            revert into one another, for the destruction of one is the <lb/>
            generation of the other. But at the same time, also, it <lb/>
            is impossible, that what is first, seeing that it is eternal, <lb/>
            should be subject to corruption; for since generation is not <lb/>
            infinite in an ascending progression, that nature must needs <lb/>
            not be eternal from which anything has been produced as <lb/>
            from that which is primary, and has been subject to corrup­ <lb/>
            tion ; but this is impossible.</p>
          <p>Further, the final cause is an end; but a thing <lb/>
            of this sort is that which does not subsist on <lb/>
            account of another, but other things on account <lb/>
            of that. Wherefore, if that which is last be a <lb/>
            5. No infinite <lb/>
            progression in <lb/>
            the case of the <lb/>
            final or formal <lb/>
            cause. <lb/>
            thing of this sort, there will not be a progression to infinity; <lb/>
            but if there is no such thing—I mean that which is last­ <lb/>
            the final cause will have no existence. But they who intro­ <lb/>
            duce this infinite progression forget that they destroy the <lb/>
            nature of the good. Although no one would undertake <lb/>
            entering on any course of action not intending to go on to <lb/>
            a termination of his undertaking; nor would there be design <lb/>
            in such things: for one who is possessed of mind always does <lb/>
            a thing for some purpose or other, (for this is a termination <lb/>
            for it,) for the end proposed is a termination. But, indeed, <lb/>
            neither can the formal cause admit of being referred to <lb/>
            another definition more copious in reason. For the prior <lb/>
            lefinition is invariably more the definition of a thing; but <lb/>
            the subsequent is not so. But to that of which there is no <lb/>
            first, neither has that which is next in order any existence.</p>
          <p>Further, they destroy scientific knowledge who <lb/>
            make assertions in this way; for it is not even <lb/>
            possible to understand anything before we come <lb/>
            to individual things; and scientific knowledge <lb/>
            has no existence in this case : for things infinite, <lb/>
            6. This theory <lb/>
            of infinite pro­ <lb/>
            gression would <lb/>
            overturn the <lb/>
            possibility of <lb/>
            knowledge. <lb/>
            in this manner, how is it possible to apprehend? for the in­ <lb/>
            finite here is not a thing similar to infinity in the case of <lb/>
            a line, which, as regards its divisions, indeed, does not come <lb/>
            to a stand-still, but is indivisible; nor is it possible for one to <lb/>
            apprehend these divisions, except he imposes some limit to <lb/>
            their divisibility. Wherefore, he will not reckon the divisions <lb/>
            or sections who goes through the infinite in detail, But <lb/>
            also, as regards the matter,—so far as it is such, in what is <note type="footnote">R </note> <pb n="52"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK I. </note> <lb/>
            being moved,1—it is necessary to understand it thus far; and <lb/>
            for nothing that is infinite is there any possibility of ex­ <lb/>
            istence : but, if this is not the case, not infinite, at any rate, <lb/>
            is that by which we may know the infinite. But, doubtless, <lb/>
            if the species of causes were infinite in number, neither, in <lb/>
            such a case, would the perception of our knowledge be pos­ <lb/>
            sible, for then we think we know when we may make known <lb/>
            the causes : but the infinite according to addition, it is not in <lb/>
            finite duration possible to exhaust.</p>

            at the same time to seek for scientific knowledge <lb/>
            and the mode of attaining such knowledge: but <lb/>

            it is not easy to acquire either of these. Now, mathematical <lb/>

            in those things that do not involve any connexion with <lb/>

            covering truth; 3 for perhaps the whole of Nature involves <lb/>
            matter : therefore, first must we investigate what Nature is.4 <lb/>
            For in this way, also, will it be evident about what only <lb/>

          <p>1. Doubt -its <lb/>
            relation to <lb/>
            scientific truth.</p>
          <p>FOR the advancement of the science under in­ <lb/>
            vestigation it is necessary for uas, first, to take <lb/>
            a review of those points respecting which one <lb/>
            ought to doubt in the first instance; but these are whatsoever <lb/>
            subjects some speculators have entertained opinions of after <lb/>
            a different mode, and whatever beyond these may happen to <lb/>
            have been overlooked. For it will contribute towards one's <lb/>
            object, who wishes to acquire a facility in the gaining of <lb/>
            knowledge, to doubt judiciously, for a subsequent acquisition2 <lb/>
            in the way of knowledge is the solution of previous doubts; <lb/>
            but when one is ignorant of the bond of a thing, it is not <lb/>
            possible for such to loose it. But the perplexity of the <lb/>
            intellect makes manifest this assertion respecting the matter <lb/>
            in hand; for so far forth as the dianoetic faculty doubts, so <lb/>
            far does it undergo something similar to persons loaded with <lb/>
            chains; for it is impossible, in both cases, to advance further. <lb/>
            Wherefore, it is necessary, in the first instance, to speculate <lb/>
            into all the difficulties involved in the present subject, both <lb/>
            on account of these things, and also from the fact, that they <lb/>
            who carry on an investigation, without doubting first, are <lb/>
            similar to persons ignorant where they ought to walk; and, in <lb/>
            addition to these things, neither can such know whether he <lb/>
            has discovered the object of his speculation or not; for the <lb/>
            end is not manifest to this speculator: but to one who has <lb/>
            previously doubted, in a judicious way, it is manifest. But, <note type="footnote">1 This book, if we allow what is commonly called Book I. the Less <lb/>
            to be as a separate one and as book IL, would, in this case, stand third <lb/>
            in order, which it does in some of the MSS. In this book, however; <lb/>
            Aristotle proceeds, according to the hint dropped at the end of the first <lb/>
            book, to lay before his readers, after the mode usually adopted by dis­ <lb/>
            putants in the schools, the doubts suggested to a thinking mind, an <lb/>
            connected with the subject-matter of ontological or metaphysical <lb/>
            science. </note><note type="footnote">2 This idea, according to Asclepius, is taken by Aristotle from Plato, <lb/>
            who pithily illustrates it by the case of fire being the result of the rub­ <lb/>
            bing together of two sticks. </note> <pb n="55"/>

            further, there is a necessity that a person should be better <lb/>
            qualified for forming a judgment who has heard all the <lb/>
            reasons, as it were, of adversaries and opposing disputants.</p>
          <p>Now, the first source of perplexity is concern­ <lb/>
            ing those things which we have expressed doubts <lb/>
            of in our Preface; namely, whether to speculate <lb/>
            into causes1 be the province of one or many <lb/>
            sciences? and whether it be the province of this <lb/>
            2. Is the science <lb/>
            of causes, as a <lb/>
            science of onto­ <lb/>
            logy, to be re­ <lb/>
            garded as one <lb/>
            or many I <lb/>
            science to discover merely the primary principles of substance, <lb/>
            or also to speculate concerning the first principles from which <lb/>
            all derive their demonstrations? as, for instance, whether it <lb/>
            is possible to affirm and deny one and the same thing, at the <lb/>
            same time, or not, and concerning the other things of such <lb/>
            a kind? And, if it is the province of this science to be con­ <lb/>
            versant about substance, whether one may be about all, or <lb/>
            whether there be many such in existence? and, if many, whe­ <lb/>
            ther all are akin to each other, or it may be proper to style <lb/>
            some of them sciences of " wisdom," and others of them, <lb/>
            something else?</p>
          <p>And this very thing is amongst the necessary <lb/>
            points of investigation, whether it should be <lb/>
            affirmed that sensible substances exist only, <lb/>
            or whether others also subsist in addition to <lb/>
            these ? and whether there is a genus singly, or <lb/>
            Questions as <lb/>
            to 3. the different <lb/>
            sorts or genera <lb/>
            of substances, <lb/>
            and their acci­ <lb/>
            dents. <lb/>
            a number of genera of substances, according to the opinion <lb/>
            of these who introduce both forms and mathematical entities <lb/>
            as things intermediate between these and sensibles? Con­ <lb/>
            cerning these, therefore,-as we have said,— an examination <lb/>
            must be made ; and also concerning substances, whether the <lb/>
            speculation extend only to them, or to the essential accidents <lb/>
            of these substances? But, in addition to these points, we <lb/>
            might inquire in regard of sameness2 and diversity, and <lb/>
            similarity and dissimilarity, and identity and contrariety, and <lb/>
            concerning priority and subsequence, and all the rest of such <lb/>
            things, concerning as many as the Dialecticians endeavour to <note type="footnote">1 This subject is considered more at large in book III. </note><note type="footnote"> * Aristotle had already discussed these points, one would suppose, <lb/>
            with sufficient copiousness in the Topics: why, then, do these inquiries <lb/>

            his Logic he treats of these merely speculatively, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνδόξως</foreign>, but here, as a <lb/>

            speculate into all of these. Further, may one investigate <lb/>
            whatsoever things are essential accidents in these very things, <lb/>
            both not only what each of them is, but also whether, in <lb/>

            they are; how <lb/>
            many they are ; <lb/>
            and as to their <lb/>
            mode of sub­ <lb/>
            sistence.</p>
          <p>And whether genera are first principles and <lb/>
            elements, or those things into which, as being <lb/>
            inherent, each thing is divided, and if the genera <lb/>
            are so, whether they are such things as are <lb/>
            predicated last or the first concerning individuals? <lb/>
            as, for example, whether animal or man be a <lb/>
            first principle, and be so rather than a singular ? <lb/>
            But most especially must we investigate and examine, with <lb/>
            pains, as to whether besides matter there is any absolute cause <lb/>
            or not, and whether this is separate or not, and whether it be <lb/>
            one, or such causes may be many in number? And <lb/>
            whether there is anything beside entirety,1 (but I mean <lb/>
            by entirety when anything has been predicated of matter,) <lb/>
            or nothing, or whether this is the case with some things, <lb/>
            indeed, but not so with others, and what sort of entities such <lb/>
            are? Moreover, whether first principles are limited in number <lb/>
            or in species, both those that subsist in formal causes and <lb/>
            those that are in the subject? and whether of things cor­ <lb/>
            ruptible and incorruptible the principles be the same or <lb/>
            different ? and whether all are incorruptible, or whether of <lb/>
            corruptible things there are corruptible principles ? More­ <lb/>
            over, also. the most difficult of all, and involving the greatest <lb/>
            perplexity, is the inquiry, whether unity and entity, as the <lb/>
            Pythagoreans and Plato used to affirm, be not anything else <lb/>
            but the substance of entities ; or this be not the case, but that <lb/>
            there be some other subject, as Empedocles says harmony is, <lb/>
            and a certain other philosopher, fire, and another, water or <lb/>
            air ? And whether first principles are universal or are as the <lb/>
            singulars of things ? and whether they subsist in capacity or <lb/>
            in energy ? Further, whether they subsist otherwise than <lb/>
            according to motion? for also these speculations would <lb/>
            furnish much perplexity. But, in addition to these points, <lb/>
            there remains the inquiry, whether numbers and dimensions, <note type="footnote">1 This subject of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ σύνολον</foreign> is treated of in bock VI. more <lb/>
            fully; for example, vide chapter iiL </note> <pb n="57"/>

            and figures and points, be certain substances or not ? and, if <lb/>
            they are substances, whether they are capable of being <lb/>
            separated from sensibles or be inherent in them? for, con­ <lb/>
            cerning all of these questions, not only is it difficult success­ <lb/>
            fully to attain unto the truth, but neither is a judicious <lb/>
            doubting easy for the reasoning faculties.1</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER II.2</title>
          </ab>
          <p>IN the first place, indeed, therefore, let us <lb/>
            institute an inquiry concerning the first asser­ <lb/>
            tions which we have made ; namely, whether to <lb/>
            speculate concerning all kinds of causes be the <lb/>
            province of one or many sciences ? 3 For how <lb/>
            would it be the province of a single science to <lb/>
            ]. The question <lb/>
            discussed,— Is <lb/>
            ontology, as a <lb/>
            science of <lb/>
            causes, to be <lb/>
            regarded as one <lb/>
            science or <lb/>
            many f <lb/>
            take cognisance of existing first principles when they are not <lb/>
            contrary to each other ? But, further, in the case of many <lb/>
            of the entities all do not exist in all4 of them. For in what <lb/>
            way is it possible for the principle of motion to be found in <lb/>
            things incapable of motion; or that the nature of the good <lb/>
            should, if everything which may be essentially good, and by <lb/>
            reason of its own nature, is an end, and so a cause, inasmuch <lb/>
            as on account of that other things are both produced and <lb/>
            exist ? But the end and the final cause are an end of any <lb/>
            action. And all things in the act of doing are attended with <lb/>
            motion; therefore, in things incapable of motion it would <lb/>
            not be possible that this should exist as the first principle, or <lb/>
            that there be therein any essential good. Wherefore, also, <lb/>
            in mathematics nothing is demonstrated through this cause ; <lb/>
            nor is there any demonstration for the reason that a thing <lb/>
            is better or worse : but neither does any mathematician make <note type="footnote">1 Or <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῷ λόγῳ</foreign> might be translated, " on rational grounds." </note><note type="footnote">2 Aristotle having enumerated the doubts which suggest themselves, <lb/>
            now proceeds to enter upon an examination of each separately; which <lb/>
            he does, in general, by laying down the reasons on both sides, as well for <lb/>
            the affirmative as for the negative of each question. </note><note type="footnote">* Mr. Maurice remarks, in his Introduction to Moral and Meta­ <lb/>
            physical Science, on this passage, that " this question involves the very <lb/>
            subject of the whole treatise." </note><note type="footnote"> 4 All are Dot agreed about the text. I have translated it as it stands <lb/>

             <note type="margin">[BOOK II. </note> <lb/>
            mention at all of any such thing whatsoever. Therefore, for <lb/>
            this reason, certain of the Sophists, as, for example, Aristippus, <lb/>
            regarded these sciences with disdain ; for in the other arts, <lb/>
            even the mechanical ones themselves, as in those of carpentry <lb/>
            and shoe-making, he said that wherefore a thing is better or <lb/>
            worse could be declared in every respect, but that the <lb/>
            mathematical sciences 1 make no account concerning things <lb/>
            good and evil. But, truly, if there are, at least, many sciences <lb/>
            of causes, and different sciences of a different first principle, <lb/>
            which of these must be said to be the one under investigation ; <lb/>
            or whom of those that are in possession of them shall we <lb/>
            pronounce scientifically informed, particularly in the matter <lb/>
            under inquiry-for in the same subject is it possible that all <lb/>
            the modes of causes exist; as, for example, of a house, the <lb/>
            origin of the principle of motion is from art and the builder, <lb/>
            and the final cause is the work, but the matter is earth and <lb/>
            stones, and the form is the definition ?</p>
          <p>2. Ontology, as <lb/>
            a science of the <lb/>
            TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">τίἐστι</foreign>, is a <lb/>
            science <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ <lb/>
            οὺσίας</foreign>.</p>
          <p>From the distinctions, therefore, laid down by <lb/>
            us originally, as to which of the sciences we <lb/>
            ought to denominate wisdom, is involved a <lb/>
            reason for further styling each thus. For as <lb/>
            far as a science is most qualified for the pre-eminence and for <lb/>
            superiority over the rest, and so far as it is just that, as <lb/>
            servants, the rest of the sciences should not contradict, so <lb/>
            far such is a science of the end and of the good, for the rest <lb/>
            of things are on account of this; but as far as wisdom has <lb/>
            been defined a science of first causes, and of that which is es­ <lb/>
            pecially capable of being scientifically known, so far such <lb/>
            would be a science of substance. For seeing that persons may <lb/>
            acquire the same knowledge by many methods, we say that <lb/>
            he rather understands a thing who makes known by its <lb/>
            being what that thing is than by its not-being; and of these <lb/>
            themselves one in preference to another, and particularly he <lb/>
            who knows what a thing is, and not he who knows the <lb/>
            quantity or the quality of a thing, or what it is by nature <note type="footnote">1 The mathematical sciences stood in higher estimation amongst the <lb/>
            Platonists than the Peripatetics. As to the sneer of Aristippus, in which <lb/>
            Aristotle almost appears silently to join, an answer might, in one way <lb/>
            be given in the value which Plotinus attaches to mathematics for <lb/>
            familiarizing mankind with that part of their nature not included in the <lb/>
            notion of body; or, to use his own words, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὸς συ̵νεθισμὸν τη̑ς ἀσωμἀτοι <lb/>

            CH. II.] <lb/>
            fitted for in the way of action or of passion. Further, in the <lb/>
            case of other things, the understanding each of those subjects <lb/>
            concerning which there are demonstrations, we think then <lb/>
            to have an existence when we may understand what a thing <lb/>
            is ; for instance, what the squaring of a right-lined figure is : <lb/>
            that it is the finding of a mean proportional.1 In like manner <lb/>
            is it in the case of the rest. But with regard to generations, <lb/>
            and actions, and every kind of change, we are in a way of <lb/>
            understanding each when we understand the first principle <lb/>
            of motion ; and this is different and in opposition to the end. <lb/>
            Wherefore, it would appear to belong to the department of a <lb/>
            different science 2 to investigate each of these causes.</p>
          <p>But, truly, also, with regard to demonstrative <lb/>
            first principles, whether they belong to one science <lb/>
            or more is a question open to doubt. But I <lb/>
            term demonstrative even those common opinions <lb/>
            from which all derive their demonstrations; for <lb/>
            instance, that everything must needs be either <lb/>
            an affirmation or negation, and that it is im- <lb/>
            3. The question <lb/>
            discussed as re­ <lb/>
            gards apodeik­ <lb/>
            tic principles— <lb/>
            what they are, <lb/>
            and whether <lb/>
            they fall under <lb/>
            the province of <lb/>
            ontological <lb/>
            science ? <lb/>
            possible for the same thing to be and not to be at the same time, <lb/>
            and whatsoever other such propositions there are. It is, I say, a <lb/>
            question open to doubt, whether there be one science of these <lb/>
            and of substance or a different one; and if not one, whether <lb/>
            it is necessary to denominate as such the science under investi­ <lb/>

            that it should be the province of one science; for why, in <lb/>
            preference, should the perception concerning these peculiarly <lb/>
            belong to geometry rather than to any other science what­ <lb/>
            soever ? If, therefore, in like manner, truly it belongs to any <lb/>
            whatsoever, but it does not admit of belonging to all the <lb/>
            sciences, as neither is it the peculiarity of the rest, so neither <lb/>
            is it the province of that science which makes known the <lb/>
            substances to investigate concerning these. But, at the same <lb/>
            time, also, in what way will it be the science of these ? For <lb/>
            what each of these happens to be we also now know; the rest <note type="footnote">1 For instance, if you wanted to mate a rectangle into a square, you <lb/>

            if there be a demonstrative science concerning them, it will <lb/>

            some of these, indeed, should be passive properties and others <lb/>

            science of ontology? But that there should be one science of <lb/>
            all substances is not reasonable; for there would be one <lb/>
            demonstrative science concerning all things that are essential <lb/>
            accidents, if every demonstrative science, in respect of a certain <lb/>
            subject, speculates into essential accidents from general <lb/>
            opinions. Respecting, then, the same genus it is the <lb/>
            province of the same science to investigate the essential <lb/>
            accidents from these same general opinions: for an exami­ <lb/>
            nation respecting the wherefore belongs to one science, and <lb/>
            to one respecting those elements whereof a thing consists, <lb/>
            whether both investigations belong to the same or a different <lb/>
            science ? Wherefore, the like will take place in regard of <lb/>
            accidents, whether these will investigate them or one of those ? <lb/>

            dents1 in these ? but I say, for example, if a solid be a <lb/>
            certain substance, and lines, and surfaces, whether it be the <lb/>
            province of the same science to take cognisance of these <lb/>

            mathematical sciences demonstrate, or if it be the province <lb/>
            of a different one ? For if, indeed, of the same, there would be <lb/>
            a certain demonstrative science, and that the science of <lb/>
            substance ; but of the essence or formal cause there does not <lb/>
            appear to be a demonstration : but, if of a different science, <lb/>
            what will be the science that speculates about the accidents <lb/>
            of substance ? for this would be altogether difficult to render <lb/>
            an account of. Further, also, whether must we say that there <lb/>
            are sensible substances only, or, also, besides these, others ? <lb/>
            and whether do the genera of these substances happen to <lb/>
            subsist singly, or are they more numerous, as, for instance, <lb/>
            they who speak both of forms and media between forms,2 <lb/>
            and things sensible, concerning which, they say, are con­ <lb/>

          <p>As to the assertion, then, indeed, that we have <lb/>
            made,3 namely, that forms are causes, and sub­ <lb/>
            stances absolutely subsisting, it has been declared <lb/>

            these inquiries in many ways are clogged with difficulties, <lb/>
            it would be no less absurd the assertion that there are, <lb/>
            indeed, certain natures besides those which are in the heavens, <lb/>
            and that these are the same with things sensible, except that <lb/>
            the former are, indeed, eternal, and the latter, corruptible. <lb/>
            For they speak of the existence of ideal man, and ideal horse, <lb/>
            and ideal health, but say nothing else in regard of these; <lb/>
            acting, in a way, similar to those who affirm the existence of <lb/>

            mathematical <lb/>
            media between <lb/>
            forms and sen­ <lb/>

            rable from <lb/>
            sensibles ? Ob­ <lb/>
            jections thereto <lb/>
            stated and ex­ <lb/>
            plained.</p>
          <p>But, further, if in addition, also, to forms and <lb/>
            sensibles any will set down things intermediate, <lb/>
            he will be involved in many doubts. For it is <lb/>
            evident that, in like manner, there will be lines, <lb/>
            and each of the other genera, besides also them <lb/>
            that are sensible. Wherefore, since astrology is <lb/>
            one of these, there will also be a certain heaven <lb/>
            besides the sensible heaven, and a certain other <lb/>
            sun and moon ; and so with the rest, in like manner, of the <lb/>
            bodies that are situated in the heavens. Although, how <lb/>
            need one place confidence in such statements as these ? for <lb/>
            neither is it reasonable that this ideal heaven should be in­ <lb/>
            capable of motion ; but, also, that it should be capable of <lb/>
            motion is altogether impossible. In like manner, also, is it <lb/>
            the case concerning the objects whereof optical science treats, <lb/>
            and that of harmonics in mathematics; for, also, it is impos­ <lb/>
            sible that these should have a subsistence different from <lb/>
            sensibles through the same causes: for if things sensible and <lb/>
            senses have an intermediate subsistence, it is manifest, also, <lb/>
            that there will be animals which will be media between them <lb/>
            and things corruptible. But one would doubt, also, con­ <lb/>
            cerning what sort of entities it is necessary for these sciences <lb/>
            to investigate. For if geodesy will differ from geometry in <lb/>
            this only, that one is conversant about things which we <lb/>
            perceive by the senses, but the other, about things that are <lb/>
            not cognisant by sense, it is manifest that besides the medici­ <lb/>
            nal science, and besides each of the rest, there will be a <lb/>
            certain science intermediate between the healing art itself <lb/>
            and this particular art of medicine. Although, indeed, how <lb/>
            is this possible ? for, also, would there be, in such a case, certain <lb/>
            salubrious qualities in addition to those that are sensible, <lb/>
            and to the salubrious itself: but, at the same time, neither <lb/>
            is this true that geodesy1 is conversant about sensible <note type="footnote"> I Geodesy, like the pure mathematical sciences, originated, in Egypt, <lb/>
            from local circumstances. It was the growth of a necessity annually <lb/>
            experienced of having fresh surveys of land, and effaced land-marks <lb/>
            restored, in consequence of the inundation of the river Nile. Thus it <lb/>
            had to deal with <foreign xml:lang="grc">τἀ αἰσῦητά</foreign>. </note> <pb n="63"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. II.] </note> <lb/>
            magnitudes and those that are corruptible ; for it would fall <lb/>
            into decay when they were in process of being destroyed. <lb/>
            But, truly, neither will astronomy be conversant about sen. <lb/>
            sible magnitude nor about yon heaven. Ifor neither are the <lb/>
            lines that fall under the cognisance of the senses the same as <lb/>
            the geometrician describes them; for nought of the things <lb/>
            that are perceived by the senses is in this way strictly <lb/>
            straight or round, for the circle touches the rule not in a <lb/>
            point, but as Protagoras was accustomed to say in his refu­ <lb/>
            tation of the geometricians. Neither are the motions and the <lb/>
            evolutions of the heaven similar to those about which <lb/>
            astrology has formed its systems; nor have the symbols 2 the <lb/>
            same nature with the stars.</p>
          <p>But there are some persons who say that these <lb/>
            reputed media between forms and sensibles are <lb/>
            not, indeed, separable from sensibles, at least, but <lb/>
            inherent in them: and to enumerate all the <lb/>
            impossibilities attendant upon these statements <lb/>

            against the po­ <lb/>

            would require a more copious discourse; but even it will be <lb/>
            sufficient to speculate thus much on this point. For neither <lb/>
            is it reasonable that this should be so in the case of these <lb/>
            merely; but it is evident that it would be possible, also, for <lb/>
            forms to subsist in sensibles : for both of these are results of <lb/>
            the same process of reasoning. But, further, must there needs <note type="footnote"> 1 This alludes to a practice of Protagoras, who used to give an illus­ <lb/>
            tration of the principle stated in the text by actually applying the <lb/>
            rule to the circle in the presence of the geometricians, and then laugh <lb/>
            at them, in his derision of their science. This quite accords with the <lb/>
            usual conduct of the sect to which Protagoras attached himself; namely, <lb/>
            that of the Sophists, who appeared at the time of the transition of the <lb/>
            early Greek philosophy into that which begun with Socrates, and <lb/>
            reached maturity under Plato and Aristotle. The Sophists, however <lb/>
            men of learning at the first, gradually degenerated into mere pretenders <lb/>
            to knowledge, whose aim was merely to extort money; and the effect <lb/>
            of their system would, if generally adopted, have been to destroy the <lb/>
            distinction between truth and falsehood. Fortunately, however, a dawn <lb/>
            of purer radiance was soon to break over Greece, and to dissipate these <lb/>
            mists and clouds of darkness. As to the original import of the term <lb/>

          <p>1.The question, <lb/>
            - Are genera <lb/>
            first principles? <lb/>
            discussed in <lb/>
            both the affirm­ <lb/>
            ative and the <lb/>
            negative, by a <lb/>
            reference to <lb/>
            things rational, <lb/>
            natural, and <lb/>
            artificial.</p>
          <p>Now, respecting these points much doubt <lb/>
            therefore prevails; namely, how it is necessary by <lb/>
            forming one's opinion thereupon to attain unto <lb/>
            the truth: and, likewise, respecting first prin­ <lb/>
            ciples, whether it is requisite to consider the <lb/>
            genera as elements and first principles, or, in <lb/>
            preference, those things from which, as inherent, <lb/>
            each first thing consists? as, for example, the <lb/>
            elements and first principles of voice appear to be those <lb/>
            things from which all voices are composed primarily, but not <lb/>
            the voice in common; and we say that those things are <lb/>
            elements of figures the demonstrations of which are inherent <lb/>
            in the demonstrations either of all or of the greater part of <lb/>
            other things But, further, both some in affirming that there <lb/>
            are many elements of bodies, and others that there is one 2, <lb/>
            of which they are composed, and from which they consist, <lb/>
            assert these to be the first principles; as, for example, <lb/>
            Empedocles asserts that fire and water, and the elements sub­ <lb/>
            sisting along with these, are those from which, as being <lb/>
            inherent, entities derive their existence : but he does not speak <lb/>
            of these as the genera of entities. And, in addition to these <lb/>
            statements, we may subjoin the remark, that if any one <lb/>
            wishes to contemplate the nature of the rest of things---as, for <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristotle still continues his discussion of the enumerated doubts; <lb/>
            and in the order that he states them in the beginning of this book. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This dogma of one original element, or material principle, is steadily <lb/>
            opposed by Aristotle throughout the Metaphysics </note> <pb n="65"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. III] </note> <lb/>
            example, a bed, of what parts it consists, and how those parts <lb/>
            are put together-in that case he is acquainted with the <lb/>
            nature of it. From these reasons, therefore, it would appear <lb/>
            that first principles would not be the genera of entities. But so <lb/>
            far forth as we obtain a knowledge of each thing by means of <lb/>
            the definitions, and so far as first principles are the genera of <lb/>
            definitions, it is necessary, also, that first principles be the <lb/>
            genera of things capable of definition. And, likewise, if to <lb/>
            acquire the science of the forms according to which entities are <lb/>
            denominated is to acquire the science of entities themselves, <lb/>
            in this case the genera of the forms are first principles. But <lb/>
            those, also, who affirm that the elements of entities are unity <lb/>
            or entity,1 or the great and the little, appear to employ these <lb/>
            as genera. But neither, truly, in both cases is it possible, <lb/>
            at least, to affirm, also, that they are first principles. For, <lb/>
            indeed, of substance there is one reason or formal principle ; <lb/>
            different, however, will be the definition through the genera, <lb/>
            and that which declares the entities whereof, as inherent, a <lb/>
            thing consists. If, also, most especially, in addition to these <lb/>
            things, the genera are first principles, whether is it necessary <lb/>
            to regard the first of the genera to be principles, or the lowest <lb/>
            that are predicated of individuals ? for this, also, is involved <lb/>
            in doubt. For if, indeed, it is requisite that universals are <lb/>
            first principles in a more eminent degree, it is evident that <lb/>
            the topmost genera will be first principles; for these are pre­ <lb/>
            dicated of all things. Therefore, the first principles of entities <lb/>
            will be as numerous as the first genera; so that unity and <lb/>
            entity will be first principles and substances : for these <lb/>
            especially are predicated of all entities. But it is not possible <lb/>
            that there should be one genus of entities, or that unity or <lb/>
            entity should be such ; for it is necessary, indeed, that the <lb/>
            differences of each genus both exist, and that each should be <lb/>
            one : but it is impossible either for the species to be predi­ <lb/>
            cated about the proper differences of the genus, or for the <lb/>
            genus to subsist, independent of the species of itself. Where­ <lb/>
            fore, if unity or entity be a genus, neither will entity or <lb/>
            unity constitute any difference. But, doubtless, unless there <lb/>
            be genera there will not be first principles, since genera are <note type="footnote"> 1 This tenet Aristotle examines in book I., and towards the close of <lb/>
            the next chapter. He glances at this system in several parts of the <lb/>
            Metaphysics, e.g. in book IX. chap. ii </note> <note type="footnote"> F </note> <pb n="66"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK II. </note> <lb/>
            first principles. Further, also, media that are comprehended <lb/>
            along with the differences will be genera as far as to indi­ <lb/>
            viduals; but now this appears to be the case with some, <lb/>
            and not with others. And further, in addition to these <lb/>
            things, we may add that the differences are rather first <lb/>
            principles than the genera; but if these, also, are first prin­ <lb/>
            ciples, first principles become infinite, so to speak : and this <lb/>
            is especially the case if one should constitute the first genus <lb/>
            a first principle.</p>
          <p>2. Reasons to <lb/>
            prove that the <lb/>
            lowest species <lb/>
            may be princi­ <lb/>
            pIes.</p>
          <p>But truly, if, also, the one rather be that which <lb/>
            is principal, and if one be a thing that is indivi­ <lb/>
            sible, and everything that is indivisible is so, <lb/>
            either according to quantity or according to species, <lb/>
            and if that which is according to species have a prior sub­ <lb/>
            sistence, and the genera are more divisible into species, one <lb/>
            would be predicated last, for man is not a genus of certain <lb/>
            particular men. Further, of those things wherein the prior <lb/>
            and subsequent are inherent, it is not possible that what is <lb/>
            predicated of them would be anything different from these ; <lb/>
            for instance, if a duad be the first of numbers there will not <lb/>
            be any number different from the species of numbers : and, in <lb/>
            like manner, rather will there be figures in addition to the <lb/>
            species of figures. But if this is not the case in regard of <lb/>
            these, hardly, at least, will there be genera of other things in <lb/>
            addition to the species, for of these there seem especially <lb/>
            to be genera. But in individuals there is not one thing <lb/>
            that is prior, and another that is subsequent. Further, <lb/>
            , here one thing is better and another worse, that which <lb/>
            is better always is prior; so that none of these could be <lb/>
            a genus. From these statements, indeed, therefore, it ap­ <lb/>
            pears that those things that are predicated of individuals are <lb/>
            first principles, rather than the genera. But, again, how, on <lb/>
            the other hand, it is necessary to regard these as first prin­ <lb/>
            ciples, it would not be easy to express. For it is requisite <lb/>
            that there should be a first principle and a cause exclusive <lb/>
            of the things of which there is a first principle, and that it <lb/>
            should be capable of subsisting in a condition of separation <lb/>
            therefrom ; but, as to the existence of some such thing besides <lb/>
            the singular,1 why should one make a supposition to this <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristotle almost seems to think it to have been the business of his <lb/>
            life to oppose the ideal hypothesis of Plato. </note> <pb n="67"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. IV.] </note> <lb/>
            effect, except that it is predicated universally, and of all <lb/>
            things ? But if, indeed, this is done on this account, in such <lb/>
            a case universals are to be set down as first principles in a <lb/>
            more eminent degree, so that the first genera would be <lb/>
            principles.</p>

          <p>BUT a doubt closely connected with the fore­ <lb/>
            going is one which of all is both the most <lb/>
            difficult and the most requisite to examine into, <lb/>
            1. Is there any­ <lb/>
            thing separate <lb/>
            from singulars? <lb/>
            concerning which our treatise, at present, is immediately <lb/>
            occupied. For if there is not anything besides singulars, and <lb/>
            if singulars are infinite, how is it possible to be in possession <lb/>
            of a science of things that are infinite ? for, as far as there is <lb/>
            something that is one and the same, and as far as there is <lb/>
            something that is universal, so far do we attain a knowledge of <lb/>
            all things. But, doubtless, if this be necessary, and if there <lb/>
            must needs be something in addition to singulars, it would <lb/>
            be requisite that there be genera in addition to singulars, <lb/>
            whether they are the lowest or the highest ; but that this is <lb/>
            impossible we have ourselves just now expressed a doubt.</p>
          <p>But, further,2 if most especially there is some­ <lb/>
            thing besides the entire when anything has been <lb/>
            predicated concerning matter, whether, if there <lb/>
            be a certain form, must there needs be something <lb/>
            universal in addition to some, and not in addition <lb/>
            to other things, or is there nothing universal <lb/>
            2. Is there any­ <lb/>
            thing separable <lb/>
            from things <lb/>
            compounded of <lb/>
            matter and <lb/>
            form ?-this <lb/>
            question dis­ <lb/>
            cussed. <lb/>
            besides singulars ? If, then, there is nothing universal besides <lb/>
            singulari, there would not be anything that is cognisable by <lb/>
            the mind ;3 but all things would fall beneath the notice of the <note type="footnote"> 1 This is a very important chapter, not merely because it gives <lb/>
            Aristotle's opinions on a subject where he may be seen in direct oppo­ <lb/>
            sition to his master, Plato, but also because we are favoured in it with <lb/>
            a glimpse into Aristotle's transcendentalism. </note><note type="footnote"> * The mode pursued by Aristotle, in the discussion of this question, <lb/>
            Is to show the validity of the affirmative, drawn from the absurdities <lb/>

            a good deal of light upon the theological system of Aristotle; how <lb/>

            the philosophy of the Stagyrite. </note> <note type="footnote"> F 2 </note> <pb n="68"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK II. </note> <lb/>
            senses, and there would not be a scientific knowledge of <lb/>
            anything, unless one would assert the exercise of the senses <lb/>
            to be science. Further, would there be nothing eternal or <lb/>
            immovable; for all things sensible are in a process of cor­ <lb/>
            ruption, and are in motion. But, truly, if there is, at least, <lb/>
            nothing that is eternal, neither is it a thing possible that <lb/>
            there should be generation ; for there must needs be some­ <lb/>
            thing, namely, that which is being produced, and wherefrom <lb/>
            it is produced : and of these the last must be ingenerable <lb/>
            if both the progress of successive productions is to stop at all, <lb/>
            and if generation from non-entity should be a thing that is <lb/>
            impossible. But, moreover, on the supposition of such things <lb/>
            being in existence as generation and motion, there must <lb/>
            needs be a limit likewise, for neither is any motion infinite ; <lb/>
            but of every motion is there an end: but that cannot be <lb/>
            produced which it is impossible could have been produced; <lb/>
            but that which has been produced must needs exist when first <lb/>
            it has been produced.1 But, further, if matter be an existence <lb/>
            from the fact of its being ingenerable, still it is much more <lb/>
            reasonable that substance should have a subsistence when <lb/>
            that is generated so as to have a being; for if neither sub­ <lb/>
            stance nor matter shall have an existence, neither will there <lb/>
            be anything at all in existence :2 but, if this be impossible, <lb/>
            there must needs be something in addition to the entire, <lb/>
            namely, the form and species; yet, if, on the other hand, any <lb/>
            one will establish this dogma, a doubt presents itself, both in <lb/>
            the case of what things one should make this assertion, and <lb/>
            in the case of what one should not. For that this is not <lb/>
            possible, in the case of all, is evident; for we would not posite <lb/>
            existence of any particular house in addition to certain <lb/>
            houses.</p>
          <p>a. The question <lb/>
            as to the unity <lb/>
            or plurality of <lb/>
            substances and <lb/>
            principles ex­ <lb/>
            amined.</p>
          <p>But, in addition to the foregoing points, we <lb/>
            may subjoin the inquiry, whether will there be <lb/>
            one substance of all things, for instance, of men? <lb/>
            Now, this is absurd, for all things are not one <lb/>
            of which the substance is one, but are many and <lb/>
            different; this, however, also, is an unreasonable statement. <lb/>
            And, at the same time, also, how would matter become each <note type="footnote"> 1 This point is discussed and reasoned upon similarly in the sixth <lb/>
            book of the Physics, chap. v. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Such a supposition then would end in a system of nihilism. </note> <pb n="69"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. IV.] </note> <lb/>
            of these ? and how is the entire both of these ? But, further, <lb/>
            respecting first principles we would also entertain this par­ <lb/>
            ticular doubt. For if, indeed, they are one in species, <lb/>
            nought will there be that is one in number ; nor will actual <lb/>
            unity or entity have any existence : and how would scien­ <lb/>
            tific knowledge be in existence, unless there was a certain one <lb/>
            in all things ?</p>
          <p>But, truly, if they are one in number, each of the first <lb/>
            principles also will be one; and not, as in the case of sensibles, <lb/>
            one principle of one thing, and another of another; as, for <lb/>
            instance, of this syllable when it is the same in species, the <lb/>
            first principles, also, are the same in species, for these, likewise, <lb/>
            are different in number : and if this be not the case, but if <lb/>
            the first principles of entities are one in number, there will <lb/>
            not be in existence anything else besides the elements; for to <lb/>
            speak of one in number, or of the singular, makes no dif­ <lb/>
            ference, for so we speak of the singular as one in number, <lb/>
            and of the universal as that which is common to these. Just, <lb/>
            therefore, does the case stand as if the elements of voice <lb/>
            should be limited in number, all the letters necessarily must <lb/>
            be in number as many as the elements, since neither two, nor <lb/>
            more than two, of them would be the same.</p>
          <p>§ 1. But a doubt1 of no less difficulty has been <lb/>
            overlooked, both by modern investigators and <lb/>
            by our predecessors, namely, as to whether the <lb/>
            first principles of things corruptible and of things <lb/>
            I. Are the prin­ <lb/>
            ciples of cor­ <lb/>
            ruptibles and <lb/>
            incorruptibles <lb/>
            the same ? <lb/>
            incorruptible be the same or different? For if, indeed, they <lb/>
            are the same, how is it the case that some things are <lb/>
            incorruptible and others corruptible, and from what cause <lb/>
            does this difference arise ?</p>
          <p>Those of the Hesiodic school, and all as many <lb/>
            as are theologians, fixed their thoughts only upon <lb/>
            the probable, as it appeared to themselves; but <lb/>
            they have treated us with disdain. For, seeing <lb/>
            2. Enoneous <lb/>
            view of the <lb/>
            Theogonists <lb/>
            this point. <lb/>
            that they make the first principles gods, and to have been <lb/>
            produced from gods, whatsoever did not taste of the nectar <lb/>
            and ambrosia they say are mortal; palpably speaking of these <lb/>
            denominations as expressive of things that are known to <note type="footnote"> 1 The question now discussed is most important, as bearing directly <lb/>
            cn the inquiry,-What was the theology of Aristotle, or had he any such <lb/>
            system at all? </note> <pb n="70"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK II. </note> <lb/>
            themselves. Respecting, however, the actual adducing of <lb/>
            these causes, they have spoken beyond our comprehension. <lb/>
            For if, indeed, the immortals partake of these for the sake <lb/>
            of pleasure, the nectar and ambrosia are, in no respect, the <lb/>
            causes of their existence ; and if these are the causes of their <lb/>
            existence, how would they be eternal when thus requiring <lb/>
            sustenance ? But, respecting those fabulous systems of philo­ <lb/>
            sophy, it is not worth one's while considering them with <lb/>
            seriousness.</p>
          <p>3. A solution <lb/>
            thereof of the <lb/>
            Physicists <lb/>
            shown to be in­ <lb/>
            consistent in <lb/>
            the case of <lb/>
            Empedocles.</p>
          <p>But from those who make assertions by de­ <lb/>
            monstration, it is necessary to ascertain in OUt <lb/>
            inquiries, why, forsooth, if entities are from the <lb/>
            same source, some of them are in their nature <lb/>
            eternal? and why others of these entities are <lb/>
            subject to decay ? But, inasmuch as they neither <lb/>
            mention a cause of this, and as it is not reasonable that the case <lb/>
            should be so, it is manifest that the first principles of these <lb/>
            would not be the same, nor would there be the same causes <lb/>
            of them. For, also, one whom any person would suppose <lb/>
            to speak particularly consistent with himself, namely, <lb/>
            Empedocles,1 has, likewise, experienced the same difficulty. <lb/>
            For he, indeed, is for establishing discord-which is a first <lb/>
            principle in his system-as a certain cause of corruption. <lb/>
            Nevertheless, this would seem, however, also, to produce <lb/>
            entities that are beyond the one ;2 for from this are produced <lb/>
            all the other works of creation, except the Deity. The <lb/>
            following, at least, are the words of Empedocles :— <lb/>
            " From which are all things, as many as were, and are, and shall be <lb/>
            after; <lb/>
            And trees therefrom have blossomed, and men and women, <lb/>
            And beasts and birds, and water-fed fishes, <lb/>
            And even the long-lived gods."</p>
          <p>And the subsistence of all things independent of these is <lb/>
            manifest; for, unless discord were inherent in things, all <lb/>
            things would have been one, as he says: for when they <note type="footnote"> 1 Asclepius endeavours to exculpate Empedocles from the charges of <lb/>
            Aristotle, by protesting against the literal interpretation of the language <lb/>
            of that sage; contending that it is purely symbolical, and in nowise <lb/>
            destructive of eternal entities. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 I have followed the text of the French edition. Bekker reads <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. IV.] </note> <lb/>
            would ha ve come together, then last in the conglomeration <lb/>
            would stand discord.</p>
          <p>Wherefore, also, it happens to him, in his <lb/>
            system, that the Deity, who is supremely happy, <lb/>
            should be less prudent than the rest of beings, <lb/>
            A. This proved <lb/>
            from the na­ <lb/>
            ture of God. <lb/>
            for he does net know all the elements, for he is not in <lb/>
            possession of discord; but the knowledge of the like is <lb/>
            through the like.1 <lb/>
            " For, indeed, says he, by earth we see earth, and by water, water, <lb/>
            And ether divine by ether, and through fire the ruinous fire, <lb/>
            And by concord, concord, and by gloomy discord, discord."</p>
          <p>But, to return to the point from whence our dis­ <lb/>
            course digressed. This, at all events, is evident, <lb/>
            that it happens, according to the theory of <lb/>
            5. The insuf. <lb/>
            ficency of the <lb/>
            Empedoclean <lb/>
            dogma. <lb/>
            Empedocles, that discord is no more the cause of corruption <lb/>
            than of existence; and, in like manner, that neither is <lb/>
            harmony a cause of existence more than of corruption, for <lb/>
            while collecting things into unity it is a cause of corruption <lb/>
            to other things. And, at the same time, also, he mentions no <lb/>
            cause of the actual transmutation, save that the thing is thus <lb/>
            constituted by nature to take place. Mark his words :— <lb/>
            " But when mighty discord2 was nourished in the members, <lb/>
            And rose up to the honours of deified Time, who, holding <lb/>
            The sway over them alternately, had, in the end, <lb/>
            Surpassed the ample objects of God's adjuration."</p>
          <p>As if, indeed, it were a thing necessary that a change <lb/>
            should take place; but he does not bring to light any <lb/>
            necessary cause. But, nevertheless, thus much, at least, he <lb/>
            only asserts consistently, for he does not constitute some <lb/>
            entities corruptible and others incorruptible, but all corrupt­ <lb/>
            ible, except the elements. But the source of perplexity now <note type="footnote"> 1 This was a favourite dogma in the theories of sensation put forward <lb/>
            by the old philosophers. It is acquiesced in by Plato in the Timæus. <lb/>
            Its source has given rise to some questioning; it has been generally <lb/>
            traced up to the Pythagoreans. Sextus Empiricus examines this point <lb/>
            in the first of his books, " Contra Mathematicos," chap. xiii. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 I have thus differed from Taylor, who translates the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">τελει <lb/>

            conceive what led Taylor into such an error, if it was not his incorrect <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [BOOK II. </note> <lb/>
            mentioned it this: why, if entities spring from the same <lb/>
            source, some of them are incorruptible and some of them <lb/>
            are not so? That, therefore, the first principles of things <lb/>
            would not be the same, let this much suffice to have been <lb/>
            spoken.</p>
          <p>6 The position <lb/>
            that principles <lb/>
            are different.</p>
          <p>But, if the first principles of things be different, <lb/>
            one matter of doubt, indeed, is, whether these <lb/>
            also will be incorruptible or corruptible? For <lb/>
            if, indeed, they are corruptible, it is manifest that it is <lb/>
            requisite that these, also, should spring from certain entities; <lb/>
            for all things perish into those from whence they derive their <lb/>
            being. Wherefore, it happens that to principles there arc <lb/>
            other first principles that are prior; but this is impossible, <lb/>
            both on the supposition of the progression being stationary, <lb/>
            at some stage of its progress, and on the supposition of <lb/>
            its going on to infinity. And, moreover, how will things <lb/>
            perishable subsist if the first principles will be destroyed? <lb/>
            but if these principles are imperishable, why, indeed, from <lb/>
            these that are things imperishable will arise those that are <lb/>
            perishable, but from the others those that are imperishable ? <lb/>
            for this is not reasonable, but either is impossible, or requires <lb/>
            for its establishment much rational 'support. And, further, <lb/>
            neither has any one attempted to enumerate different ones ; <lb/>
            but speculators assign the same first principles of all things- <lb/>
            the first subject of doubt, however, they entertain slightly,1 <lb/>
            regarding it as something trifling.</p>
          <p>]. The question, <lb/>
            whether entity <lb/>
            and unity are <lb/>
            first principles ? <lb/>
            examined in <lb/>
            reference to the <lb/>
            Platonists and <lb/>
            Physicists.</p>
          <p>f 2. But, also, the most difficult point of all2 to <lb/>
            examine into, and the most necessary for the dis­ <lb/>
            covery of truth, is, whether entity and unity are <lb/>
            substances of entities, and whether each of them <lb/>
            not being anything else, this is unity and that is <lb/>
            entity; or whether it is necessary to investigate <lb/>
            what, at length, unity and entity are, as if <lb/>
            another nature were the subject to these? For some, truly, in <lb/>
            that way, and some in this, suppose their nature to be dis­ <lb/>
            posed. For Plato, indeed, and the Pythagoreans do not <lb/>
            regard entity as anything different from unity, but that this <note type="footnote"> 1 The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">άποτρώγουσιν</foreign> is a metaphor derived from dogs mangling <lb/>
            and destroying food, if interrupted in devouring it. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This subject has been already examined in book I., and is discussed <lb/>

            is their nature that it should be the same thing for the <lb/>
            substance to be one, and to be a certain entity But amongst <lb/>
            natural philosophers, Empedocles, for instance, as if con­ <lb/>
            ducting the inquiry to that which is more known, says that <lb/>
            unity is entity. For he would seem to affirm that this is <lb/>
            harmony1—at least, this is a cause in his system of unity <lb/>
            being found in all things. But others say that fire, and some <lb/>
            that air, is this unity and entity from whence that entities <lb/>
            both arise and are produced. So, in like manner, is it the <lb/>
            case, also, with those who lay down the existence of more <lb/>
            elements than these ; for it is, likewise, necessary for these to <lb/>
            reckon unity and entity such things as whatever, at least, <lb/>
            they affirm first principles to be. But it happens, unless one <lb/>
            will set down the existence of unity and entity as a certain <lb/>
            substance, that not any of the rest of the universals will have <lb/>
            any subsistence, for these are universal pre-eminently above <lb/>
            all. But, if unity itself be not some particular thing, nor <lb/>
            entity itself, much less will there be any of the other things <lb/>
            that will have a subsistence, except those denominated <lb/>
            singulars. But, further, on the supposition of unity not being <lb/>
            a substance, it is evident that neither would number have a <lb/>
            subsistence, as a certain nature that has been separated from <lb/>
            entities, for number constitutes the monad ; but the monad <lb/>
            is the same as some certain unit. But, truly, if, at least, <lb/>
            actual unity and actual entity be a certain particular thing, <lb/>
            it is necessary that the substance of that thing be entity and <lb/>
            unity ; for it is not any different thing that is universally <lb/>
            predicated about them, but these very same things.</p>
          <p>But, doubtless, if actual entity and actual <lb/>
            unity, at least, shall have any existence, much <lb/>
            doubt will arise how there will subsist anything <lb/>
            different from these. Now, I mean how there will <lb/>
            be more entities in existence than one. For any- <lb/>
            2.ThePhysicist <lb/>
            increases the <lb/>
            difficulty of this <lb/>
            question, and <lb/>
            leaves it unre­ <lb/>
            moved. <lb/>
            thing different from entity has no existence. Wherefore, <lb/>
            according to the theory of Parmenides, it must needs happen <lb/>
            that all entities are one, and that this one constitutes entity. <lb/>
            But in both cases there is a difficulty; for even on the <lb/>
            supposition whether unity, doubtless, be not substance, or <lb/>
            whether any actual unity have a subsistence, it is impossible <lb/>
            for number to be substance : but if, indeed, then, it has not a <note type="footnote"> 1 Vide book IX. chap. ii. </note> <pb n="74"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK II </note> <lb/>
            subsistence, it hath been previously stated why ; but if it has. <lb/>
            the same doubt presents itself respecting entity also: for from <lb/>
            what will there be another one besides the one itself, for <lb/>
            must not that necessarily be not one, for all entities are <lb/>
            either one or many, each of which is one ? Further, if unity <lb/>
            itself be indivisible, according, indeed, to the axiom of Zeno,1 <lb/>
            nothing would there be having a subsistence. For that which <lb/>
            neither when added nor subtracted makes anything greater <lb/>
            or less, he affirms this not to belong to the category of <lb/>
            entities, because entity is manifestly magnitude ; and if it is <lb/>
            magnitude it is corporeal, for this, in every way, is entity. <lb/>
            But the addition of such things, in one way, will make what <lb/>
            is greater, and, in another, will not make anything so at all. <lb/>
            As a surface and a line make that which is greater; but a <lb/>
            point and a monad, by no means, have this effect. But since <lb/>
            this philosopher speculates clumsily,2 and it happens that <lb/>
            there is something that is indivisible, wherefore, even in this <lb/>
            way, also, hath one for him a certain reply as follows,-an <lb/>
            addition of this sort will not make a thing greater, but will <lb/>
            make it more ; yet how, forsooth, from one, or more than one, <lb/>
            of this kind will arise magnitude, for this is even like saying, <lb/>
            that a line is made up of points ? But, doubtless, if any one <lb/>
            makes a supposition in this way, so that, as some say, from <lb/>
            actual unity, and a something else that is not one, is com­ <lb/>
            posed number, not the less should it form a subject for <lb/>
            investigation, why, and how, what is produced will one time <lb/>
            be number, and another time, magnitude, if what is not one <lb/>
            be inequality and the same nature. For neither is it mani­ <lb/>
            fest how from one and this natnre, nor how from a certain <lb/>
            number and this nature, magnitudes would arise. <note type="footnote"> 1 The Zeno mentioned here by Aristotle was the famous Eleatio <lb/>

          <p>BUT a doubt connected with these is, whether <lb/>
            numbers and bodies, and surfaces and points, <lb/>
            are certain substances or not ? For if they are <lb/>
            not, it eludes our comprehension what being <lb/>
            1. The questior <lb/>
            discussed—Are <lb/>
            numbers and <lb/>
            figures,&amp;c.sub. <lb/>
            stances t <lb/>
            is, and what the substances of entities are. For passive pro­ <lb/>
            perties, and motions, and relations, and dispositions, and ratios, <lb/>
            do not appear to signify a substance of anything; for <lb/>
            all these are predicated respecting a certain subject, and no <lb/>
            one of them can be said to be this or that particular thing. <lb/>
            But things which would seem particularly to signify sub­ <lb/>
            stance, namely, water, and earth, and fire, from which <lb/>
            compounded bodies consist, the heats and colds of these <lb/>
            and such like qualities are affections, not substances; but <lb/>
            all the while the body, which undergoes these passive <lb/>
            conditions, alone sustains them as a certain entity, and as <lb/>
            being a certain substance. But, truly, both body is less <lb/>
            substance than a superficies, and this latter than a line, and <lb/>
            this than the monad and the point, for by these is body <lb/>
            defined. And these, indeed, seem capable of existence with­ <lb/>
            out body; but the existence of body, without these, seems <lb/>
            impossible.</p>
          <p>Wherefore, the majority of speculators and our <lb/>
            predecessors considered substance and entity to <lb/>
            be body, and the other things to be passive <lb/>
            2. Appeal, on <lb/>
            this subject, to <lb/>
            antiquity. <lb/>
            properties of this;2 so that, also, the first principles-those <lb/>
            of bodies-are the first principles of entities. Subsequent <lb/>
            investigators, however, and they, too, persons that appeared <lb/>
            endowed with more wisdom than these, supposed such to <lb/>
            be numbers. As, therefore, we have said, unless these are <lb/>
            substance, there is, upon the whole, no substance in existence, <lb/>
            nor no entity, for the accidents, at least, in these it would not, <lb/>
            truly, be worthy to call entities. <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristotle now proceeds to examine this fundamental dogma with <lb/>
            the Pythagoreans, which he has already discussed, partially, in book I., <lb/>
            and resumes the consideration of in book XII. of the Metaphysics. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This assertion is exemplified by what Aristotle has laid down in <lb/>

            discussion of <lb/>
            this inquiry.</p>
          <p>But if, doubtless, this is acknowledged, that <lb/>
            dimensions and points are substance, rather <lb/>
            than bodies themselves, yet we do not perceive <lb/>
            to what sort of bodies these would belong (for that they <lb/>
            be inherent in things that fall under cognisance of the <lb/>
            senses, this is impossible); in this case, then, there would <lb/>
            not be any substance in existence. Further, however, <lb/>
            it appears that all these entities are divisions of body, one <lb/>
            indeed, into breadth, and another into depth, and a third into <lb/>
            length. But, in addition to these things, in like manner, <lb/>
            there is in the solid every kind of figure whatsoever; so that, <lb/>
            if neither mercury is in the stone, nor the half of a cube in <lb/>
            the cube, in such a way as has been defined neither, in this <lb/>
            case, would one surface exist in body: for if this would be the <lb/>
            case with anything whatsoever, it would be with that which <lb/>
            would separate the half. Now, there is the same mode of <lb/>
            reasoning in the case of a line, and a point, and a monad; <lb/>
            wherefore, if body especially be substance, and if these are <lb/>
            substance rather than this, and these have no existence, nor <lb/>
            do certain substances exist, there eludes our comprehension <lb/>
            what entity is, and what is the substance of entities. For, <lb/>
            in addition to the statements that have been made, those <lb/>
            irrational consequences relating to generation and corruption, <lb/>
            also, take place. For, indeed, substance-when not previously <lb/>
            existing it comes into existence now,1 or when it which for­ <lb/>
            merly had an existence afterwards ceases to exist-the sub­ <lb/>
            stance, I say, appears to undergo these affections, namely, <lb/>
            production and corruption; but points, and lines, and surfaces, <lb/>
            cannot possibly arise or be destroyed, though sometimes these <lb/>
            have a subsistence, and sometimes they have not. For when <lb/>
            bodies mutually touch or intersect each other, at the same <lb/>
            time that they touch they become one, and at the same time <lb/>
            that they intersect they become two. So that points, lines, <lb/>
            and surfaces, when bodies are compounded together, have no <lb/>
            subsistence, but then have been reduced to corruption: but <lb/>
            when bodies are divided, these rise into existence, though pre­ <lb/>
            viously they had no existence. For a point, truly, that is <lb/>
            indivisible is not capable of being divided into two; and, if <note type="footnote"> 1 The student would do well to consult Mosheim's Dissertation on <lb/>

            they are produced and destroyed, they are produced from <lb/>
            something. But, in a similar way, is it the case respecting <lb/>
            the present time, which is contained in duration; for neither <lb/>
            does this admit of being generated and destroyed, but, never­ <lb/>
            theless, invariably seems to be a thing that is different, not <lb/>
            that it is, however, any particular substance. In like manner, <lb/>
            also, it is evident that it is the case both respecting points, <lb/>
            and lines, and surfaces, for the reasoning is the same; for all <lb/>
            these, in like manner, are either bounds or divisions.</p>

          <p>BUT, upon the whole, would one feel perplexity <lb/>
            why also it is necessary to investigate into cer­ <lb/>
            tain other entities besides sensibles and media, for <lb/>
            example, such as we posite as forms ? For if it is <lb/>
            on this account, because mathematical entities, <lb/>
            1.Are there any <lb/>
            other principles <lb/>
            over and above <lb/>
            mathematical <lb/>
            entities and <lb/>
            sensibles ? <lb/>
            indeed, differ from those that are here in a certain other <lb/>
            respect, yet, in regard of there being many of them of <lb/>
            the same species, there is no difference in this. Wherefore, <lb/>
            the first principles of these will not be limited in number, <lb/>
            as neither of all the lines which are here are the first prin­ <lb/>
            ciples limited in number, but in species, unless one takes <lb/>
            the principle of this particular syllable, or of this particular <lb/>
            voice, and the first principles of these will be limited in <lb/>
            number. In like manner, also, is it the case with things that <lb/>
            are intermediate; for there, likewise, things of the same <lb/>
            species are infinite. Wherefore, unless, in addition to sensi­ <lb/>
            bles and mathematical entitities, there are certain others, <lb/>
            such as some call the forms, there will not be a substance one <lb/>
            in number and species; nor will there be certain first prin­ <lb/>
            ciples of entities so many in number, but in species. If, then, <lb/>
            this is necessary, the subsistence of forms, on this account, is <lb/>
            necessary also. For even although they who make such <lb/>
            assertions do not propound their theories with distinctness, <note type="footnote">1 This brings us to the close of the examination of the doubts that ' <lb/>
            had been started in the commencement of this book. Some of them <lb/>

            yet it is this which they aim at; and they must needs affirm <lb/>

            of principles.</p>
          <p>Contiguous, also, to this inquiry is the question <lb/>
            whether elements subsist in potentiality,1 or in <lb/>
            some other manner? For if, indeed, in some <lb/>
            other manner, there will be something else that is prior <lb/>
            to first principles; for potentiality is prior to that cause: <lb/>
            but it is not necessary that everything that is potential <lb/>
            should be disposed in that way. But if elements are ex­ <lb/>
            istent in potentiality, it is admissible that none of the entities <lb/>
            should have a subsistence; for it is possible for that to <lb/>
            exist which not as yet has any existence: for, indeed, that <lb/>
            which has no existence is being produced, but nothing of <lb/>
            things that are impotential is produced.</p>
          <p>3. Shall we pre­ <lb/>
            dicate reality <lb/>
            of universals or <lb/>
            of singulars ?</p>
          <p>And these doubts, then, is it necessary to <lb/>
            moot respecting first principles; and there re­ <lb/>
            mains, also, the inquiry whether universals exist, <lb/>
            or, as we say, singulars? For if, indeed, uni. <lb/>
            versals exist, they will not be substances; for nought of those <lb/>
            things that are general signify this particular thing, but <lb/>
            a thing of such a sort; but the substance is this particular <lb/>
            thing. But if it will be possible to exhibit this particular <lb/>
            thing, and that which thereof may in common be predicated, <lb/>
            in such a case many animals will Socrates himself be, and <lb/>
            man and animal if each signify this certain particular thing, <lb/>
            and that which is one. If, indeed, therefore, first principles <lb/>
            are universal, these consequences take place; but if they are <lb/>
            not universal, but are as singulars, they will not be objects of <lb/>
            scientific knowledge; for the sciences are conversant about <lb/>
            all things that are universal. Wherefore, will there be different <lb/>
            first principles prior to principles, namely, those that are <lb/>
            predicated universally, in case there is likely to be a science <lb/>
            of them. <note type="footnote"> 1 The subject of potentiality, or capacity in general, is examined <lb/>

          <p>THERE is a certain science which makes, as the <lb/>
            object of its speculation, entity, as far forth as it is <lb/>
            entity, and the things which are essentially in­ <lb/>
            herent in this. But this is the same with none <lb/>
            of those which are called particular sciences; for <lb/>

            universal sci­ <lb/>
            ence of entity, <lb/>
            and not a parti <lb/>

            of it. <lb/>
            none of the rest of the sciences examines universally concern­ <lb/>
            ing entity so far forth as it is entity: but, cutting away a <lb/>
            certain portion of it, they investigate what is accidental in <lb/>
            regard of this; as, for example, the mathematical sciences. <lb/>
            But, whereas we are in search of first principles and the top­ <lb/>
            most causes, it is evident that they must needs be absolutely <lb/>
            of a certain nature. If, therefore, they, also, who investigate <lb/>
            the elements of entities were accustomed to investigate these <lb/>
            first principles, it is necessary, likewise, that the elements of <lb/>
            entity should not have a subsistence according to accident, <lb/>
            but so far forth as they are entities. Wherefore, also, must <lb/>
            we ascertain the first causes of entity, so far as it is entity.</p>

            reference to the art of medicine; for, indeed, a thing is called <lb/>
            medicinal partly in reference to its possessing the medicinal <lb/>

            a similar manner with these. Thus, however, is entity,1 also, <lb/>
            spoken of in various ways indeed; but every entity in re­ <lb/>
            ference to one first cause: for some things, because they are <lb/>

            substance, either as corruptions, or privations, or qualities, or <lb/>
            things formative or generative, of substance, or of those <lb/>
            which are spoken of in reference to substance, or the negations <lb/>
            of any of these or of substance. Wherefore, also, the non­ <lb/>

          <p>As, then, there is one science of all things <lb/>
            pertaining to health, in like manner, also, is <lb/>
            this so in the case of other things. For it is <lb/>
            the province of one science to speculate concerning not <lb/>
            only those things spoken of according to one, but also those <lb/>
            spoken of in reference to a single nature. For these, also, <lb/>
            in a certain manner, are spoken of in accordance with <lb/>
            one. It is evident, therefore, that it is the province of a <lb/>
            single science to speculate concerning entities, so far forth <lb/>
            as they are entities. But in every respect is the science of <lb/>
            ontology strictly a science of that which is first or elemental, <lb/>
            both on which the other things depend and through which <lb/>
            they are denominated. If, then, this is substance, the Philo­ <lb/>
            sopher or Metaphysician must needs be in possession of the <lb/>
            first principles and causes of substances. Now, of every genus <lb/>
            there is both one sense of each and one science; as, for <lb/>
            instance, grammatical science is one, and speculates into all <lb/>
            vocal sounds. Wherefore, to speculate into, also, the number <lb/>
            of the species of entity, and the species of the species, belongs <lb/>
            to a science one in kind. <note type="footnote"> 1 The subject of entity is fully discussed in the next book. <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin"> CH. II.] </note> If, therefore, entity and unity are the same <lb/>
            thing, and one nature, 1 from the fact of their <lb/>

            tion; there is, however, no difference, should we even <lb/>
            make our suppositions in regard of them after a similar <lb/>
            manner, nay, even rather is it for the advantage of the present <lb/>
            inquiry. For it is the same thing, one man and the entity <lb/>
            man and man; and not anything different does it make <lb/>
            manifest, according to a repetition of the expression, to say <lb/>
            man is, and man and one man: but it is evident that there is <lb/>
            no separation of being either in the case of production or <lb/>
            corruption. But in like manner, also, is it the case with unity. <lb/>
            Wherefore, it is manifest that addition in these implies the <lb/>
            same thing, and that nothing different is unity from entity <lb/>
            And, further, the substance of each thing is one not according <lb/>
            to accident; and in like manner, also, is it the case with any <lb/>
            entity whatsoever. Therefore, as numerous as are the species <lb/>
            of unity,2 so numerous, also, are those of entity, into the <lb/>
            nature of which it is the province of the same science in kind <lb/>
            to investigate : now I speak, for instance, of sameness and <lb/>
            similarity, and of the other things of this sort, and of those <lb/>
            that are in opposition to these. And almost all contraries <lb/>
            are reduced to this first principle. These points, however, <lb/>
            have formed the subject-matter of our inquiries in our treatise <lb/>
            styled, “A Selection of Contraries.”</p>
          <p>And so many portions of philosophy are there as <lb/>
            there are, at least, substances. Wherefore, is it <lb/>
            necessary that there should be a certain first phi­ <lb/>
            losophy, and one next in order belonging to these; <lb/>
            for unity and entity are things straightway involv­ <lb/>
            ing genera ;wherefore, also, the sciences will follow <lb/>
            4. Why it is that <lb/>
            ontology has to <lb/>
            inquire into pri­ <lb/>
            vation, nega­ <lb/>
            tion, &amp;c. ;and, <lb/>
            in general, into <lb/>
            opposites and <lb/>
            contraries. <lb/>
            upon these. For the Philosopher or Metaphysician is as one that <lb/>
            is styled a Mathematician, for his science also has parts; and <lb/>
            there is a certain first and second science, and another next <lb/>
            in order, in mathematics. But whereas it is the province of <lb/>
            one science to investigate things that are in opposition, and <note type="footnote"> I This position, as to the identity in signification of entity and unity <unclear/> <lb/>
            -<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὸὄν, τὸ ἔν</foreign>,—is questioned by many. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The subject of unity is examined into in book IX. </note> <note type="footnote"> G </note> <pb n="82"/>

            since plurality is opposed to unity,1 it is also the province of <lb/>
            one science to speculate into negation and privation, on <lb/>
            account of both kinds of inquiry being possible in the case of <lb/>
            unity, of which there is the negation or the privation, either <lb/>
            absolutely affirmed that such does not reside therein, or in a <lb/>
            certain genus thereof. In this case, indeed, therefore, the <lb/>
            difference is present in unity with the exception of that which <lb/>
            is inherent in negation, (for negation is the absence of that.) <lb/>
            And in privation, also, is there a certain subject nature of <lb/>
            which the privation is predicated. Now, plurality is opposed <lb/>
            to unity; wherefore, also, the things that are in opposition to <lb/>
            those that have been mentioned-namely, both diversity, and <lb/>
            dissimilarity, and inequality, and as many other qualities as <lb/>
            are denominated either according to the same, or according <lb/>
            to plurality and unity-it is the province of the science of <lb/>
            metaphysics that we have alluded to, to examine into; among <lb/>
            the number of which, also, a certain one is contrariety; for <lb/>
            contrariety is a certain difference, but difference is diversity.</p>
          <p>5. This unity of <lb/>
            ontology not <lb/>
            destroyed by <lb/>
            the diversity in <lb/>
            meaning of its <lb/>
            subject-matter.</p>
          <p>Wherefore, since unity is spoken of in various <lb/>
            ways, these, also, shall in many ways be spoken <lb/>
            of; but, nevertheless, it is the province of one <lb/>
            science to make known all such; for even though <lb/>
            unity be spoken of in many ways, on that <lb/>
            account it is not the province of a different science to in­ <lb/>
            vestigate them : if, however, neither the definitions are <lb/>
            capable of being reduced in accordance with one, nor in <lb/>
            reference to one, then is it the province of a different science. <lb/>
            But since all such are referred to what is first-as, for <lb/>
            example ;as many things as are styled one are spoken of <lb/>
            in reference to the first one-in the same manner may the <lb/>
            assertion be made, that this science is concerning sameness <lb/>
            and diversity, and the rest of the contraries. Wherefore, in <lb/>
            dividing how many modes each is expressed by, in this way <lb/>
            must reference be made to what is first or original in each <lb/>
            category, in order to ascertain how it is expressed in reference <lb/>
            to that. For things will be denominated partly by reason <lb/>
            of having those primaries, and partly that they are causes of <lb/>
            them, and partly according to other such modes. There­ <lb/>
            fore, is it evident, as has been stated in the doubts, that it is <note type="footnote"> 1 Vide book IX. chap. vi. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Vide book IV. chap.vi, and book IX. chap. L </note> <pb n="83"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. II.] </note> <lb/>
            the province of one science to institute an inquiry concerning <lb/>
            these and concerning substance. But this was one of those <lb/>
            inquiries that have been mentioned in the doubts.</p>
          <p>And it is the part of the. philosopher to be <lb/>
            able to speculate about all the foregoing sub­ <lb/>
            jects of inquiry. For, if it be not the province <lb/>
            of the philosopher, who shall there be that will <lb/>
            be likely to examine whether he be the same <lb/>
            person, Socrates, and Socrates sitting; or whether <lb/>
            one be contrary to one, or what a contrary is, <lb/>
            6. The fore­ <lb/>
            going subjects, <lb/>
            subjects of in. <lb/>
            quiry for the <lb/>
            ontologist, <lb/>
            proved; first, <lb/>
            from the ana­ <lb/>
            logy of number, <lb/>
            &amp;c. <lb/>
            or in how many ways it is denominated? In like manner, also, <lb/>
            is it in the case of the rest of such points for investiga­ <lb/>
            tion. Since, therefore, these of themselves are affections <lb/>
            of unity, so far forth as it is unity, and of entity, so far forth <lb/>
            as it is entity, but not so far forth as they are numbers, <lb/>
            .or lines, or fire, it is evident that it is the province of <lb/>
            that science of ontology to make known both what these are, <lb/>
            and the accidents that are inherent in them. And not in <lb/>
            this respect do they err who examine concerning these, as <lb/>
            not philosophising, but because substance, about which they <lb/>
            understand nothing, is a thing prior in existence. Since, as <lb/>
            there are peculiar affections of number, as far as it is number, <lb/>
            (for instance, oddness, evenness, commensurability, equality, <lb/>
            excess, defect,) and as these both absolutely and relatively <lb/>
            to one another are inherent in numbers, and since in a similar <lb/>
            way there are other peculiar qualities, in what is solid and inca­ <lb/>
            pable of motion, and in what is being moved, both that which <lb/>
            is without weight, and that which has weight, so, also, in <lb/>
            entity, so far forth as it is entity, are there certain peculiar <lb/>
            properties; and these are they about the truth of which it is <lb/>
            the province of the philosopher or ontologist to inquire.</p>
          <p>Now, a proof of this is the following:1 for <lb/>
            dialecticians and sophists assume, indeed, the <lb/>
            same figure as the philosopher, (for sophistical <lb/>
            7. Secondly, <lb/>
            from a reference <lb/>
            to dialectics. <lb/>
            is only apparent wisdom, and dialecticians dispute about <lb/>
            all things ;) to all, however, is entity common. But they <lb/>
            dispute concerning these, evidently, from the cause of these <lb/>
            being proper subjects of inquiry for philosophy. For, in- <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristotle seems to think that for the sophist or dialectician ta <lb/>
            claim the title of philosopher was a mere piece of assumption; and, <lb/>
            Indeed, to discuss at all subject of ontology. See note, p. 63. </note> <note type="footnote"> C2 </note> <pb n="84"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK III. </note> <lb/>
            deed, sophistry and dialectics are employed about the same <lb/>
            genus as philosophy is ; but philosophy differs from the one <lb/>
            in the mode of power, and from the other in the choice <lb/>
            of life.1 And again, dialectic science is merely tentative <lb/>
            of the knowledge of those things that philosophy has already <lb/>
            actually reached; but sophistic science is only apparent, and <lb/>
            8. Thirdly, from <lb/>
            the reduction of <lb/>
            contraries to <lb/>
            unity. <lb/>
            not real. And the same is further proved from <lb/>
            the fact that a different co-ordination of con­ <lb/>
            traries is privation, and all things are referred <lb/>
            to entity and nonentity, and to unity and <lb/>
            plurality: as, for instance, rest in its nature partakes of <lb/>
            unity, and motion of plurality. But that entities and <lb/>
            substance are compounded of contraries almost all men <lb/>
            acknowledge-all, at least, assert the first principles to be <lb/>
            contraries: according to some, indeed, these principles being <lb/>
            odd and even; and according to others, hot and cold; and <lb/>
            according to others, finite and infinite ; and others, harmony <lb/>
            and discord. But all the rest of such are referred appar­ <lb/>
            ently to unity and plurality; for let this reduction be received <lb/>
            by us as is done in the first book of our work “Concerning the <lb/>
            Good.” 2 Now, there it appears that first principles, both <lb/>
            altogether and as is acknowledged by others, fall under these <lb/>
            genera.</p>

          <p>From these statements, therefore, is it also <lb/>
            evident that to investigate entity, so far forth <lb/>
            as it is entity, is the province of one science. <lb/>

            posed from contraries: but the first principles, also, of <lb/>
            contraries are unity and plurality; and these are belonging <lb/>
            to the department of one science, whether the predication <lb/>
            be made according to one or not, as, perhaps, the truth is. <lb/>
            But, nevertheless, even though unity be spoken of in many <lb/>
            ways, to the first will the rest be reduced, and the contraries in <lb/>
            like manner. And for this reason, even though entity and unity <lb/>
            be not universal and the same, in the case of all things, or <lb/>
            separable, as, perhaps, they are not, yet some things, no doubt, <lb/>
            are referred to unity, but others to that next in order; and <lb/>
            for this reason it is not the business of the geometer to in­ <lb/>
            vestigate into what the contrary is, or the perfect, or unity, <lb/>

          <p>BUT we must determine whether it is the <lb/>
            province of one science,1 or a different one, to spe­ <lb/>
            culate concerning axioms, as they are called, in <lb/>
            mathematics; and concerning substance? Doubt­ <lb/>
            less, it is manifest that it is belonging to one, and <lb/>

            that the science of the philosopher, and the investigation of <lb/>

            inherent, but not in any genus separate distinctly from the <lb/>
            rest. And all investigators employ them, indeed, because <lb/>
            they belong to entity, so far forth as it is entity; each genus, <lb/>

            they comprise the genus about which they bring forward <lb/>
            their demonstrations. Wherefore, since it is evident that <lb/>
            they are inherent in all things, as far as they are entities, (for <lb/>
            this is held by these in common,) the speculation of them <lb/>
            belongs to the philosohper, whose business it is to make <lb/>
            known the truth concerning entity,1 so far forth as it is entity, <lb/>
            and concerning these. Therefore, no one of those who are <lb/>
            partial inquirers attempts to say aught concerning these, <lb/>
            whether they are true or not, neither, for instance, the <lb/>
            geometer nor the arithmetician.</p>
          <p>2. An apparent <lb/>
            shown not to be <lb/>
            a real exception <lb/>
            to the forego­ <lb/>
            ing.</p>
          <p>Some of the natural philosophers, however, <lb/>
            in doing so, act reasonably; for they alone are <lb/>
            accustomed to think that it is their province <lb/>
            to examine concerning the whole of nature, <lb/>
            and concerning entity. But since there is something of a <lb/>
            higher order than the physical,2 (for nature is merely one <lb/>
            certain genus of entity,) the investigation in regard of these <lb/>
            should belong to the universal, and to that which is specu­ <lb/>
            lative of the first'substance. Now, I admit there is a certain <lb/>
            wisdom, namely, even the physical; but it is not the first <lb/>
            As many things, however, as certain of those who speak con­ <lb/>
            cerning the truth of axioms attempt to lay down, in what <lb/>
            way they ought to be admitted, they do this from ignorance <lb/>
            of analytics ;3 for they ought to approach such a subject who <lb/>
            are instructed therein beforehand : but whilst hearers they <lb/>
            should not be investigators. That, therefore, it is the part <lb/>
            of the philosopher, and of the inquirer concerning substance <lb/>
            in its entirety, so far forth as it is such by nature, to examine, <lb/>
            also, in regard of syllogistic principles, is evident.</p>

            the first princi­ <lb/>

            this principle <lb/>
            is,and on what <lb/>

          <p>But it is becoming that one especially furn­ <lb/>
            ishing information about each genus should be <lb/>
            competent to speak of the very surest principles <lb/>
            of the thing; and, therefore, the same holds true <lb/>
            of a person that is engaged in the investiga- <note type="footnote"> 1 As is shown in book V. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 These words prove that Aristotle was aware of the importance of <lb/>

            tion of entities, so far forth as they are entities—I mean, <lb/>
            that he should be able to adduce the most firm principles of <lb/>
            all. Now, this is the philosopher; and the most firm first <lb/>
            principle of all is that concerning which there can be no <lb/>
            possibility of deception, for such must needs be that which is <lb/>
            most known; for those points respecting which men do not <lb/>
            impart knowledge are all exposed to deception in; and it <lb/>
            must needs, likewise, be a thing independent of hypothesis. <lb/>
            For a principle which one must be in possession of who under­ <lb/>
            stands any entity whatsoever, this is not an hypothesis; but <lb/>
            what one must make known, in the manifestation of anything <lb/>
            whatsoever, he must also needs come forward furnished with <lb/>
            this. That, therefore, indeed, such is the most firm first prin­ <lb/>
            ciple of all is evident. Now, what this principle is we shall <lb/>
            after this declare. For the same thing to be present and not be <lb/>
            present at the same time in the same subject, and according to <lb/>
            the same, is impossible, (and whatsoever things we have further <lb/>
            defined, let these be so defined in respect of their logical diffi­ <lb/>
            culties.) This, however, is the most firm of all first principles; <lb/>
            for it involves the distinction spoken of above. For it is impos­ <lb/>
            sible to suppose that anything whatsoever is the same, and is <lb/>
            not the same, as certain think that Heraclitus 2 asserts; for <lb/>
            it is not necessary, as far as concerns what one asserts to <lb/>
            exist, to suppose that these also do exist. But if it is not ad­ <lb/>
            missible that contraries at the same time should subsist in the <lb/>
            same subject, (now the usual definitions have been additionally <lb/>
            made by us to this proposition,) and if an opinion contrary <lb/>
            to an opinion be that of contradiction, it is evident that it is <lb/>
            impossible for the same inquirer to suppose that at the same <lb/>
            time the same thing should be and not be; for one labouring <lb/>
            under deception in regard of this would entertain contrary <lb/>
            opinions at the same time. Wherefore, all who employ de­ <lb/>
            monstration reduce the matter to this last opinion ;for by <lb/>
            nature this, also, is the first principle of all the rest of the <lb/>
            axioms. <note type="footnote"> 1 By a reference to the doubts enumerated in book II., we shall see <lb/>
            that Aristotle has already laid out for himself the inquiry now pursued. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Asclepius defends Heraclitus, and maintains that Aristotle con. <lb/>

            of demonstra­ <lb/>
            tion.</p>
          <p>Now, there are certain philosophers who, as <lb/>
            we have intimated, themselves both affirm that <lb/>
            it is possible that the same thing may and may <lb/>
            not be, and that they really think so. This prin­ <lb/>
            ciple, however, do many of the investigators of <lb/>
            Nature employ. But we just now have assumed it as a thing <lb/>
            impossible, in the case of an entity, that it should be and not <lb/>
            be at the same time ; and by means of this have we demon­ <lb/>
            strated that this is the most firm of all first principles. Now, <lb/>
            some also demand a demonstration of this, from ignorance; <lb/>
            for it is ignorance the not knowing what things one ought to <lb/>
            seek a demonstration of, and of what things he ought not. For, <lb/>
            indeed, upon the whole, it is impossible that there should be <lb/>
            a demonstration of all things; for one would go on in this <lb/>
            case to infinity, so that there would not be any demonstration <lb/>
            at all in this way. If, however, there be some things of <lb/>
            which we should not seek a demonstration, what they in pre­ <lb/>
            ference require such a first principle to be they have not the <lb/>
            2. This anomaly <lb/>
            confirmed. <lb/>
            ability to affirm. But it is possible to demonstrate <lb/>
            concerning this, by refutation, that it is impossible, <lb/>
            if only he would affirm anything who doubts; but if he <lb/>
            makes no assertion, it would be ridiculous the seeking an argu­ <lb/>
            ment against him who had not a reason to put forward about <lb/>
            anything, so far as he had no such reason ; for an adversary of <lb/>
            this sort, as far now as he is such, would be like unto a plant. <lb/>
            Now, I say, demonstration by refutation differs from demon­ <lb/>
            stration simply or properly so called, because he that employs <lb/>
            demonstration would seem to require what is the principle in <lb/>
            the beginning; but, on the supposition of the existence of <lb/>
            another cause of such a kind, it would be a refutation, and <lb/>
            not a demonstration.</p>
          <p>3. Seven argu­ <lb/>
            ments against <lb/>
            those who say <lb/>
            that contradic­ <lb/>
            tions are true <lb/>
            first argument.</p>
          <p>Now, a commencement of a discussion in <lb/>
            regard of all such points is, not the demand­ <lb/>
            ing the declaration that either a thing exists <lb/>
            or doth not exist, (for this, one would imagine, <note type="footnote">1 This dogma, by many thus supposed as originating with the <lb/>
            Heraclitics, Aristotle now proceeds to discuss in the most ample man* <lb/>
            ner. In ranking it as a tenet of the school of the physicists, or <lb/>
            natural philosophers, he points at Heraclitus, or probably to the <lb/>
            followers of Democritus and Protagoras. </note> <pb n="89"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. IV.] </note> <lb/>
            perhaps, was the asking the principle assumed originally,) but <lb/>
            the demanding the signification, at least, of a thing, both <lb/>
            as for oneself and for another. For this also amounts to <lb/>
            a necessity, if he is to say anything at all; for if he does not, <lb/>
            there would be no possibility of a rational discussion with <lb/>
            such a one, neither for himself relatively to himself, nor to <lb/>
            another. If any one, however, would grant this, there will be <lb/>
            a demonstration in existence; for now will there actually be <lb/>
            in existence something that has been determined. But the <lb/>
            cause is not the person demonstrating, but the person sus­ <lb/>
            taining1 the argument; for, by overturning the discussion, <lb/>
            he yet sustains the discussion. And further,2 he that ac­ <lb/>
            quiesces in this, hath acquiesced in the truth of something <lb/>
            independent of demonstration; so that not everything would <lb/>
            be so and not so.</p>
          <p>In the first place, indeed, therefore, it is evi­ <lb/>
            dent that this very assertion is true, because <lb/>
            the name signifies the existence or the non- <lb/>
            existence of this particular thing; so that not <lb/>
            everything would be so, and not so in this parti- <lb/>
            4. Deductions <lb/>
            therefrom; first, <lb/>
            that the name <lb/>
            of a thing is sig­ <lb/>
            nificant with the <lb/>
            unity of itself. <lb/>
            cular way. Further, if man signifies one thing, let this be a <lb/>
            two-footed animal. Now, I say, that this signifies one thing; <lb/>
            if this be man, whatever is a man, this, namely, the being <lb/>
            a two-footed animal, is the being in man: but there is no dif­ <lb/>
            ference should any one assert that more is thereby signified, <lb/>
            provided only they have been reduced under proper defini­ <lb/>
            tions; for grant that upon each definition a different name <lb/>
            may have been imposed. Now, I say, for example, if he <lb/>
            would not assert that man signifies one, but many things, <lb/>
            of one of which there is a single definition, namely, two- <lb/>
            footed animal, yet, also, are there many others, but defined <lb/>
            according to number; for its own proper denomination might <lb/>
            be set down according to each of the definitions. But if its <lb/>
            proper denomination should not be thus set down, but one <lb/>
            would say that such signified an infinity of things, it is pal­ <lb/>
            pable that there would not be a definition of it at all; for the <lb/>
            signifying not any one thing is the signifying nothing. And <note type="footnote"> 1 That is, in the endeavour made by such to overturn the contra <lb/>
            diction, the very statements which he makes, by the mere force of truth, <lb/>
            conduct him to a refutation of himself. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This clause is inserted in Didot’sedition. </note> <pb n="90"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK. III. </note> <lb/>
            when the denominations are devoid of meaning, there is an <lb/>
            end to mutual discussion, and, also, in reality, to discussion <lb/>
            on the part of a man with himself. For it is not possible <lb/>
            that a person should understand anything that is not capable <lb/>
            of understanding one thing: but, if it were possible, one <lb/>
            name would be imposed on this thing. Let it, doubtless, be <lb/>
            granted, as has been stated in the commencement, that a <lb/>
            name significant of something be significant of one thing also.</p>
          <p>5.Secondly, <lb/>
            that the being, <lb/>
            and the not <lb/>
            being, of man, <lb/>
            are not the <lb/>
            same either <lb/>
            nominally or <lb/>
            really.</p>
          <p>It is not, therefore, possible that being in man <lb/>
            signifies the same particular thing as the not being <lb/>
            in man, if man is significant not merely of what is <lb/>
            predicated of one, but even one thing itself; for <lb/>
            this we do not require that the one should signify <lb/>
            that which is predicated of one: since, if the <lb/>
            case stands in this way, at least, the musical, and the white, <lb/>
            and the man, would signify one thing; so that all things <lb/>
            would be one, for they would be synonymous; and it will <lb/>
            not be possible that the same thing be and not be, save by <lb/>
            equivocation; just as if we would call any one a man whom <lb/>
            others would call a not-man. The subject of doubt, how­ <lb/>
            ever, is not this, if it is possible that the same thing at the <lb/>
            same time should be and not be the man nominally, but really. <lb/>
            But if the name man, and the name not-man, do not signify <lb/>
            anything different, it is evident that the not being man will <lb/>
            not differ from the being man. Wherefore, the being man will <lb/>
            be the not being man, for they will be one thing; for this sig­ <lb/>
            nifies that they are one-as a tunic and a cloak-if there is <lb/>
            one definition of each. And if they shall be one, the being <lb/>
            man and the not being man signify one thing: but it hap <lb/>
            been demonstrated that they signify a different thing.</p>
          <p>6. This con­ <lb/>
            clusion con­ <lb/>
            firmed in the <lb/>
            case of “ non <lb/>
            ens."</p>
          <p>There is a necessity, therefore, of this con­ <lb/>
            sequence, if there be a particle of truth in the <lb/>
            assertion, that man in signification is equipol­ <lb/>
            lent with being a two-footed animal; for this was <lb/>
            what the expression man was assumed to signify. Now, <lb/>
            if there exists a necessity that this be the case, it is not pos­ <lb/>
            sible for this very thing not to be a two-footed animal then, <lb/>
            for this doth the phrase, “the being a necessity," signify, <lb/>
            namely, the impossibility of its not being man. Accordingly, <lb/>
            it is not possible to be true to say at the same time that the <lb/>
            same thing is both a man and is not a man. But there <pb n="91"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. IV.] </note> <lb/>
            prevails the same mode of reasoning in the case of the not <lb/>
            being man also; for the being of a man and the not being <lb/>
            of a man signify a different thing, if, truly, both the being <lb/>
            white and the being man are different; for much more is <lb/>
            there opposition in this case to justify the difference of signi­ <lb/>
            fication. But if, also, one would say that the white signifies <lb/>
            one and the same thing with the being man, again will we <lb/>
            make the same assertion, as has been declared on a former oc­ <lb/>
            casion, namely, that all things will be one, and not merely things <lb/>
            in opposition. But, if this be not possible, that which has been <lb/>
            declared will happen, if the question asked be answered.</p>
          <p>If, however, when a simple question is put, <lb/>
            one subjoin negations also, the question actu­ <lb/>
            ally put is not replied to: for nothing hinders <lb/>
            the same thing being both man and white, and <lb/>
            7. An unfair <lb/>
            mode of treat­ <lb/>
            ing this point <lb/>
            stigmatized. <lb/>
            other things ten thousand in multitude; but, nevertheless, if <lb/>
            the question be asked, if it is true to affirm man to be <lb/>
            this, or not to be so, the reply should be, that it signifies <lb/>
            one thing, and no addition should be made that it is <lb/>
            both white and large. For, also, it is impossible to go <lb/>
            through accidents when, at least, they are infinite; either, <lb/>
            therefore, let one go through all or none. In like manner, <lb/>
            therefore, if, also, ten thousand times over they are the same <lb/>
            thing, namely, man and not man, the reply to the question, <lb/>
            if man is, should not be that at the same time also not man <lb/>
            is, unless the reply likewise states, in addition, the rest of <lb/>
            whatsoever things are accidents, as many as are so, and as <lb/>
            many as are not; if this, however, be not done by the person <lb/>
            asked the question, there is nothing under discussion at all.</p>
          <p>But, in general, they who make this assertion <lb/>
            overturn substance 1 and essence, or the formal <lb/>
            cause and very nature of a thing; for they must <lb/>
            themselves needs affirm all things to be accidents, <lb/>
            and that the essence of man or animal, whatsoever <lb/>
            it be, has no existence. For if there will exist the <lb/>

            ment against <lb/>
            those who say <lb/>
            that contradic­ <lb/>
            tions are true <lb/>
            they do away <lb/>
            the TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">τι ἧν <lb/>
            είναι</foreign>. <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristotle's line of argument against this dogma is to show that it <lb/>
            quite destroys our notions of substance, and form, and definition, and <lb/>
            essence; that, if we admit its reality, we must deny the possibility of <lb/>
            anything like absolute predication, which, joined to the absurdity of <lb/>
            viewing all things as accidents, seems to overturn any arguments the <lb/>
            sceptics can bring forward. </note> <pb n="92"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK III. </note> <lb/>
            essential nature of anything whatsoever, such as is that <lb/>
            which is to be man this will not be to be not man, or not to <lb/>
            be man, although these are negations of this; for it was one <lb/>
            thing which it signified, and this was the substance of a <lb/>
            certain thing. But the signification of the substance of <lb/>
            a thing is, that not anything else is the being of that thing: <lb/>
            but if the being whatsoever man is will be found in this, <lb/>
            being either whatsoever is not man, or whatsoever not is <lb/>
            man, is a thing impossible; for it will be a something dif­ <lb/>
            ferent. Wherefore, it will be necessary for them to say that <lb/>
            a formal and substantial definition of this kind, and one <lb/>
            invariably suited unto the subject, will be one of a nonentity: <lb/>
            but all things, as we have supposed, are according to acci­ <lb/>
            dent ;for in this lies the distinction between substance and <lb/>
            accident, for the white is an accident in man, because he is <lb/>
            white, but not anything whatsoever that is white.</p>
          <p>9. Therefore <lb/>
            they deny the <lb/>
            existence of <lb/>
            anything, save <lb/>
            accident.</p>
          <p>But, if all things are spoken of according <lb/>
            to accident, there will be no primary universal, <lb/>
            if an accident always signifies a predication <lb/>
            about a certain subject.1 There is a necessity, <lb/>
            then, of going on in a progression to infinity. But this is <lb/>
            impossible, (for more than two of such are not connected2 <lb/>
            together,) for accident is not a thing that is accidental to <lb/>
            that which is an accident, unless that both are accidental <lb/>
            '.n the same subject. Now, I say this, for example, in the <lb/>
            instance of the white being musical, and the latter being <lb/>
            white, because both are accidents in man; but not on this <lb/>
            account is Socrates musical, because it happens that both are <lb/>
            accidents in a certain other subject. Since accidents, there­ <lb/>
            fore, are spoken of some in this way and some in that, as <note type="footnote"> 1 Of course, every accident involves some subject or other, wherein <lb/>
            it resides, and whereof it is predicated. This constitutes the very <lb/>
            notion of an accident. Vide book V. chaps, ii. iii. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 There is a difference of opinion amongst the commentators as to <lb/>
            the meaning of this passage. Alexander makes out that Aristotle's <lb/>
            meaning is to lay down that no more than two accidents can be simul­ <lb/>
            taneously predicated of a subject; e.g. Hippocrates is the most skilful <lb/>
            doctor. Ammonius, on the other hand, adopts quite a different view, <lb/>
            and says that what the Stagyrite intends to affirm is, that no more <lb/>
            than two definitions are to be found in a proposition, and he refers to <lb/>
            the explanation of the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄ</foreign>pos, in the Prior Analytics, book I. chap. L <lb/>
            Vide note, p. 251, in Mr. Ower's Translation of Aristotle's Organon, <lb/>

            many as are so expressed, as the white in Socrates, it is not <lb/>
            possible should be infinite in an ascending series of productions <lb/>
            in the case of man; as, for example, that in Socrates the <lb/>
            white there should be some other different accident, for any one <lb/>
            thing is not produced from all: nor, truly, in the white will <lb/>
            be found any different accident; as, for instance, the musical: <lb/>
            for, also, in no wise rather is this an accident in that, than <lb/>
            that in this. And, at the same time, the distinction has been <lb/>
            made that some things are accidents after this manner, <lb/>
            but others, as the musical in Socrates. But as to as many <lb/>
            things as are accidental in this way, such are accidents not in <lb/>
            such a way as an accident in what is accidental; but this is <lb/>
            the case with whatsoever is accidental in that other way. <lb/>
            Wherefore, all things will not be spoken of according to <lb/>
            accident; something, then, will there be significant, also, as <lb/>
            of substance; and if this be so, it has been demonstrated <lb/>
            that it is impossible that at the same time contradictions <lb/>
            should be predicated of the same subject.</p>
          <p>Further, if all contradictions are true at the <lb/>
            same time concerning the same thing, it is mani­ <lb/>
            fest that all things will be one. For the same <lb/>
            thing will it be, both a trireme, and a wall, and a <lb/>
            man, if it is possible to affirm or deny anything <lb/>
            10. Aristotle's <lb/>
            third argument; <lb/>
            viz. that this <lb/>
            theory would <lb/>
            end in an irra. <lb/>
            tional Pan­ <lb/>
            theism. <lb/>
            of everything, as there is a necessity for those to do who <lb/>
            assert the opinion of Protagoras. For if, also, to any one a <lb/>
            man seems not to be a trireme, it is evident that he will not be <lb/>
            a trireme : wherefore, also, he is, if the contradiction be true. <lb/>
            And, doubtless, comes to pass a saying of Anaxagoras : 1 "at <lb/>
            the same time subsist together all things," so that, in reality, <lb/>
            nothing is one. The indefinite, therefore, they seem to speak <lb/>
            of, and, thinking that they mention entity, they talk about <lb/>
            nonentity; for an entity in capacity, and not in actuality, <lb/>
            constitutes the indefinite. But, doubtless, must we say to <lb/>
            the authors of this hypothesis, that of everything either an <lb/>
            affirmation or a negation must be predicated; for it would be <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristotle alludes to the It Homœomery” of Anaxagoras, according <lb/>
            to which no one body differed from another in its elementary composi­ <lb/>
            tion; and that what constituted the apparent diversity was the predo­ <lb/>
            minance of any one element over the rest; all of which he affirmed <lb/>
            were contained equally in one substance as in another. Vide Cudworth, <lb/>
            vol. III. p. 84; and Tenneman's History of Philosophy, p. 79, translated <lb/>
            in " Bohn's Philological Library." </note> <pb n="94"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK III. </note> <lb/>
            absurd if in each thing there will be inherent the negation of <lb/>
            itself, but that the negation of what is different, and which is <lb/>
            not inherent therein, will have no existence. Now, I say, <lb/>
            for example, if it is true to assert of a man that he is not a <lb/>
            man, it is manifest also that he is not a trireme; if, indeed, <lb/>
            therefore, there is truth in the affirmation, there is a necessity <lb/>
            that also there be truth in the negation : but if there is not <lb/>
            truth in the affirmation, the negation, at least, of a trireme <lb/>
            will more appertain to him than the negation of himself. If, <lb/>
            therefore, that also be true, there will also be truth in the <lb/>
            negation of the trireme ;and if in the negation of this, in the <lb/>
            affirmation also. And these consequences happen to those <lb/>
            who make such a statement, even to the effect that it is not <lb/>
            necessary to employ either affirmation or negation. For, if <lb/>
            it is true that the same individual is man and not man, it is <lb/>
            evident that such a one will be neither man nor not man; for of <lb/>
            those two qualities there are two negations. But if that is one <lb/>
            which is composed of both, this one would also be in opposition.</p>
          <p>1. Fourth ar­ <lb/>
            gument, drawn <lb/>
            from the nature <lb/>
            of affirmation <lb/>
            and negation, <lb/>
            in the case of <lb/>
            the same sub­ <lb/>
            ject.</p>
          <p>Further, indeed, respecting all things it is so ; <lb/>
            and a thing will be white and not white, and entity <lb/>
            and nonentity, and it will be so respecting the <lb/>
            rest of the assertions and negations in a similar <lb/>
            manner; or this will not be the case, but only <lb/>
            so regarding some, and not regarding others. <lb/>
            And if, doubtless, it were not so respecting all, these would <lb/>
            be indisputable ; but if it be true concerning all, again, no <lb/>
            doubt, in the case of whatsoever there is an assertion <lb/>
            there will also be a negation; and in the case of whatsoever <lb/>
            there is a negation there will likewise be an assertion ; or in <lb/>
            the case of whatsoever there is an assertion there will also be <lb/>
            a negation; or of whatsoever, indeed, there is an assertion <lb/>
            there is also a negation: but of whatsoever things there is <lb/>
            a negation, of all such there will not be an assertion. And if <lb/>
            this be so, there would be something indubitably a non­ <lb/>
            entity, and this will be a firm opinion; and if to be a non­ <lb/>
            entity be something both firm and known, more firm would be <lb/>
            the opposite assertion. And if, in like manner, also, it is <lb/>
            necessary that in the case of whatsoever things one employs <lb/>
            a negation he should employ an affirmaton also, it would <lb/>
            be true, undoubtedly, by dividing, to say either that a thing, <lb/>
            for instance, is white, and again that it is not white, or that <pb n="95"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. IV.] </note> <lb/>
            this would not be true. And if,indeed, it is not true, by <lb/>
            dividing, to say so,1 he does not affirm these things, and there <lb/>
            is nothing in existence; but how can one speak of non­ <lb/>
            entities, or understand anything respecting them, or thus <lb/>
            move forward in the paths of knowledge? And all things <lb/>
            would be one, as it has been said heretofore, and both man, <lb/>
            and god, and trireme, and the contradictions of them, will be <lb/>
            the same. But if,in like manner, this be so in the case of <lb/>
            each thing, in no wise will one thing differ from another; <lb/>
            for if there will be a difference, this will be true, and a <lb/>
            peculiarity of this. In like manner, also, if it is possible that <lb/>
            he who makes the division should speak the truth, there <lb/>
            happens that which has been declared. And to this reason we <lb/>
            may subjoin the following : that all would speak the truth, <lb/>
            and all would speak falsely, and one would acknowledge him­ <lb/>
            self to be speaking what is false. At the same time, however, it <lb/>
            is evident that the investigation with such a person is con­ <lb/>
            cerning nothing; for he affirms nothing. For neither in this <lb/>
            manner nor in that is the assertion made with such a one, <lb/>
            but in this manner and not in this manner. And again, at <lb/>
            least, with respect to these points he makes a negation of <lb/>
            both, because the assertion is made that they are neither so <lb/>
            in this manner nor not in this manner, but both in this <lb/>
            manner and not in this manner; for, if this were not the case, <lb/>
            there would now be in existence something that has been <lb/>
            defined. Further, if when an assertion be true the negation be <lb/>
            false, and if when the latter itself be true the affirmation be false, <lb/>
            it would not be possible at the same time to assert and deny the <lb/>
            same thing with truth. But, perhaps, persons will say that <lb/>
            this is what has been laid down from the commencement.</p>
          <p>Further, does one who supposes that in a <lb/>
            manner a thing either is so and so, or that it is <lb/>
            not so, labour under a misapprehension ? but he <lb/>
            who thinks that it is both, does he speak truth, <lb/>
            12. Fifth argu­ <lb/>
            ment, drawn <lb/>
            from the nature <lb/>
            of truth. <lb/>
            or can he verify his assertion ? for if he affirms truth, <lb/>
            what is the assertion, save that such is the nature of entities ? <lb/>
            and if he does not affirm the truth, but rather he speaks truth <lb/>
            who makes a supposition in that way, entities, in such a case, <lb/>
            would, in a certain manner, be now disposed thus; and would <note type="footnote"> I This reasoning must lead one to an assertion of nihilism, which <lb/>

            this be true and not so at the same time, and yet, in reality <lb/>
            not true? But if, in like manner, all both speak falsehooc <lb/>
            and speak truth, it is not possible for such either to utter of <lb/>
            to declare anything, for at the same time he says the same <lb/>
            things and not the same things. But if he makes no s up­ <lb/>
            position, but in the same way thinks and does not think, in <lb/>
            what way will he be disposed differently from plants ?1</p>
          <p>13. Sixth argu­ <lb/>
            ment, founded <lb/>
            on the assump­ <lb/>
            tion that one <lb/>
            thing may be <lb/>
            better than an­ <lb/>
            other.</p>
          <p>Whence, also, it is especially manifest that no <lb/>
            one either of the rest of the sceptics, or of those <lb/>
            making this statement, is so affected. For why, <lb/>
            may I ask, does he walk towards Megara,2 but <lb/>
            not remain still, thinking that he is actually <lb/>
            walking ?nor straightway, at dawn, does he proceed to a <lb/>
            well or a precipice ? if he may chance to meet with such, he, <lb/>
            however, appears cautious, as not considering the falling into <lb/>
            it to be not good and to be good in the same sense. It is <lb/>
            evident, accordingly, that the one he considers preferable, <lb/>
            but the other as not preferable. And, if this be the case, <lb/>
            both the one he must needs consider a man and the other <lb/>
            not a man; and the one thing sweet, and the other not <lb/>
            sweet. For not as of equal importance cloth he investi­ <lb/>
            gate and regard all things, inasmuch as he thinks it better <lb/>
            to drink water and to visit a certain person, and then seeks, <lb/>
            in point of fact, for those very things. Although he ought <lb/>
            to seek for all things with equal zest, if, in like manner, <lb/>
            it were the same thing—I mean to say, both man and not <lb/>
            man. But, as has been declared, there is no one who does <lb/>
            not appear cautious in regard of the one set of things and <lb/>
            not so in regard of the other. Wherefore, as it appears all <lb/>
            men suppose that the case is absolutely so, if not concerning <lb/>
            all things, at least, concerning what is better and worse. <lb/>
            Now, if they do so not from scientific knowledge, but from <lb/>
            opinion, much more must attention be paid to truth; just as <lb/>
            also the health of one that is diseased must be looked after <lb/>
            more than that of a person that is sound : for he that in­ <lb/>
            dulges in theory or surmise, compared with one possessed of <lb/>
            scientific knowledge, is not healthfully disposed towards truth. <note type="footnote"> 1 This is Didot's reading.

            in the same manner assert an untruth who thinks four five, <lb/>
            as he who thinks it a thousand. If, therefore, he be not <lb/>
            deceived, in the same manner, it is evident that the other is <lb/>
            less deceived in this way, so that he affirms what is more <lb/>
            true. If, therefore, that which is more true be more imme­ <lb/>
            diate to the truth, there would be something true, at least, to <lb/>
            which what is more contiguous will be more true. And <lb/>
            even if nothing should be true, yet now, at any rate, is <lb/>
            there something that is more firm and more true than <lb/>
            another; and so in this way would we be liberated from that <lb/>
            intemperate theory alluded to, and one which forbids the <lb/>
            definition of anything mentally.</p>

          <p>Now, from the same opinion originates also <lb/>
            the theory of Protagoras; and in like manner <lb/>
            is there a necessity that both of them should <lb/>
            be or not be capable of verification. For if <lb/>

            of the hypo­ <lb/>
            thesis of Prota­ <lb/>
            goras. <lb/>
            all things that seem so are true, and if all things that are <lb/>
            apparent are true, then must all things, at the same time, be <lb/>
            true and false. For many entertain contrary opinions to one <lb/>
            another; and those who do not happen to think the same with <lb/>
            themselves they regard as victims to delusion; so that the <lb/>
            same thing must needs be and not be. And, if this be the <lb/>
            case, it is necessary that all things that seem so should be <lb/>
            true; for opposite sentiments do they hold with one <lb/>
            another who speak falsehood and who speak truth. If, then, <lb/>
            things be so, all will speak truth: that from the same opinion, <lb/>
            then, both of these theories originate is evident. <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristotle still continues his attack on these sceptics; and having <lb/>
            shown that the chief objection to this dogma lies in this, that if it be <lb/>

          <p>There does not, however, exist the same method <lb/>

            such philosophers, for some of them require per­ <lb/>
            suasion, and some compulsion. For as many, <lb/>
            indeed, as have formed opinions in this way from <lb/>
            doubt, the ignorance of these is remediable, for <lb/>
            the refutation is directed towards not the theory, <lb/>
            but the understanding; and as many as speak for argument's <lb/>
            sake, refutation is a cure also of these, both of that discourse <lb/>
            which consists in voice,2 and of that which consists in names. <lb/>
            But unto those persons who labour under doubt in this way <lb/>
            has the opinion itself originated from sensibles ;the opinion, <lb/>
            I mean, that contradictions and things contrary subsist <lb/>
            together, inasmuch as they see contraries arising from the <lb/>
            same thing. If, therefore, it is not possible that nonentity <lb/>
            should come into existence, in a similar way, according to <lb/>
            them, must the thing have pre-existed, namely, as both con­ <lb/>
            traries at once ; as also Anaxagoras 3 says and Democritus, <lb/>
            that everything was mingled in everything; for, also, this <lb/>
            latter philosopher maintained that vacuity and fulness are <lb/>
            similarly resident in any part whatsoever, although the one of <lb/>
            these is entity and the other nonentity.</p>

            false.</p>
          <p>Respecting, indeed, therefore, those who form <lb/>
            their opinions from these data we will say <lb/>
            that in a certain manner they speak correctly, <lb/>
            and that in a certain sense they are involved in <lb/>
            ignorance. For entity is spoken of in a twofold point of <lb/>
            view; so that it is in a way admissible that something <lb/>
            should arise from that which has no being, and that <lb/>
            it is in a way not admissible that it should be so; and <lb/>
            that the same thing at the same time should be an entity <lb/>
            and a nonentity, but not according to the same entity; for <lb/>
            in capacity, no doubt, is it admissible at the same time for <lb/>
            the same thing to be contraries, but in actuality not so. <note type="footnote"> 1 This is a wise course to pursue in the conduct of any philosophic <lb/>

          <p>And, in like manner, also, has the truth <lb/>
            respecting the things apparent reached some <lb/>

            cided by plurality or fewness; but the same thing seems <lb/>
            sweet to some on tasting it, and to others bitter. Where­ <lb/>
            fore, if all persons were sick, or all beside themselves,2 but two <lb/>
            or three were sound in health, or in possession of their mind, <lb/>
            it would happen that these latter would appear to be ill and <lb/>
            labouring under an aberration of intellect, but that the rest <lb/>
            would not seem so. Further, to many of the rest of the <lb/>
            animal creation8 do contraries appear to be the same thing <lb/>
            as well as to us ; and to each very person with himself things <lb/>
            do not always, according to sense, appear to be the same : <lb/>
            which description of these, therefore, is true or false is <lb/>
            obscure; for nothing the more is this true than that, but <lb/>
            both in like manner are affected as regards truth. Wherefore, <lb/>
            Democritus says, at least, that, positively, either nothing is <lb/>
            true, or that, if it be so, that to us it is wrapped 4 in obscurity.</p>
          <p>But, upon the whole, on account of their sup­ <lb/>
            posing prudence, no doubt, to be sense, and that <lb/>
            this sense constitutes an alteration, these persons <lb/>
            affirm that the apparent, according to sense, is <lb/>

            Empedocles and Democritus, and each of the other philoso­ <lb/>
            phers, so to speak, have become entangled in opinions of <lb/>
            this sort. For Empedocles, also, asserts that those changing <lb/>
            their habit change their prudence ; witness his words <lb/>
            " For for the present counsel varies in men." <lb/>
            And in other passages he says, that <lb/>
            " As far as diverse men become, so far <lb/>
            Is present, also, in them always diverse thought." <lb/>
            And Parmenides evinces the same mode of thinking; for <lb/>
            instance, in the words :— <lb/>
            “For as each has a tempering of graceful limbs, <lb/>
            So present in man is mind. For the same thing <lb/>
            With whatever thinks is the nature of limbs in men, <lb/>
            Both every and all, for more than this is mind." <lb/>
            And the apothegm of Anaxagoras, also, is remembered <lb/>
            amongst certain of his associates ; namely, that entities are <lb/>
            such to them as they may have supposed them. Now, they <lb/>
            say that even Homer seems to have been in possession of this <lb/>
            opinion, because he made Hector, after he was deranged from <lb/>
            the wound, to lie in a delirious state; as if even those of <lb/>
            unsound mind were capable of exercising thought, indeed, <lb/>
            but not the same thoughts as with those of sound mind. It <lb/>
            is evident, therefore, if both be exertions of prudence, that <lb/>
            also entities subsist in this way, and not in this way, at the <lb/>
            same time.</p>
          <p>6. Their acata­ <lb/>
            lepsythe result, <lb/>
            first, of confin­ <lb/>
            ing observation <lb/>
            merely to ob­ <lb/>
            jects of sense.</p>
          <p>Wherefore, also, most difficult is that which <lb/>
            ensues from this theory; for if they who par­ <lb/>
            ticularly perceived as true that which it is <lb/>
            admissible should be true, (but these are they <lb/>
            who especially seek after it and love it;) if <lb/>
            these persons hold such opinions, and manifest such tenets <lb/>
            respecting truth, how is it not becoming those to despair who <lb/>
            attempt to philosophise ? for the pursuit of things eluding <lb/>
            their grasp would constitute the investigation of truth. <lb/>
            But a cause of this opinion of theirs is the following : <lb/>
            that from time to time they have examined into the truth, <lb/>
            concerning entities, no doubt, but the entities they have sup­ <lb/>
            posed to be sensibles merely. Now, in these is inherent <note type="footnote"> constitute the senses the criterion of truth; and the dogma of the <lb/>
            truth of the apparent follows from this in the way of an easy con­ <lb/>
            sequence. </note> <pb n="101"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH.V.] </note> <lb/>
            much of the nature of the indefinite and that of entity, which <lb/>
            subsists in such a manner as we have declared. Wherefore <lb/>
            they speak naturally ; but they do not speak things that are <lb/>
            true. For so is it more in harmony for them to speak after <lb/>
            this manner than as Epicharmus1 in his reply to Xeuophanes.</p>
          <p>But, moreover, seeing the whole of this visible <lb/>
            nature in motion, but respecting what is being <lb/>
            changed seeing nothing verified,—regarding, at <lb/>
            7. Secondly, <lb/>
            from their no­ <lb/>
            tions about <lb/>
            change. <lb/>
            least, what is being changed altogether and everywhere,-they <lb/>
            considered that verification was not a thing that is possible: <lb/>
            for from this hypothesis blossomed that most extreme opinion <lb/>
            of those philosophers mentioned just now; namely, that of <lb/>
            those speculators who professed to adopt the philosophy of <lb/>
            Heraclitus, and such as Cratylus2 held, who at last was of <lb/>
            opinion that one ought to speak of nothing, but moved <lb/>
            merely his finger; and who rebuked Heraclitus for saying <lb/>
            that it is not possible to enter the same river twice: for <lb/>
            he himself was of opinion that you could not do so once.</p>
          <p>In reply, however, to this theory we will also <lb/>
            say, that there is some foundation in reason for <lb/>
            their supposing with these, that that which <lb/>
            undergoes a change, when it does change, may <lb/>
            not be considered as existing. This, however, <lb/>
            8. The Heracli­ <lb/>
            tic dogma, not <lb/>
            entirely desti­ <lb/>
            tute of truth, is <lb/>
            argued against <lb/>
            in five ways. <lb/>
            is a circumstance attended with doubtfulness, for the rejecting <lb/>
            substance retains something of that which is rejected; and of <lb/>
            that which is being produced must there now necessarily <lb/>
            exist something: and if, in short, it is undergoing corruption, <lb/>
            there will subsist a certain entity; and if it is being pro­ <lb/>
            duced, there must needs be that from which it is produced, <lb/>
            and by which it is generated, and that this process goes not on <lb/>

            ments, let us make those assertions following; namely, that <note type="footnote"> 1 Epicharmus was a native of Cos, and a pupil of Pythagoras; he <lb/>

            tity goes, it does not abide the same; but it is according to <lb/>
            form that we know all things. But, further, it is worth <lb/>
            while reproving those who think thus, because, although <lb/>
            knowing the number of sensibles themselves, and that in <lb/>
            the case of the fewer number of sensibles this state of flux <lb/>
            and mutation was to be found, they have yet manifested <lb/>
            similar sentiments respecting the whcle heaven.1 For the <lb/>
            place about us, of what is sensible, continues alone to subsist <lb/>
            in a condition of corruption and generation; but this in no <lb/>
            wise, so to say, is part of the universe : wherefore, more <lb/>
            justly would it be, on account of the greater number of wit­ <lb/>
            nesses, to have acquitted these, than on account of these, the <lb/>
            fewer, to have condemned those. And, further, is it evident <lb/>
            that in reply, also, to these we may use the same arguments <lb/>
            with those that have been originally laid down by us; for <lb/>
            that there is some nature immovable has been demonstrated <lb/>
            to their satisfaction, and has gained their assent. It happens, <lb/>
            however, to those, at least, who say that a thing is and is <lb/>
            not at the same time, to affirm all things to be in a state of <lb/>
            rest, rather than of motion; for, on this hypothesis, there <lb/>
            exists nothing into which anything is changed, for all things <lb/>
            are inherent in all.</p>
          <p>9. The truth of <lb/>
            the apparent <lb/>
            argued against, <lb/>
            first, in the dif­ <lb/>
            ference between <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἴσθησις</foreign> and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">φαντασία</foreign>.</p>
          <p>Regarding, however, the truth that not every­ <lb/>
            thing that is apparent is true, in the first place, <lb/>
            indeed, it might be replied, that sense, to be sure, <lb/>
            is not deceitful in what falls within its own <lb/>
            peculiar province, but that imagination is not the <lb/>
            same with sense. It is worthy of consideration and wonder, in <lb/>
            the next place, if they really are in doubt of this, whether mag­ <lb/>
            nitudes are so great, and colours such as they appear to those <lb/>
            at a distance, or such as they appear to those that are near? <lb/>
            and whether they are such as they appear to persons in <lb/>
            health, or such as they appear to persons in sickness ? and, in <lb/>
            regard of weight, whether things more weighty are such as <lb/>
            appear so to the weak, or such as seem so to the strong? and <note type="footnote"> I Aristotle's idea of the heaven was, that it was endued with an <lb/>
            eternal existence, and that the stars that rolled along its surface were <lb/>
            either themselves actually gods, or the spheres where the gods resided, <lb/>
            as the soul does in our bodies. Book VIII. c. vili. </note> <pb n="103"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. V.] </note> <lb/>
            lastly, in respect of truth, whether things are true such an <lb/>
            appear so to the sleeping, or such as seem so to those who <lb/>
            are awake? for that they do not, in reality, think so, at least, <lb/>
            is evident; for no one, if even he supposes when asleep by <lb/>
            night that he were in Athens, when he is in Libya, goes, <lb/>
            when he awakes, to the Odeion.1</p>
          <p>And, further, respecting the future, as also <lb/>
            Plato says, doubtless, not similarly decisive is <lb/>
            the opinion of the physician and that of the <lb/>
            ignorant quack; for example, as to the likelihood <lb/>
            that one will be sound, or that one will not be <lb/>
            so: and, further, in the case of the senses them­ <lb/>
            selves, not similarly decisive is the testimony <lb/>
            10. Secondly, <lb/>
            in the different <lb/>
            degrees of cre­ <lb/>
            dit to be at­ <lb/>
            tached to the <lb/>
            testimony of <lb/>
            the senses <lb/>
            themselves in <lb/>
            different cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances. <lb/>
            of sense in respect of what is foreign, and in respect of <lb/>
            what is its peculiar province, or of that which is near <lb/>
            and of that which is remote from itself. But respecting <lb/>
            colour it is sight and not taste that judges; and respect­ <lb/>
            ing juices it is taste but not sight, each of which never <lb/>
            at the same time affirms about the same thing that <lb/>
            simultaneously a thing is so and not so disposed. But <lb/>
            neither in a different period have the senses doubted <lb/>
            about the passion, at least, to which they are subject, but <lb/>
            about that in which the passion is an accident. Now, I say, <lb/>
            for example, that the same wine, either from being changed, <lb/>
            or from the bodily organ being changed, might so appear at <lb/>
            one time to be sweet, and at another time not sweet; but the <lb/>
            sweet then, at least, when it is sweet is not such, for it never <lb/>
            has undergone a change; but always verification thereof is <lb/>
            possible, and of necessity is it that such will be a thing that <lb/>
            is sweet. All these theories, however, overturn this con­ <lb/>
            clusion, since, also, if there is not a substance of anything <lb/>
            neither is there anything necessarily subsisting; for it is not <lb/>
            admissible for the necessary to be at one time disposed one <note type="footnote"> I The Odeion is mentioned by Plutarch in his Life of Pericles. It <lb/>
            was built by Pericles in imitation of the king of Persia's pavilion. <lb/>
            Here the contests for prizes in music were decided. This is a practical <lb/>
            argument against his opponents; for the phenomenon of dreaming <lb/>
            shows that though things may appear so and so to them, yet that they <lb/>
            do not in their conduct, when they awake from such dreams, make it <lb/>
            manifest that they consider the real and the apparent as the same: <lb/>
            they thus acknowledge, though perhaps unwillingly, one case where <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ φαινόμενον</foreign> is not <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἀληθές</foreign>. </note> <pb n="104"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK III. </note> <lb/>
            way, and at another time another : wherefore, if there is <lb/>
            anything of necessity, it will not be disposed both so and <lb/>
            not so.</p>
          <p>11. Thirdly,that <lb/>
            it would lead to <lb/>
            a system of <lb/>
            nihilism, and <lb/>
            a denial of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>.</p>
          <p>If, also, upon the whole, what is sensible exists <lb/>
            merely, nothing would there be subsisting, inas­ <lb/>
            much as animated beings would have no exist­ <lb/>
            ence ; for sense would have no existence. Perhaps, <lb/>
            then, on the supposition of the non-existence of sense, the <lb/>
            truth would be, that neither sensibles nor sensations exist, <lb/>
            (for of the percipient is sense an affection;) but that it is im­ <lb/>
            possible that the subjects themselves which produce sense <lb/>
            have not any existence, even though sense exist not. For, <lb/>
            doubtless, sense itself is not of itself; but there is something <lb/>
            else, also, different from, and independent of, sense, which <lb/>
            must needs be prior to sense; for the moving cause is prior <lb/>
            in nature to that which is being moved: and if these asser­ <lb/>
            tions are made one with another, not a whit the less is the <lb/>
            same theory true.</p>

          <p>1. The absurd­ <lb/>
            ity of scepti­ <lb/>
            cism practically <lb/>
            acknowledged <lb/>
            by sceptics <lb/>
            themselves.</p>
          <p>BUT there are some who doubt and are sceptics <lb/>
            both amongst those who are persuaded of the <lb/>
            reality of these opinions and those who merely <lb/>
            affirm these theories, for they ask, who is it that <lb/>
            judgeth him that is in good health, and him <lb/>
            that, upon the whole, is capable of forming his decision cor­ <lb/>
            rectly about each particular ? Now, doubts of such a sort <lb/>
            as this are similar -to one's doubting whether we now sleep <lb/>
            or are awake. For all such doubts are tantamount to the <lb/>
            same; for these persons demand that there should be a reason <lb/>
            of all things: for they seek for a first principle, and expect to <lb/>
            obtain this by demonstration, whereas, at least, that they are <lb/>
            not persuaded of the validity of their position they make <lb/>
            manifest in their acts. But, as we have said, this is the <lb/>
            characteristic property 2 of these philosophers, for they seek <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristotle still continues to overthrow this fundamental principle <lb/>
            of the sceptical philosophy; adapting his refutations to the nature of <lb/>
            his adversaries' ground. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ πάθος</foreign>—that is, this is their constitutional error; meaning that <lb/>
            the great fault in the philosophy of these theorists was that they </note> <pb n="105"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH VI.] </note> <lb/>
            for a reason of things of which there is no reason; for the <lb/>
            principle of demonstration is not demonstration. These, <lb/>
            therefore, indeed, would be easily persuaded of this, for it is <lb/>
            not difficult to apprehend.</p>
          <p>They, however, who seek in reason compulsion <lb/>
            merely, seek an impossibility; for what is contrary <lb/>
            they deem it right to speak, immediately utter­ <lb/>
            ing contrary things. But if all things are not <lb/>
            2. If the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ <lb/>
            φαινόμενον</foreign> be <lb/>
            true, all abso­ <lb/>
            lute existences <lb/>
            are denied. <lb/>
            relatives, but some are also themselves by themselves, that <lb/>
            is, absolute, in such a case everything apparent would not be <lb/>
            true, for the apparent is apparent to some one : therefore, <lb/>
            he that says that all things apparent are true, makes all <lb/>
            entities relatives. Wherefore, also, must the precaution be <lb/>
            adopted by those who seek for compulsion in reason, and at <lb/>
            the same time, also, think right to subjoin a reason that not <lb/>
            the apparent is true, but that the apparent is true to whom­ <lb/>
            soever it appears so, and when it appears, and how far, and in <lb/>
            what manner.</p>
          <p>But if they subjoin a reason, to be sure, but do <lb/>
            not in this way subjoin it, it will happen speedily <lb/>
            unto them that they should speak things that <lb/>
            are contrary. For it is possible for the same <lb/>
            3. Admitting <lb/>
            these, there is a <lb/>
            sense in which <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ φαινό­ <lb/>
            μενον</foreign> is true. <lb/>
            thing to appear honey, as far as the sight goes, and not to <lb/>
            appear so to the taste; and, as we have two eyes, not the same <lb/>
            will a thing appear to each organ of vision if they be dis­ <lb/>
            similar. Whereas, in reply to those, at least, who, on account <lb/>
            of the causes originally enumerated, affirm the apparent to be <lb/>
            true, and for this reason contend that all things in like <lb/>
            manner are false and true; in reply to these, I say, it may <lb/>
            be affirmed that neither the same things appear the same to <lb/>
            all men, nor to the same person do the same things invaria­ <lb/>
            bly appear the same,1 but frequently things contrary at <lb/>
            the same time; for the touch, in the alteration of the fingers, <lb/>
            says that there are two objects, but the organ of sight one; <note type="footnote"> required a demonstration of everything, forgetting that there were <lb/>
            certain ultimate principles which must be assumed as the basis of all <lb/>
            reasoning, and, as such, are themselves indemonstrable. This subject is <lb/>
            well handled by the metaphysicians in modern days. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Anyone familiar with the writings of modern sceptics, e.g. Thomas <lb/>
            Hope, in his " Origin and Prospects of Man," will remember the use <lb/>

            system. </note> <pb n="106"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK III. </note> <lb/>
            but neither to the same sense, at least, do the same things <lb/>
            seem the same, and according to the same, and in like man­ <lb/>
            ner, also, in the same moment of time: wherefore, this would <lb/>
            be true. But, perhaps, for this cause it is necessary to say to <lb/>
            those who speak not on account of doubt, but for talk's sake, <lb/>
            that this is not absolutely true, but that it is true relatively <lb/>
            to this person.</p>
          <p>4. The general <lb/>
            ground of objec­ <lb/>
            tion to the truth <lb/>
            of the apparent.</p>
          <p>And, as doubtless it has been formerly af­ <lb/>
            firmed, it is necessary, also, to make all things <lb/>
            relative, both in reference to opinion and sense; <lb/>
            so that nothing either has been produced or will arise except <lb/>
            on the supposition of some person previously exercising <lb/>
            thought. But if anything has been generated or will arise, <lb/>
            it is evident that all things would not be according to <lb/>
            opinion. Further, if one thing exists, it exists in relation to <lb/>
            one, or in relation to a definite thing ;and if the same thing <lb/>
            is both half and equal, such exists in relation to these ; yet <lb/>
            the equal is not in reference to the double. Now, in relation <lb/>
            to opinion, if man and the subject of the opinion be the <lb/>
            same, man will not be the thinking subject, but the subject <lb/>
            of opinion. But if each thing will be in relation to the <lb/>
            thinking subject, the thinking subject will subsist in re­ <lb/>
            lation to things infinite in species. That, indeed, there­ <lb/>
            fore, most indisputable of all is the opinion, that assertions <lb/>
            in opposition are not at the same time true; and what happens <lb/>
            in the way of consequence unto those who say that they are. <lb/>
            true, and why they say so, let thus much suffice to have been <lb/>
            spoken.</p>
          <p>5. To say that a <lb/>
            contradiction of <lb/>
            the same thing <lb/>
            is true is to say <lb/>
            that contraries <lb/>
            maybe found <lb/>
            in the same <lb/>
            subject.</p>
          <p>But since it is impossible that contradiction <lb/>
            should be true of the same subject at the same <lb/>
            time, it is evident that neither can contraries pos­ <lb/>
            sibly subsist at the same time in the same subject. <lb/>
            For, indeed, of contraries one or other is not the <lb/>
            less privation. But privation of substance is ne­ <lb/>
            gallon from some definite genus. If, therefore, it is im­ <lb/>
            possible at the same time to affirm and deny with truth, it is <lb/>
            impossible that also contraries should be inherent in the <lb/>
            same subject at the same time; but either both must be in. <lb/>

          <p>BUT, truly, neither is it possible that there is <lb/>
            any mean between a contradiction; but there <lb/>
            is a necessity either of asserting or denying <lb/>
            any one thing whatsoever of one. Now, in <lb/>
            the first place, this is evident to those who de- <lb/>
            1. No mean is <lb/>
            there between <lb/>
            contradiction <lb/>
            proved; first, <lb/>
            from the nature <lb/>
            of truth and <lb/>
            falsehood. <lb/>
            fine what truth and falsehood are. For, indeed, the asser­ <lb/>
            tion that entity does not exist, and that nonentity does, is a <lb/>
            falsehood, but that entity exists, and that nonentity does not <lb/>
            exist, is truth. Wherefore, the person who affirms that this <lb/>
            medium is in existence or is not will speak truth or utter <lb/>
            falsehood. But neither is entity nor nonentity said not to <lb/>
            exist or to exist.</p>
          <p>Further, either will there be a mean between <lb/>
            contradiction, as that of a darkish colour between <lb/>
            black and white, or it will be as that which is <lb/>
            neutral between man and horse. If, therefore, <lb/>

            from the <lb/>
            change involved <lb/>
            in the notion of <lb/>
            contradiction. <lb/>
            this subsist in this way, there would be no change, (for a <lb/>
            change takes place from something that is not good into that <lb/>
            which is good, or from this latter into what is not good;) but <lb/>
            now it is always apparent as taking place, for there is not a <lb/>
            change existing but one into opposites and media. If, how­ <lb/>
            ever, there is a mean, so also would there be a certain pro­ <lb/>
            duction into a thing that is white, not from that which is <lb/>
            dot white; but this is not perceived as being the case.</p>
          <p>Further, everything intelligible and mental the <lb/>
            understanding either affirms or denies; and this is <lb/>
            manifest from definition when truth is spoken or <lb/>

            as an assertion or negation, truth is spoken; but when in that <lb/>
            way, falsehood. Further, must there be in all contradictions a <lb/>
            mean, save where the assertion is made only for argument or <lb/>
            talk's sake, so that also one will neither utter truth nor not <lb/>

            undertakes to prove to be false, namely, as to there being a mean <lb/>

            decided is, that if we ask, are contradictions true, or can they be so, we <lb/>
            must reply that they cannot. Vide p. 88. </note> <pb n="108"/>

            something in subsistence : wherefore, besides generation and <lb/>
            corruption, some change will there be. Moreover, in whatso­ <lb/>
            ever genera negation introduces tne contrary, in these also will <lb/>
            be found this medium; as, for example, in numbers a number <lb/>
            neither odd nor not odd: such, however, is impossible, and from <lb/>
            the definition is this evident. Further, would we go on in a pro­ <lb/>
            gression to infinity, and not only will there be sesquialterate <lb/>
            entities, but even more than this. For, again, it will be possible <lb/>
            to deny this in regard of the assertion and negation of the me­ <lb/>
            dium of the former contradiction; and this will be something, <lb/>
            for there will be a certain other substance of this. Moreover, <lb/>
            as to the question if a thing is white when one says that it is <lb/>
            not, nothing has he denied than that it is; but that a thing <lb/>
            is not, amounts to a negation.</p>

            of paradox.</p>
          <p>But from the same source as other paradoxes <lb/>
            has this opinion reached unto certain speculators; <lb/>
            for when they are unable to solve arguments open to dispute, <lb/>
            giving in to reason, they consent to the truth of whatever is <lb/>
            brought out by syllogism. Some, therefore, make assertions <lb/>
            from some such cause as this, but others on account of re­ <lb/>
            quiring in their investigations the reason of all things.</p>
          <p>5. The impor­ <lb/>
            tance of defini­ <lb/>
            tion in this <lb/>
            question mani­ <lb/>
            festa the dif­ <lb/>
            ferencebetween <lb/>
            Heraclitus and <lb/>
            Anaxagoras.</p>
          <p>The principle, however, in respect of all these, <lb/>
            is to be derived from definition. But definition <lb/>
            arises from their necessarily signifying some­ <lb/>
            thing ; for the sentence of which the name is a <lb/>
            sign becomes the definition of a thing. And the <lb/>
            theory of Heraclitus, affirming all things to be <lb/>
            and not to be, appeared to make all things true; but that <lb/>
            of Anaxagoras1 was, that there is a certain medium between <lb/>
            contradiction; so that all things are false, for when they are <lb/>
            mingled, neither is the mixture good nor not good : where­ <lb/>
            fore, there is nothing that one can affirm as true. <note type="footnote"> 1 Asclepius has a curious remark on this passage. He compares <lb/>
            Anaxagoras in his theory of " the mixture of all things in all" to the <lb/>
            Manichaeans. The Manichæans, not being able to solve their perplex­ <lb/>
            ities as to the existence of evil, assumed the existence of a distinct <lb/>
            first principle thereof; and, in like manner, the school of Anaxagoras <lb/>
            adopted their dogma, from not being cognisant of the various reso­ <lb/>
            lutions into different forms assumed by matter, while the matter in <lb/>
            itself, per <unclear>se</unclear>, remained the same. Vide Tenneman, ss. 107, 199. </note> <pb n="109"/>

          <p>Now, these distinctions having been laid down, <lb/>
            it is evident that the predications made in one <lb/>
            way only, and also those that are made about all, <lb/>
            it is impossible should be as certain affirm they <lb/>
            are; some, indeed, saying that nothing is true; (for <lb/>
            nothing, they say, hinders all things from being <lb/>

            true, some all <lb/>
            things to be <lb/>
            true, and some <lb/>
            that all things <lb/>
            are true and all <lb/>
            false. <lb/>
            in such a way as that the diagonal of a square is commensu­ <lb/>
            rable 2 with its side;) but others affirming that all things are <lb/>
            true. For almost all these assertions are the same with those <lb/>
            of Heraclitus; for this philosopher, in affirming that all things <lb/>
            are true and all things false, affirms also separately each of <lb/>
            these theories. Wherefore, if those are impossible, it is im­ <lb/>
            possible, likewise, that these should be so.</p>
          <p>But, further, are those palpably contradictions <lb/>
            which, likewise, it is not possible should at the <lb/>
            same time be true. Nor, doubtless, is it possible <lb/>
            2. General <lb/>
            mode of refu­ <lb/>
            tation from <lb/>
            definition. <lb/>
            that all should be false, although, at least, it would the rather <lb/>
            seem to be admissible from what has been stated. But, in <lb/>
            reply to all such theories, must the question be asked, (as also <lb/>
            has been declared in the discussions above,) not if there is <lb/>
            something or if there is not, but if something has a significa­ <lb/>
            tion. Wherefore, from the definition is the discussion to be <lb/>
            drawn, by assuming what falsehood or truth signifies. But if <lb/>
            the true and the false be nothing else than to assert what is <lb/>
            true or deny what is false, it is impossible that all things be <lb/>
            false ; for it is necessary that either portion of the contradic­ <lb/>
            tion be true. Further, if it be necessary either to assert or <lb/>
            deny everything, it is impossible for both to be false; for either <lb/>
            part of the contradiction is false. <note type="footnote"> 1 In this chapter there is a sort of recapitulatory view given of the <lb/>
            sceptical dogma previously under examination. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Aristotle thus illustrates the system of these sceptics by this prin­ <lb/>
            ciple, which is geometrically false, and must be so, because the side of <lb/>
            a square is to its diagonal as 1: √2, between which there is plainly no <lb/>
            number to be found that will measure both. This principle dep ends on <lb/>
            a quality of numbers, viz. that if we square two numbers of which one <lb/>
            is greater than the other, and yet is not quite the double of the smaller, <lb/>
            two other numbers will be the result, one of which will be less than the <lb/>
            quadruple of the other, without being either double or triple cf it. </note> <pb n="110"/>

          <p>Truly, also, doth the common sayingl happen <lb/>
            unto all such theories, that they overthrow or <lb/>
            stultify themselves. For the person that says <lb/>

          <p>It is evident, however, that neither they <lb/>
            who lay down that all things are at rest speak <lb/>
            the truth, nor they who say that all things <lb/>
            are in motion. For if, indeed, all things are <lb/>
            at rest, the same things will always be true and false. Now, <lb/>
            this appears to be a thing undergoing a change. For he <lb/>
            who speaks once himself was not, and again will not be. It <lb/>
            all things, however, are in motion, there will be nothing that <lb/>
            is true; all things, in that case, are false. But it has been <lb/>
            demonstrated that this is impossible. Further, must entity <lb/>
            needs undergo a change ; for from something into something <lb/>
            is the- change made. But, doubtless, neither are all things <lb/>

            subsists in such a condition of rest or motion eternally : for <lb/>
            there is something which always moves the things that are in <lb/>
            motion, and the first imparter of motion is itself immovable.2 <note type="footnote"> 1 This is the line of argument followed in the Theætetus. The <lb/>

            principle, but from the contrary a different one; but, again, <lb/>
            that is called a first principle from whence each thing would <lb/>
            spring in the most beautiful manner : as, for instance, even <lb/>
            in the case of discipline the beginning must be made some­ <lb/>
            times not from what is first, and the principle of a thing, but <lb/>
            from whence one may learn with the greatest facility. And, <lb/>
            again, that is a principle from whence is produced the first <lb/>
            of a thing that is inherent; as, for example, a keel of a <lb/>
            vessel and a foundation of a house: and some suppose the <lb/>
            heart of animals to be a thing of this sort; but others the <lb/>
            brain, and others whatever else of this kind they may happen <lb/>
            with. And, again, that is a principle from whence the first <lb/>
            of a thing not inherent is produced, and whence motion and <lb/>
            change have first been naturally fitted to commence; as, for <lb/>
            example, the child from the father and the mother, and the <lb/>
            battle from abuse. And that is a first principle according <lb/>
            to the free impulse of which things in motion are moved, and <lb/>
            things undergoing a change, are changed, as in cities do- <note type="footnote"> 1 In the dommentaries of Alexander this book stands fourth. Thomas <lb/>

            cause is as the end; this, however, is the final cause, as, for <lb/>

            motion and the end are regarded as causes; for example, of <lb/>
            health, tenuity, or purging, or medicines, or instruments, for <lb/>
            all these are on account of the end; but they differ from one <lb/>
            another in respect of being, some as instruments, and others <lb/>
            as things done. Causes, indeed, therefore, are enumerated <lb/>

          <p>And seeing that causes are thus multifariously <lb/>

            causes of the same thing, not according to acci- <lb/>
            2. Results <lb/>
            from these de­ <lb/>
            finitions. <lb/>
            dent; for instance, of the statue both the statuary art <lb/>
            and the brass, not according to anything that is different, <lb/>
            but so far forth as it is a statue ; this, however, does not take <lb/>
            place in the same manner, but the brass is as matter, and <lb/>
            the art as the origin of motion, or the efficient cause. And <lb/>
            some things are reciprocally1 causes of one another; as, for <lb/>
            example, labour of a good habit of body, and this latter, <lb/>
            again, of labour : yet not in the same manner, but the one is <lb/>
            as the end, and the other as the principle of motion. Fur­ <lb/>
            ther, the same thing sometimes is the cause of things that are <lb/>
            contrary; for that which when present is the cause of this <lb/>
            particular thing, this when absent we sometimes denominate <lb/>
            the cause of the contrary: for example, the absence of the <lb/>
            pilot is the cause of the capsizing of the boat, the presence <lb/>
            of whom is the cause of its preservation. Both, however, as <lb/>
            well the presence as the absence of the pilot, are as efficient <lb/>
            causes, that is, causes imparting motion.</p>
          <p>Now, all the causes just enumerated fall under <lb/>
            four modes the most evident. For, indeed, the <lb/>
            elements of syllables, and the matter of things <lb/>

            duced into four <lb/>
            modes. <lb/>
            constructed by art, and the fire and earth, and all such <note type="footnote"> 1 This is an important distinction, and might be illustrated further <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [BOOK IV. </note> <lb/>
            bodies, and the parts of a whole, and the hypotheses of the <lb/>
            conclusion, are causes, as that whereof other things are <lb/>
            produced. But of these some are as the subject; as, for <lb/>
            instance, the parts: but others, as the formal cause; for ex­ <lb/>
            ample, both the whole, and the composition, and the form. <lb/>
            But the seed, and the physician, and the deliberator, and, in <lb/>
            short, the maker, all are the causes of the principle of change <lb/>
            or of stability. But the rest, as the end and the good,l are <lb/>
            causes of other things; for the final cause aims at being the <lb/>
            best, and an end to the other things : let there be, however, <lb/>
            no actual difference in saying a thing is good or appears <lb/>
            good.</p>
          <p>4. Modes of <lb/>
            causes further <lb/>
            explained.</p>
          <p>These causes, indeed, therefore, are so many <lb/>
            in species, but the modes of causes are, doubt­ <lb/>
            less, many in number; these, however, become <lb/>
            less numerous by being reduced under heads. For causes <lb/>
            are called so in many ways; and of those things of <lb/>
            the same species, antecedently and subsequently, one <lb/>
            thing is the cause of another; as, for example, of health <lb/>
            the physician and the artisan, and of the diapason2 the <lb/>
            double and number, and always those things that comprise <lb/>
            anything whatsoever of singulars. But, moreover, cause is <lb/>
            denominated as the accident and the genera of these; as, for <lb/>
            instance, of a statue, in one sense, Polycletus is the cause, <lb/>
            and, in another, the statuary, because it is accidental with <lb/>
            the statuary to be Polycletus : and the things embracing <lb/>
            the accidental are causes; for instance, man is a cause of <lb/>
            a statue, or also, in general, animal, because Polycletus is <lb/>
            a man, and man is an animal. But also of the accidents <lb/>
            one is more remote, and another more contiguous than <lb/>
            others; for example, just as if the white and the musical <lb/>
            should be termed a cause of the statue, but not merely <lb/>
            Polycletus, or man. But besides all things, both those <lb/>
            that are denominated appropriately or strictly, and those ac­ <lb/>
            cording to accident, some causes are denominated as things <note type="footnote"> 1 As regards the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ</foreign> ayadd <foreign xml:lang="grc">ν</foreign> viewed as a cause, Aristotle has already <lb/>
            examined the subject in the first book. The Stagyrite ranks it as <lb/>
            a final cause; and thus most wonderfully betrays his consciousness of <lb/>
            the tie that binds moral and physical causes together. Vide Ethics, L <lb/>

            endued with a capacity, but others as things energizing; a? <lb/>
            the cause of the house being built is the builder, or the <lb/>
            builder considered as in the act of building. In like manner <lb/>
            with what has been stated will be mentioned, also, the causes <lb/>
            in the case of which there are causes; as, for example, of <lb/>
            this statue, as far forth as it is a statue, or, in general, of an <lb/>
            image, or of this brass, so far forth as it is brass, or, in <lb/>
            short, matter; and in the case of the accidents it is so in like <lb/>
            manner. Further, also, these and those shall be predicated <lb/>
            as connected together; as, for example, not Polycletus nor a <lb/>
            statuary, but Polycletus a statuary. But, however, all these, <lb/>
            at least, are six in number, yet are expressed in a twofold <lb/>
            manner. For either as a singular are they denominated, 01 <lb/>
            as the genus thereof, or as the accident, or as genus of the <lb/>
            accident, or as these connected together or simply expressed ; <lb/>
            further, all of them as energizing, or according to capacity. <lb/>
            But thus far is there a difference, that causes energizing and <lb/>
            singulars,1 and those of which they are the causes, subsist <lb/>
            at the same time and at the same time cease to be ; as, <lb/>
            for example, the person healing with that person that is <lb/>
            being restored to health, and this person the builder with <lb/>
            that which is being built. Not invariably, however, is this <lb/>
            the case with regard to causes in capacity; for not at the <lb/>
            same time sink into decay the house and the builder.</p>

            of Philosophy," who awards the credit of this distinction to Plato, <lb/>

            are divided into other voices different from them in species; <lb/>
            but, even though they be divided, the parts would be of the <lb/>
            same species ; as, for example, the portion of water is water, <lb/>
            but a portion of the syllable is not a syllable. In like <lb/>
            manner, also, do the old philosophers,1 who enumerate the <lb/>
            elements of bodies, say that they are those entities into which <lb/>
            bodies are ultimately divided ; but those no longer are <lb/>
            divisible into others different in species; and whether such <lb/>
            may be one or many, these they yet call elements. Simi­ <lb/>
            larly, also, are denominated the elements both of diagrams <lb/>
            and, in general, those of demonstrations; for the primary <lb/>
            demonstrations, and those that are inherent in many more <lb/>
            demonstrations, themselves are styled elements of demon­ <lb/>
            strations ; but of such kind are the first syllogisms, which <lb/>
            are composed of three terms by means of the one middle.</p>
          <p>2. Derived <lb/>
            meaning of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">στοιχεῑον</foreign>.</p>
          <p>And, by a transference of the meaning, they <lb/>
            hence call an element that which being one and <lb/>
            small may be useful for many purposes; where­ <lb/>
            fore, also, what is small, and simple, and indivisible, is styled <lb/>
            an element. Hence it has come to pass that those things <lb/>
            which are most especially universal are elements, because <lb/>
            each of them is one and simple, and is inherent in many <lb/>
            things, or in all, or in as many as possible ;and to some <lb/>
            speculators it seems that the one and the point are first <lb/>
            principles. Since, therefore, those things called genera are <lb/>
            universal and indivisible, (for there is one definition of them,) <lb/>
            certain persons call the genera elements; and that, too, in <lb/>
            preference to difference, for the genus is more universal. <lb/>
            For in whatsoever the difference resides, the genus also <lb/>
            follows; but in what the genus resides does not, in every way, <lb/>
            constitute the difference. Common, however, to all is the <lb/>
            characteristic that the being of the element of each body is <lb/>
            the first inherent quality in each. <note type="footnote"> 1 We have a discussion akin to this in the third book of Aristotle's <unclear/> <lb/>

          <p>NATURE1 is called, in one way, the production <lb/>
            of things that are by Nature; as, for instance, if <lb/>
            one putting forth his voice should articulate the <lb/>
            letter U: and in another, as that from which, as <lb/>
            1. Different ac­ <lb/>
            ceptations of <lb/>
            the term <foreign xml:lang="grc">φύσις</foreign>, <lb/>
            or Nature. <lb/>
            being inherent, that which is being naturally produced is <lb/>
            primarily formed. Moreover, Nature2 is the origin of the <lb/>
            earliest motion in each of the things in itself subsisting by <lb/>
            Nature, so far as it is this very thing. Now, those things are <lb/>
            said to be produced by Nature as many as involve growth <lb/>
            through another body, by means of contact and growth along <lb/>
            with, or growth beside, just as embryos. But the being <lb/>
            connascent differs from contact; for in the latter there must <lb/>
            needs be nothing else besides the touch: but in things that <lb/>
            are connate there is some one thing that is the same in both, <lb/>
            which, instead of involving contact, causes them to be con­ <lb/>
            nascent, and causes them to be one according to what is con­ <lb/>
            tinuous and involving quantity, but not according to quality. <lb/>
            Moreover, is that styled Nature from which, as its primary <lb/>
            matter, there either is or arises anything of the things that <lb/>
            subsist by Nature, being without regular motion,3 and un­ <lb/>
            changeable from the power which belongs to itself; for instance, <lb/>
            of a statue, or of brazen vessels, the brass is called the nature, <lb/>
            and of wooden vessels the wood : but in like manner is it in <lb/>
            the case of the rest. For each thing is from these, the pri­ <lb/>
            mary matter remaining in a state of conservation; for in this <lb/>
            way, also, do they affirm the elements of those things that <lb/>
            are by Nature to constitute Nature; some saying that this <lb/>
            is fire, but others, earth, and others, air, and others, water: <lb/>
            but others asserting some other such thing, and others, some <lb/>
            of these, but others, all of them. <note type="footnote"> 1 The distinctions laid down concerning the term Nature in this <lb/>
            chapter are most important. It is this very word <foreign xml:lang="grc">φύσις</foreign> which stands <lb/>

            Nature as <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρώτη <lb/>
            ὕλη</foreign>.</p>
          <p>In another way, however, Nature is styled the <lb/>
            substance of things that exist by Nature ; for in­ <lb/>
            stance, those who affirm that Nature is the earli­ <lb/>
            est synthesis, as Empedocles says that <lb/>
            " Nature is there of no one of entities, <lb/>
            But merely mixture and of things mixed, <lb/>
            A change, and thus by men is Nature styled." <lb/>
            Wherefore, as many things, also, as by Nature exist or are <lb/>
            produced, that being in existence already from which it is <lb/>
            natural that they should arise, or should have their being, <lb/>
            not as yet do we say that such is in possession of Nature, <lb/>
            unless they have the species and the form. By Nature, then, <lb/>
            subsists that which is composed from both of these, as, for <lb/>
            instance, animals and their parts. Nature, however, consti­ <lb/>
            tutes the primary matter, and this in a twofold sense,-either <lb/>
            the primary in reference to a thing itself, or, upon the whole, <lb/>
            the first; for example, of brazen works the first in reference <lb/>
            to these is the brass; and water, perhaps, in general, if the <lb/>
            primary matter of all things that are capable of being liquified <lb/>
            be water. And Nature constitutes both species and substance; <lb/>
            and this is the end of production. But now, metaphorically <lb/>
            speaking and generally, every substance is called Nature for <lb/>
            this reason, because Nature, also, is a certain substance.</p>
          <p>3. Nature in the <lb/>
            precise sense of <lb/>
            the word.</p>
          <p>Doubtless, from the things that have been <lb/>
            stated, the earliest nature, and that termed so with <lb/>
            precision, is the substance,—I mean of those things <lb/>
            possessing the principle of motion in themselves, so far forth <lb/>
            as themselves are such. For matter, in respect of its being <lb/>

          <p>NECESSARY1 is defined that without which, <lb/>
            as a co-operating cause, it is not admissible for <lb/>
            a thing to exist; as, for instance, respiration <lb/>
            and nourishment are necessary conditions for an <lb/>

            the term Neces. <lb/>
            sary. <lb/>
            animal: for without these it is impossible that an animal can <lb/>
            exist. And that is necessary without which it is not possible <lb/>
            for what is good either to subsist, or to arise, or to cast aside <lb/>
            any evil, or that any evil should be exterminated; for instance, <lb/>
            the drinking a certain medicine is a necessary precaution <lb/>
            against sickness, and the sailing to Ægina,2 against the loss <lb/>
            of one's property. Further, the compulsory and compulsion <lb/>
            are styled necessary ; but this is that which constitutes an <lb/>
            obstruction, and is capable of offering an hindrance to impulse <lb/>
            and free-will.3 For what is compulsory is styled necessary : <lb/>
            wherefore, also, is it a thing that is sad; as also Evenus4 has <lb/>
            it :— <lb/>
            It For everything necessary is a thing doleful." <lb/>
            And force, or compulsion, involves a certain necessity, as also <lb/>
            Sophocles 5 says :— <lb/>
            " But force compels me to do these things." <lb/>

            Further, that which does not admit of being otherwise than <lb/>
            it is, we say is in this way disposed as a necessary thing. And, <lb/>
            according to this acceptation of the word, what is necessary, <lb/>
            and all the other things that are so, are also, in a manner, styled <lb/>
            necessary; for the violent, or compulsory, is called necessary, <lb/>
            either in regard of action or passion, at such times as when a <lb/>
            person cannot make any move according to impulse, on ac­ <lb/>
            count of some constraining cause; so that this is a necessary <lb/>
            impulse on account of which the thing could not be other­ <lb/>
            wise. And in the case of the co-operating causes of the prin­ <lb/>
            ciple of vitality, and the good, it is so in like manner; for <lb/>
            when it is not admissible, on the one hand, to obtain, indeed, <lb/>
            the good, and on the other, to live and to exist without cer­ <lb/>
            tain things, these things then are necessary, and this cause <lb/>
            constitutes a certain necessity.</p>

            ple of necessity <lb/>
            involved in de­ <lb/>
            monstration.</p>
          <p>Further, does demonstration belong to those <lb/>
            things that are necessary,1 because it is not pos­ <lb/>
            sible that the things that are being demonstrated <lb/>
            should be otherwise, if the thing be absolutely <lb/>
            demonstrated; but causes of this are things primary, which <lb/>
            it is impossible should subsist otherwise than they do; out of <lb/>
            which is formed the syllogism. Of some things, truly, is there <lb/>
            a different cause from themselves of their being necessary, <lb/>
            but of others there is no such cause; but on account of these <lb/>
            are other things that are from necessity. Wherefore, what is <lb/>
            primary and what is absolute, or simple, are strictly neces­ <lb/>
            sary; for it is not possible that this can be disposed in many <lb/>
            ways: therefore, neither can it subsist in different ways at <lb/>
            different times; for on such a supposition would it now be <lb/>
            disposed in many ways. If, therefore, there are certain <lb/>
            things that are eternal and immovable, there is in them <lb/>
            nothing compulsory or contrary to Nature. <note type="footnote"> 1 This is a quality inherent in demonstrative truth, which has given <unclear/> <lb/>

          <p>ONE is called that which subsists as such <lb/>
            according to accident in one way, and in another, <lb/>
            that which subsists essentially. A thing is called <lb/>
            one according to accident; for instance, Coriscus <lb/>
            and what is musical, and the musical Coriscus; <lb/>
            for it is one and the same thing to say, Coriscus <lb/>
            1. One, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕν</foreign>, <lb/>
            distinguished <lb/>
            into " one per <lb/>
            accidens" and <lb/>
            "one per se;" <lb/>
            different mean. <lb/>
            ings of " one <lb/>
            per accidens." <lb/>
            and what is musical, as to say, Coriscus the musician; also, <lb/>
            to say the musical and the just is one with saying the just <lb/>
            musician Coriscus. For all these are called one according <lb/>
            to accident; the just, indeed, and the musical, because they <lb/>
            are accidents in one substance; but what is musical and <lb/>
            Coriscus, because either is an accident in the other. Like­ <lb/>
            wise, also, in a certain sense, the musical Coriscus is one with <lb/>
            Coriscus, because either of the parts of those that are in <lb/>
            this sentence is an accident in the other; as, for example, <lb/>
            what is musical in Coriscus and the musical Coriscus in just <lb/>
            Coriscus, because one portion of either is an accident in the <lb/>
            same one. For there is no difference whether what is musical <lb/>
            is an accident in Coriscus, or Coriscus the just in the <lb/>
            musical Coriscus. In like manner, however, will one be <lb/>
            denominated according to accident, though it should be pre­ <lb/>
            dicated of the genus, or of some universal names; as, for <lb/>
            instance, if man were said to be the same with a musical <lb/>
            man: for that it should be so either because the musical <lb/>
            is an accident in the man being one substance, or because <lb/>
            both are accidents in any one of those which are singulars, <lb/>
            as in Coriscus; nevertheless, both are not inherent in the <lb/>
            same manner, but the one, perhaps, as genus and in the sub­ <lb/>
            stance, and the other, as a habit or passion of the substance. <lb/>
            Therefore, as many things as are expressed according to <lb/>
            accident are styled one after this manner.</p>
          <p>But of things denominated one essentially, <lb/>
            some are styled so on account of their being con- <lb/>
            2. Definitions <lb/>
            of "one per se," <lb/>
            according to <note type="footnote"> 1 We have now laid before us the various significations that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔν</foreign> has. <lb/>
            The <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἕν</foreign> we must bear in mind is in metaphysics a synonyme with the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ὄν</foreign>, and therefore equally with it, as Aristotle has already shown, the <lb/>
            subject-matter about which ontology is conversant. Vide books III. <lb/>

            different modes <lb/>
            of continuity. <lb/>
            tinuous; as, for instance, a bundle1 held together <lb/>
            by a string and a piece of wood by glue ; and <lb/>
            a line, even though it be curved, yet, if it be continuous, is <lb/>
            called one; as also each of the parts of the body: for in­ <lb/>
            stance, a leg and an arm. Now, of these very things those <lb/>
            are more one which by nature are continuous than those that <lb/>
            are continuous by art. But that is called continuous of <lb/>
            which the motion is one essentially, and also which it is not <lb/>
            possible should be otherwise. And motion is one when it is <lb/>
            indivisible, and indivisible according to time ; those things, <lb/>
            however, are essentially continuous as many as are not one <lb/>
            by contact; for if you were to place sticks touching one <lb/>
            another, you would not say that these are one, either one <lb/>
            piece of wood, or one body, or anything else that is continu­ <lb/>
            ous. And, indeed, in general, things that are continuous <lb/>
            are called one, even though they may have a curve, and still <lb/>
            rather things that have not a curve; thus the leg and thigh <lb/>
            are more one than the leg and foot together, because it is pos­ <lb/>
            sible that the motion of the leg and foot be not one. And <lb/>
            the straight line is one rather than the curved line. But the <lb/>
            curved, and that which has an angle, we call both one and <lb/>
            not one, because it is admissible that both the motion of the <lb/>
            whole should not be at the same time, and yet that at the <lb/>
            same time should be the motion of a part;2 but part and <lb/>
            the whole of a straight line are always at the same time in <lb/>
            motion together, and no such portion as involves magnitude <lb/>
            partly remains at rest and partly is in motion, as of a line <lb/>
            that is curved.</p>
          <p>3. Things one <lb/>
            where the ulti­ <lb/>
            mate subject is <lb/>
            the same.</p>
          <p>Further, in another way a thing is called one <lb/>
            in respect of the subject being in species indif­ <lb/>
            ferent or destitute of a difference. But things <lb/>
            that are indifferent are those of which the form, <lb/>
            according to sense, is indivisible, and the subject is either <lb/>
            the first or the last in respect of the end. For both wine <lb/>
            is called one and water one, so far forth as either is indi­ <lb/>
            visible according to the form; and all fluids are styled one, as <note type="footnote"> 1 This word, which is sometimes erroneously written <foreign xml:lang="grc">φάκελλος</foreign> <lb/>
            instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">φάκελος</foreign>, means the same as the Latin " fasciculus," and is <lb/>
            found in Herodotus, Melp. iv. 62. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 I have followed Taylor's most clear and admirable translation of <lb/>
            these words. </note> <pb n="123"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VI. ] </note> <lb/>
            oil, wine, and things that are soluble, because the ultimate <lb/>
            subject of all these is the same; for all these are, in reality, <lb/>
            water and air. But those things are styled one, also, of which <lb/>
            the genus is one, differing by opposite differences. And all <lb/>
            these are called one because one genus is the subject of the <lb/>
            differences; for instance, horse, man, dog, is a certain one <lb/>
            because all of them are animals; and, doubtless, they are one <lb/>
            in some similar manner as the matter is one. These things, <lb/>
            however, sometimes in this way are styled one, and some­ <lb/>
            times the superior genus is regarded one, which is deno­ <lb/>
            minated the same, if those higher up than these be the <lb/>
            ultimate species of the genus; as, for example, the isosceles, <lb/>
            to be sure, and the equilateral, are one and the same figure <lb/>
            because both are triangles; but they are not the same <lb/>
            triangles.</p>
          <p>Further, are those things styled one the defi­ <lb/>
            nition of whatsoever of which, denominating the <lb/>
            essence of them, is indivisible, as far as regards <lb/>
            4. Things one <lb/>
            in respect of <lb/>
            definition; <lb/>
            another definition signifying the being of the thing, for every <lb/>
            actual definition is essentially indivisible. For so, also, both <lb/>
            that which has undergone increase and diminution is one <lb/>
            because the definition is one, as in the case of surfaces pos­ <lb/>
            sessing length and breadth the definition of the species is one. <lb/>
            In general, however, are those things one of which <lb/>
            the perception is indivisible ; I mean, that which <lb/>
            and of percep­ <lb/>
            tion. <lb/>
            perceives what the essence or formal principle is, and which <lb/>
            cannot be separated either in time, or place, or definition; <lb/>
            these most especially, I say, are one; and of these as many as <lb/>
            are substances.</p>
          <p>For, universally, whatever things do not in­ <lb/>
            volve division, so far forth as they have it not, <lb/>
            so far are they styled one; for example, if man, <lb/>
            as far as he is a man, has not a division, he is <lb/>
            5. Further, <lb/>
            senses of <unclear>ἕν</unclear>, or <lb/>
            " one," reduced <lb/>
            to its primary <lb/>
            signification. <lb/>
            one man; and if an animal, as far as it is an animal, is indi­ <lb/>
            visible, animal is one: but if magnitude, as far as magnitude is <lb/>
            concerned, is indivisible, magnitude is one. The most things, <lb/>
            no doubt, then, are styled one because some one different <lb/>
            thing they either effect, or suffer, or possess, or because of <lb/>
            their being relative to some one thing; but those things <lb/>
            primarily denominated one are those of which the substance <lb/>
            is one: one, however, either in continuity, or species, or <pb n="124"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK IV. </note> <lb/>
            definition; for also we reckon as plural, or many, either those <lb/>
            things that are not continuous, or those of which the form is <lb/>
            not one, or of which the definition is not one. But, further, <lb/>
            is it the case1 that we say sometimes that anything what­ <lb/>
            soever is one, provided only it involves quantity and con­ <lb/>
            tinuity; and we sometimes say that it is not one, if it be <lb/>
            not a certain whole, that is, if it does not possess one form; <lb/>
            for instance, we would not say that in like manner a shoe is <lb/>
            one, when looking at the portions of that shoe any way <lb/>
            whatsoever put together, although there may be continuity <lb/>
            involved therein: but if it be in such a position of its parts <lb/>
            as to be in reality a shoe, and to have a certain form, <lb/>
            it would already then be one. Wherefore, also, of lines <lb/>
            the circular is particularly one because it is entire and <lb/>
            perfect.</p>
          <p>6. The essen­ <lb/>
            tial quality of <lb/>
            " one " illus­ <lb/>
            trated.</p>
          <p>Of the one, however, the very essence consists <lb/>
            in this, that it is the principle of a certain <lb/>
            number; for the first measure is the principle of <lb/>
            each genus thereof; for that whereby, as primary, <lb/>
            we make a thing known, this is the first measure of each <lb/>
            genus: therefore, the first principle of that which may be <lb/>
            known constitutes, in regard of each genus, the one. But <lb/>
            the one is not the same in all the genera; for here it is <lb/>
            diesis,2 and there a vowel, or a mute; but of gravity there is <lb/>
            a different one, and of motion another. Everywhere, how­ <lb/>
            ever, is unity indivisible, either in form or in quantity. That, <lb/>
            indeed, therefore, which is indivisible according to quantity, <lb/>
            and so far forth as it is a quantity, (I mean, what is in every <lb/>
            direction indivisible, and is without position,) this is called an <lb/>
            unit or monad; but that which is in every direction indi­ <lb/>
            visible, and involves a position, is a point; and that which is <lb/>
            divisible in one direction is a line, and that capable of a <lb/>
            twofold division, a surface; but that which in every way and <note type="footnote"> 1 I have omitted translating the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπεί</foreign>, which is found in some <lb/>

            body. And, conversely, that which is divisible in a twofold <lb/>
            respect is a surface, and that in a single direction, a line, <lb/>
            and that divisible everywhere in three directions is a body, <lb/>
            but that divisible nowhere according to quantity, a point <lb/>
            and a monad; the one, without position, a monad, and the <lb/>
            other, with position, a point.</p>
          <p>And, moreover, some things are one according <lb/>
            to number, but others according to species, and <lb/>
            others according to genus, and others according <lb/>
            to analogy. Those things are one in number of <lb/>
            7. Modes of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔν</foreign>. <lb/>
            according to a <lb/>
            logical divisior <lb/>
            of it. <lb/>
            which the matter is one, but in species of which the defi­ <lb/>
            nition is one, but in genus of which there is the same figure <lb/>
            of predication; but according to analogy are things one as <lb/>
            many as are disposed as one thing in relation to another. <lb/>
            The subsequent, however, invariably follows the things that <lb/>
            are prior; as, for instance, whatsoever things are one in <lb/>
            number are also one in species, but whatsoever things are <lb/>
            one in species are not all one in number; but all things are <lb/>
            one in genus, whatsoever are likewise so in species; but <lb/>
            whatsoever are one in genus are not all one in species, but <lb/>
            are so in analogy; and whatsoever things are one analogically <lb/>
            are not all so in genus.</p>
          <p>It is manifest, however, also, that plurality <lb/>
            will be spoken of in an opposite manner to <lb/>

            senses of"ens <lb/>
            per accidens." <note type="footnote">1 Entity, about which metaphysics is most concerned, is now defined <lb/>
            by Aristotle. This term is examined into by an old Cambridge scholar, <lb/>
            Henricus More, in a treatise of his entitled, " Enchiridion Meta. <lb/>

            according to accident as when we say that a just man is <lb/>
            musical, and that the man is musical, and that the musician <lb/>
            is a man ;speaking in a similar manner as when we say that <lb/>
            the musical man builds because it is an accident to the <lb/>
            builder to be a musician, or for the musician to be a <lb/>
            builder: for the affirming that this particular thing is that <lb/>
            signifies that this thing is an accident in that. So, also, in <lb/>
            the case of the instances that have been mentioned; when <lb/>
            we say that the man is a musician, and that the musician is <lb/>
            a man, or that one who is white is the musician, or that <lb/>
            the latter is white, we say this because both of these are <lb/>
            accidents in the same subject; but we say that because they <lb/>
            are accidents in entity : but that the musician is a man we <lb/>
            say because the being a musician is an accident to this <lb/>
            person. So, also, is it said that what is white is a man <lb/>
            because1 that is a man to which the being white is an <lb/>
            accident. Things, indeed, therefore, said to subsist according <lb/>
            to accident are expressed in this way, either because both are <lb/>
            inherent in the same entity, or because they are inherent in <lb/>
            that entity, or because they are the same with that in which <lb/>
            the accidents are inherent, and of which the thing itself is <lb/>
            predicated.</p>

            ten categories;</p>
          <p>Entities, also, are said to subsist essentially <lb/>
            whatsoever signify the figures of predication; for <lb/>
            as often as they are predicated, so often do <lb/>
            they signify essence. Since, therefore, of the <lb/>
            things that are predicated some signify what a thing is, <lb/>
            or quiddity, and others quality, and others quantity, and <lb/>
            others relation, and others action or passion, and some the <lb/>
            place where, and others the time when, to each of these the <lb/>
            being or essence signifies the same thing. For there is no <lb/>
            difference in the expression, the man is in a healthy state, <lb/>
            from this, namely, the man is healthy, or, the man is <lb/>
            walking or is cutting, from the expression, man walks or <lb/>
            cuts. And in like manner, also, is it in the case of the rest. <lb/>
            and in <lb/>
            truth as op- <lb/>
            Further, the words "to be" and " it is " signify that <lb/>
            a thing is true, but the words " not to be," that <note type="footnote"> of Cudworth's Intellectual System, p. 152, Harrison's Ed., where there <lb/>

            it is not true, but false ;1 in like manner is it the <lb/>
            case both in respect to affirmation and negation; <lb/>
            posed to false­ <lb/>
            hood , <lb/>
            as, for example, he who says that Socrates is musical says so <lb/>
            because this is true ; or he who says that Socrates is not <lb/>
            white says so because it is true; he, however, who says that <lb/>
            the diameter is not incommensurable says so because this is <lb/>
            false. Further, "to be " and "being" signify that <lb/>
            which is expressed partly as potentially,2 and <lb/>
            partly as actually, of those things that have been <lb/>
            as well as <lb/>
            in capacity and <lb/>
            actuality. <lb/>
            enumerated. For we say, also, that seeing is both seeing in <lb/>
            potentiality expressly, and in actuality; and similarly we say <lb/>
            that he is endued with scientific knowledge who both has <lb/>
            the ability to employ scientific knowledge and does actually <lb/>
            employ it, and that a thing is in a condition of rest both in <lb/>
            which rest is at present inherent, and which involves the <lb/>
            capability of remaining in a state of quiescence. But in like <lb/>
            manner, also, is it in the case of substances ; for we speak of <lb/>
            the existence of Mercury3 in the stone, and the half of the <lb/>
            line; and we call that corn which not yet has reached a <lb/>
            state of maturity. When, however, a thing is potential, and <lb/>
            when it is not as yet potential, must be defined elsewhere.</p>

            the parts of these. Now, all these are denominated substances <lb/>
            because they are not predicated of a subject, whereas other <lb/>
            things are predicated of these. But in another way is that <lb/>
            styled substance whatever may be the cause of being, and <lb/>
            may be inherent in such as are not predicated of a subject; <lb/>
            for example, soul in an animal. Further, as many parts as <lb/>
            are inherent in such things that both define and signify " the <lb/>
            what" a certain thing is, on the removal of which the whole <lb/>
            is taken away,-as, for example, if superficies be taken away <lb/>
            body also is destroyed, as some say ; and superficies is <lb/>
            destroyed by taking away a line ; and, in general, number <lb/>
            seems to certain to be a thing of this kind : for that if it <lb/>
            is removed away nothing can subsist, and that it defines all <lb/>
            things,-such parts we may consider substances. Further, the <lb/>
            essence of which the formal cause is the definition, this, also, <lb/>
            is styled the substance of each thing.</p>
          <p>2. Reduction <lb/>
            of these to two.</p>
          <p>Now, substance happens in two ways to be <lb/>
            styled substance, both as the ultimate subject <lb/>
            which no longer is predicated of anything else, and as that <lb/>
            which may be this certain particular thing, and may be separ­ <lb/>
            able ; but such is the form and the species of each thing.</p>

          <p>I. Different <lb/>
            significations of <lb/>
            the term same; <lb/>
            "same per acci­ <lb/>
            dens."</p>
          <p>BUT the same are styled partly according <lb/>
            to accident, as the white and the musical are <lb/>
            the same because they are accidents in the same <lb/>
            subject, and man and musician are the same <lb/>
            because either is an accident in the other; I mean, that man <lb/>
            is musical because the musical is an accident in man: and <lb/>
            this is the same with either, and either of these the same <lb/>
            with this; for also with the man that is musical both man <lb/>
            and musical are styled the same, and that is regarded the <lb/>
            same with those. Wherefore, also, all these are not predi­ <lb/>
            cated universally; for it is not true to say that every man <lb/>
            is the same thing with what is musical: for universals are <lb/>
            absolute existences, but accidents are not absolute existences, <lb/>
            but are simply predicated of singulars. For it seems the <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristotle now examines into our notions of identity and diversity; <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. X.] </note> <lb/>
            same thing to be Socrates and Socrates the musical, for <lb/>
            the expression Socrates is not affirmed of all; wherefore, <lb/>
            not every Socrates is predicated as every man is. And some <lb/>
            things in this way are called the same. Some <lb/>
            things, however, are called the same essentially <lb/>
            and of " same <lb/>
            per se." <lb/>
            in the same way as unity also; for those things likewise <lb/>
            of which the matter is one either in species, or in number, or <lb/>
            in genus, are called the same, and those of which the sub­ <lb/>
            stance is one are called the same. Wherefore, it is evident <lb/>
            that sameness is a certain unity of the being of either many <lb/>
            things, or when one employs anything as many, as when one <lb/>
            affirms the same thing to be the same with itself, for he <lb/>
            employs that thing as two.</p>
          <p>But diverse are those things called of which <lb/>
            either the species are numerous, or the matter, or <lb/>
            the definition of the substance; and, in general, <lb/>
            2. When <lb/>
            things are said <lb/>
            to be diverse, <lb/>
            is the diverse denominated in a manner opposite to the same. <lb/>
            And those things are styled different whatsoever are diverse; <lb/>
            being, however, in some respect the same, not merely in <lb/>
            number, but either in species, or genus, or analogy. Further, <lb/>
            things are considered different of which the <lb/>
            genus is diverse, and the things that are con­ <lb/>
            trary, and whatsoever involve diversity in the <lb/>
            different, <lb/>
            similar, and <lb/>
            dissimilar. <lb/>
            substance. Similar are those things styled both which . <lb/>
            everywhere undergo the same affection and undergo more <lb/>
            of the same affections than of the diverse, and of which <lb/>
            the quality is one, and in as many of the contraries as a <lb/>
            change is possible, that which possesses more of these, or the <lb/>
            more important amongst these, is similar to that thing. <lb/>
            Things that are dissimilar, however, are denominated in an <lb/>
            opposite way to those that are similar.</p>

            which widely differ of those under the same capacity, and <lb/>
            those of which there is the greatest difference, either simply, <lb/>
            or according to genus, or according to species. And other <lb/>

            of the other things also following as many as are expressed <lb/>

          <p>PRIOR and subsequent are things called. <lb/>
            Some, as in the case of a certain thing exist­ <lb/>
            ing as first, and as a first principle, in each <lb/>
            genus; for prior is that which is nearer a certain <lb/>
            first principle, defined either simply and by <lb/>
            1. Different <lb/>
            senses of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρότερον</foreign> and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑϭτερον</foreign>, either <lb/>
            as a first prin­ <lb/>
            ciple ; <lb/>
            nature, or relatively, or according to place, or by certain <lb/>
            things: as, for instance, some things are prior in place <lb/>
            from the fact of being nearer either by nature to a certain <lb/>
            definite place as to the mean or the extreme, or by some <lb/>
            ordinary relation in this way; and that which is more remote <lb/>
            from this definite locality is subsequent. Other <lb/>
            things prior and subsequent, however, are so in <lb/>
            or in reference <lb/>
            to duration; <lb/>
            accordance with time; for some things, indeed, are considered <lb/>
            prior as they are more remote from the present moment: for <lb/>
            instance, in the case of things that have taken place in time <lb/>
            past; for the Trojan annals are prior to the Medean because <lb/>
            they are further removed from the present time; and other <lb/>
            things are prior in regard of being nearer the present time, <lb/>
            as in the case of things to come: for the Nemean games2 are <lb/>
            prior to the Pythian because it is an event nearer the <lb/>
            present, using the present as a first principle and a thing <lb/>
            that is first. Some things, also, according to motion are prior <lb/>
            and subsequent ; for that which is more imme­ <lb/>
            diate to the first moving power is prior : as, for <lb/>
            example, a boy is prior to a man; and this, also, <lb/>
            or motion, and <lb/>
            capacity, and <lb/>
            order. <note type="footnote">1 The subject of priority and subsequence, treated of in this chapter, <lb/>

            is a certain first principle simply considered. Some things, <lb/>
            also, are prior according to potentiality; for that which is <lb/>
            super-eminent in potentiality is prior, and that which is more <lb/>
            potential is prior: but that nature is of such kind as according <lb/>
            to the free-will of which another must needs follow which is <lb/>
            also posterior. Wherefore, in the event of that one not imparting <lb/>
            motion, the consequence will be that no motion should ensue <lb/>
            in the other; and, in the event of that one imparting motion, <lb/>
            that motion should ensue in the other; but free-will con­ <lb/>
            stitutes a first principle. Also, things according to order are <lb/>
            styled prior and subsequent; but these are such as according <lb/>
            to some one relation defined are distant proportionally: as, <lb/>
            for example, in a dance the person standing second1 is prior <lb/>
            to one that stands third, and the paranete to the nete in <lb/>
            a musical instrument; for in the former is the person who <lb/>
            presides, and in the latter the medium is a first principle.</p>

            and subse­ <lb/>

            ed in reference <lb/>
            to our know­ <lb/>
            ledge of them, <lb/>
            either from <lb/>
            reason or from <lb/>
            sense.</p>
          <p>These things, indeed, therefore, are styled prior <lb/>
            in this way; but in another way is a thing prior <lb/>
            in knowledge as if it were even absolutely prior. <lb/>
            Of these things, however, that are otherwise, some <lb/>
            are according to reason, and some according to <lb/>
            sense; for, certainly, according to reason things <lb/>
            that are universal are prior; but according to <lb/>
            sense the singulars are prior. And according to the reason, also, <lb/>
            the accident is prior to the whole, as the musical is before <lb/>
            a man that is musical; for the entire reason will not be <lb/>
            without the part, although it is not possible to be musical <lb/>
            when there is not a certain one that is musically gifted. <note type="footnote"> 1 I have followed Taylor in translating the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραϭτάτης</foreign> thus. <lb/>
            Alexander Aphrodisiensis reads the text differently; for he renders it <lb/>
            in his commentary by <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρωτοϭτάτης</foreign>, which is found in the Asclepian <lb/>
            MSS. The word, in fact, means one who stands in a chorus on the <lb/>
            right or left hand of another. Strictly speaking, <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραϭτάτης</foreign> is a military <lb/>
            term; it was applied to the leader or front rank of either of the wings <lb/>
            of an army; and <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρωτοϭτάτης</foreign> meant the right hand man in the front <lb/>
            rank of the main body. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρανήτη: χορδὴ</foreign> is the word understood. The paranete is a term <lb/>
            borrowed from music, and signified the string next to the undermost; <lb/>
            or, in other words, the one next to the last of five strings. The note, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">νήτη</foreign>, i. e. <foreign xml:lang="grc">νεάτη χορδή</foreign>, is the last, but with us the highest in the musical <lb/>

            Further, the passive conditions of things that are prior are <lb/>
            called prior; as, for instance, straightness is prior to smooth­ <lb/>
            ness : for the one is an essential affection of a line, and the <lb/>
            other of a superficies.</p>
          <p>Some things, therefore, are called prior and <lb/>
            subsequent in this way; but others are termed <lb/>
            so according to nature and substance, as many <lb/>
            as it is admissible can be in subsistence without <lb/>
            a. Other <lb/>
            senses in which <lb/>
            we may view <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρότερον</foreign> and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕϭτερον</foreign>. <lb/>
            others, but others cannot subsist without them; which <lb/>
            opinion Plato adopted. But since " the being"1 is in many <lb/>
            ways denominated, in the first place the subject is prior <lb/>
            through which the substance is prior; in the next place the <lb/>
            things according to potentiality and actuality are otherwise; <lb/>
            for according to potentiality2 are some things prior, and <lb/>
            others according to actuality, subsequent; as, for instance, <lb/>
            according to potentiality is the half prior to the whole, <lb/>
            and the part to the whole, and the matter to the sub­ <lb/>
            stance; but according to actuality3 is this a thing that is <lb/>
            subsequent: for when dissolution has taken place things will <lb/>
            subsist according to actuality. In a certain manner, it is true, <lb/>
            all things that are styled prior and subsequent are expressed <lb/>
            according to these; for some according to generation it is <lb/>
            admissible may subsist without others, as the whole without <lb/>
            the parts: but some according to corruption, as the part is <lb/>
            prior to the whole. But it is in like manner with the rest.</p>

          <p>POTENTIALITY. is called the first principle of <lb/>
            motion or change in another thing, or so far <lb/>
            forth as it is another thing; as the building art <lb/>
            is a potentiality that does not reside in the thing <lb/>
            1. Different <lb/>
            significations <lb/>
            of the term po­ <lb/>
            tentiality or <lb/>
            capacity. <lb/>

            sionally rendered it by capacity. </note> <pb n="134"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK IV </note> <lb/>
            potentiality, would reside in the person who is being healed, <lb/>
            but not so far forth as he is a person that is being healed <lb/>
            Therefore, in general, the first principle of change or of motion <lb/>
            is said to be potentiality in another thing, so far forth as it <lb/>
            is another, and potentiality is styled such from another <lb/>
            thing, or so far forth as it is another; for according to this <lb/>
            sense of potentiality is what is passive in any degree passive. <lb/>
            Sometimes, then, if it may be possible also that anything <lb/>
            whatsoever undergoes passion, we say that thing involves the <lb/>
            potentiality of being passive; but sometimes we say that this <lb/>
            is not the case as regards every passion, but if it be passive <lb/>
            in reference to what is better. Further, is potentiality the <lb/>
            capacity of accomplishing this particular thing well, or doing <lb/>
            so according to free-will; for sometimes persons who merely <lb/>
            have been walking or speaking, but yet who have not done so <lb/>
            well, or not as they would choose, we would not say possessed <lb/>
            the power or potentiality of speaking or walking: but also, <lb/>
            in like manner, is it in the case of passion. Further, as many <lb/>
            habits as according to which things are entirely devoid of <lb/>
            passion, or unchangeable, or not capable of being easily <lb/>
            altered into a worse state, such are styled potentialities. <lb/>
            For things are broken, indeed, and rubbed together,1 and bent, <lb/>
            and are, in general, subject to decay, not from the having <lb/>
            capacity, but from the not having capacity or potentiality, <lb/>
            and from deficiency in some point: other things, however, <lb/>
            are impassive by such as scarcely, and in a small degree, <lb/>
            become affected on account of potentiality, and the pos­ <lb/>
            session of potentiality, and the being in a certain manner <lb/>
            disposed.</p>
          <p>2. Different <lb/>
            modes of the <lb/>
            potential cor­ <lb/>
            responding <lb/>
            with those of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δύναμις</foreign>, or <lb/>
            capacity.</p>
          <p>Now, seeing that potentiality is denominated <lb/>
            in so many ways, in the first place will also the <lb/>
            potential be styled as that which possesses a first <lb/>
            principle of motion or of change, (for even what <lb/>
            is stationary is something potential in another <lb/>
            thing, or so far forth as it is another,) and in the <lb/>
            second place, if anything else of this should possess a capacity <lb/>
            of this sort, and in the third place, if it involve such a <lb/>
            capacity of bringing about a change in anything whatsoever, <lb/>
            whether into what is worse or into what is better. For, also, <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭοντρίβεται</foreign>. Taylor translates this word " bruised." I have rem <lb/>
            dered it literally. </note> <pb n="135"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XII.] </note> <lb/>
            that which is in a state of decay seems to be a thing capable <lb/>
            of falling into decay, otherwise it would not be corrupted if <lb/>
            such were impossible; but already has it a certain disposition <lb/>
            of parts, and a cause and first principle of such a passive <lb/>
            condition. Sometimes, however, from the fact of possession, <lb/>
            and sometimes from the fact of privation, does it seem to be <lb/>
            a thing of this sort. And if privation in a manner constitute <lb/>
            a habit, all things by the fact of the possession of something <lb/>
            would be potentialities; but the entity would be also ex­ <lb/>
            pressed equivocally. Wherefore, is a thing potential in <lb/>
            respect of having a certain habit and first principle, and in <lb/>
            respect of involving the privation of this, if it is admissible <lb/>
            that it should involve privation. And in the fourth place is <lb/>
            a thing potential from the non-possession of a potentiality­ <lb/>
            or a first principle of this in another, or so far forth as it is <lb/>
            another-which is subject to corruption. But, moreover, are <lb/>
            all those things potential either in the mere accident of their <lb/>
            being generated or not being generated, or in respect of their <lb/>
            being generated in an excellent manner. For, also, in things <lb/>
            that are inanimate is there such a capacity inherent; as, for <lb/>
            instance, in musical instruments: for one lyre, they say, can <lb/>
            send forth sound, but that another does not possess this <lb/>
            capacity, if it be not fair sounding.</p>
          <p>Impotentiality, however, is a privation of <lb/>
            potentiality, and a certain removal1 of a first <lb/>
            principle of such a sort, as has been mentioned, <lb/>
            3. Impotenti­ <lb/>
            ality as opposed <lb/>
            to potentiality. <lb/>
            either entirely so, or from being by nature adapted to have <lb/>
            such, or already to have such when it has been naturally <lb/>
            fitted thereto also; for we would not say that in like manner <lb/>
            was it impotential or impossible for a man and an eunuch <lb/>
            to beget a child. But, moreover, according to both sorts <lb/>
            of potentiality is there impotentiality opposed, both to that <lb/>
            merely which is capable of motion, and to that capable <lb/>
            of motion in an excellent manner. And things are styled <lb/>
            impotential, some in accordance with this kind of im­ <lb/>
            potentiality, and others in another way; as, for instance, <lb/>
            both the possible and the impossible. That, <lb/>
            indeed, is a thing impossible the contrary of <lb/>
            4. When tl ings <lb/>
            are said to be <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄρϭις</foreign>. This word is translated in Liddell and Scott's Lexicon, <lb/>
            In reference to this passage, " abolition." It is a technical term in <lb/>
            poetry, corresponding to the Latin expression " ictus." </note> <pb n="136"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK IV. </note> <lb/>
            impossible, as <lb/>
            In geometry. <lb/>
            which is necessarily true; as the commensurability <lb/>
            of the diameter is a thing that is impossible1 <lb/>
            because such a position in mathematics is false; and the <lb/>
            contrary of this is not only true, but also must necessarily <lb/>
            be so, namely, the incommensurability of the diameter. Its <lb/>
            being commensurable, accordingly, is not merely false, but <lb/>
            must be false. The contrary, however, to this is the possible, <lb/>
            when it is not necessary that the contrary should be false; <lb/>
            as, for example, the possibility of a man's sitting: for not <lb/>
            necessarily is his being in a posture not of sitting a thing <lb/>
            that is false. The possible in one way, therefore, as has been <lb/>
            stated, signifies that which is not necessarily false, but in <lb/>
            another it signifies the being true, and in another that which <lb/>
            it is admissible may be true. Now, this is what in geometry <lb/>
            is figuratively styled potentiality. These, indeed, therefore, <lb/>
            are things possible-not so according to potentiality.</p>
          <p>5. Reduction <lb/>
            of these to one <lb/>
            genus.</p>
          <p>But all the things that are expressed according <lb/>
            to potentiality are enumerated2 with reference <lb/>
            to one original potentiality or capacity; and this <lb/>
            is a principle of change in another, so far forth as it is <lb/>
            another. For the rest are styled potential, partly in some <lb/>
            other of them possessing such potentiality, and partly in <lb/>
            its non-possession thereof, and partly in its being thus dis. <lb/>
            posed. In like manner, also, is it the case with things that <lb/>
            are impotential. Wherefore, the precise definition of the <lb/>
            first potentiality3 would be a principle capable of bringing <lb/>
            about a change in another thing, or so far forth as it is <lb/>
            another.</p>

            certain one thing, and a certain particular thing of this sort. <lb/>
            Multitude, then, indeed, is a certain quantity if it may be <lb/>
            numerable, but magnitude if it may be measurable; and <lb/>
            multitude is styled that which is divisible in capacity <lb/>
            into what is not continuous, but magnitude into that which <lb/>
            is continuous. Now, of magnitude that which is continuous <lb/>
            in one direction is length, and that in two directions breadth, <lb/>
            and that in three, depth. But of these finite multitude is <lb/>
            number, and length is a line, and breadth a superficies, and <lb/>
            depth a body.</p>
          <p>Moreover, some things are said to be certain <lb/>
            quantities in themselves, or to be essential quan­ <lb/>
            tities; but others, quantities according to acci- <lb/>
            2. Quantity <lb/>
            either essen­ <lb/>
            tial ; <lb/>
            dent: as a line, to wit, is a certain essential quantity, <lb/>
            whereas what is musical is a quantity according to acci­ <lb/>
            dent. Now, of quantities that are so essentially, some are <lb/>
            a certain quantity according to substance; as, for instance, a <lb/>
            line, (for in the definition expressive of what anything is, a <lb/>
            certain quantity is inherent;) but other quantities are pas­ <lb/>
            sions and habits of such a substance: as, for example, <lb/>
            much and little, and long and short, and broad and narrow, <lb/>
            and high and low, and heavy and light, and the rest of such <lb/>
            properties. Likewise, both the great and the little, and the <lb/>
            greater and less, expressed both in reference to themselves <lb/>
            and in relation to one another, are the essential passions <lb/>
            of quantity. These names, indeed, are also transferred to <lb/>
            other things. Of quantities, however, that are <lb/>
            expressed according to accident, some are so <lb/>
            or according to <lb/>
            accident. <lb/>
            expressed as has been declared, because what is musical is <lb/>
            quantity, and what is white is so in respect of there being <lb/>
            a certain quantity in that subject wherein they are inherent; <lb/>
            and other things are quantities as motion and duration : for <lb/>
            these, also, are termed certain quantities, and things con­ <lb/>
            tinuous in respect of those things being divisible of which <lb/>
            these are passive states. Now, I mean not that which is in <lb/>
            a state of motion, but that which has had motion imparted to <lb/>
            it; for from the fact of that being quantity, motion is like­ <note type="footnote"> the Categories. The reader is referred to this portion of the Meta­ <lb/>

          <p>QUALITy2 is styled in one way the difference <lb/>
            of substance; as, man is a certain quality of <lb/>
            animal because he is a biped, and horse is a <lb/>
            certain quality of animal because he is a quadru­ <lb/>
            ped, and a circle is a certain quality of figure because it is <lb/>
            without angles: so that the difference constitutes the quality <lb/>
            according to the substance. Now, in this one way is quality <lb/>
            styled the difference of substance, but in another, as things <lb/>
            incapable of motion and mathematical entities, just as num­ <lb/>
            bers are certain qualities; for example, those that are com­ <lb/>
            pound, and not only those which subsist in respect of one, but <lb/>
            those of which surface and solid are an imitation, (now these are <lb/>
            planer square, or cube numbers,) and, in general, whatever be­ <lb/>
            sides quantity inheres in substance, for the being assumed once <lb/>
            is the substance of each thing; as, for example, the substance of <lb/>
            the six is not twice three, or thrice two, but the being taken <lb/>
            once, for once six is six. Moreover, as many things as are <lb/>
            passive conditions of substances in a state of motion are called <lb/>
            qualities, as heat and cold, and whiteness and blackness, and <lb/>
            gravity and lightness, and whatever such-like properties there <lb/>
            are according to which the bodies of those things that are <lb/>
            undergoing a change are said to be altered. Further, are <lb/>
            things qualities4 so far as they subsist according to virtue and <lb/>
            vice, and, in general, to what is bad and good. <note type="footnote"> 1 In connecting motion and duration together, the reader can hardly <lb/>

            of these to two. <lb/>
            most strict or appropriate ; for first, indeed, as quality, is the <lb/>
            difference of substance. And a certain part of this, also, is <lb/>
            the quality contained in numbers; for this is a certain diffe­ <lb/>
            rence of substances, yet either not of things that are being <lb/>
            moved or not so far forth as they are being moved. These, <lb/>
            however, are passive conditions of things that are in motion, <lb/>
            to far forth as they are being moved and are differences of <lb/>
            motions. And virtue and vice are a certain portion of such <lb/>
            passions; for they make manifest the differences of motion <lb/>
            and of energy in accordance with which those things that <lb/>
            are in motion are agents and are passive in an excellent or <lb/>
            a worthless manner: for that which in this way possesses the <lb/>
            power of motion, or of energizing in this way, is good, and <lb/>
            that which is moved and energizes in that way, and in a con­ <lb/>
            trary manner, is worthless. And most especially do what is <lb/>
            good and bad signify quality in the case of animated natures, <lb/>
            and amongst these particularly does this apply1 to the case <lb/>
            of those that possess free-will.</p>

          <p>WITH respect to relatives,2 they are denomi­ <lb/>
            nated, some of them, as a twofold to a half, and <lb/>
            a threefold to a third, and, in general, a multiple <lb/>
            1. Three modes <lb/>
            of the relative, <lb/>
            per se. <lb/>
            to a submultiple, and excess to that which is exceeded; <lb/>
            and others of them, as the calorific to that which is heated, <lb/>
            and the divisible to the divided, and, in general, the active to <lb/>
            the passive; and others of them, as the measurable to the <lb/>
            measure, and the object of scientific knowledge to science, and <lb/>
            the sensible to sense.</p>
          <p>Now, regarding these relatives, the first of them <lb/>
            are expressed according to number, either simply <lb/>

            wording to <lb/>
            number. <lb/>
            or by definition, in respect of them or in respect <lb/>
            of one ; as, for example, the twofold in respect <lb/>
            of one is a definite number, and the multiple is according to <lb/>
            number in respect of one, but such as is not defined; as, for <lb/>
            example, this or this particular number; but the sesquialiter, <lb/>
            in relation to the subsesquialiter, is according to number in <lb/>
            relation to a definite number. Superpartient, in relation to <lb/>
            superpartient, is according to the indefinite in the same man- <lb/>
            Der as the multiple is in relation to one. But that which <lb/>
            exceeds, in relation to that which is exceeded, is, in short, in­ <lb/>
            definite according to number; for number is commensurable: <lb/>
            but the excess and what is exceeded are denominated accord­ <lb/>
            ing to a non-commensurable number; for that which exceeds <lb/>
            is such in relation to that which is exceeded, and something <lb/>
            further than this: but this is indefinite; for whatsoever chances <lb/>
            to be the result is either equal or not equal. These things, <lb/>
            therefore, which are relatives, are all denominated accord­ <lb/>
            ing to number, and are passive properties of numbers : and, <lb/>
            further, the equal, and similar, and same, according to another <lb/>
            manner, are termed thus; for all these are expressed according <lb/>
            to the one. For the same, indeed, are those things of which <lb/>
            the substance is one; but similar are those things of which <lb/>
            the quality is one; and equal are those of which the quantity <lb/>
            is one. And the one is the first principle and measure of <lb/>
            number; so that all these are denominated relations according <lb/>
            to number, indeed, yet not in the same manner.</p>
          <p>3. The second, <lb/>
            according to <lb/>
            capacity, or its <lb/>
            privation.</p>
          <p>Things active and passive, however, subsist <lb/>
            according to an active and passive potentiality, <lb/>
            and according to energies that belong to potenti­ <lb/>
            alities ; as that capable of promoting heat to that <lb/>
            which is heated, because of its being endued with poten­ <lb/>
            tiality: and again, the making warm in relation to that <lb/>
            which is made warm; and one who severs in relation to that <lb/>
            which is severed-as things energizing-are relatives. But of <lb/>
            those things that are relatives according to number, these are <lb/>
            not energies, save only in the manner it has been mentioned <lb/>
            elsewhere; but energies according to motion do not subsist in <lb/>
            numbers. And of those things that are relatives according <lb/>
            to potentiality, some are already styled so according to <lb/>
            periods of duration; as, for example, that which forms in <lb/>
            relation to that which has been formed, and that which is <pb n="141"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XV.] </note> <lb/>
            likely to form in relation to that which is likely to be formed. <lb/>
            For so, also, is a father called a father of a son; for there As <lb/>
            something that partly has been active and partly passive. <lb/>
            Further, are some things considered relations according to. <lb/>
            the privation of potentiality; for instance, just as the im­ <lb/>
            possible, and as many things as are expressed in this way <lb/>
            as, for example, the invisible.</p>
          <p>Things, therefore, denominated relatives ac­ <lb/>
            cording to number and potentiality are all of <lb/>
            them so called because each derives that which <lb/>
            it is from reference to another, but not because <lb/>
            4. The third. <lb/>
            as the objective <lb/>
            to the subjec­ <lb/>
            tive. <lb/>
            something else is denominated with reference to it; and the <lb/>
            measurable, and that which may be scientifically known, and <lb/>
            that which is an object of the intellect,1 on account of some­ <lb/>
            thing else being denominated in respect of them, are styled <lb/>
            relatives. For, also, being an object of the intellect, signifies <lb/>
            that the intellect is exercised about this; the intellect how­ <lb/>
            ever, does not subsist in relation to that about which the <lb/>
            intellect is conversant, for the same thing, doubtless, would be <lb/>
            said twice. In like manner, also, the power of sight is that of <lb/>
            something, and not of him to whom the sight belongs. This, <lb/>
            however, is a true statement, but it is in relation to colour, <lb/>
            or something else of this kind; yet in that way the same <lb/>
            thing would be expressed twice: I mean that sight is the <lb/>
            sight of him of whom it is the sight.</p>
          <p>Things, indeed, therefore, called relatives es­ <lb/>
            sentially are denominated partly in this way, <lb/>
            and partly if their genera are of this kind; as, <lb/>
            5. Other senses <lb/>
            of the word <lb/>
            relative. <lb/>
            for instance, the art of healing belongs to those things that <lb/>
            are relative, because the science which is the genus of it <lb/>
            seems to belong to those that are relatives. We may sub­ <lb/>
            join, as such, those things according to which, whatever they <lb/>
            may be, things that possess them are spoken of as relatives, <lb/>
            for example, equality is a relation because of the equal being <lb/>
            relative, and similarity is a relation because of the similar <lb/>
            being relative. Some things, however, are called <lb/>
            relatives according to accident, as man is a rela- <lb/>
            6. Relation, per <lb/>

            meaning literal <lb/>
            and figurative.</p>
          <p>PERFECT is denominated that beyond which <lb/>
            it is not possible to assume anything cr any <lb/>
            one single portion; as, for instance, the time <lb/>
            of each thing is perfect beyond which it is not <lb/>
            possible to assume any period of duration which is a portion <lb/>
            of this time: and that which according to virtue, and to <lb/>
            what belongs to the excellent, doth not involve excess with <lb/>
            respect to any genus; as, for instance, a perfect or finished <lb/>
            physician, and a perfect or finished musician, are such when <lb/>
            they are in no wise deficient as far as regards the species of <lb/>
            the excellence that is proper to their professions, so, also, <lb/>
            transferring our remarks to the case of evil things, we say a <lb/>
            perfect or finished sycophant, and a finished thief, since we <lb/>
            also denominate these characters good, as a good thief, and <lb/>
            a good sycophant. And virtue is a certain perfection ;1 for <lb/>
            each thing is then perfect, and every substance is then <lb/>
            perfect, when, in accordance with the species of its proper <lb/>
            excellence or virtue, no portion of the natural magnitude <lb/>
            is deficient. Further, in whatever things resides an admirable <lb/>
            end, these are styled perfect; for in respect of involving an <lb/>
            end are they perfect. Wherefore, since the end is something <lb/>
            belonging to extremes, and transferring, also, our remarks to <lb/>
            the case of things that are worthless, we say that a thing is <lb/>
            perfectly lost and perfectly corrupted when nought of the <lb/>
            corruption and of what is bad is deficient, but when it has <lb/>
            arrived at the ultimate limit of these. Wherefore, also, <note type="footnote"> 1 This is the Aristotelian view of virtue, and a most remarkable one <lb/>
            it is-Man, by cultivating principles of virtue, is acting up to the per­ <lb/>

            death, metaphorically, is called the termination, because both <lb/>
            are extremes. The end, however, together with the final <lb/>

          <p>The things indeed, therefore, denominated <lb/>

          <p>A TERMINATION is called the last of each thing, <lb/>
            and beyond which, as first, it is not possible to <lb/>
            assume anything, and within which, as first, are <lb/>
            comprised all things, and that, likewise, which <lb/>
            1. The word <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">πέρας</foreign>, or ter­ <lb/>
            mination, ex­ <lb/>
            plained. <lb/>
            may be a form of magnitude, or of that which is in possession <lb/>
            of magnitude, and which is the end of everything. Now, <lb/>
            a thing of this kind is that towards which motion and the <lb/>
            mode of an action tend, and not from which they originate. <lb/>
            Sometimes, however, a termination is both of these; both that <lb/>
            from which motion and action originate, and towards which <lb/>
            they tend; also, that for the sake of which other things <lb/>
            operate, and the substance of each thing, and the essence or <lb/>
            the formal cause of each: for this is a termination of know­ <lb/>
            ledge, and if of knowledge, also of the thing done. Where­ <lb/>
            fore, it is evident that even as often as the first principle is <lb/>
            predicated so often also is the termination, and still more <lb/>
            multifariously; for the first principle, to be sure, is a certain <lb/>
            termination: not every terminatior, however, is a first <lb/>
            principle. <note type="footnote"> 1 Asclepius illustrates this by the spear of Achilles, which one <lb/>

          <p>" THE according to which "1 is denominated in <lb/>
            many ways. In one way, indeed, as the species <lb/>
            and the substance of each thing ; as, for instance, <lb/>
            that in accordance with which a man is good, <lb/>
            itself is good; and, in another way, as that in which first <lb/>
            a thing has been fitted by nature to rise into being, as colour <lb/>
            in a superficies.2 Therefore, what has, indeed, in the first <lb/>
            instance been mentioned as " the according to which " con­ <lb/>
            stitutes form; but that mentioned secondarily, as such, is as <lb/>
            the matter of each thing, and the first subject in everything <lb/>
            And, in general, " the according to which" will have a sub­ <lb/>
            sistence as often as the cause; for according to what a man <lb/>
            has come is an expression of the same import as on account <lb/>
            of what he has come; and the inquiry according to what false <lb/>
            reasoning, or correct reasoning, may be drawn is the same as <lb/>
            an inquiry into what is the cause of the syllogism, or the <lb/>
            paralogism, in such cases. Moreover, "the according to <lb/>
            which" is denominated that which subsists according to a <lb/>
            position, according to which one stands, or according to <lb/>
            which one walks; for all these signify position and locality.</p>
          <p>2. Five signifi­ <lb/>
            cations of the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ καθ</foreign>' auTO, <lb/>
            or the essential.</p>
          <p>Wherefore, " that according to itself," or the <lb/>
            essential, is necessarily expressed in many ways. <lb/>
            For in one way is "that according to itself," or <lb/>
            the essential, the very nature of each thing, or the <lb/>
            formal cause; as, for example, Callias essentially is the very <lb/>
            nature also of Callias; and, secondly, it signifies whatsoever <lb/>
            things are inherent in the " what anything is;" as Callias <lb/>
            essentially is an animal; for in the definition of Callias is to <lb/>
            be found animal, for Callias is a certain description of <lb/>
            animal: and, thirdly, may we denominate " that according <lb/>
            to itself," or the essential, as a thing that has primarily been <lb/>
            a recipient in itself, or a certain part of things that belong to <lb/>
            itself; as, for instance, superficies is essentially white, and man <note type="footnote"> 1 " Secundum quid." Mr. Maurice illustrates this word by a passage <lb/>
            from As You Like It:-" In respect that it is of the country it is a <lb/>

            essentially is an animal, for the soul is a certain portion of <lb/>
            the man in which vitality is primarily inherent. Fourthly, does <lb/>
            it signify that of which there is not any one other cause; for <lb/>
            of man there are many causes, such as animal, biped; but, <lb/>
            nevertheless, man is man essentially. Fifthly, we consider <lb/>
            " that according to itself," or the essential, as many things as <lb/>
            are inherent in some one particular thing alone, and as far <lb/>
            forth as it is alone. Wherefore, whatever has a separate has <lb/>
            also an essential subsistence.</p>

          <p>Now habit' is denominated, in one way, <lb/>
            as a certain energy of the possessor and the <lb/>
            possessed, just as it were a certain action or <lb/>
            motion; for when the one accomplishes, and the <lb/>

            between them, so also between one having in possession a <lb/>
            garment, and the garment had in possession, habit is a mean. <lb/>
            Therefore, indeed, is it evident that it is not admissible that <lb/>
            this should involve another habit; for the thing would go on <lb/>
            to infinity if it be the case that one habit should involve the <lb/>
            habit of that which is possessed. And in another way is <lb/>
            habit styled a disposition according to which that which is <lb/>
            disposed is disposed well or ill; and this either according to <lb/>
            itself, that is, essentially, or in relation to another: as, for <lb/>
            example, health is a certain habit, for it is a disposition of <note type="footnote"> 1 Habit is not viewed in its ethical aspect here; that is, in reference <lb/>
            to the provision natural to the human species, whereby active principles <lb/>

            may be a portion of such a disposition. Wherefore, also, is <lb/>
            the virtue or excellency of the parts a certain habit.</p>

          <p>1. Different <lb/>
            modes of pri­ <lb/>
            vation, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭτέρη­ <lb/>
            ϭις</foreign>, in regard <lb/>
            of an aptitude <lb/>
            of the subject.</p>
          <p>PRIVATION3 is denominated, in one way, in <lb/>
            case a thing does not involve any of the things <lb/>
            that by nature are adapted for being possessed, <lb/>
            even though itself may not by nature be adapted <lb/>
            for the possession of such; as, for example, a <lb/>
            plant in this sense is said to be deprived of eyes. And <lb/>
            in another way is that termed privation if a thing be <lb/>
            by nature fit for possession of a thing, either itself or the <lb/>
            genus, and yet may not have possession of that thing; <unclear/>&lt;*, in <lb/>
            one sense is a blind man deprived of sight, and a mole in <lb/>
            another : the latter, indeed, according to the genus, and the <lb/>
            former according to itself, or essentially. Further, is that <lb/>
            privation if a thing be by nature adapted to possess a <lb/>
            quality; and when it is so adapted by nature to possess it, <note type="footnote"> 1 Any one who has studied the ethical system of Aristotle is familiar <lb/>
            with this sentiment. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Vide Categories, chap. viii. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Vide chap. x. of the Categories on the subject of opposition, and <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. XXIII.] </note> <lb/>
            yet possesses it not, for blindness is a certain privation; but <lb/>
            for an animal to be blind is not in accordance with every <lb/>
            age, but with that only in which it is fitted by nature to <lb/>
            have sight, and yet may not have it at all. And in like <lb/>
            manner may privation be found in " the what," and according <lb/>
            to " what," and for " what," and so far forth as it may be <lb/>
            adapted by nature for the possession of such, and yet may <lb/>
            not possess them.</p>
          <p>Further, the violent removal of each thing is <lb/>
            styled a privation. And as often, also, as are <lb/>
            expressed negations from A, so often, likewise, are <lb/>
            expressed privations; for the unequal is denomi- <lb/>

            privation in re­ <lb/>
            gard of nega­ <lb/>
            non. <lb/>
            nated thus from the fact of the non-possession of equality <lb/>
            when by nature it is fitted for it, but the invisible, both <lb/>
            from being entirely without colour and in consequence of <lb/>
            having it defectively; and an animal is called "apous," or <lb/>
            without feet, both from its being without feet entirely, and <lb/>
            in consequence of having them attended with some defect <lb/>
            Further, do we call a thing privation when that thing has <lb/>
            anything small; as, for instance, any fruit with a small <lb/>
            kernel: and this amounts to the being, in a manner, disposed <lb/>
            defectively. And, again, we say privation exists where a <lb/>
            thing cannot be effected with facility, or in a proper manner; <lb/>
            as, for example, that which cannot be severed is so not only <lb/>
            in respect of the incapacity of being severed, but also in <lb/>
            respect of the incapacity of being severed easily or properly. <lb/>
            Moreover, privation is found in the non-possession of a thing <lb/>
            in every way; for a person blind is not called such from <lb/>
            being one-eyed, but from being deprived of the power of <lb/>
            vision in both eyes. Wherefore, not every man is good or <lb/>
            evil, or just or unjust; but also there are shades of character <lb/>
            intermediate between these.</p>

          <p>POSSESSION' is denominated in many ways; <lb/>
            in one way as the action of a thing according <lb/>
            to the nature of that thing, or according to the <lb/>
            impulse of it. Wherefore, both a fever is said <lb/>

            in which we <lb/>
            use the word <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [BOOK IV. </note> <lb/>
            to possess a man, and tyrants are said to possess states, and <lb/>
            those that are clothed a garment. And in another way <lb/>
            we term possession as that in whatever anything is inherent, <lb/>
            as being receptive; as, for instance, the brass possesses the <lb/>
            form of a statue, and the body possesses disease. And in <lb/>
            another way we term possession as a thing that embraces the <lb/>
            things that are comprised; for wherein anything is com­ <lb/>
            prised, by this it is said to be possessed: as, for instance, we <lb/>
            say that the vessel possesses moisture, and the city inhabit­ <lb/>
            ants, and the ship sailors; and so, also, the whole possesses <lb/>
            the parts. And, further, that which hinders, in accordance <lb/>
            with its own force, anything from motion or action is said to <lb/>
            possess this very thing; as, for example, both the pillars <lb/>
            possess the superincumbent weights, and just as the poets <lb/>
            make Atlas to possess the heaven, so that it should otherwise <lb/>
            fall upon the earth; as, also, certain of the physiologists2 <lb/>
            affirm. And in this way, likewise, is the connecting said to <lb/>
            possess the things which it connects, as if they would otherwise <lb/>
            have severally been separated according to their own proper <lb/>
            force. And the being in anything is expressed in a similar <lb/>
            manner with, and as a consequence upon, possession.</p>

          <p>"THE being from anything" is said in one way <lb/>
            to be that from which a thing is as from matter; <lb/>
            and this in a twofold respect, either according to <lb/>
            the first genus, or according to the last species: as, <lb/>
            for instance, all liquids, in a way, are from water, and the <lb/>
            statue is from brass. And in another way we consider "the <note type="footnote"> 1 For example, Hesiod in the Theogony, at line 517, "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ατλας δ' <lb/>

            being from anything" as that which springs from the first <lb/>
            moving cause; thus, from what doth the battle arise? from <lb/>
            invective, because such is a first principle of the battle. In <lb/>
            another sense, however, is this defined as that from what is <lb/>
            composite, (I mean from matter and form,) as the parts from <lb/>
            the whole, and the verse from the Iliad, and the stones from <lb/>
            the house; for form is an end to be sure, but that which <lb/>
            possesses an end is finished. And in some respects it is as <lb/>
            the species from a part; for instance, man is from biped, and <lb/>
            a syllable from a letter: for these1 are from those otherwise <lb/>
            than the statue from the brass, for from the matter cognisant <lb/>
            to the senses is the composite substance; but also form con­ <lb/>
            sists from the matter of the form. Some things are styled <lb/>
            in this way as " that from anything," and others, if they <lb/>
            subsist according to any part of these modes: as from the <lb/>
            father and mother the child, and from earth the plants, <lb/>
            because they spring from some part of them.</p>
          <p>And, lastly, is this styled as that which sub­ <lb/>

            as also those particulars just now enumerated; but others <lb/>
            only in respect of their being successive in time: as from <lb/>

            things that are contained in the definition which manifests <lb/>
            each thing, these also are parts of the whole. Wherefore, the <lb/>
            genus is called a part also of the species, and in other respects <lb/>
            the species is regarded a part of the genus.</p>

          <p>A WHOLE is styled, first, that from which is <lb/>
            absent no part of those things whereof the whole <lb/>
            by nature is said to consist; and secondly, that <lb/>
            which contains the things contained,1 so that they <lb/>
            form one certain thing. And this is the case in a twofold <lb/>
            way; for it is so either in such a manner that each may be <lb/>
            one, or that one thing may arise from these. For the <lb/>
            universal, indeed, and that which is predicated in general as <lb/>
            being a certain whole, are universal in such a way as that <lb/>
            the predication of each contains many things, and that all are <lb/>
            one as each predicated thing is; for example, man, horse, <lb/>
            god, is individually one thing, because all are animals. And <lb/>
            the continuous and the finite may we regard as a whole when <lb/>
            there may be produced one thing from many things that are <lb/>
            inherent, especially when this is the case in potentiality, but <lb/>
            if not in energy. <note type="footnote"> 1 Some copies, e.g. the Leipsic edition, insert <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν καὶ</foreign> before <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ περι­ <lb/>

            seeing that quantity has a first principle, and a mean, and <lb/>
            an extreme, of whatsoever quantities position does not cause <lb/>
            a difference "all" is predicated; but of whatsoever it does, a <lb/>
            “whole ” is predicated ; and as many things as admit of both, <lb/>
            both "whole" and " all" are predicated. There are those things, <lb/>
            however, whose nature abides the same in the act of trans- <lb/>
            position ; but not so with the form, as wax and a garment: <lb/>
            for both whole and all are they styled, for they possess both. <lb/>
            But water, and whatsoever things are moist, and number, are <lb/>
            called " all, no doubt; yet number is not styled a whole, and <lb/>
            water a whole, unless metaphorically. All those, however, <lb/>
            are predicated thus of which the entire is predicated; as in <lb/>
            the case of the one, in the case of these I say all things are <lb/>
            predicated; as in the case of things divided we say all this <lb/>
            is number, and all these monads.</p>

            must needs be itself divisible and a whole. For <lb/>
            two things are not mutilated when either one <lb/>

            thus, if a goblet be mutilated, still must the goblet exist; but <lb/>
            a number is no longer the same when a part is taken away. <lb/>
            And, in addition to these, if also things may be of dissimilar <lb/>
            parts, neither can all these be considered mutilated; for <lb/>
            number is that which also contains dissimilar parts: as, for <lb/>
            example, a duad, a triad. But, in short, none of those <lb/>
            things of which the position does not make a difference is <lb/>
            mutilated, as water or fire; but such must needs be muti­ <lb/>
            lated which have a substantial position. Further, things <note type="footnote"> 1 Some of the remarks in this chapter might guide us in questions <lb/>

            continuous must needs be mutilated; for harmony consisting <lb/>

          <p>And, in addition to these, neither are those <lb/>
            things mutilated, whatsoever are wholes, by the <lb/>
            privation of any part whatsoever indifferently. <lb/>
            For it is not necessary that either the principal <lb/>
            parts of the substance, or those that are taken away <lb/>
            anywhere whatsoever, should make what remains mutilated; <lb/>
            as, for instance, if a goblet be bored it is not mutilated, but <lb/>
            if its handle, or if any of its extremities, be, it is mutilated: <lb/>
            and a man is not mutilated if he have flesh or spleen, but <lb/>
            if he have an extremity taken away, and not every such <lb/>
            indifferently; but should it be that which does not possess <lb/>
            the power of reproduction when entirely taken away. <lb/>
            Wherefore, bald persons are not mutilated.</p>

            matter.</p>
          <p>GENUS is styled so partly when there may be <lb/>
            a continuous generation of things that possess <lb/>
            the same species; as, for instance, there is said <lb/>
            to be a genus of men, because as long as the <lb/>
            generation of them may be continuous there <lb/>
            would exist such. And it is that also from which things <lb/>
            derive their being as the first disposing cause towards <lb/>
            existence; for so are the Ellenes styled the genus, and the <lb/>
            Ionians: the former as springing from Hellen, and the <lb/>
            latter from Ion,1 as the first generator. And rather are <lb/>
            those things a genus that are from the generator than from <lb/>
            the matter. For they are said to be the genus, also, that <lb/>
            are from the female, as those from Pyrrha. Further, are <lb/>
            they termed as the surface is called the genus of superficial <lb/>
            figures, and the solid of such as are solid; for, as regards <note type="footnote"> 1 Hellen was supposed to have been the son of Deucalion and Pyrrha; <lb/>
            his two sons, AEOlUS and Dorus, gave their names to the two great sub­ <lb/>

            sach of the figures, the one is such a surface, but the other <lb/>
            is such a solid, and this is the subject in the differences, <lb/>
            which, of course, is the genus. Further, do we regard genus <lb/>
            as that which first is inherent in definitions, which is predi­ <lb/>
            cated in the case of the essence of a thing the differences of <lb/>
            which are called qualities. The genus, therefore, indeed, is <lb/>
            denominated in thus many ways; partly according to the <lb/>
            continuous generation of the same species, and partly accord­ <lb/>
            ing to the original moving power of the same species, and <lb/>
            partly as matter; for that to which the difference and the <lb/>
            quality belong; this constitutes the subject which we style <lb/>
            matter.</p>
          <p>And things are called diverse in genus of <lb/>
            which the first subject is diverse, and in the case <lb/>
            of which one is not resolved into another, nor <lb/>
            both into the same, (as the form and the matter <lb/>
            2. When things <lb/>
            are said to be <lb/>
            diverse in <lb/>
            genus. <lb/>
            are something different in the genus,) and whatsoever things <lb/>
            are denominated according to a different form of the predica­ <lb/>
            tion of entity; for some entities signify quiddity, and some <lb/>
            a certain quality of a thing, and some have a signification in <lb/>
            accordance with our former division ;2 for neither are these <lb/>

          <p>THE false3 is denominated in one way as <lb/>
            a false thing; and, in regard of this, partly in <lb/>
            the fact of its not being composed, or in the <lb/>
            impossibility of its being in a state of com- <lb/>
            1. The term <lb/>
            false, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψσυ̃δος</foreign>. <lb/>
            explained as <lb/>
            equivalent with <lb/>

            position; as the expression of the diameter being commen­ <lb/>
            surable, or of your being in a sitting posture; for of these the <lb/>
            former is, indeed, always, but the latter sometimes false: for <lb/>
            thus are these not in being. For things are false as many <lb/>
            as are in being, no doubt, but yet are fitted by nature, <lb/>
            to appear either not such as they are, or what they are not; <lb/>
            as, for example, a rough painting and dreams; for these, <note type="footnote"> 1 I have added these words from Taylor, to complete the sense. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 In the division of the ten predicaments—the famous <unclear>once</unclear> a that if <lb/>

            truly, are something, but not those things of which they <lb/>
            cause an imagination or impression. Things, indeed, there­ <lb/>
            fore, are thus termed false either in respect of themselves <lb/>
            not being, or in respect of the impression that is conveyed <lb/>
            from them being that of a nonentity; and a false discourse <lb/>
            is a discourse about nonentities, so far forth as it is false.</p>
          <p>2. What lalsity <lb/>
            in definition <lb/>
            amounts to.</p>
          <p>Wherefore, every false definition, or discourse, <lb/>
            is employed about something that is different <lb/>
            from that of which it would be a true dis­ <lb/>
            course; as the discourse about a circle is a false one <lb/>
            when transferred to a triangle. Now, the discourse, or <lb/>
            definition of everything is partly as one-namely, that <lb/>
            explanatory of the essence; and it is partly as many, since, <lb/>
            somehow, a thing itself, and this thing, viewed as passive, <lb/>
            may be regarded the same as Socrates and Socrates the <lb/>
            musical. And a false discourse is a discourse simply about <lb/>
            nothing.</p>

            on the subject <lb/>
            of correct defi­ <lb/>
            nition.</p>
          <p>Wherefore, Antisthenes entertained a silly <lb/>
            opinion when he thought that nothing could be <lb/>
            predicated, unless one, in regard of one thing, <lb/>
            by a proper definition or discourse; the result <lb/>
            of which statements was, that there can be no contradiction <lb/>
            in existence, and almost no way of making a false assertion. <lb/>
            It is possible, however, to express each thing not only in a <lb/>
            discourse proper to itself, but also in that which belongs to <lb/>
            a different thing,-falsely, no doubt, and altogether so: not­ <lb/>
            withstanding, then, is it possible to express the same, in a <lb/>
            manner, also with truth; as, for instance, eight are twofold, <lb/>
            from the definition of the duad. Some things, indeed, there­ <lb/>
            fore, are denominated in this way false.</p>
          <p>4. Proper sense <lb/>
            of the word <lb/>
            false as applied <lb/>
            to a man.</p>
          <p>But a false man is called one who is ready and <lb/>
            disposed to admit false assertions of such a sort, <lb/>
            not on account of anything that is different, but <lb/>
            on account of their being false, and who, in the <lb/>
            case of others, is the cause of the adoption of such false asser­ <lb/>
            tions ; as also we say that those things are false as many as <lb/>
            create a false impression.2 <note type="footnote"> I Antisthenes flourished about 396 B. c. He was the founder of the <lb/>

            treasure. This, then, would be an accident to the person <lb/>
            engaged in digging the trench, namely, the discovery of the <lb/>
            treasure ; for neither does the one necessarily follow from the <lb/>

            does he, for the most part, find a treasure. And the case is <lb/>

            however, this takes place neither of necessity nor as for the <lb/>

            there is something which has a subsistence, and a subsistence <lb/>
            in something, and some of these both in a certain place and <lb/>
            at a certain time, whatsoever would be so, indeed, but would <lb/>
            involve no allusion as to why it was this particular thing, <lb/>

            ever, so far forth as itself is concerned, but as far as some­ <lb/>
            thing else is; for the storm was the cause of his going to the <lb/>
            port he was not sailing for, and this was Ægina. And in <lb/>
            another way is a thing called an accident; for example, in <lb/>
            the way whatsoever things are inherent in each thing essen­ <lb/>
            tially, and yet are not contained in the substance of that <lb/>
            thing, as in a triangle to have angles equal to two right <lb/>
            angles. And accidents of this sort it is admissible should <lb/>
            be eternal, yet this is not the case with any of those others. <lb/>

          <p>1. The chief <lb/>
            distinction of <lb/>
            metaphysics, <lb/>
            as a science, <lb/>
            that it investi­ <lb/>
            gates “ens,” <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ <lb/>
            όν</foreign>, as such.</p>
          <p>THE first principles and causes of entities are <lb/>
            under investigation; and it is evident that the <lb/>
            investigation regards the causes and first prin­ <lb/>
            ciples of entities, so far forth as they are entities. <lb/>
            For there is a certain cause of health, and of <lb/>
            a good habit of body, and of mathematical entities; likewise <lb/>
            are there first principles, and elements, and causes; and in <lb/>
            general, also, every science which is an intellectual one, or in <lb/>
            any degree even partaking of the faculty of thought,2 is con­ <lb/>
            versant about causes and first principles, which are either <lb/>
            more accurate or more simple, as the case may be. All of <lb/>
            these, however, being descriptive of one particular subject, <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristotle in this book, which stands sixth in some copies, proceeds <lb/>
            to expand further the fundamental notion of metaphysics as a science <lb/>
            of entity. It harmonizes with physics, so far forth as both are <lb/>
            speculative; and under ontology must be ranked theology, as being <lb/>
            in its nature eminently speculative or theoretic. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">διάνοιας</foreign>. See note, p. 244 of the Orgar on, "Bohn's Classical <unclear>Library</unclear>.2 </note> <pb n="157"/>

            and a particular genus, are engaged about this; but not con. <lb/>
            coming being or entity simply considered, nor so far forth <lb/>
            as it is entity: nor do they make any account of the sub­ <lb/>
            stance of a thing, but from this one particular subject, partly <lb/>
            from sense making this manifest, and partly assuming an <lb/>
            hypothesis as to substance or quiddity; they, accordingly, <lb/>
            demonstrate the things that are essentially inherent in the <lb/>
            genus about which they subsist, either more necessarily or <lb/>
            more feebly. Wherefore, it is evident that there is not a <lb/>
            demonstration of substance, nor of "the what" a thing is, that <lb/>
            is, of quiddity, by means of an induction of such a kind; but <lb/>
            there is some other mode of manifestation. In like manner, <lb/>
            also, these sciences say nothing as to whether the genus <lb/>
            about which they are engaged is or is not, on account of its <lb/>
            belonging to the same faculty of thought or understanding, <lb/>
            and of its making manifest the nature of a thing, and whether <lb/>
            it is this particular thing.</p>
          <p>But since, also, physical science happens to <lb/>
            be conversant about a certain genus of entity, <lb/>
            (for about such a sort of substance is it con­ <lb/>
            versant in which is contained in itself the first <lb/>
            2. A Yortiori <lb/>
            proof of this <lb/>
            from physical <lb/>
            science, <lb/>
            principle of motion and of rest, it is evident that it is neither <lb/>
            practical, nor productive, that is, effective; for the first principle <lb/>
            of things that are productive resides in the producer or <lb/>
            efficient cause, whether that principle be mind, or art, or a <lb/>
            certain capacity, but the first principle of things that are <lb/>
            practical is free-will in the agent; for the same thing is an <lb/>
            object of action and of free-will. Wherefore, if every dianoetic <lb/>
            faculty be either practical, or productive, or speculative, the <lb/>
            physical dianoetic energy would be some speculative science; <lb/>
            but speculative about such an entity as it is possible should <lb/>
            have motion imparted to it, and about such a substance as, <lb/>
            existing according to reason, for the most part has not a <lb/>
            separable subsistence merely. It is requisite, <lb/>
            however, as regards the essence or formal cause, <lb/>
            and the definition how things are so, that this <lb/>
            should not escape our notice, as without this <lb/>
            and from the <lb/>
            mode of defi­ <lb/>

            and to which the inquiry what they are belongs, some subsist <lb/>
            in such a manner as the flat-nose,1 and some as the hollow. <lb/>
            And these differ, since flat-nose is conceived along with <lb/>
            matter, for, in truth, a flat-nose is a hollow-nose; but hol­ <lb/>
            lowness or concavity is without sensible matter. If, there­ <lb/>
            fore, all physical or natural things are predicated in the same <lb/>
            way as flat-nose—as, for instance, nose, eye, face, flesh, bone, <lb/>
            in short, animal, leaf, root, bark; in short, plant (for the <lb/>
            definition of none of these subsists without motion, but such <lb/>
            invariably involves matter)—it is plain how it is necessary in <lb/>
            physical inquiries to investigate the nature of a thing, and <lb/>
            to define it, and why, also, it is the part of the natural <lb/>
            philosopher to institute an inquiry concerning a certain soul, <lb/>
            namely, such a soul as is not unconnected with matter; that <lb/>
            therefore the physical dianoetic energy is speculative is <lb/>
            and from the <lb/>
            case of mathe­ <lb/>
            matica. <lb/>
            evident from these statements. But also the <lb/>
            mathematical dianoetic energy is speculative also; <lb/>
            whether it is conversant, however, about entities <lb/>
            that are immovable, and capable of a separate subsistence, <lb/>
            is a point that at present is obscure: but that certain mathe­ <lb/>
            matical systems investigate certain entities, so far as they are <lb/>
            immovable, and so far as they have a separable subsistence, <lb/>
            is clear.</p>
          <p>3. The neces­ <lb/>
            sity of such a <lb/>
            science as onto­ <lb/>
            logy proved.</p>
          <p>Now, if there is something that is eternal and <lb/>
            immovable, and that involves a separate subsist­ <lb/>
            ence, it is evident that it is the province of the <lb/>
            speculative,2 that is, of the ontological, science to <lb/>
            investigate such. It is not, certainly, the province of physical <lb/>
            science, at any rate, (for physical science is conversant about <lb/>
            certain movable natures,) nor of the mathematical, but of a <lb/>
            science prior to both of these, that is, the science of meta­ <lb/>
            physics.3 For physical science, I admit, is conversant about <lb/>
            things that are inseparable, to be sure, but nut immovable; <note type="footnote"> 1 In adducing here this illustration of <foreign xml:lang="grc">σιμότης</foreign> “pugnosedness,” so <lb/>
            frequently found in this and other parts of his works, Aristotle is <lb/>
            preparing the way for demonstrating the necessity of some such science <lb/>
            being in existence as that of ontology. Vide Mr. Maurice’s analysis of the <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. I.] </note> <lb/>
            and of mathematical science some are conversant about enti. <lb/>
            ties that are immovable, it is true, yet, perhaps, not sepa­ <lb/>
            rable, but subsisting as in matter. But Metaphysics, or the <lb/>
            First Philosophy, is conversant about entities which both have <lb/>
            a separate subsistence and are immovable; and it is necessary <lb/>
            that causes should be eternal, all without exception, but <lb/>
            particularly these : for these are the causes of the things that <lb/>
            are manifest or phenomenal amongst those that are divine.</p>
          <p>Wherefore, according to this view of things, <lb/>
            there would be three speculative philosophies; <lb/>
            namely, the mathematical, the physical, the <lb/>
            theological. For it is not obscure that if what <lb/>

            division of <lb/>

            science. <lb/>
            is divine exists anywhere, it resides in such a nature as this; <lb/>
            and it is requisite that that should be the most honourable <lb/>
            science which is conversant about a genus of things which is <lb/>
            most entitled to our respect. The speculative sciences, ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly, are more eligible than the rest of the sciences; and <lb/>
            of such as are speculative, this science of metaphysics, now <lb/>
            under investigation, is more eligible than all the others,</p>
          <p>For one would feel a doubt as to whether at <lb/>
            all the first philosophy, or ontology, is universal, <lb/>
            or conversant about a certain genus and one <lb/>
            nature. For neither is there the same method <lb/>
            5. Solution of <lb/>
            a doubt as re­ <lb/>
            gards onto. <lb/>
            logy. <lb/>
            of conducting our inquiries in the mathematical sciences; <lb/>
            but geometry, in fact, and astronomy, are conversant about a <lb/>
            certain peculiar nature : yet, in reply to this, I would say that <lb/>
            pure mathematics universally 2 is common to all the branches <lb/>
            of that science, and thus that the first philosophy universally <lb/>
            is common to all the sciences. If, then, there is not some <lb/>
            different substance besides those that consist by nature, the <lb/>
            physical would be the first science; but if there is a certain <lb/>
            immovable substance, this will be prior, and the subject <lb/>
            of the first philosophy, and in this way will subsist uni­ <lb/>
            versally, because it is the first of the sciences; and it would <lb/>
            be the province of this science of metaphysics, or ontology, to <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴπερ τὸ θεῖον ὐπαρχοί</foreign>. This air of hesitation, here and elsewhere, <lb/>

          <p>SINCE, however, entity, simply so called, is <lb/>
            denominated in many ways, of which one was <lb/>
            that which subsists according to accident, and <lb/>
            another that which is as a thing that is true,2 <lb/>
            and the non-being of which is as a thing that is <lb/>
            false, and besides these, since these are figures of predi­ <lb/>
            cation ; as, for example, quiddity, and quality, and quantity, <lb/>
            and the place where, and the time when, and whatever else <lb/>
            there is that is significant in this way: further, besides all <lb/>
            these, is there that which subsists in potentiality, and that <lb/>
            which subsists in energy : since, however, I say entity is deno­ <lb/>
            minated in many ways; in the first instance, as far as regards <lb/>
            that subsisting according to accident, must we declare that <lb/>
            respecting this there exists no speculation.3</p>
          <p>2. Practical <lb/>
            proof of thia <lb/>
            from house­ <lb/>
            building ;</p>
          <p>And a proof of this statement is the following; <lb/>
            for in no science is there any attention paid to this <lb/>
            neither in practical, nor productive, nor specula­ <lb/>
            tive science. For neither does one who builds a house make at <lb/>
            the same time as many things as are accidental to the house <lb/>
            when it is built, for these are infinite; there is no hindrance, <lb/>
            for example, but that the house, when it has been con­ <lb/>
            structed should prove to some persons agreeable, but to <lb/>
            others injurious, and to others serviceable, and, as I may say, <lb/>
            different from all entities, of none of which the building art is <lb/>
            and a specula­ <lb/>
            tive proof of it <lb/>
            from geometry. <lb/>
            productive. And, in the same manner, neither <lb/>
            does the geometrician speculate into things which <lb/>
            in this way are accidental to figures, nor whether <lb/>
            there is any difference between a wooden triangle and a <lb/>
            triangle having angles equal to two right angles. <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristotle here shows that though there is no possibility of there <lb/>
            being a science of accidents, yet that there may exist one conversant <lb/>
            about the substances wherein these accidents inhere. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Vide book VIII. chap. x. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 The reasoning that follows is well worthy of attention. </note> <pb n="161"/>

          <p><note type="margin"> CH. II. </note> And this coincidence takes place rationally; <lb/>
            for the accidental subsists as it were in name <lb/>
            merely. Wherefore, after a certain mode, Plato <lb/>
            judiciously arranged nonentity about the art <lb/>
            of the Sophist. For the arguments of the <lb/>
            3. This view <lb/>
            about a science <lb/>
            of the acci­ <lb/>
            dental confirm­ <lb/>
            ed from the <lb/>
            science of the <lb/>
            Sophist. <lb/>
            Sophists are employed about the accident, as I may say, <lb/>
            most especially of all things; for they ask, for instance, <lb/>
            whether a musician and a grammarian are a different person <lb/>
            or the same ? and whether the musical Coriscus and Coriscus <lb/>
            are the same ? and whether everything which may exist, yet <lb/>
            not always, has been generated ? wherefore, whether in case <lb/>
            a man is musical he has been made grammatical ? and whether <lb/>
            in case he is grammatical he has been made musical ? and as <lb/>
            many other arguments, no doubt, as there are of this kind; <lb/>
            for accident appears to be a something that hovers on the <lb/>
            confines of nonentity.1 Now, this is evident also from such <lb/>
            arguments as the foregoing; for of those things that subsist in <lb/>
            a different way from accidents there is generation and cor­ <lb/>
            ruption : but this is not the case with those things that <lb/>
            subsist according to accident.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, however, must we further is­ <lb/>
            cuss concerning accident, as far as is possible, what <lb/>
            is its nature, and on account of what cause it <lb/>
            exists; for at the same time, perhaps, will it be <lb/>
            evident on account of what reason also there is <lb/>
            4. The nature <lb/>
            and cause of <lb/>
            the accident <lb/>
            may account <lb/>
            for the non- <lb/>
            existence of a <lb/>
            science of it. <lb/>
            not a science of it. Since, therefore, there are in entities <lb/>
            some things that are always disposed in a similar manner, <lb/>
            and from necessity,-a necessity that is not denominated <lb/>
            according to what is violent, but that which we have spoken <lb/>
            of in the case of its not being admissible for a thing to be <lb/>
            otherwise than it is,-and since other things, though these <lb/>
            are not of necessity, to be sure, nor always, yet are in <lb/>
            existence for the most part, this is the first principle, and <lb/>
            this the cause of the subsistence of accident.</p>
          <p>For whatever may be neither always, nor for <lb/>
            the most part, this we pronounce to be an acci­ <lb/>
            dent;2 as, for instance, in the dog-days, that is, <lb/>

            aiming at furnishing pleasure, would probably make some­ <lb/>
            thing calculated to promote health, but not in accordance <lb/>
            with, or by virtue of, the art of cooking. Wherefore, we say <lb/>
            that this would be accidental, and that in a certain respect, <lb/>
            the cook makes something that is salubrious, but, simply con-. <lb/>
            sidered, that he does not so.</p>
          <p>6. Why the ac­ <lb/>
            cident must <lb/>
            exist.</p>
          <p>For of some things are there other poten­ <lb/>
            tialities1 that sometimes are productive, but of <lb/>
            others there is no definite art or potentiality; <lb/>
            for of those things that are, or are generated according to acci­ <lb/>
            dent, the cause also is according to accident. Wherefore, since <lb/>
            all things are not from necessity and always either are entities <lb/>
            or are in generation, but since most things have a subsistence <lb/>
            for the most part, it is necessary that there be in existence <lb/>
            something which subsists according to accident, and that it <lb/>
            should be such as is a white musician, who exists neither <lb/>
            always, nor for the most part. Since sometimes, however, <lb/>
            such is produced, there will be a subsistence according to acci­ <lb/>
            dent, and if not, all things will subsist from necessity. Where­ <lb/>
            fore, matter will be the contingent cause2 of what is accidental, <lb/>
            differently from that which has a subsistence, for the most <lb/>
            part.</p>
          <p>7. The exist­ <lb/>
            ence of the ac-</p>
          <p>We must, however, assume this as a begin­ <lb/>
            ning of the inquiry, whether there is nothing <note type="footnote">1 As to the different sorts of potentialities, or capacities, and their. <lb/>

            which subsists neither always, nor for the most <lb/>
            part, or whether this is impossible ? Accordingly, <lb/>
            Uideat 1 settled <lb/>
            point. <lb/>
            in addition to these things is there something which in one <lb/>
            way or other has a casual subsistence, and a subsistence <lb/>
            according to accident. Shall we, however, admit that that <lb/>
            which has a subsistence for the most part, and that which <lb/>
            has a perpetual subsistence, is not inherent in the nature of <lb/>
            anything, or are there certain entities that are eternal ? Con­ <lb/>
            cerning these points, indeed, we will afterwards examine.</p>
          <p>That, however, there is not a science of the <lb/>
            accidental is manifest; for, certainly, every science <lb/>
            is a science either of that which subsists always, <lb/>
            or of that which subsists as for the most part. <lb/>
            8. That there is <lb/>
            no science of <lb/>
            the accidents, <lb/>
            reaffirmed. <lb/>
            For, otherwise, how should one learn anything or- instruct <lb/>
            another? for it is necessary that the object of the science be <lb/>
            defined, either by that subsisting always, or that having a <lb/>
            subsistence for the most part, as that mead is useful, for the <lb/>
            most part, for one that is sick of fever. What, however, is <lb/>
            beyond this it will not be allowable to affirm; namely, as to <lb/>
            the time when it may not be useful: as, for instance, during <lb/>
            new-moon, for either always, or for the most part, is the <lb/>
            mead serviceable during new-moon, also; and what is dif­ <lb/>
            ferent from these is accidental. What, in truth, therefore, the <lb/>
            accidental is, and from what cause it arises, and that there is <lb/>
            no science of it in existence, has been declared.</p>

          <p>Now, that there are first principles, and causes <lb/>
            that are generable and corruptible, without any­ <lb/>
            thing rising into existence and falling into decay, <lb/>
            is evident. For if this were not the case all <lb/>
            1. To deny the <lb/>
            accidental leads <lb/>
            to a system of <lb/>
            necessity. <lb/>
            things would subsist from necessity, if of that which is being <lb/>
            produced and corrupted there must needs be a certain cause <lb/>
            which does not subsist according to accident. For whether <lb/>
            will this particular thing take place or not? if, at least, this be <lb/>
            produced it will, but if not, by no means will it take place; <lb/>
            but this latter will take place if something else is accent <lb/>
            plished.</p>

          <p>And so it is manifest1 that when time is <lb/>
            substracted from finite duration you will in­ <lb/>
            variably come to the present moment. Where­ <lb/>
            fore, this person will die either by disease or violence if he, <lb/>
            at least, go forth out of the city, and this will take place if he <lb/>
            should be thirsty, and this will happen if something else <lb/>
            happens; and so will he come to that which now is, or to <lb/>
            something of those things that have been : as, for instance, if <lb/>
            he may have felt thirst; and this will happen if he eats things <lb/>
            that are pungent to the taste; and this, assuredly, is the case <lb/>
            or is not: wherefore, he shall necessarily either die or shall not <lb/>
            die. In like manner, also, if any one pass over in his inquiry <lb/>
            to the things that have been done, the reasoning is the same; <lb/>
            for already does this subsist in something: but I speak of that <lb/>
            which has been done. Accordingly, all things that are likely <lb/>
            to be in future will subsist from necessity : as, for instance, <lb/>
            the death of one that is living; for already has something <lb/>
            been accomplished which shows a tendency towards dissolu­ <lb/>
            tion ; I mean, the existence of things that are contrary in <lb/>
            the same body: but if the death of this person is to be <lb/>
            brought about by disease or violence, not as yet has this taken <lb/>
            place, but should this particular thing be effected.</p>
          <p>3. Under what <lb/>
            class of cause <lb/>
            must we rank <lb/>
            that of the TO <lb/>

          <p>It is evident, then, that this reduction ad­ <lb/>
            vances towards a certain principle, and this <lb/>
            principle no longer extends to anything else. <lb/>
            Therefore, will this be the principle of what is <lb/>
            casual, and there will be nothing as a cause of its <lb/>
            generation. But into what sort of first principle, and what <lb/>
            sort of cause such a reduction may be made, whether as into <lb/>
            matter,2 or as into the final cause, or as into the power that <lb/>
            imparts motion that is the efficient cause, is particularly <lb/>
            worthy of consideration.</p>

            cussion be dismissed, for the subject has been <lb/>

            and falsehood. <lb/>
            which subsists as true is entity, and that which subsists as <lb/>
            false is nonentity, since they are employed about1 composi­ <lb/>
            tion and division, and entirety about a portion of con­ <lb/>
            tradiction; for that which is true involves an affirmation <lb/>
            in the case of composition, and a negation in the case of <lb/>
            division; but that which is false involves the contradiction of <lb/>
            this division.</p>
          <p>But how it is possible to understand what <lb/>
            subsists at the same time, or has a separate <lb/>
            2. Solution of <lb/>
            a difficulty. <lb/>
            subsistence, this is another question. Now, I mean, that <lb/>
            things which subsist together, and that which subsists apart, <lb/>
            are disposed in such a way as not to subsist in a consequent <lb/>
            order, but so as to become one certain thing; for not in <lb/>
            things themselves are the false and the true,-as that <lb/>
            which is good is true, but that which is bad is false,-but in <lb/>
            the understanding; and the truth and falsehood concerning <lb/>
            things that are simple, and concerning essence, are not in the <lb/>
            understanding either. As many points, then, as it is requisite <lb/>
            to examine into as regards entity subsisting in this way, and <lb/>
            regarding nonentity, must be investigated on a subsequent2 <lb/>
            occasion.</p>
          <p>Since, however, composition and division are <lb/>
            in the intellect but not in the things themselves, <lb/>
            and that which is an entity after this manner is dif­ <lb/>
            ferent from those things that are properly termed <lb/>
            3. Why an in­ <lb/>
            quiry about <lb/>
            entity in this <lb/>
            aspect is omit­ <lb/>

            entities, (for either the nature of a thing, or its being of a <lb/>
            certain quality or quantity, or something else of the kind, <lb/>
            doth the intellect conjoin or separate,)—that which, as an <lb/>
            entity, subsists as an accident, and that which is as it were <lb/>
            what is true-the consideration of these must be omitted. <note type="footnote"> or the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ μὴ ὂν</foreign> as one with falsehood. This piece of Platonism is rejected <lb/>

            Wherefore, let these points be omitted, to be sure; but we <lb/>

          <p>ENTITY is denominated in many ways, as <lb/>
            we have previously made the division in the case <lb/>
            of those statements relating to its multifarious <lb/>
            predications;8 for one signification of entity is <lb/>
            “the what a thing is," or quiddity, and this <lb/>
            certain particular thing; and another is quality <lb/>
            or quantity, or each of the rest of the things that are so pre­ <lb/>
            dicated. Now, seeing that entity is spoken of in thus many <lb/>
            ways, it is evident that the first entity amongst these is <lb/>
            quiddity, or “the what a thing is," which signifies sub­ <lb/>
            stance. For when we say that this particular thing is of a <lb/>
            certain quality, we term it either good or bad; but not as of <lb/>
            three cubits, or that it is a man: when, however, we say <lb/>
            what a thing is, we term it not white or warm, or of three <lb/>

            such; some, to wit, as being quantities, and some qualities, <lb/>
            and some passions, and others, some other things of the sort. <lb/>
            Wherefore, one might feel perplexed as to whether walking.1 <lb/>
            and health, and sitting, were each of them an entity or <lb/>
            a nonentity. And, in like manner, also, is it the case with <lb/>
            any whatsoever of the other things of this kind respecting <lb/>
            which similar doubts are entertained; for none of them is <lb/>
            adapted by nature either to subsist essentially or is capable of <lb/>
            being separated from substance, but rather (if I may express <lb/>
            myself so) this is to be said of any amongst the entities <lb/>
            which is walking, and sitting, and being in sound health. <lb/>
            And these rather than those appear to be entities, because <lb/>
            they have some definite subject, and this is substance, and <lb/>
            the singular which appears in the category of this kind ; for <lb/>
            that which is good, or the sitting posture, is not expressed <lb/>
            without this2 also. It is evident, therefore, that each of <lb/>
            those also subsists on account of this.3 Wherefore, that which <lb/>
            is primarily entity, and not any particular entity, but entity <lb/>
            simply or absolutely, will constitute substance.</p>
          <p>Therefore, that which is first is denominated in <lb/>
            many ways; nevertheless, first of all is substance, <lb/>
            both in reason, and knowledge, and time, and <lb/>
            nature. For no one of the rest of the categories <lb/>

            stands foremost <lb/>
            amongst the <lb/>
            categories. <lb/>
            is capable of a separate subsistence, but this alone; and in <lb/>
            definition is this first: for in the definition of everything <lb/>
            there is a necessity that the definition of substance be <lb/>
            inherent. And then we think we know each particular thing, <lb/>
            especially, when we know what man is, or fire is, rather than <lb/>
            when we know the quality, or the quantity, or the situation <lb/>
            of a thing; since we then come to know each of these things <lb/>
            when we know what the quantity of them is, or the quality.</p>
          <p>And unquestionably, also, was that originally, <lb/>

            stance, whether <lb/>
            natural or <lb/>
            supranatural.</p>
          <p>Now, substance seems to subsist, no doubt, in <lb/>
            bodies most palpably. Wherefore, we say that <lb/>
            both animals, and plants, and the parts of them, <lb/>
            are substances; and we say the same of natural <lb/>
            or physical bodies, as fire, and water, and earth, and every­ <lb/>
            thing of this sort; and as many as are either parts of these <lb/>
            or are composed of these, either partly or entirely, as both <lb/>
            the heaven and its parts, stars, and moon, and sun. Whether, <lb/>
            however, these are the only substances, or whether there are <lb/>
            others besides, or whether no one of these, but certain dif­ <lb/>
            ferent ones, are substances? this must be examined into. But <lb/>
            to some2 the boundaries of bodies (as superficies, and line, <lb/>
            and point, and monad) seem to be substances, and that, too, <lb/>
            rather than body and solidity. Further, with the exception <lb/>
            of things that are sensible, some are not of opinion that <lb/>
            there is anything in existence of the kind, but others, that <lb/>
            there are many such, and that especially those entities have a <lb/>
            subsistence which are eternal; as Plato considered both forms <lb/>
            and mathematical entities as two substances, and, as a third, <lb/>
            the substance of sensible bodies. But Speusippus,3 starting <note type="footnote"> 1 This chapter contains an examination into the primary one of the <lb/>

            from one, says that there are many substances and first prin­ <lb/>
            ciples of each substance; one of numbers, but another of <lb/>
            magnitudes, then another of soul; and in this way extends, <lb/>
            therefore, the classes of substance. And some affirm that <lb/>
            forms and numbers have the same nature, but that other <lb/>
            things that are connected therewith, as lines and surfaces, <lb/>
            belong to a second class of substances as far as to the sub­ <lb/>
            stance of the heaven and to sensibles.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, respecting these we must consider <lb/>
            what it is that is said well or not well, and what <lb/>
            substances exist, and whether there are certain <lb/>
            ones besides sensibles,1 or are not, and how these <lb/>

            subsist? also, whether there is any separable substance, and <lb/>
            why there is, and after what mode of subsistence; or whether <lb/>
            there is no substance besides sensibles ? This, I say, must <lb/>
            form the subject of our investigation, having first delineated <lb/>
            substance in a sketch of what it is.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>Now, substance is denominated, if not multi­ <lb/>
            fariously, yet, at least, in four ways particularly; <lb/>
            for both the essence or the formal cause, and the <lb/>
            universal, and the genus, seem to be substance in <lb/>
            ]. Matter is <lb/>
            substance re­ <lb/>
            garded as the <lb/>
            primary sub­ <lb/>
            ject. <lb/>
            each thing; and fourth of these is the subject. But the <lb/>
            subject is that of which other things are predicated, while <lb/>
            itself is no longer predicated of any other thing. Wherefore, <lb/>
            concerning this point we must come to a determination in <lb/>
            the first instance; for substance appears especially to be the <lb/>
            primary subject. Now, in some such manner is matter deno­ <lb/>
            minated substance, but in another way form, and in a <lb/>
            third, that which results from, or is a compound of, these; <lb/>
            now, I mean by matter, brass, for instance, but by form <lb/>
            the figure of the idea, and by that which is composed of these <lb/>
            the statue in its entirety. Wherefore, if form be prior to <note type="footnote"> 1 Such philosophers as Hippo, surnamed the Atheist, and, in after- <lb/>
            times, the followers of Epicurus, maintained the existence merely of <lb/>
            what was cognisant by the senses. Plato, Speusippus, and Xenocrates, <lb/>
            in their speculations, developed an element exclusively transcendental. <lb/>
            Vide Tenneman, sect. 128; Diogenes Laertius, Lives of the Philoso­ <lb/>
            phers, Introduction, p. 10, sqq translated in "Bohn's Classical Library.4 </note> <pb n="170"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK VI </note> <lb/>
            matter, and rather than it is entity or being, also for the <lb/>
            same reason will be prior that which is a compound of both. <lb/>
            Now therefore, by way of a rough delineation has it been <lb/>
            declared what substance is at all; namely, that it is not <lb/>
            that which is predicated of the subject, but is that of which <lb/>
            other things are predicated. It must needs, however, be spoken <lb/>
            of not in this manner solely, for such is not sufficient; for <lb/>
            this account of it is obscure.</p>
          <p>2. This proved <lb/>
            from the fact <lb/>
            that the various <lb/>
            qualities of <lb/>
            matter presup­ <lb/>
            pose a sub­ <lb/>
            stance wherein <lb/>
            they inhere.</p>
          <p>And, further, matter becomes substance: for <lb/>
            if matter is not substance, what else is escapes <lb/>
            our comprehension; for when other things are <lb/>
            removed away, nothing appears remaining. For <lb/>
            other things are the passive conditions1 of bodies, <lb/>
            and are productions, and potentialities; but length, <lb/>
            and breadth, and depth, are certain quantities, but not sub­ <lb/>
            stances : for quantity is not substance, but rather that wherein <lb/>
            these very qualities are inherent primarily—that is substance. <lb/>
            But, unquestionably, if we take away length, and depth, and <lb/>
            breadth, we see nothing left except whatsoever is bounded by <lb/>
            these. Wherefore, to persons conducting the inquiry in this <lb/>
            way, matter must needs appear only as substance ; and I call <lb/>
            matter that which essentially is termed neither quiddity, nor <lb/>
            quantity, nor anything else of those things whereby entity is <lb/>
            defined. For there is something of which each of these is pre­ <lb/>
            dicated from which “ the being " is different, as well as from <lb/>
            each of the categories ; for the other things are predicated of <lb/>
            substance, but this of matter. Wherefore, that which is ulti­ <lb/>
            mate essentially is neither quiddity, nor quantity, nor quality, <lb/>
            nor any other such thing. Neither, therefore, are negations so; <lb/>
            for these also will have a subsistence according to accident. <lb/>
            In consequence of these things, no doubt, therefore, it happens <lb/>
            with speculators that matter is regarded as substance.</p>
          <p>3. Others would <lb/>
            make form, and <lb/>
            that which is <lb/>
            composed of <lb/>
            matter and <lb/>
            form, to be sub­ <lb/>
            stance.</p>
          <p>This, however, is impossible ; for both a capa­ <lb/>
            bility of separation in its subsistence, and the <lb/>
            subsisting as this particular thing, seem to <lb/>
            inhere especially in substance. Wherefore, form, <lb/>
            and that which is composed of both, would appear <lb/>
            to be substance rather than matter. Indeed, then, as regards <lb/>
            the substance which is composed of both (I mean composed <note type="footnote"> 1 This argument has already been noticed by Aristotle, in his Review <lb/>
            of Greek Philosophy in book L </note> <pb n="171"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH IV.] </note> <lb/>
            of matter and form), the consideration of this must be <lb/>
            omitted, for it is posterior and manifest; but somehow matter <lb/>
            also is plain. But respecting the third substance must there <lb/>
            be an inquiry made, for this is most perplexing. Now, <lb/>
            certain substances of sensibles are acknowledged to exist; <lb/>
            wherefore, in the case of these, let us, in the first place, insti­ <lb/>
            tute an examination.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER IV.1</title>
          </ab>
          <p>BUT since in the beginning of this book we <lb/>
            have made a division in how many ways we <lb/>
            define substance, and of these a certain one <lb/>
            seems to be the essence or the very nature of <lb/>
            a thing, we must make an inquiry respecting this, <lb/>
            1. Aristotle <lb/>
            justifies his <lb/>
            inquiry into <lb/>
            the first defini­ <lb/>
            tion of sub­ <lb/>
            stance, as the <lb/>
            TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">τι ἦγ εἶναι</foreign>. <lb/>
            for advantageous is the transition to what is more known. For <lb/>
            in this way is instruction imparted to all by means of advancing <lb/>
            through those things that are less known to Nature to things <lb/>
            that are Inure known ; and this is something accomplished, as <lb/>
            in practical things the having made from those things that <lb/>
            are good to each, things that are good to each generally ;3 so, <lb/>
            from things that are more known to oneself, the having made <lb/>
            things that are known to himself, to be known to Nature, as <lb/>
            well as things that are known to individuals, and such as are <lb/>
            first, and are often but little known, and often involve little <lb/>
            or nothing of entity. Nevertheless, however, from things <lb/>
            badly known, to be sure, yet known to oneself, must we en­ <lb/>
            deavour to attain a knowledge of things generally known, <lb/>
            making a transition, as has been stated, by the way of these <lb/>
            very things.</p>
          <p>And, in the first place, let us speak thereof <lb/>
            some things logically, because the very nature of <lb/>
            everything is that which is denominated as <lb/>
            subsisting essentially or absolutely. For your <lb/>
            essence does not consist in being in one that is <lb/>
            2. Logical con­ <lb/>
            siderations as <lb/>
            regards the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τό <lb/>
            τι ἦν εἶναι</foreign>, for <lb/>
            its being the <lb/>
            same with the <lb/>
            TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">καθ' αὺτό</foreign>. <note type="footnote"> 1 These remarks on the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τό</foreign> Ti <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦν εἶναι</foreign> are most important. In the <lb/>
            Posterior Analytics, book II. chap. xi., this term occurs. Mr. Owen, in <lb/>
            his translation, renders it by "essence," i.e. the formal cause. It is <lb/>
            translated by Mr. Lewis, in his “ History of Philosophy," “ the very <lb/>
            nature of a thing." I have adopted both together. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This is a favourite principle with Aristotle. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Alexander illustrates this remark by the case of a legislator pro <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [BOOK VI </note> <lb/>
            musical, for not according to yourself are you musical; your <lb/>
            essence, then, subsists according to yourself. For, truly, not <lb/>
            everything that is essentially present to a thing is the very <lb/>
            nature of that thing; for that is not the case with that which <lb/>
            is so essentially present, as a white surface, since the being of <lb/>
            a surface is not the same thing with the being of what is <lb/>
            white. But, doubtless, neither is that which is composed <lb/>
            of both, namely, the being of a white surface, the same as the <lb/>
            essence of superficies. Should the question be asked why it <lb/>
            is not, our reply is, because superficies is contained in the <lb/>
            definition of white surface. In whatever definition, then, <lb/>
            expressive of this, this will not be found inherent, this will <lb/>
            be the reason of the essence or very nature of each thing. <lb/>
            Wherefore, if the being of a white surface is the being of <lb/>
            a smooth surface, the being white and smooth is one and the <lb/>
            same thing.</p>
          <p>3. Aristotle dis­ <lb/>
            cusses two <lb/>
            questions <lb/>
            touching the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τό</foreign> <lb/>
            TC <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦνεἶναι</foreign> : <lb/>
            namely, <lb/>
            whether there <lb/>
            may be said to <lb/>
            be a definition, <lb/>
            or discursus, of <lb/>
            the formal <lb/>
            cause of each <lb/>
            of the catego­ <lb/>
            ries, and <lb/>
            whether the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τό <lb/>
            τι ἦν εἶναι</foreign> is <lb/>
            discoverable <lb/>
            therein ?</p>
          <p>But since, also, in accordance with the rest of <lb/>
            the categories there are natures that are compo­ <lb/>
            site, (for there is a certain subject to each as to <lb/>
            quality and quantity, and the time when, and <lb/>
            the place where, and motion,) we must examine <lb/>
            if there is a definition of the very nature or <lb/>
            essence of each of them,1 and, also, whether the <lb/>
            essence of a thing is inherent in these? as, for <lb/>
            example, if in man the essence of white man is <lb/>
            inherent. Now, let his name be garment, what <lb/>
            then is the being of a garment ? but, doubtless, <lb/>
            neither does this belong to those things that are <lb/>
            expressed absolutely; or, shall we say that a thing which is not <lb/>
            essential is predicated in two ways, and that of this the <lb/>
            one is from addition, but the other is not so ? And in <lb/>
            regard of this being added to another thing, it is denominated <lb/>
            as that which is defined; for instance, if one defining the <lb/>
            being white should assume the definition of white man, <lb/>
            another thing is so denominated because something else is <lb/>
            not added to it; for example, if a garment signifies a white <lb/>
            man, but some one should define the garment as white, in <lb/>
            this case a white man is, doubtless, something that is white, <lb/>
            yet his essence or very nature does not consist in being white, <lb/>
            but in being a garment. Is there, then, in short, in existence <note type="footnote"> I 1 Vide concluding paragraphs of chaps, iv. and v. </note> <pb n="173"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. IV.] </note> <lb/>
            such a thing as the essence or very nature of entities or not ? <lb/>
            for whatsoever is the very nature of a thing is the essence of <lb/>
            that thing. But when one thing is predicated of another, it <lb/>
            is not this certain particular thing; as, for instance, a white <lb/>
            man is not this certain particular thing, if the being this <lb/>
            particular thing belong to substances only. Wherefore, the <lb/>
            very nature of a thing appertains to those things the dis­ <lb/>
            course respecting which is a definition. But not every <lb/>
            discursus which signifies the same thing as the name is a <lb/>
            definition, (for, in this case, all discourses would be definitions,) <lb/>
            for the name will be the same with any discourse whatsoever. <lb/>
            Wherefore, also, the term Iliad will be a definition; but if it <lb/>
            may be one of some primary thing, a discourse is then a <lb/>
            definition. And things of this kind are such as are spoken of <lb/>
            not in respect of the predication of one thing of another.</p>
          <p>The very nature of a thing will not, accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, be found in any of those things that are <lb/>
            not the species of a genus, but in these only; for <lb/>
            4. Something <lb/>
            decisive on this <lb/>
            point. <lb/>
            these seem to be predicated not according to participation <lb/>
            and passion, nor as an accident: but, no doubt, there will be <lb/>
            a discourse of each thing, and it will signify something of the <lb/>
            other things, if it be a name; I mean, that this particular <lb/>
            thing is inherent in this, or instead of the simple assertion is <lb/>
            there one that is more accurate; but it will not be a definition, <lb/>
            nor the essence or very nature of a thing.</p>
          <p>Or also shall we say that definition, as well as <lb/>
            the essence of a thing, is expressed in many <lb/>
            ways ? for also the inquiry what the nature of <lb/>
            5. Another so­ <lb/>
            lution pro­ <lb/>
            posed. <lb/>
            a thing is, in one way signifies substance, and the being <lb/>
            this particular thing, but in another each of the categories, <lb/>
            quantity, quality, and whatever things else there are of this <lb/>
            sort. For as the inquiry what a thing is also belongs to all <lb/>
            things, though not after a similar manner, but to one thing <lb/>
            primarily, and to others in a consequent order, so also the <lb/>
            nature of a thing inheres in the substance simply, but in <lb/>
            other things in a sort of a way; for also as to the quality <lb/>
            of a thing we could ask the question what it is: where­ <lb/>
            fore, likewise, quality belongs to those things to which the <lb/>

            but just as in the case of nonentity certain speculators <lb/>
            say that it is nonentity, logically speaking, not simply, but <pb n="174"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK VI. </note> <lb/>
            that is nonentity, so also is it with lespect to quality. It <lb/>
            is necessary, therefore, to examine also how one should speak <lb/>
            ut everything not, certainly, at any rate, more than how <lb/>
            each thing subsists or is disposed.</p>
          <p>6. The conclu­ <lb/>
            sion from this <lb/>
            discussion <lb/>
            stated.</p>
          <p>Wherefore, now, also, since what is spoken is <lb/>
            manifest, the very nature or essence of a thing <lb/>
            will also, in like manner, be inherent primarily <lb/>
            and simply in substance, and afterwards in other <lb/>
            things; as in the inquiry what a thing is, the essence or <lb/>
            very nature of that thing will not be inherent simply, but <lb/>
            with the addition of quality or quantity will the essence be <lb/>
            inherent. For it is requisite to speak of the existence of these <lb/>
            entities either equivocally or with addition and ablation, as, <lb/>
            also, that which is not the object of scientific knowledge is a <lb/>
            thing that may be scientifically known; since this is correct, <lb/>
            at least, neither to speak of these equivocally, nor in like <lb/>
            manner, but just in such a way as what is medicinal is pre­ <lb/>
            iicated in reference to one and the same thing, without, <lb/>
            however, being one and the same thing, and yet, indeed, <lb/>
            is not equivocally predicated either; for no medicinal body <lb/>
            is termed a work and an apparatus either equivocally or <lb/>
            according to one, but in relation to one thing.</p>
          <p>7. This conclu­ <lb/>
            sion vindicated.</p>
          <p>Therefore, in whatsoever way one chooses, <lb/>
            indeed, to express1 these things makes no dif­ <lb/>
            ference. This, however, is evident, that definition, primarily <lb/>
            and absolutely considered, and that the essence or very <lb/>
            nature of a thing, belong to substances. Notwithstanding, <lb/>
            they belong to other things, also, in a similar manner, except <lb/>
            not primarily. For there is no necessity, even though we <lb/>
            should admit that a name has the same signification with a <lb/>
            certain discourse, that a discourse about that which the name <lb/>
            signifies should be a definition of this; but this will take place <lb/>
            if the name may have the same signification with a discourse, <lb/>
            at least a certain discourse. And this takes place if it be <lb/>
            of one thing not by continuity, as the Iliad, or whatever <lb/>
            things else are one by connexion, but if it is as multifariously <lb/>
            expressed as one thing is. Unity, however, is predicated <lb/>
            in as many ways as entity; and entity signifies partly this <lb/>
            particular thing, and partly quantity, and partly quality. <note type="footnote"> I The question as regards the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τό</foreign> rt <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦν εἶναι</foreign> has been thus settled; <lb/>

            Wherefore, also, of white man will there be a certain discourse <lb/>
            and definition; and in another way will there be the same, <lb/>
            both of that which is white and of substance.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER V.1</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THIS statement, however, involves a doubt-in <lb/>
            case any one denies definition to be a discourse <lb/>
            subsisting from addition-of what the definition <lb/>
            will be of those things that are not simple, but <lb/>
            1. The forego. <lb/>
            ing statement <lb/>
            involves two <lb/>
            matters of <lb/>
            doubt. <lb/>
            connected together; for from addition it is necessary to make <lb/>
            them manifest. Now, I say, for instance, there is nose and hol­ <lb/>
            lowness, and flatness of nose—I mean, that which is called from <lb/>
            both of these in respect of this being inherent in that; and <lb/>
            neither the hollowness nor the flatness of nose is, according <lb/>
            to accident, at least, a passion of nose, but subsists essentially; <lb/>
            nor do they subsist as the white in Callias, or man, because <lb/>
            Callias is white, to whom it is an accident to be man: but <lb/>
            they subsist as the male in animal, and the equal in quantity, <lb/>
            and in the same way as all those things that are said to be <lb/>
            essentially inherent. But these are those in whatsoever is <lb/>
            inherent either the definition or the name of which this is <lb/>
            an affection, and which it is not possible to manifest separately, <lb/>
            as it is possible to make manifest the white without man, not <lb/>
            so, however, the female without animal. Wherefore, the very <lb/>
            nature and definition of these are either of nothing, or, if <lb/>
            there is a definition of these, it is in a manner otherwise <lb/>
            from what we have declared.</p>
          <p>And there is also another matter of doubt about <lb/>
            these. For if, in truth, a flat-nose and a hollow- <lb/>
            2. Second sub­ <lb/>
            ject of doubt. <lb/>
            nose are the same, the same thing will be the flat and the <lb/>
            hollow; but if not, on account of its being impossible to use <lb/>
            the word flat even without the thing of which it is an essen­ <lb/>
            tial affection, and if flatness of nose will be a hollowness in <lb/>
            the nose, the speaking of flat-nose either is a thing not possible, <lb/>
            or the same thing will be said twice over; as thus, nose is <lb/>
            hollow-nose; for the nose, that is, the flat-nose, will be a hollow- <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristotle is viewing the rd <foreign xml:lang="grc">όν</foreign> from a logical point of view, which <lb/>

            nose. Wherefore, the inherence in things of this sort of what <lb/>
            is the essence or formal principle would be absurd ; and if it <lb/>
            were not absurd there would be a progression ad infinitum; <lb/>
            for in a nose, a flat-nose, will there further be inherent some­ <lb/>
            thing else that is essential. It is evident, therefore, that of <lb/>
            substance only1 is there definition ; for if it were also of the <lb/>
            rest of the categories, it must needs be from addition, as in <lb/>
            the definition of quality and unevenness; for it is not framed <lb/>
            without number, nor is the definition of female framed with­ <lb/>
            out animal. Now, definitions formed from addition I call <lb/>
            those in whatever the same things happen to be said twice, as <lb/>
            in these.</p>
          <p>3. Aristotle's <lb/>
            reply.</p>
          <p>And, if this be true, neither will there be defi­ <lb/>
            nition of those things that are conjoined together <lb/>
            as of an odd number: it escapes their notice, however, that <lb/>
            not accurately are the definitions of these things expressed <lb/>
            by them. But if there are definitions of these things also, <lb/>
            doubtless in a different way do they subsist; or, as has been <lb/>
            affirmed, definition must be spoken of as subsisting in many <lb/>
            ways, and so with the essence, or the very nature of a thing, <lb/>
            likewise. Wherefore, in one way there will not be a definition <lb/>
            of any of these, nor will essence be inherent in any one of <lb/>
            these, save in substances; and in another way they will be <lb/>
            inherent. That, therefore, indeed, definition is a discursus or <lb/>
            description of the very nature or essence of a thing, and that <lb/>

            tion whether <lb/>
            the essence,and <lb/>

            are the same, or different ? For this will be of <lb/>
            advantage in reference to the inquiry concerning <lb/>
            substance; for both each particular thing does <lb/>
            not seem to be different from its own substance, and the <note type="footnote"> 1 It is important to observe that Aristotle withholds definition from <lb/>
            all the categories save substance, and makes this a ground for the <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. VI.] </note> <lb/>
            essence, or very nature of each thing, is said to be the sub­ <lb/>
            stance of that thing. Therefore in the case, no doubt, of things <lb/>
            that are predicated according to accident, these would seem <lb/>
            to be different, as that a white man is a thing different from <lb/>
            the being of white man. For if they were the same, both <lb/>
            the being of man, and the being of white man, would be the <lb/>
            same; for man and white man, as they say, are the same thing. <lb/>
            Wherefore, also, the being of a white man, and the being of <lb/>
            man, would be the same. Or is there no necessity for whatever <lb/>
            things that are according to accident to be the same, as <lb/>
            those things that have an essential subsistence? for not, in <lb/>
            like manner, do the extremes become the same. But, perhaps, <lb/>
            at least, it would seem to happen that the extremes should <lb/>
            become the same according to accident; as, for instance, the <lb/>
            being of white, and the being of a musician ; but this does <lb/>
            not seem to be the case.</p>
          <p>And as regards things that are predicated <lb/>
            absolutely there always is a necessity that they <lb/>
            be the same, as must take place if there are <lb/>
            certain substances belonging to which there are <lb/>
            not different substances, nor different antecedent <lb/>
            2. That they <lb/>
            are the same in <lb/>
            the case of <lb/>
            things predi­ <lb/>
            cated abso­ <lb/>
            lutely. <lb/>
            natures, such as some affirm ideas to be. For if the actual <lb/>
            good be a different thing from the being good, and animal <lb/>
            from the being animal, and entity from the essence of entity, <lb/>
            there will exist both different substances, and natures, <lb/>
            and ideas, besides those mentioned; and those substances <lb/>
            will be prior if there be in existence the essence of <lb/>
            substance. And if they are, indeed, unconnected one with <lb/>
            another, of such there will not be a scientific knowledge, and <lb/>
            they will not be entities. Now, I mean by the phrase “ un­ <lb/>
            connected," if neither in the actual good is inherent the being <lb/>
            good, nor if the existence of good pertains to this; for the <lb/>
            scientific knowledge of each thing subsists when we know the <lb/>
            essence or very nature of each thing: and in the case of <lb/>
            what is good, and of other things, the same takes place. <lb/>
            Wherefore, if the being good be not good, neither will the <lb/>
            being in entity constitute entity, nor that in unity be unity. <lb/>
            In like manner, also, all or not one of the essences will have an <lb/>
            existence. Wherefore, if neither it be so with the being in <lb/>
            entity, neither will it be so with anything else. Further, in <lb/>
            whatever is not inherent the being good is not good. <note type="footnote"> N </note> <pb n="178"/>

            from this.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, it is necessary that the good and <lb/>
            the being of good1 be one, also the fail and the <lb/>
            being fair; in fact, whatsoever things are not predicated of <lb/>
            another, but have an absolute subsistence, and are things <lb/>
            which are primary. For, also, this is sufficient if it takes <lb/>
            place, even though forms may have no existence; but rather, <lb/>
            perhaps, if forms do subsist. But, at the same time, it is <lb/>
            evident that also if ideas are such things as some say they are, <lb/>
            the subject of them will not be substance; for it is necessary <lb/>
            that these be substances, I admit: but it is not necessary <lb/>
            that they be predicated of a subject, for in this will they be <lb/>
            inherent by participation. And, doubtless, from these argu­ <lb/>
            ments it is evident that each particular itself, and the <lb/>
            essence, not according to accident are one and the same <lb/>
            thing, and that to have a scientific knowledge, at any rate, of <lb/>
            anything is to know scientifically the very nature or essence <lb/>
            of that thing. Wherefore, according to this exposition, it is <lb/>
            requisite that both be a certain one thing.</p>
          <p>4. That they <lb/>
            are not the <lb/>
            same in the <lb/>
            case of what Is <lb/>
            predicated ac­ <lb/>
            cording to acci­ <lb/>
            dent.</p>
          <p>But that a thing predicated according to acci­ <lb/>
            dent, as the musical or white, should be the same <lb/>
            as the very nature of a thing itself, on account of <lb/>
            the twofold signification of that in which it is an <lb/>
            accident and the accident itself, this is not a true <lb/>
            assertion; so that in a certain respect a thing itself is the same, <lb/>
            and in a certain respect is not the same, with the very nature <lb/>
            of that thing. For the being of man is not the same with <lb/>
            that of a white man; but so far as the essence of man is <lb/>
            passive to whiteness it is the same. Now, it would appear <lb/>
            absurd, also, if any would impose the name on each thing of <lb/>
            the essences; for there will be another essence besides also <lb/>
            that: as besides the essence of horse there will be a different <lb/>
            essence of horse. Although what hinders certain essences <lb/>
            even from being now directly the same as the things of which <lb/>
            they are the very natures, if the very nature of a thing be <lb/>
            substance? But, truly, not only are they one, but also the <lb/>
            definition of them is the same, as is also evident from the <lb/>
            statements that have been made; for to be one and one are <note type="footnote"> I It is not quite obvious what difference Aristotle had in his mind <lb/>

            not according to accident. Further, if they be different they <lb/>
            will go on in a progression ad infinitum; for the one will be the <lb/>
            essence of being one, but the other the one itself. Wherefore, <lb/>
            also, in the case of those will there be the same definition. <lb/>
            That, therefore, in the case of the first existences, and o. <lb/>
            things predicated essentially, the being of each thing, and <lb/>
            that very thing itself, are one and the same thing it evident.</p>
          <p>As regards, however, the refutations of the <lb/>
            sophists in reference to this position, it is palpable <lb/>
            that they are decided by the same solution; for <lb/>

            and the being Socrates are the same ? For there is no differ­ <lb/>
            ence in the things either from which one would ask the <lb/>
            question, or from which he should light upon an answer in <lb/>
            his attempted solution of it. How, then, the essence or very <lb/>
            nature is the same, and how it is not the same, with each <lb/>

            stances. Now, all things which are produced either by Nature <lb/>
            or Art involve matter, for it is possible for each of them <lb/>
            both to be and not to be; this capability, however, is the <lb/>
            matter in each. And, in general, Nature1 is even that from <lb/>
            which a thing proceeds, and that according to which entities <lb/>
            are generated is Nature likewise: for that which is being <lb/>
            produced has a nature; as, for example, a plant or animal, <lb/>
            and that by means of which a thing is generated is Nature <lb/>
            herself, which is predicated according to the species, and is of <lb/>
            the same species; but this is inherent in another, for man <lb/>
            begets man. In this way, therefore, are produced the things <lb/>
            that are generated through Nature: and the rest of the <lb/>
            generations are denominated productions or operations. All <lb/>
            operations, however, are either from art, or from potentiality, <lb/>
            or the understanding. But of these some are produced, also, <lb/>
            from chance and from fortune in a similar way, as in the <lb/>
            case of those things that are produced by Nature; for there <lb/>
            also are produced some things that are the same both from <lb/>
            seed and without seed. Respecting, indeed, these,2 then, we <lb/>
            will subsequently institute an examination. From Art, <lb/>
            however, are generated those things of whatsoever there is a <lb/>
            form in the soul. But I mean by form the essence or very <lb/>
            nature of each thing, and the first substance. For, also, of <lb/>
            contraries in a certain manner is there the same form; for <lb/>
            thus the substance of privation is the substance that is the <lb/>
            one opposed, as health of disease; for by the absence of health <lb/>
            is disease made apparent, and health constitutes the principle <lb/>
            in the soul and in the science.</p>
          <p>2. Exemplifica­ <lb/>
            tion, too, of the <lb/>
            efficient princi­ <lb/>
            ple in each of <lb/>
            these.</p>
          <p>The salubrious, however, is produced when the <lb/>
            physician reasons thus : since this is done for <lb/>
            the sake of health, it is necessary, if this will be <lb/>
            salubrious, that this particular condition should <lb/>
            exist; for example, evenness, and, if this take place, that the <lb/>
            result be heat. And so he always reasons, until he conducts <lb/>
            you to that which he himself can accomplish last. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, now the motion which begins from these is called the <lb/>
            operation that tends towards becoming healthy. Wherefore, <lb/>
            it happens that in a certain manner from health is generated <note type="footnote"> 1 The term <foreign xml:lang="grc">φύϭις</foreign> has already been explained in book IV.; and the <lb/>

            health, and a house is constructed from a house; namely, <lb/>
            that which involves matter arises, or is generated, from that <lb/>
            which does not involve a connexion with matter: for the <lb/>
            medicinal and the house-building arts are the form, the <lb/>
            one of health, and the other of a house. Now, I mean by <lb/>
            substance not involving any connexion with matter, the <lb/>
            essence or very nature or formal cause of a thing. Of gene­ <lb/>
            rations, however, and of motions one is termed thought and <lb/>
            another operation; that is termed conception or thought <lb/>
            which arises from the first principle and the form, but <lb/>
            that is operation which takes its rise from the thought <lb/>
            or conception of what is ultimate. In like manner, also, is <lb/>
            produced each of the rest of those things that are media; <lb/>
            now, I say, for instance, if health is to be restored there must <lb/>
            needs be a reduction to equality secured. What, then, is <lb/>
            this reduction into a state of equality ? It is this par­ <lb/>
            ticular result. But this particular result will take place <lb/>
            if heat shall have been promoted. And what is this ? It <lb/>
            is this particular effect. Now, this effect is inherent in <lb/>
            capacity, but the former already lies in the power of the <lb/>
            physician. Now, that which brings about the result, and <lb/>
            whence the motion of restoring health derives its beginning, <lb/>
            if it springs from art, such is the form that is in the <lb/>
            soul; but if it arises from chance, it arises from that evidently <lb/>
            which, for once, is the principle of bringing about the change <lb/>
            to one that acts from art: as also, perhaps, in the case of <lb/>
            restoring health, the first principle originates from the com­ <lb/>
            munication of heat; and this result it accomplishes by means <lb/>
            of friction. Accordingly, heat is either a part of health, (I mean, <lb/>
            such heat as inheres in the body,) or there follows it directly <lb/>
            some such thing as is a part of health, or this is accomplished <lb/>
            indirectly, that is, by means of many media. This last, how­ <lb/>
            ever, is that which produces the result, and in this way is <lb/>
            part of health, as stones are parts of a house, and something <lb/>
            else a part of other things.</p>
          <p>Wherefore, as it is said, it is impossible that <lb/>
            there be a prodution of anything if nothing may <lb/>
            pre-exist. That certainly, therefore, a portion <lb/>
            3. Therefore, <lb/>
            generation pre­ <lb/>
            supposes a <lb/>
            something pre- <lb/>
            existent. <note type="footnote"> 1 This is the great dogma Aristotle is endeavouring to establish, in <lb/>

              will exist necessarily is evident; for matter is that part, <lb/>
              for this is inherent, and is itself produced. But then, as <lb/>
              such, is it to be classed amongst those things that are con­ <lb/>
              tained in the definition. And in both ways we denominate <lb/>
              the brazen circles what they are, speaking of both the matter <lb/>
              that it is brass, and the form that it is such a figure, and this <lb/>
              is the genus into which it is first posited. But a brazen <lb/>
              circle involves matter in its definition.</p>
          <p>4. A miscon­ <lb/>
            ception that <lb/>
            might arise <lb/>
            from this dog­ <lb/>
            ma obviated.</p>
          <p>But that from which, as from matter, some <lb/>
            things are formed is styled, when it is so formed, <lb/>
            not that from which they are formed, but is <lb/>
            called something else that is of this; as, for <lb/>
            example, a statue is called not a stone, but of stone or stony. <lb/>
            And a man who is in a state of convalescence is not denomi­ <lb/>
            nated that from which he recovers back his health ; and a <lb/>
            cause of this is the following, that that arises from privation <lb/>
            and the subject which we call matter: as both a man and a <lb/>
            person that is indisposed become healthy. Rather, however, <lb/>
            is health said to arise from privation-as one in health <lb/>
            from one that is indisposed-than from man. Wherefore, <lb/>
            a sick person is not denominated as one that is sound in <lb/>
            health; but this is affirmed of man, and a man who is in <lb/>
            sound health. And in regard of those things of which the <lb/>
            privation is obscure and nameless, as in the case of the brass, <lb/>
            whatever be the figure, or in the bricks and timbers of a house, <lb/>
            those things seem to arise from these: as, in the instance <lb/>
            above adduced, one that is in health from a person that is <lb/>
            indisposed. Wherefore, as neither that which is produced is <lb/>
            called by the name of that from which it is formed, in the case <lb/>
            of the instance above adduced, so neither in this instance is <lb/>
            the statue called wood, but derivatively is classified as wooden, <lb/>
            not wood, and as brazen, but not brass, and stony, but not <lb/>
            stone; and a house also is spoken of as made of bricks, but <lb/>
            not as bricks : since, if one carefully examines, he would not say <lb/>
            absolutely that either is the statue produced from wood, or a <lb/>
            house from bricks, on account of its being necessary that <lb/>
            whatever 1 is produced from anything should be changed from <lb/>
            that from which it is produced, but should not continue as it <lb/>
            was before. Therefore, on account of this, indeed, the thing <lb/>
            is expressed in this manner. <note type="footnote"> 1 This is the sense put upon these words by Taylor. </note> <pb n="183"/>

          <p>SINCE, however, that which is produced is pro­ <lb/>
            duced1 both by something (now, I mean that <lb/>
            whence also originates the first principle of gene- <lb/>
            1. No genera­ <lb/>
            tion of form <lb/>
            save per acci­ <lb/>
            dens. <lb/>
            ration, that is, its efficient cause) and from something, (but <lb/>
            let this be not privation, but matter, for already has it been <lb/>
            defined In what manner we have denominated this,) also <lb/>
            must there be that which is produced ; and this is either a <lb/>
            sphere or a circle, or whatever else of the other things that <lb/>
            may chance to present itself; as neither the efficient cause <lb/>
            produces the subject, (I mean, the brass,) so neither does it <lb/>
            make the sphere, unless by accident, because a brazen sphere <lb/>
            is a sphere ; but it does not produce the sphere itself. For <lb/>
            the production of a certain thing of this kind is the produc­ <lb/>
            tion of this particular thing from the entire subject. Now, <lb/>
            I say, that to make the brass round is not to make the <lb/>
            round or the sphere, but something different, such as this <lb/>
            form in another thing. For, if the artist produces it, he would <lb/>
            produce this from something else; for this would be the <lb/>
            subject: as, for example, to make a brazen sphere ; and this <lb/>
            the artist makes in this manner because from this particular <lb/>
            thing which is brass he forms this which is a sphere. If, <lb/>
            therefore, also, he produces this very thing, it is evident that <lb/>
            in like manner he will produce another; and the productions <lb/>
            will go on in a process ad infinitum.</p>
          <p>It is palpable, then, that neither form (or by <lb/>
            whatever name we must needs term form, as it <lb/>
            subsists in that which is cognisable to sense) is <lb/>
            produced, nor is there a generation thereof, nor <lb/>
            is this the essence or very nature of a thing ; <lb/>
            2. But that <lb/>
            what is com­ <lb/>
            pounded of <lb/>
            matter and <lb/>
            form is gene­ <lb/>
            rated. <lb/>
            for this is that which is produced in another subject either <lb/>
            from Art, or from Nature, or potentiality, and the efficient <lb/>
            cause it is which produces the existence of a brazen sphere ; <lb/>
            for it produces it from brass and a sphere : for into this par­ <lb/>
            ticular thing, which is the form, doth the efficient cause mould <lb/>
            the brass, and this constitutes a brazen sphere. And if, in <note type="footnote"> 1 What Aristotle aims to establish is this, that it is not strictly true <lb/>
            to say that naked form is generated, but that matter, in combination <lb/>
            with a certain invariable form, is. This dogma may be regarded as <lb/>
            a necessary sequence to the reasoning that has gone before. </note> <pb n="184"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK VI. </note> <lb/>
            short, of the being or existence of sphere there exists a <lb/>
            generation, it will be a something that is a generation from <lb/>
            a certain thing : for it will be necessary that what is produced <lb/>
            always be divisible, and that this should be this particular <lb/>
            thing, and that should be something else : now, I mean that <lb/>
            this should be matter, and that form. Therefore, if a <lb/>
            sphere be a figure equal from the centre to all points of <lb/>
            its periphery, of this one part will be that in which that <lb/>
            which produces will be inherent, and the other part <lb/>
            that which resides in this part; but the whole is that <lb/>
            which has been produced or generated: as, for instance, the <lb/>
            brazen sphere. It is evident, therefore, from the statements <lb/>
            that have been made, that what is denominated as form <lb/>
            or as substance is not generated, but that the union1 which <lb/>
            is said to take place according to this is generated, and that <lb/>
            in everything which is being produced matter is inherent, and <lb/>
            that one part is matter, but the other form.</p>
          <p>3. Forms sepa­ <lb/>
            rate from things <lb/>
            not the causes <lb/>
            of generation, <lb/>
            either per <lb/>
            modum gene­ <lb/>
            rantis ;</p>
          <p>Whether, then, is there any sphere besides <lb/>
            these components, or is there a house besides <lb/>
            the bricks; or shall we say that if this were <lb/>
            the case neither would this particular thing <lb/>
            ever have been produced, save that it2 signifies a <lb/>
            particular thing of this sort ? This, however, also, <lb/>
            is not defined; but it produces and generates such a particular <lb/>
            kind of thing from this particular thing, and, when it has <lb/>
            been generated, it is this particular thing with such a quality. <lb/>
            And the whole of this particular thing is Callias or Socrates, <lb/>
            just as this is a brazen sphere, and man and animal are, in <lb/>
            general, as the brazen sphere. It is evident, therefore, <lb/>
            that the cause of forms, (as some have been accustomed <lb/>
            to denominate forms,) if there are certain natures of this <lb/>
            sort in existence besides singulars, in no wise is useful <lb/>
            towards both generations and substances; nor would essen­ <lb/>
            tial substances have a subsistence on account of these, at least. <lb/>
            or, per modum <lb/>
            exemplaris. <lb/>
            It is, accordingly, evident that in the case of <lb/>
            some things, also, the generator is such as that <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭύνοδος</foreign> is the word translated " union;" it corresponds with the <lb/>
            Latin “concursus:” it was a term in astronomy employed to designate <lb/>
            what we call conjunction between two stars. </note><note type="footnote"> * I have followed the text in the Leipsic edition. Didot reads if <lb/>

            which is being produced or generated, not, I admit, the actual <lb/>
            thing itself, at least ; not so numerically, but specifically, as <lb/>
            may be observed to take place in natural phenomena; for <lb/>
            man generates man, unless something abnormal or contrary <lb/>
            to nature be produced, as when a horse begets a mule. And <lb/>
            with these is it in like manner; for that which would be <lb/>
            common to a horse and an ass, namely, the most proximate <lb/>
            genus, would not have a name imposed upon it, but both, <lb/>
            perhaps, would be as a mule. Wherefore, it is plain that it is <lb/>
            in no wise necessary to provide a form as an exemplar or <lb/>
            model,1 (for in these, that is, in things sensible, especially, <lb/>
            investigators from time to time have searched for them, for <lb/>
            these same in an eminent degree are substances;) but for the <lb/>
            generator it sufficeth to have produced, and to be the cause <lb/>
            of the subsistence of form in matter. And the entire now <lb/>
            of such a form in these things, such as flesh and bones, is <lb/>
            Callias and Socrates, and different, no doubt, is a thing on <lb/>
            account of the matter thereof; for matter in each thing is dif­ <lb/>
            ferent, but in form it is the same, for the form is indivisible.</p>

          <p>SOME one, however, may doubt, perhaps, why <lb/>
            some things are produced by both art and from <lb/>
            chance, as health, but other things are not pro­ <lb/>
            duced in this way, as a house. Now, a cause of <lb/>
            this is the following,-that the matter of these, <lb/>
            1. Why some <lb/>
            things are pro­ <lb/>
            duced from art <lb/>
            and chance, <lb/>
            and some are <lb/>
            not. <lb/>
            which is the first principle of generation, consists in the ac­ <lb/>
            complishing and the production of something of those things <lb/>
            that are artificially formed, in which there is inherent a <lb/>
            certain portion of the thing, which matter is partly of such <lb/>
            a kind as is capable of being moved by itself, and partly is <lb/>
            not so; and of this one part is it possible to move in this par­ <lb/>
            ticular way, but the other it is not possible; for many things <lb/>
            involve the capacity of being moved by themselves, but not <lb/>
            in this way: for instance, to leap. As regards those things, <lb/>
            therefore, of which the matter is of such a kind, as stones, it <lb/>
            is impossible for them to be moved in this way, unless by <note type="footnote"> 1 This same reasoning is put forward in book I. chap. vii., and in book <lb/>

            something else,—yet in this way, assuredly,1—and it is so <lb/>
            with fire. On account of this some things will not be with­ <lb/>
            out that which is in possession of art; whereas other things <lb/>
            will be, for they will be moved by those things which do <lb/>
            not possess art, no doubt, but are themselves capable of being <lb/>
            moved either by other things which do not possess art, or <lb/>
            possess it partially. But it is evident, from the statements <lb/>
            that have been made, that also all things, in a certain manner; <lb/>
            are generated from things that are equivocal, as those that <lb/>
            have a subsistence from Nature, or from an equivocal portion,­ <lb/>
            for example, a house from a house,-or by reason of intellect ; <lb/>
            for art is form, either from a part or from that which pos <lb/>
            sesses a certain part, if it be not produced according to <lb/>
            accident. For the cause of the production is an essential first <lb/>
            portion.</p>

          <p>For the heat (which is involved in motion) has <lb/>
            generated heat in the body, and this is, unques­ <lb/>
            tionably, health, or a part of health, or there fol­ <lb/>
            lows it a certain part of health, or health itself. Wherefore, <lb/>
            also, it is said to be a producer, because that produces health <lb/>
            on which heat follows, and to which it is an accident. Where­ <lb/>
            fore, as in the syllogisms substance is the first principle of all <lb/>
            things, (for from the nature of a thing are syllogisms,) so, <lb/>
            also, in this instance, are generations. And, in like manner, <lb/>
            also, with these are those things that are by Nature con­ <lb/>
            stituted. For the seed produces as things that are con­ <lb/>
            structed from art; for it involves form in capacity, and that <lb/>
            from which the seed originates is, in a manner, equivocal ; <lb/>
            for it is not necessary to investigate all things in this way, <lb/>
            as man is from man; for woman also is from man: wherefore, <lb/>
            mule does not originate from mule, save unless there be an <lb/>
            injury from mutilation. Thus as many things, however, as <lb/>
            are being produced from chance—just as in that instance-are <lb/>
            those the matter of which is capable, also, of being moved <lb/>
            by itself with that motion which the seed effects; but those <lb/>
            things the matter of which does not possess this capability, <lb/>
            it is impossible can be produced in any other way except <lb/>
            from themselves by generation. <note type="footnote"> I The MSS. differ as to the punctuation of this passage; some have <lb/>

            the rest of the <lb/>
            categories. <lb/>
            sphere is what is produced, but not the sphere or the brass, <lb/>

            (for always it is necessary that there pre-exist matter and <lb/>
            form,) so, also, must it be in the case of " the what anything <lb/>
            is, or quiddity, and in the case of quality, and quantity, and <lb/>
            similarly of the rest of the categories; for there quality is not <lb/>

            but such a measure or quantity of wood, or an animal of <lb/>
            such a kind. But from these statements may we acquire <lb/>
            what is a peculiarity of substance, namely, that there is a <lb/>
            necessity that there should always pre-exist a different sub­ <lb/>
            stance, (I mean, one subsisting in a state of actuality,) which <lb/>
            produces: as, for instance, an animal must pre-exist if an <lb/>

          <p>BUT since definition is a sentence or expla­ <lb/>
            nation, and every sentence or explanation has <lb/>
            parts, and as a sentence is similarly related to the <lb/>
            thing itself, as the part of the sentence to the part <lb/>

            necessary that the definition of the parts should be inherent <lb/>
            in the definition of the whole, or not ? In the case of some <lb/>
            things they appear to be as things that are inherent; <lb/>
            but in the case of others it is not so. For thus the defini. <lb/>
            tion of a circle does not involve that of its segments; but the <note type="footnote"> 1 I have followed the Paris edition of Didot. Taylor seems to have <lb/>

            definition of a syllable involves that of the letters of speech : <lb/>
            notwithstanding that the circle, also, is divided into segments, <lb/>
            as, likewise, is the syllable into letters or elements of speech. <lb/>
            But, further, if the parts are prior to the whole, and if the <lb/>
            acute be a part of the right angle, and the finger of an animal, <lb/>
            the acute would be a thing that is prior to a right angle, and <lb/>
            the finger to man.</p>
          <p>2. The affirm­ <lb/>
            ative of this <lb/>
            question true <lb/>
            as regards <lb/>
            some cases, and <lb/>
            as regards <lb/>
            others the ne­ <lb/>
            gative is true.</p>
          <p>Now, these do not seem to be prior; for in <lb/>
            the definition they are denominated from them, <lb/>
            and also are they prior in their being capable <lb/>
            of subsistence without one another : or shall we <lb/>
            say that part is denominated in many ways, of <lb/>
            which one mode is the measurement accord­ <lb/>
            ing to quantity? Let, however, the mode of the subsist­ <lb/>
            ence of this be omitted ; but into those things of which <lb/>
            substance is composed, as from parts, we must institute <lb/>
            an investigation. If, therefore, the one be matter, but <lb/>
            the other form, and the third that which is composed of <lb/>
            these, and if substance be both matter and form, and <lb/>
            that which consists from these, it is the case that also <lb/>
            matter is termed in one respect a part of something, but it <lb/>
            is the case that such is not so in another respect; but this is <lb/>
            true as regards those things of which the definition of form <lb/>
            consists : as, for instance, of hollo wness, indeed, the flesh is <lb/>
            not a portion, for this is matter from which hollowness is pro­ <lb/>
            duced ; but it is a certain portion of flatness of nose, and <lb/>
            of the entire statue, no doubt, is the brass a part, but of that <lb/>
            which is denominated as the form of the statue it is not so; <lb/>
            for by form must we predicate, and so far forth as everything <lb/>
            involves form : never, however, is the material to be essenti­ <lb/>
            ally predicated.</p>
          <p>8. What it is <lb/>
            that gives rise <lb/>
            to this differ­ <lb/>
            ence illustrat­ <lb/>
            ed.</p>
          <p>Wherefore, the definition of a circle does <lb/>
            not involve that of its segments; but that of <lb/>
            a syllable does involve the definition of the <lb/>
            elements of speech, for the elements of the defi­ <lb/>
            nition are parts of form, and are not the matter thereof : but <lb/>
            the segments of a circle thus are parts-as matter-in which <lb/>
            the circle is ingenerated; they are, I admit, nearer to form <lb/>
            than the brass when roundness is ingenerated in the brass. <lb/>
            But it will be the case that neither all the elements of the <lb/>
            syllable will be contained in the definition of syllable; as, for <pb n="189"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH.X.] </note> <lb/>
            instance, these waxen letters,1 or those which are in the air, <lb/>
            for now, also, are these a part of the syllable as sensible <lb/>
            matter. For, also, it does not follow that because a line if <lb/>
            divided into halves is corrupted, or2 a man when divided <lb/>
            into bones, and nerves, and flesh, that therefrom they are in <lb/>
            such a manner, on this account, composed as though they <lb/>
            were parts of the substance, but that they are composed from <lb/>
            them as from matter. And they are parts of the entire, to be <lb/>
            sure; but they are not any longer parts of form, and of that <lb/>
            about which the definition is concerned only. Wherefore, <lb/>
            neither are they found in definitions. Of some definitions, <lb/>
            indeed, therefore, will there be inherent the definition of parts <lb/>
            of this kind, and of others it is necessary that it be not <lb/>
            inherent, unless such be the definition of that which is taken <lb/>
            together;3 for, on this account, from these as from first prin­ <lb/>
            ciples do some things consist, into which they are corrupted, <lb/>
            and others do not consist from these. Whatever things, in­ <lb/>
            deed, therefore, are assumed together are form and matter; <lb/>
            as a flat nose or a brazen circle : those are corrupted into <lb/>
            these, and matter constitutes a portion of them ; but as many <lb/>
            things as are not assumed along with matter, but involve no <lb/>
            connexion with matter, as the definitions of form merely, <lb/>
            these, however, are not corrupted either entirely, or by no <lb/>
            means4 in this way, at least. Wherefore, things that fall <lb/>
            not under these are the first principles and parts of those, <lb/>
            but of the form are these neither parts nor first principles. <lb/>
            And, on this account, a statue of clay is corrupted into clay, <lb/>
            and a sphere of brass into brass, and Callias into flesh and <lb/>
            bones; and, further, a circle is corrupted into its segments, <lb/>
            for there is something which is assumed along with matter; <lb/>
            for equivocally is the circle predicated, both that which is <lb/>
            predicated simply, and those that are singulars on account <lb/>
            of there not being a proper name for singulars. <note type="footnote"> 1 This illustration makes the reasoning of this chapter quite plain. <lb/>
            A syllable composed of letters of wax can be defined only materially; <lb/>
            whereas, viewing it as made up of certain elements of speech, logical <lb/>
            or formal definition is only in such a case applicable. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This passage is differently punctuated in the Paris and Leipsic <lb/>

            plicit solution <lb/>
            of this ques­ <lb/>
            tion; first, as <lb/>
            regards the <lb/>
            priority of the <lb/>
            parts or of <lb/>
            their subse­ <lb/>
            quence.</p>
          <p>Therefore, indeed, also, has the truth now been <lb/>
            declared, yet, nevertheless, let us express our­ <lb/>
            selves more clearly1 on resuming the subject. As <lb/>
            many things, therefore, as are parts of the defi­ <lb/>
            nition, and into which the definition is divided, <lb/>
            these are prior, either all or some of them. But <lb/>
            the definition of a right angle is not divided into <lb/>
            the definition of an acute; but that of an acute angle is <lb/>
            divided into the definition of a right angle : for a person who <lb/>
            defines an acute employs a right angle, for the acute is less <lb/>
            than the right. In like manner, also, is it the case with a <lb/>
            circle and semicircle, for the semicircle is defined by the <lb/>
            circle, and the finger by the whole, for such a part of a man <lb/>
            is a finger. Wherefore, whatsoever parts involve such a rela­ <lb/>
            tion as matter, and into which, as into matter, the whole is <lb/>
            divided, are things subsequent; but as many as belong to <lb/>
            the relation of definition and of substance, which subsists <lb/>
            according to the definition, are things that are prior, either <lb/>
            all or some of them.</p>
          <p>5. Illustration <lb/>
            of this from <lb/>
            the soul, &amp;c.</p>
          <p>Now, since the soul of animals (for this is the <lb/>
            substance of that which is animated) constitutes <lb/>
            the substance according to definition, and their <lb/>
            form and the very nature or essence of such a body, if, <lb/>
            at least, the part of each thing be properly defined, it will <lb/>
            not be properly defined without mention of its appropriate <lb/>
            function ; and this, in the present case, will not subsist with­ <lb/>
            out sense. Wherefore, the parts of this, that is, of soul, are <lb/>
            prior, either all or some of them, to the entire animal, and, <lb/>
            doubtless, similarly is it with an individual thing. But the <lb/>
            body and its parts are subsequent to this substance; and <lb/>
            the substance is not divided into these as into matter, <lb/>
            but the entire is. To the entire, therefore, these are, in a <lb/>
            manner, prior, but, in a manner, are not prior; for neither <lb/>
            are they capable of subsisting in a state of separation; for <lb/>
            neither does finger belong to an animal when disposed in <lb/>
            every way, but equivocally so termed is a dead finger. Now, <lb/>
            some things perish along with the whole, and these are prin­ <lb/>
            cipal parts wherein, as first, are inherent the definition and <note type="footnote"> 1 Clearness, as already stated, in this matter depends on the dis­ <lb/>
            tinction between matter and form, and how definition in one case is <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. X.] </note> <lb/>
            the substance: as, for instance, the heart or brain, if such be <lb/>
            the principal part, for it makes no difference which of these <lb/>
            is of such a kind. But man and horse, and those that are so, <lb/>
            are found in singulars. And an universal substance does <lb/>
            not subsist; but there will be a certa.n entirety composed <lb/>
            from this reason or formal principle, and this matter as <lb/>
            an universal: but as regards a singular consisting from <lb/>
            ultimate matter, this is Socrates, in the present instance, and <lb/>
            the case is similar with other things. Therefore, also, is defi­ <lb/>
            nition a portion both of the form (but by form I mean the <lb/>
            essence or very nature of a thing) and of the universal that <lb/>
            is composed from form and matter itself</p>
          <p>But the parts of definition are only the parts <lb/>
            of form ; but a definition is of that which is <lb/>
            universal: for the being of a circle and a circle, <lb/>
            and the being of a soul and a soul, are the same <lb/>
            thing. And of that which is entire now, as of <lb/>
            6. Secondly, as <lb/>
            regards the <lb/>
            parts of the <lb/>
            thing defined <lb/>
            entering the de­ <lb/>
            finition. <lb/>
            this circle,-of any of the singulars, either sensible or intel­ <lb/>
            ligible,—(now, I mean by the intelligible, for example, the <lb/>
            mathematical, but by the sensible such as are made of brass <lb/>
            and wood,) of these, however, I say there is no definition, <lb/>
            save that they are known by the intervention1 of the intellect <lb/>
            or sense. And when they are removed away from actuality <lb/>
            it is not evident whether they exist at all or do not exist, yet <lb/>
            they are always expressed and made known by universal <lb/>
            definition. But the matter is unknown in itself. Now, <lb/>
            matter is partly sensible and partly intelligible; that which <lb/>
            is sensible is such as brass and wood, and such as is <lb/>
            movable; but intelligible matter is that which is inherent <lb/>
            in things that are sensible : but not so far forth as they are <lb/>
            sensible as mathematical entities. How, indeed, therefore, <lb/>
            this is so respecting the whole and part, and respecting the <lb/>
            prior and subsequent, has been declared.</p>
          <p>But as to whether a right angle, and a circle, <lb/>
            and an animal, are prior to the parts into which <lb/>
            they are divided, and of which they are composed? <lb/>

            must necessarily be, that not simply or absolutely are the <lb/>
            parts predicated. For if, also, soul is an animal, or that which <lb/>
            is animated, every animal1 is each animal's own soul; and if <lb/>
            the circle constitute the being of a circle, and the right angle, <lb/>
            the being of the right angle, and the substance, also, the sub­ <lb/>
            stance of the right angle, what particular thing, and belonging <lb/>
            to what, as a substance, each of these is, we must state on a. <lb/>
            subsequent occasion; for instance, of those parts that are con­ <lb/>
            tained in the definition, and of a certain right angle ; for both <lb/>
            the angle of brass which subsists in conjunction with matter <lb/>
            is a right angle, and that, also, contained within lines—I mean, <lb/>
            singular lines. But a right angle that involves no connexion <lb/>
            with matter is subsequent to those parts that are contained in <lb/>
            the definition, and prior to those parts that are contained in the <lb/>
            singular. But this is not to be affirmed of part absolutely. <lb/>
            And if soul be something that is different, and does not con­ <lb/>
            stitute an animal, in this case must we both assert some <lb/>
            parts to be prior, and other parts we must assert to be not <lb/>
            prior, just as has been declared.</p>

          <p>1. What sort <lb/>
            are the parts of <lb/>
            form, or rather <lb/>
            of what is com­ <lb/>
            prehended <lb/>
            along with <lb/>
            form, viewed in <lb/>
            their entirety.</p>
          <p>BUT it is a matter of doubt, naturally, what ie <lb/>
            the quality of the parts of form, and what sort <lb/>
            the parts are not, but what kind the parts are, <lb/>
            which belong to a composite nature. Although, <lb/>
            in case this is not evident, it is not possible to <lb/>
            define each thing. For of that which is universal <lb/>
            and of form is there the definition; as to which, therefore, of the <lb/>
            parts are related as matter, and which are not so, if these be not <lb/>
            manifest, neither will be manifest the definition of the thing. <lb/>
            As many things, indeed, therefore, as appear to be ingenerated <lb/>
            in the form of different things, as a circle in brass, and <lb/>
            stone, and wood, these, then, seem to be manifest, because <lb/>
            neither the brass nor the stone is anything of the substance <note type="footnote"> 2 This is Taylor's sense, which differs from that of the Latin Version. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 In this chapter, I take it, Aristotle wants to show the difficulty of <lb/>
            framing logical in contradistinction to material definitions, from the <lb/>
            fact that we cannot always distinguish what is formal from what is <lb/>
            material in the thing to be defined. </note> <pb n="193"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XI.] </note> <lb/>
            of the circle consequent upon its separation from them. But <lb/>
            as many things as are not perceived to be separated there is <lb/>
            no hindrance to their being similarly disposed with these, as <lb/>
            if all circles were seen composed of brass; for, nevertheless, <lb/>
            would the brass be in no wise a part of form, but it would be <lb/>
            difficult in thought to abstract this: as, for instance, the form <lb/>
            of man always appears in flesh and bones, and in such like <lb/>
            parts-are these, then, also, parts of form, and of the definition, <lb/>
            or are they not so, but matter merely ? But, on account of <lb/>
            its not being ingenerated in another also, we find it im­ <lb/>
            possible to separate it. And, since this seems to be admis­ <lb/>
            sible,—yet as to the time when, this is obscure,—certaiu <lb/>
            philosophers now are involved in doubt, in the case both of <lb/>
            a circle and in the case of a triangle, as if it were not fitting <lb/>
            for lines, and that which is contained within lines, also to <lb/>
            be defined by continuity; but that all should be predicated <lb/>
            in a similar manner with the flesh or bones of a man, and <lb/>
            the brass and stone of a statue, and they refer all things to <lb/>
            numbers: and the definition of a line, they say, is that of the <lb/>
            duad. Of those, likewise, who assert the existence of ideas, <lb/>
            some make the actual line the duad, but others, the form <lb/>
            -of the line ; for, in regard of some things, they say that form, <lb/>
            and that of which the form is compounded, are the same: <lb/>
            as, for instance, a duad and the form of the duad. But in <lb/>
            the case of a line it is not so.</p>
          <p>There happens, therefore, to be one form of many <lb/>
            things of which the species appears to be different, <lb/>
            which consequence also ensued in their system <lb/>
            unto the Pythagoreans :and it is possible, as a <lb/>

            istic solution <lb/>
            of the foregoing <lb/>
            censured. <lb/>
            result from this position, to make one actual form of all <lb/>
            things, and that other things be not forms at all, although on <lb/>
            this supposition will all things be one. That, therefore, those <lb/>
            things involve a certain doubt, (I mean, those questions that <lb/>
            have been started respecting definitions, and from what cause <lb/>
            it is that they are thus attended with difficulty,) this has <lb/>
            been declared.</p>
          <p>Wherefore, both to reduce all things in this <lb/>
            way, and to abstract matter, would be super­ <lb/>
            fluous ; for in the case of some things, perhaps, <lb/>
            this is in this, or these things are so disposed. <lb/>
            3. Summary <lb/>
            view of this <lb/>
            question as re­ <lb/>
            gards the <lb/>
            parts of form. <lb/>
            And the comparison that is made in the case of an animal, <note type="footnote"> 0 </note> <pb n="194"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK VL </note> <lb/>
            which the junior Socrates1 was accustomed to employ, is not <lb/>
            a good one, for it forcibly withdraws one away from the truth, <lb/>
            and makes us suppose as possible that man should subsist <lb/>
            without parts, as a circle without brass. But this latter <lb/>
            instance is not similar to the former, for animal, perhaps, is <lb/>
            something that is cognisant by sense, and which cannot be <lb/>
            defined without motion; wherefore, neither can it be defined <lb/>
            without the parts somehow disposed. For not altogether is <lb/>
            the hand a part of a man, but that which is able to accom­ <lb/>
            plish the proper function of a hand; wherefore, when it is <lb/>
            animated it is a part, but when it is not animated it is not a <lb/>
            part. Respecting, however, mathematical entities, why are <lb/>
            not definitions parts of the definitions of such ? for example, <lb/>
            why are not semicircles parts of the definition of a circle ? for <lb/>
            these are not sensibles; or, shall we say that this makes no <lb/>
            difference, for they will be the matter of certain things, and <lb/>
            of those that are not sensible, and of everything that is not <lb/>
            the very nature or essence of a thing ? These, then, will <lb/>
            not be the parts of universal circle, but of singulars, as <lb/>
            has been stated previously, for matter is partly sensible and <lb/>
            partly intelligible. And it is evident, also, that the soul is <lb/>
            the first substance, and that body is matter, but man or <lb/>
            animal is the compound of both as universal. If the soul, <lb/>
            however, be the form of such, Socrates and Coriscus are <lb/>
            two-fold ; for some regard Socrates as soul, but others as an <lb/>
            entirety: but if they be considered as this soul regarded <lb/>
            simply, this body also will involve the relation of the uni­ <lb/>
            versal and of the singular.</p>

            quiries as re­ <lb/>
            gards sub­ <lb/>
            stance.</p>
          <p>Whether, however, beside the matter of such <lb/>
            sort of substances, there is any other substance, <lb/>
            and whether it is necessary to search for any <lb/>
            different substance of these-as, for instance, <lb/>
            numbers, or some such thing-must afterwards be examined <lb/>
            into.2 For, on account of thi3, let us also endeavour to frame <lb/>
            some distinctions respecting sensible substances, since, in a <note type="footnote"> 1 As to the younger Socrates, he was not any relation, at least it <lb/>
            does not appear so, of Socrates, who, in reference to this, his namesake, <lb/>
            was termed the elder Socrates. He is supposed to have been a pupil <lb/>
            of Plato, and is represented by Plato in his writings, e.g. in the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πολιτικός</foreign>, conversing with the elder Socrates. Some imagine that he <lb/>
            was a brother of Theætetus. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Vide book XII. chap. vi. </note> <pb n="195"/>

            certain manner, the investigation regarding sensible substance <lb/>
            is a work of the physical and second philosophy ;1 for not <lb/>
            only is it necessary for the natural philosopher to afford in­ <lb/>
            formation respecting matter, but also respecting tnat sub­ <lb/>
            stance which subsists according to the definition, even still <lb/>
            more. In the case, however, of definitions, in what manner <lb/>
            are those parts which are assumed in the definition, and <lb/>
            why definition is one reason,-for it is evident that the thing <lb/>
            is one, and that the thing is in a certain way one definite <lb/>
            particular, which involves parts,—this must subsequently2 be <lb/>
            inquired into.</p>
          <p>What, therefore, is the essence of a thing, and <lb/>
            how this subsists in itself, that is, absolutely, has <lb/>
            been declared respecting everything universally, <lb/>
            and why the definition of the essence of some <lb/>

            tion of the <lb/>
            questions in <lb/>
            regard of defi­ <lb/>
            nition. <lb/>
            things possesses the parts of that which is defined; but, <lb/>
            in other things, why this is not the case, and why that in the <lb/>
            definition, indeed, of substance the parts so constituted as <lb/>
            matter are not inherent, this, likewise, has been declared. <lb/>
            For they are not parts of that substance, but of the entire <lb/>
            together ; and of this there is at least, in a manner, a defini­ <lb/>
            tion, and there is not so. For as involving a connexion <lb/>
            with matter there is not a definition (for it is a thing that <lb/>
            is indefinite), but according to the first substance there is; <lb/>
            as, for instance, the definition of man is the definition of <lb/>
            his soul. For the substance constitutes form, that is, such as <lb/>
            is indwelling, from which and from matter the entire sub­ <lb/>
            stance is denominated; as, for example, hollowness or <lb/>
            concavity : for from this and nose a flat nose, and flatness, <lb/>
            are composed, for therein twice will the nose be inherent. In <lb/>
            the substance, however, in its entirety, as in a flat nose, or <lb/>
            Callias, is matter also inherent. And that the essence or <lb/>
            very nature of a thing, and a singular in the case of some <lb/>
            things, are the same—as in the case of primary substances; <lb/>
            for instance, a curvature, and the essence of a curvature, <lb/>
            if it is primary-that these, I say, are the same, this has <lb/>
            been declared. Now, I mean by primary, or first, that which <lb/>
            is not expressed in respect of one thing being inherent in <note type="footnote"> 1 The " prima philosophia " is, of course, hyper-physical. As to the <lb/>

            another, and in a subject as matter. But as many things as <lb/>
            subsist as matter, or as things involving a connexion with <lb/>
            matter, these are not the same, except that they are one <lb/>
            according to accident, as Socrates and the musical, for these <lb/>
            are the same according to accident.</p>

          <p>1. Another <lb/>
            question as re­ <lb/>
            gards defini­ <lb/>
            tion discussed.</p>
          <p>LET us now, however, first discuss the subject <lb/>
            so far forth as there has been no statement <lb/>
            made concerning definition in the Analytics for <lb/>
            the doubt that has been expressed in those inquiries is of <lb/>
            advantage to our present dissertations respecting substance. <lb/>
            Now, this doubt which I allude to is as follows: "why, pray; <lb/>
            a thing that is capable of definition, of which the reason, we <lb/>
            say, is a definition, is one thing, as the definition of man is a <lb/>
            two-footed animal ? for let this stand as a definition of him." <lb/>
            Now, why is this one thing, but not many, animal and two- <lb/>
            footed ? for also, in the case of man and white, they are <lb/>
            many things when they are not inherent, either in the other; <lb/>
            but when the one is inherent in the other, and when the <lb/>
            subject—viz. man—undergoes any passive condition, they are <lb/>
            one, for then a white man becomes and is one thing. Here, <lb/>
            however, either does not partake of the other, for genus does <lb/>
            not appear to participate in the differences; for in such a case <lb/>
            would the same thing at the same time participate in contra­ <lb/>
            ries, for differences are contraries wherein the genus differs. <lb/>
            And if the genus does participate in the differences, the same <lb/>
            reasoning holds good, even though the differences be many <lb/>
            in number; for instance, having the capability of walking, <lb/>
            biped, without wings. For why are these things one, but not <lb/>
            many ? for they are not one because they are inherent,2 for <lb/>
            so, indeed, will there be one of all. But it is requisite that, <lb/>
            at any rate, as many things as are contained in definition <lb/>
            should be one, for definition is a certain single principle or <note type="footnote"> 1 In this chapter certain points pertaining to definition are discussed; <lb/>
            such as had been omitted by Aristotle in the second book of the Pos­ <lb/>
            terior Analytics, where the same subject is examined into. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 These words are supplied in Didot's, but are not found in the <lb/>

            reason, and belongs to substance.1 Wherefore, of one par­ <lb/>
            ticular thing this must needs be a definition, for also sub­ <lb/>
            stance signifies one certain particular thing, as we say.</p>
          <p>And it is necessary, first, to examine respecting <lb/>
            those definitions which subsist according to divi­ <lb/>
            sions. For there is nothing else involved in defi- <lb/>
            2. In respect of <lb/>
            genus and dif­ <lb/>
            ference ; <lb/>
            nition unless the genus that is denominated first, and the <lb/>
            differences, but the other things are genera, both that which <lb/>
            is first, and the differences comprehended along with this; as, <lb/>
            for instance, the first genus is animal, and that next in order <lb/>
            to this is two-footed animal; and, again, two-footed animal <lb/>
            without wings; and, in like manner, will it be the case if tht <lb/>
            definition be expressed by means of many distinctive quali­ <lb/>
            ties. In general, however, there is no difference whether <lb/>
            it subsists by many such, or by few, or by two of them : <lb/>
            yet if a thing be defined by two distinctive qualities, the <lb/>
            one will be difference, and the other genus, as, for instance, <lb/>
            of two-footed animal, animal is the genus, and the other, two- <lb/>
            footed is the difference. If, therefore, genus, simply con­ <lb/>
            sidered, is not anything different from the species, as it were, <lb/>
            of that genus, or if, indeed, it is, yet it is as matter,-for <lb/>
            voice is genus and matter, but the differences produce the <lb/>
            forms and elements out of this,-it is evident, in such a case, <lb/>
            that a definition is a sentence or discursus composed from dif­ <lb/>
            ferences. But, therefore, is it necessary, likewise, <lb/>
            that the difference of the difference should, at <lb/>
            least, be divided; as, for example, a difference be­ <lb/>
            longing to animal, such as having the support of <lb/>
            and in respect <lb/>
            of the differ­ <lb/>
            ences of a <lb/>
            difference. <lb/>
            feet: again, it is requisite to know the difference of the <lb/>
            animal that possesses the differential quality of being sup­ <lb/>
            ported on feet, as far forth as it is such—I mean, such as has <lb/>
            the support of feet. Wherefore, it is not proper to say that <lb/>
            of an animal which has the support of feet, one sort we find <lb/>
            with wings and another without them, if one is to express <lb/>
            himself correctly; but on account of the impossibility of <lb/>
            making a proper division of the distinctive qualities will one <lb/>
            do this: but it is correct to say so if one kind has cloven, and <lb/>
            another has feet that are not cloven; for these are the differ­ <lb/>
            ences of foot, for a cloven foot is a certain qualiJ v of foot. An i <note type="footnote"> 1 Some MSS. read <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐϭία</foreign>. </note> <pb n="198"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK VI. </note> <lb/>
            so always does one desire to go on making divisions of dis­ <lb/>
            tinctive qualities, until we come to things that do not <lb/>
            involve any difference. But then will there be as many <lb/>
            species of foot as there are differences, and the number of <lb/>
            animals with feet supporting them will be equal to the <lb/>
            differences.</p>
          <p>3. The unity of <lb/>
            the definition <lb/>
            not destroyed <lb/>
            by the number <lb/>
            of specified dif­ <lb/>
            ferences.</p>
          <p>Now, it these things are so, it is evident <lb/>
            that the ultimate difference will be the substance <lb/>
            of the thing,1 and the definition of it, if it is not <lb/>
            necessary to say oftentimes the same things in <lb/>
            the case of definitions, for it would be super­ <lb/>
            fluous. But this, at least, happens sometimes; for when one <lb/>
            calls an animal that has feet supporting it a biped, he has <lb/>
            said no more than this, viz. that an animal having the <lb/>
            support of feet has two feet. And if he make a division <lb/>
            of this by an appropriate difference, he will say the same <lb/>
            thing frequently, and in an equal number of times with <lb/>
            the differences. If, indeed, therefore, a difference of a differ­ <lb/>
            ence may be produced, one which is the ultimate difference <lb/>
            will constitute form and substance; if, however, the division <lb/>
            be made according to accident, as if one should make a <lb/>
            division, in the case of the classes of that which has the <lb/>
            support of feet, of one into white, and another into black, <lb/>
            so many differences or distinctive qualities will there be as <lb/>
            there may be divisions of them. Wherefore, it is evident that <lb/>
            definition is a sentence that is composed from the things <lb/>
            that are differences, and from the last of these that is drawn <lb/>
            up in accordance with a correct classification, at least. And <lb/>
            this would be plain, if one should transpose the arrangement <lb/>
            of the terms of definitions of this kind; as, for example, that <lb/>
            of a man, saying,-instead of the ordinary definition,-animal <lb/>
            biped having the support of feet; for superfluous would be <lb/>
            the distinctive quality of having the support of feet, on the <lb/>
            supposition of the thing defined being denominated a biped. <lb/>
            An arrangement of terms, however, does not exist in sub­ <lb/>
            stance; for how is it necessary to understand the one as <lb/>
            subsequent, but the other as prior? Respecting, then, <lb/>
            definitions that subsist according to divisions2 of the dis- <note type="footnote"> 1 The unity of definition Aristotle rests on the determination of <lb/>

          <p>BUT since our present investigation is concern­ <lb/>
            ing substance, let us once more take a review of <lb/>
            the matter. Now, substance is said to subsist <lb/>
            1. Connexion <lb/>
            of the following <lb/>
            with the fore­ <lb/>
            going. <lb/>
            as the subject and the essence or very nature of a thing, and <lb/>
            that which is composed from these is termed substance, and <lb/>
            that which is universal. Respecting, indeed, then, two of <lb/>
            them have we declared our opinions already; for also we <lb/>
            have done so in the case of the essence or very nature of a <lb/>
            thing, and the subject, observing that in two ways it is a <lb/>
            subject, either as being this certain particular thing, as an <lb/>
            animal is the subject of its passive states, or it is as matter <lb/>
            in a condition of actuality. But to some speculators doth <lb/>
            the universal in an eminent degree appear to be a cause, and <lb/>
            the universal appears to be a first principle also. Where­ <lb/>
            fore, likewise, as regards this point must we institute an <lb/>
            inquiry.</p>
          <p>For it seems to be a thing impossible that <lb/>
            substance should be anything whatsoever of <lb/>
            2. Are univer­ <lb/>
            sals substances? <lb/>
            those things that are denominated universal, for primary <lb/>
            substance, to be sure, in everything is that which does not <lb/>
            belong to another thing; that which is universal, however, is <lb/>
            common, for that is said to be universal which by nature <lb/>
            is fitted to be inherent in many things: of what, then, will <lb/>
            this be a substance ? for either it will be a substance of all <lb/>
            things or of nothing; but of all things it is not even possible <lb/>
            that it should be a substance: and if it be the substance of <lb/>
            one thing, other things also will be this; for those things of <note type="footnote">the Platonists by Aristotle, who considered that they had treated the <lb/>
            subject here discussed superficially and unmethodicaily. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Aristotle comes to be engaged in the speculations pursued in this <lb/>

            and <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign> being subdivided into subject, form, the composite of both, <lb/>
            and the universal; and three of these being already discussed, he now <lb/>

            which the substance is one, and the essence or very nature <lb/>
            one, will themselves likewise be one. Further, is that deno­ <lb/>
            minated substance which is not predicated of a subject; the <lb/>
            universal, however, is invariably predicated of a certain sub­ <lb/>
            ject. But then shall we say that it is not possible, certainly, <lb/>
            that it should subsist in such a way as the essence or very <lb/>
            nature of a thing, but that it be inherent in tbis: for ex­ <lb/>
            ample, animal in man and horse. Therefore, is it evident <lb/>
            that there will be a certain definition of it. But there is no <lb/>
            difference either if there is not a definition of all those things <lb/>
            that are contained in the substance; for this, nevertheless, <lb/>
            will be a substance of something, as mail is the substance of <lb/>
            man, wherein man is inherent. Wherefore, the same conse­ <lb/>
            quence will again ensue, for substance will be substance of <lb/>
            man :l as, for instance, animal is substance in that species in <lb/>
            which it is inherent as a peculiar property.</p>
          <p>3. Quality not <lb/>
            a substance, <lb/>
            but it presup­ <lb/>
            poses such.</p>
          <p>And, further, the thing would be both im­ <lb/>
            possible and absurd, that this particular thing <lb/>
            and substance, if they are composed from certain <lb/>
            things, should not consist of substances, or of <lb/>
            anything of the sort, but from quality. For that which is <lb/>
            not substance and quality will be prior both to substance <lb/>
            and this particular thing; an assertion that is impossible : <lb/>
            for neither in definition, nor in time, nor in generation, is it <lb/>
            possible, likewise, that the passive properties of a thing <lb/>
            should be prior to the substance of it, for they will involve <lb/>
            a subsistence separable from it. Moreover, in Socrates, who <lb/>
            is a substance, will substance be inherent; wherefore, will <lb/>
            Socrates be a substance in two substances. And in general <lb/>
            the result following ensues-if man is substance, and as many <lb/>
            things as are thus expressed-that none of those things con­ <lb/>
            tained in definition is substance of anything, and that it has <lb/>
            not a subsistence. separable from them, nor does it subsist in <lb/>
            another: now, I mean, for example, that there is not any <lb/>
            animal besides those certain particular ones, or anything <lb/>
            else of those things that are contained in the definitions. <lb/>
            Now, from these considerations, also, it is evident to persons <lb/>
            examining into the subject, that nothing of those things that <lb/>
            have an universal subsistence is substance, and that nothing <note type="footnote"> 1 The punctuation adopted in the Leipaic edition is most confused. <lb/>
            I have followed Didot's text in preference. </note> <pb n="201"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XIII.] </note> <lb/>
            of those things that are predicated in common signifies this <lb/>
            certain particular thing, but a thing of such a quality.</p>
          <p>And if this be not admitted, many other con­ <lb/>
            sequences also will ensue,1 and, amongst the <lb/>
            rest, the consequence that there- will be a third <lb/>
            man. Further, also, it is evident that the case <lb/>
            4. Further ar­ <lb/>
            guments <lb/>
            against univer­ <lb/>
            sals being sub­ <lb/>
            stances. <lb/>
            stands thus, from the following remark, for it is impossible <lb/>
            that substance should be compounded from substances which <lb/>
            are inherent in such a manner as to subsist in actuality ; for <lb/>
            two things thus would subsist in actuality, yet they never <lb/>
            would be one thing in actuality. But if they may be two <lb/>
            things in potentiality, they will be one; as the two-fold is <lb/>
            compounded of two halves, at least, in potentiality, for actu­ <lb/>
            ality in the case of others separates them. Wherefore, if the <lb/>
            substance be one thing, it will not be compounded from <lb/>
            substances that are inherent, and subsisting according to that <lb/>
            mode which Democritus mentions correctly; for it is impos­ <lb/>
            sible, he says, that from two atoms should be generated one, <lb/>
            or two from one, for he makes magnitudes that are indivi­ <lb/>
            sible to be substances. Therefore, is it plain that also in the <lb/>
            case of number this will take place in a similar manner, if <lb/>
            number be a composition of monads, as is said by some <lb/>
            speculators, for either the duad is not one, or it is not the <lb/>
            monad that is involved in this actuality.</p>
          <p>But the result which ensues contains a matter <lb/>
            of doubt; for if neither from the universals is it <lb/>
            possible that any substance be compounded, on <lb/>
            5. A doubt <lb/>
            suggested by <lb/>
            this reasoning. <lb/>
            account of an animal's signifying a thing of such a sort, but <lb/>
            not this certain particular thing, neither is it possible that <lb/>
            there subsists any substance from substances, in actuality—I <lb/>
            mean, that no composite nature can thus subsist; now, on such <lb/>
            a supposition, every substance would be a thing that is un­ <lb/>
            compounded. Wherefore, neither would there be a definition <lb/>
            of any substance. But, assuredly, it seems, at least, to all <lb/>
            speculators, and has been laid down originally, that definition <lb/>
            is conversant about substance, either solely or principally: <lb/>
            but now the conclusion drawn is this, that neither is there <lb/>
            definition of this, that is, of substance, nor will there be a <lb/>
            definition of any one thing in such a case ; or, shall we say <note type="footnote"> 1 Syrianus sides with the Platonists against Aristotle, and endeavourl <lb/>
            to show the inconsistency of the Stagyrite's reasoning hereupon. </note> <pb n="202"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK VI. </note> <lb/>
            that in a certain manner there will be, and in a certain <lb/>
            manner there will not be, a definition of substance ? What, <lb/>
            however, that is which is affirmed will be more manifest <lb/>
            from the sequel.1</p>

          <p>. This dogma <lb/>
            touching uni­ <lb/>
            versals ex­ <lb/>
            poses the fal­ <lb/>
            lacy or the <lb/>
            Ideal theory.</p>
          <p>Now, from these very circumstances is evident <lb/>
            the result which ensues, to those both who say <lb/>
            that ideas are as well substances as separable <lb/>
            substances,2 and who at the same time constitute <lb/>
            form out of the genus and the differences. For if <lb/>
            forms and animal exist in man and in horse, there is, undoubt­ <lb/>
            edly, one and the same, or a different animal in number, for <lb/>
            by definition it is evident that there is one and the same; for <lb/>
            the same definition does he assign who says that they are <lb/>
            inherent in each. If, therefore, there is some man—an actual <lb/>
            thing subsisting essentially-that is this certain particular <lb/>
            individual thing, and one which has a separate subsistence, it <lb/>
            is necessary, also, that those things from which they are <lb/>
            composed, as, for example, animal and biped, should signify <lb/>
            this certain particular individual thing, and should involve <lb/>
            a separable subsistence, and be substances. Wherefore, also, <lb/>
            2. Illustrated <lb/>
            in the case of <lb/>
            animal. <lb/>
            this will be the case with animal. If, therefore, <lb/>
            animal will be the same and one thing in horse <lb/>
            and man, as yourself in yourself, how will it be <lb/>
            one in things that subsist separately ? and why will not this <lb/>
            animal subsist, likewise, apart from itself? If, in the next <lb/>
            place, it will participate in the properties of two-footed and <lb/>
            many-footed, something which is impossible ensues; for con­ <lb/>
            traries, at the same time, will be inherent in this, which is <lb/>
            one thing, and this certain particular thing. And if this is <lb/>
            not the case, what is the mode of subsistence when one <lb/>
            affirms that an animal is two-footed, or adapted for walking ? <lb/>
            Perchance, however, they are composites, and are in contact <lb/>
            with one another, or have been mingled together. But all <lb/>
            such suppositions as to the mode of Subsistence in this case <lb/>
            are absurd. Shall we say, however, that in each thing there <note type="footnote"> 1 Vide the chapter following. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Some MSS. have the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἃμα</foreign> here after <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσίας</foreign>. </note> <pb n="203"/>
            <note type="margin"> II. XV j </note> <lb/>
            subsists something that is different ? Therefore, to speak the <lb/>
            word, those things will be infinite of which the substance is <lb/>
            animal; for not according to accident is man from animal: <lb/>
            moreover, many things will animal itself be, for animal which <lb/>
            is contained in each individual is substance, for it is not pre­ <lb/>
            dicated of anything else. And if this be not admitted, from <lb/>
            that will man subsist, and that will be a genus of man. And, <lb/>
            further, all things from which man consists will be ideas; <lb/>
            therefore, idea will not be an idea of one thing, but a sub­ <lb/>
            stance of another, for this is impossible; for, in such a case, <lb/>
            each of those things that are contained in animals will be an <lb/>
            animal itself. Further, will it subsist from this certain par­ <lb/>
            ticular thing ? and how will it subsist from this actual animal ? <lb/>
            or how is it possible that animal should subsist-which is <lb/>
            substance-as this very thing beside animal itself?</p>
          <p>Further, also, in the case of sensibles, both <lb/>
            these consequences ensue, and consequences still <lb/>
            3. These proofs <lb/>
            confirmed. <lb/>
            more absurd than these; if, therefore, it is impossible that <lb/>
            this can be the case, it is evident that there is not an idea of <lb/>
            them after such a mode as some would affirm.</p>

          <p>BUT since both entirety and the formal cause <lb/>
            are a different substance,-now, I say that the <lb/>
            1. Forms are <lb/>
            ingenerable. <lb/>
            former is substance in this way as the formal cause that is <lb/>
            comprehended along with matter, and that the latter is the <lb/>
            formal cause in general,-in regard of as many things, <lb/>
            then, as are so denominated, of these, truly, is there corrup­ <lb/>

            dissolution to ensue, for neither exists there generation in <lb/>
            this case; for the being of a house is not generated, but the <lb/>
            being of this particular house: but forms subsist without <lb/>

            therefore, inde­ <lb/>
            finable. <lb/>
            on this account, also, of sensible substances—I <lb/>
            mean, such as are singulars—there is neither <lb/>
            definition nor demonstration, because they involve <lb/>
            matter the nature of which is such as to admit of the possi­ <lb/>
            bility both of being and not being; wherefore, all the singulars <lb/>
            of such are things subject to decay or corruption. If, there­ <lb/>
            fore, also, demonstration be of those things that are neces­ <lb/>
            sary, as well as that which is a scientific definition, and if it <lb/>
            does not admit of being the case, as neither with scientific <lb/>
            knowledge that at one time it should be scientific know­ <lb/>
            ledge, and at another time should be ignorance, (but a thing <lb/>
            of this kind is opinion,) so neither is it to be admitted that <lb/>
            demonstration nor definition should subsist after this mode; <lb/>
            but such is an opinion, in regard of that which admits of <lb/>
            being disposed otherwise. It is evident, therefore, that there <lb/>
            would not be either definition or demonstration of those <lb/>
            things that may subsist differently; for, also, things that are <lb/>
            subject to corruption or decay are obscure to those even <lb/>
            that are in possession of scientific knowledge, when they <lb/>
            pass away from under the notice of sense; and though the <lb/>
            same reasons or principles be preserved in the soul, still will <lb/>
            there not further exist thereof either definition or demonstra­ <lb/>
            tion. Wherefore, as regards things relating to definition, <lb/>
            when one defines any of the singulars it is right that he should <lb/>
            not be ignorant that always is it possible to overturn this <lb/>
            definition, for a thing of this sort does not admit of definition.</p>
          <p>3. Ideas are in­ <lb/>
            definable.</p>
          <p>Neither, therefore, is it possible for any idea <lb/>
            to be defined; for the idea ranks amongst singu­ <lb/>
            lars, as they say, and has, likewise, a separable subsistence. <lb/>
            And it is necessary, also, that definition consist from names; <lb/>
            but the person who is framing the definition will not create <lb/>
            a name or nominative term, for it will be a thing unknown. <lb/>
            The things, however, that are posited or acknowledged are <lb/>
            common to all. It is necessary, then, that these also subsist <lb/>
            in other things; for instance, even just as if one should define <lb/>
            yourself, he would say that you are an animal which is <lb/>
            attenuated or white, or something else that will be inherent <lb/>
            4 Reply to an <lb/>
            objection <lb/>
            also in another. If any one, however, would say <lb/>
            that there is no hindrance to all things being <pb n="205"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XV.] </note> <lb/>
            separately inherent in many, but that all collectively belong <lb/>
            to this alone, we must, in the first place, say that also they <lb/>
            would belong to both; namely, animal biped to animal and <lb/>
            biped. And this must needs ensue, likewise, in the case of <lb/>
            things that are everlasting; since, at any rate, they are prior <lb/>
            existences, and are parts of that which is a composite. But, <lb/>
            assuredly, also, are they separable, if the thing—man—be <lb/>
            separable ; for either nothing will be separable, or both will be <lb/>
            so. If, indeed, then, nothing may possess the capacity of <lb/>
            a separate subsistence, there will not exist genus besides <lb/>
            species; but if both are separable, there will exist the dif­ <lb/>
            ference likewise. In the next place, because they are prior <lb/>
            existences in respect of being, these, also, on the contrary, <lb/>
            will not be exposed to decay. And then, if ideas spring from <lb/>
            ideas, (for more uncompounded are those things from which <lb/>
            other composites arise,) it will be necessary that those things <lb/>
            from which the idea consists should be predicated, further, <lb/>
            of many; for instance, take the case of animal and biped. But <lb/>
            if this be not admitted, how shall a knowledge of these be <lb/>
            attained ? for there will be a certain idea which it will be <lb/>
            impossible to predicate in the case of more things than one. <lb/>
            This does not, however, seem to be the case ; but every idea <lb/>
            appears to be participate.</p>
          <p>As, therefore, it has been declared, it is over­ <lb/>
            looked by these persons that it is impossible to <lb/>
            frame any definitions or distinctions in the case <lb/>
            of things that are eternal, and eminently in the <lb/>
            5. Ideas inde­ <lb/>

            case of as many things as are single; for instance, the sun1 <lb/>
            and moon: for not only do persons err in the addition of <lb/>
            things of this sort, in the event of which being taken away <lb/>
            still the run will continue as that body which revolves round <lb/>
            the earth, or which is hid by night. For if the sun were to <lb/>
            stand still in his orbit, or were to become apparent by night, <lb/>
            in such a case no longer will he be the sun; but the thing <lb/>
            would be absurd if he were not, for the sun signifies a <lb/>
            certain substance. Further, such persons take for granted <lb/>
            whatsoever points admit of being affirmed of another thing, <lb/>
            ;ust as if something else should become a thing of this sort, <note type="footnote"> 1 There is no article in the original before sun, but there is before <lb/>

            it is eviden that it will be the sun. The definition, then, is <lb/>
            common; but the sun was classed amongst singulars in such <lb/>
            a way as Cleon or Socrates, whereas, why does no one of these <lb/>
            bring forward a definition of idea? for it would become mani­ <lb/>

            such, that what is now stated is true.</p>

            substance mis­ <lb/>
            taken for sub­ <lb/>
            stances them­ <lb/>
            selves.</p>
          <p>IT is evident, also, that, likewise, the majority <lb/>
            of those things which seem substances are capa­ <lb/>
            cities and parts of animals, for none of these <lb/>
            involves a separate subsistence; but when they <lb/>
            may be separated, then, also, are they all of them as matter <lb/>
            I mean, such as both earth, and fire, and air; for none of these <lb/>
            is one thing, but each, as it were, a heap of immatured <lb/>
            things before they be digested, and some one thing produced <lb/>
            from their being blended together. But particularly would <lb/>
            one suppose the parts of animated beings, and those of the <lb/>
            soul, to be both of them contiguous to an existence in this <lb/>
            manner, as well in actuality as also in capacity, in respect of <lb/>
            having the first principles of motion from something in their <lb/>
            joints or flexures. Wherefore, some animals continue to <lb/>
            retain life after being divided : but, nevertheless, will all of <lb/>
            them subsist in capacity when they may be one thing, and <lb/>
            that which is continuous by nature, but not by force, or by <lb/>
            connascence, that is, growth in conjunction with something <lb/>
            else; for a thing of this kind is mutilation.</p>

            to be the sub­ <lb/>
            stances of <lb/>
            things.</p>
          <p>Since, however, unity is denominated2 as also <lb/>
            entity is, and since the substance of unity is <lb/>
            single, and those things of which there is cne <lb/>
            substance in number are one in number, it is <lb/>
            evident that neither unity nor entity can possibly <lb/>
            be the substance of things, as neither can the being of an <note type="footnote"> 1 We are now warned against the needless multiplication of sub­ <lb/>

            substance is matter developing itself to our observation under a certain <lb/>
            form, but that the qualities reside in this compound <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατὰ δύναμιν</foreign>, i.e. <lb/>
            potentially. These qualities are not, therefore, substances. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Vide book IL chap. iv. </note> <pb n="207"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XVI.] </note> <lb/>
            element or first principle be the substance of things. But <lb/>
            we are actually engaged in the inquiry, what, therefore, the <lb/>
            first principle is, in order to conduct our investigation to <lb/>
            that which is more known. The substance, then, indeed, of <lb/>
            these is rather entity and unity, than both the first principle, <lb/>
            and the element, and the cause; but by no means are these <lb/>
            substances either, if there be not anything else which is in <lb/>
            common with substance; for in nothing is the substance <lb/>
            inherent but in itself, and in that which is in possession of <lb/>
            itself of which it is the substance. Further, unity would <lb/>
            not subsist in many places at the same time ; that which is <lb/>
            common, however, does subsist in many places at the same <lb/>
            time: wherefore, it is evident that nothing of those things that <lb/>
            are universals can possess a subsistence separate from singulars.</p>
          <p>But they who affirm the existence of forms,1 <lb/>
            speak partly correct in assigning them a separable <lb/>
            subsistence, if they be substances, but speak <lb/>
            partly incorrect, because they assert unity to be <lb/>
            3. The Platonic <lb/>
            theory of form3, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴὸη</foreign>, how far <lb/>
            true, and how <lb/>
            far false. <lb/>
            a form in the case of many things. And the cause of this <lb/>
            position with these Platonists is the following: that they <lb/>
            have no rational account to render as to what are substances <lb/>
            of this kind—I mean, such as are incorruptible, and have a <lb/>
            subsistence independent of singulars and sensibles; therefore <lb/>
            do they constitute them as the same in the species with <lb/>
            things that are corruptible (for we know these), namely, ideal <lb/>
            man and ideal horse, adding to sensibles the thing signified <lb/>
            by the term ideal;2 although, indeed, if we had not beheld <lb/>
            the stars, yet this would be no hindrance, I presume, to the <lb/>
            existence of eternal substances, in addition to those which we <lb/>
            bad already attained a knowledge of. Wherefore, also, <lb/>
            though even now we may not have it in our power to see <lb/>
            what eternal substances are, yet, perhaps, it will be necessary <lb/>
            that there be some eternal substances in existence, at any <lb/>
            rate.3 That, indeed, therefore, neither any of those reputed <lb/>
            universals is substance, nor that there is any substance com­ <lb/>
            posed of substances, is evident. <note type="footnote"> 1 Vide book I. chap. vii., and also book XII. chap. iv. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 That is, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ αὐτό</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote">3 This is another of those passages that Christian writers would <lb/>

          <p>1. Summary <lb/>
            view of what <lb/>
            substance is.</p>
          <p>BUT what and what sort of a thing we ought <lb/>
            to define substance let us again declare, just as <lb/>
            if having made another commencement; for, <lb/>
            perhaps, from these statements will be evident the circum­ <lb/>
            stances also concerning that substance which is separated <lb/>
            from sensible substances. Since, therefore, substance is a <lb/>
            certain first principle and cause, from this starting point <lb/>
            must we pass onwards in our investigation.</p>
          <p>2. Discussions <lb/>
            grounded on <lb/>
            the assumption <lb/>
            that substance <lb/>
            is a cause as to <lb/>
            why a thing <lb/>
            subsists.</p>
          <p>But the inquiry why a thing subsists is invari­ <lb/>
            ably carried on in this way; namely, why one <lb/>
            thing is inherent in a certain other; for the inves­ <lb/>
            tigation why a musical man is a musical man, <lb/>
            indeed, is to engage in the inquiry that has been <lb/>
            mentioned, namely, why, or on what account a <lb/>
            man is musical ? or it is to engage in the inquiry of something <lb/>
            else. Therefore, in sooth, the investigation why this thing <lb/>
            is the thing which it is, is no investigation at all; for it is <lb/>
            necessary that the wherefore,1 and the existence of a thing, <lb/>
            should inhere as manifest entities. Now, I say, for instance, <lb/>
            the moon undergoes an eclipse: and of the inquiry why a thing <lb/>
            is that thing which it is, there is one principle and one cause <lb/>
            in the case of all things, as on what account a man is a man, <lb/>
            or a musician a musician, except some one say that each <lb/>
            thing is indivisible in regard to itself; but this would'be to <lb/>
            constitute unity : but this is both common in the case of <lb/>
            all things, and is a thing that is concise. One, however, <lb/>
            might inquire why man is that kind of an animal that he is. <lb/>
            This, then, is evident, that such a one does not investigate <lb/>
            why he who is a man is a man. Accordingly, he engages <lb/>
            in the inquiry why a certain thing subsists, as what is <lb/>
            common in the case of something; but that it does so subset <lb/>
            ought to be evident; for, if it be not thus, he inquires after <lb/>
            nothing : as, to take an instance, why does it thunder ? <lb/>
            why, because sound is produced in the clouds : for so one <lb/>
            thing as the cause of another is that which is under investi­ <lb/>
            gation. And on what account do these things, as bricks and <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ὅτ</foreign>.: other MSS. read rb <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄν τι</foreign>, which diminishes the force and <lb/>
            meaning of the passage. </note> <pb n="209"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XVII.] </note> <lb/>
            stones, constitute a house ; it is evident, then, that he inves­ <lb/>
            tigates the cause ; but this is the essence or very nature of <lb/>
            a thing, (that is, if one is to express himself logically,) which, <lb/>
            in the case of some things, is that for the sake of which a <lb/>
            thing subsists, that is, the final cause; as, perhaps, in the <lb/>
            case of a house or a bed : but in the case of other things it <lb/>
            is something that has imparted motion in the first instance ; <lb/>
            for this also is a cause. But a cause of this kind is such a <lb/>
            cause as is sought for in the case of a thing that is being <lb/>
            produced and destroyed; but the other cause also is sought <lb/>
            for in the case of a thing already in existence. The subject <lb/>
            of investigation, however, is in an eminent degree latent- <lb/>
            I mean, such a one as is involved in the things that are mu­ <lb/>
            tually not predicated of one another; as, for instance, in the <lb/>
            inquiry what man is, on account of its being asserted that he <lb/>
            is simply so and so; but not from any definition being <lb/>
            framed to the effect that he is this or that. It is requisite, <lb/>
            however, if they conduct the inquiry correctly, to investigate <lb/>
            such ; but if not, it will be the case that nothing will be <lb/>
            under investigation, and something under investigation in <lb/>
            common. But since it is requisite to have in possession the <lb/>
            being of a thing, and that it should subsist, it is evident that <lb/>
            the inquiry is about matter, why it subsists; as, for instance, <lb/>
            these particulars constitute a house—why? because these <lb/>
            subsist as that which is the being of a house.</p>
          <p>Thus, too, is it in the inquiry why man is <lb/>
            this particular thing, or why this body is in <lb/>
            possession of this particular quality, the like <lb/>
            inquiry is made. Wherefore, the cause of the <lb/>
            3. And on the <lb/>
            same giound <lb/>
            we may deci fle, <lb/>
            e. g. why man is <lb/>
            this particular <lb/>
            thing. <lb/>
            matter is under investigation : but this is the form by which <lb/>
            anything subsists, and this is substance. It is evident, there­ <lb/>
            fore, that, in the case of simple substances, there is not any <lb/>
            investigation in existence, nor any disciplinary teaching ; but <lb/>
            there is a different mode of investigation of things of this <lb/>
            sort. Since, however, that which is compounded of some­ <lb/>
            thing, and compounded in such a way as that the whole is one <lb/>
            thing, but not as a heap, but as a syllable, yet a syllable <lb/>
            is not the elements of speech, nor the same thing with the <lb/>
            letters B and A; nor is flesh the same with fire and earth: for <lb/>
            when a dissolution of these takes place, flesh and syllable no <lb/>
            longer exist, as in the instance of the flesh and the syllable ; <pb n="210"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK VI. </note> <lb/>
            but the elements subsist, that is, the fire and earth continue to <lb/>
            subsist. The syllable in this case is something besides not <lb/>
            only the elements of speech, namely, the vowel and the mute, <lb/>
            but also something else; and the flesh not only is fire and <lb/>
            earth, or the warm and the cold, but also something else. If, <lb/>
            therefore, it is requisite that also flesh be either an element, <lb/>
            or that which is compounded from elements-if it is an <lb/>
            element—again will there be the same reasoning, for from <lb/>
            this,-even from fire and earth,-will consist the flesh ; and, <lb/>
            further, from something else something different,1 so that the <lb/>
            progression will go on to infinity: but if it be compounded <lb/>
            from an element, it is evident that it will not consist of one, <lb/>
            but many, or it will be that very thing itself. Wherefore, again, <lb/>
            in the case of this, as in the case of the flesh or syllable, we <lb/>
            shall put forward the same reasoning. Now, it would seem that <lb/>
            there is something of this sort, and that it is not an element; <lb/>
            and the cause, at least, of this thing being flesh, but that a <lb/>
            syllable. In like manner, also, is it concerning other things. <lb/>
            But the substance of each thing constitutes this, in truth; for <lb/>
            this is the first cause of being or substance. Since, however, <lb/>
            some things are not substances of things,-but this is the case <lb/>
            with as many substances as according to nature are consti­ <lb/>
            tuted as well as by nature,-to some, also, would this nature <lb/>
            appear to be substance, or it is not an element, but a first <lb/>
            principle. Now, an element2 is that whereunto as inherent <lb/>
            in a thing, as matter, a compound is divided, as, for instance, <lb/>
            of the syllable A B, A and B are the elements. <note type="footnote"> 1 "Something different:, [ have supplied these words myself to <lb/>

          <p>FROM the statements that have been now made <lb/>
            it is necessary to draw our inference, and, collect­ <lb/>
            ing together a summary of the foregoing, to <lb/>
            1 An epitome <lb/>
            as to what are <lb/>
            substances. <lb/>
            impose upon our remarks some termination or conclusion. <lb/>
            It has, therefore, been stated that the causes, and the first <lb/>
            principles, and the elements of substances, are the subjects <lb/>
            under investigation in the present Treatise. Now, as to <lb/>
            substances, some are acknowledged to have a subsistence <lb/>
            by all philosophers; respecting others, however, certain spe­ <lb/>
            culators have put forth from time to time certain peculiar <lb/>
            opinions of their own. Physical or natural substances are <lb/>
            acknowledged to have a subsistence; for example, fire, <lb/>
            earth, water, air, and the rest of simple bodies: in the next <lb/>
            place, plants, and the parts of these; animals, also, and their <lb/>
            parts; and lastly, the heaven and the parts of the heaven: <lb/>
            but those certain philosophers, who hold peculiar sentiments <lb/>
            respecting substances, affirm that both forms and mathema­ <lb/>
            tical entities or species are substances. But, unquestionably, <lb/>
            from the foregoing reasonings the consequence ensues of there <lb/>
            being other substances—I mean, the essence or very nature <lb/>
            of a thing, and the subject. Further, in other respects we <lb/>
            may assume that the genus is substance in preference to the <lb/>
            species, and the universal to the singulars. With the uni­ <lb/>
            versal, however, and th3 genus, the ideas, also, are connected, <lb/>
            for they seem to be substances according with the same <lb/>
            process of reasoning.</p>
          <p>Since, however, the essence or very nature of <lb/>
            a thing appears to be substance, and the reason <lb/>
            or principle of this is definition, on this account <lb/>
            we have settled various points respecting defini- <lb/>
            2 Why Aristo­ <lb/>
            tle was led to <lb/>
            the discussions <lb/>
            found in book <lb/>
            VI. <note type="footnote"> 1 In book VII., which is according to others book VIII., we have a <lb/>
            sort of application of the logical principles in regard of substance, <lb/>
            arrived at in book VI., to the case of substance regarded as what is <lb/>
            cognisant by the senses. </note> <note type="footnote"> p 2 </note> <pb n="212"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK VII. </note> <lb/>
            tion, and respecting that which is essential. But since <lb/>
            definition is a sentence, and since a sentence has parts, we <lb/>
            found it requisite also to examine concerning a part, what <lb/>
            sort are the parts of substance, and what sort they are not, <lb/>
            and whether these ought to be the same with the parts of <lb/>
            the definition likewise? Further, then, neither is the uni­ <lb/>
            versal 1 nor the genus substance. But concerning ideas and <lb/>
            mathematical entities we will subsequently2 institute an <lb/>
            inquiry; for, beside3 the substances of things cognisant by the <lb/>
            3. The inquiry <lb/>
            in book VII. <lb/>
            senses, certain speculators assert these to have a <lb/>
            subsistence. At present, however, let us treat <lb/>
            of those substances that are acknowledged to <lb/>
            have a subsistence; but these are sensible substances, or the <lb/>
            substances of those things that fall beneath the notice of the <lb/>
            senses.</p>
          <p>4. Substances <lb/>
            cognisant by <lb/>
            sense have <lb/>
            matter as their <lb/>
            subject.</p>
          <p>Now, all sensible substances involve matter.4 <lb/>
            But substance may be considered as those <lb/>
            things that may be classed amongst subjects <lb/>
            in one sense as matter, but in another as the <lb/>
            definition; now, I mean by matter that which is not this <lb/>
            certain particular thing in energy, but in capacity is this <lb/>
            certain particular thing; and in a different sense definition <lb/>
            and form are subjects. That which is this certain particular <lb/>
            thing is separable from the formal principle of it, and third <lb/>
            is that which is composed of these, of which alone there are <lb/>
            generation and corruption, and which is a thing that simply <lb/>
            has a separable subsistence; for of those substances which <lb/>
            Subsist according to a formal principle some are capable of a <lb/>
            separate subsistence, but some are not so. But that matter <lb/>
            is a substance is evident, for in all opposite changes is <lb/>
            there something which is the subject of the changes; as, <lb/>
            for instance, in place, that which is now here, but again is <lb/>
            elsewhere ; and according to increase, that which is at the <lb/>
            present moment of such a size, and the next less or larger; <lb/>
            and according to alteration, a person who is now healthy, and <note type="footnote"> 1 Vide book VI. chap. xiii. </note><note type="footnote">2 In book XIL </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Some MSS. read <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ</foreign> instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρά</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote">4 In objects that are cognised by our senses, what we perceive is <lb/>

            at another time indisposed: and in like manner, also, aword­ <lb/>
            ing to substance, a thing which now subsists in a state of <lb/>
            generation is again, however, in a state of corruption, and <lb/>
            that which is at the present time a subject, as this certain <lb/>
            particular thing, yet is at some future period a subject as <lb/>
            according to privation. And, doubtless, the rest of the <lb/>
            changes follow upon this; yet this does not follow one or two <lb/>
            of the other changes: for there is no necessity, should even <lb/>
            anything involve local or topical matter, that this also involve <lb/>
            matter, both such as is generable and corruptible. What, <lb/>
            then, is the difference between simple production, and that <lb/>
            which is not simple production, has been declared in our <lb/>
            Treatise on Physical Phenomena.</p>

          <p>BUT since the subsistence of substance as a sub­ <lb/>
            ject and as matter is admitted by philosophers, and <lb/>
            this is that which subsists in capacity, it remains <lb/>
            that we should state what that substance is amongst <lb/>
            sensibles which subsists as energy. Democritus, <lb/>
            1. What sen <lb/>
            siMle substance <lb/>
            is viewed as <lb/>
            energy; the <lb/>
            opinion of De­ <lb/>
            mocritus on <lb/>
            this point. <lb/>
            therefore, assuredly seems to be a person who considered that, <lb/>
            in regard of this, there are three differences; for he was of <lb/>
            opinion that the subject-body and the matter were one and <lb/>
            the same thing, but that the difference lay either in the <lb/>
            rysmos,1 which is figure, or in the trope, which is position, <lb/>
            or in the diathege, which is order.</p>
          <p>But there appear many existing differences; <lb/>
            as, for example, some things are termed sub­ <lb/>
            stance from the composition of matter: as, to <lb/>
            give an instance, whatsoever things are formed by <lb/>
            2. Substance, in <lb/>
            this point of <lb/>
            view, the sub­ <lb/>
            ject of many <lb/>
            differences. <lb/>
            mixture, such as mead, which is a mixture of honey and <lb/>
            water; and others are termed so from a wooden fastening, <lb/>
            as a chest;2 and others from a string, such as a bundle; <lb/>
            and others from glue, as a book; and others from many of <lb/>
            these; and others, again, are said to subsist from position, as <lb/>
            a threshold and the lintel of a door: for these differ from <note type="footnote"> 1 This has been already noticed by Aristotle, in book I. chap. iv. </note><note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">γόμφω</foreign> I have translated " wooden fastening," on the authority of <lb/>
            lAddeR and Scott. Taylor renders it by the word " nail" </note> <pb n="214"/>
             <note type="margin">[BOOK VII. </note> <lb/>
            circumstances of position in a certain respect; other things, <lb/>
            however, derive their being from time, as1 dinner and break­ <lb/>
            fast, and some from place, as the winds. And some things <lb/>
            are styled differences from the passive properties of sensibles; <lb/>
            as, for example, hardness and softness, and thickness and <lb/>
            thinness, and dryness and moistness: and some are so termed <lb/>
            from certain of these qualities, and others from all of them; <lb/>
            and, in general, some from excess, but others from defect. <lb/>
            Wherefore, it is evident that the fact of a thing's sub­ <lb/>
            sistence is denominated in thus many ways, for a threshold <lb/>
            is a threshold because it is situated thus, and its subsistence <lb/>
            signifies that it has this position in this way; and the sub­ <lb/>
            sistence of ice signifies the fact of its congelation in this form. <lb/>
            And the subsistence of some things will be defined by even <lb/>
            all of these circumstances; and this because some things <lb/>
            consist from the mixture of some things, but others from <lb/>
            their temperament, and some from their connexion, and <lb/>
            some from their condensation, and some from their employ­ <lb/>
            ment of other differential qualities, as either the hand or <lb/>
            foot. Therefore, must we take into consideration the genera <lb/>
            of differences, for these will be the first principles of sub­ <lb/>
            sistence; as, for example, those things which have their sub­ <lb/>
            sistence in the more and the less, or the dense and the rare, <lb/>
            and the other properties of this kind; for all these belong to <lb/>
            excess and defect. If anything, however, has its subsistence <lb/>
            in figure, or smoothness and roughness, all things will subsist <lb/>
            in what is right-lined and curved. Now, to some things <lb/>
            their subsistence will consist in their being mingled, and, in <lb/>
            an opposite way, their non-subsistence will consist in not <lb/>
            being mingled.</p>
          <p>3. Certain de­ <lb/>
            ductions drawn <lb/>
            by Aristotle <lb/>
            from the fore­ <lb/>
            going points.</p>
          <p>It is, therefore, evident from these foregoing <lb/>
            statements, that if substance is a cause of the <lb/>
            subsistence of each thing, that in these must be <lb/>
            sought the solution of the question what the <lb/>
            cause of the subsistence of each of these is. Substance, in- <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεῖπνον</foreign> teal <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄριϭτον</foreign>. I have differed from Taylor, who translates <lb/>
            these words supper and dinner." <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δεῖπνον</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">δεῖ πίνειν</foreign>—was regarded as <lb/>
            the principal meal; and the. Homeric use of the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ᾰριϭτον</foreign> was to <lb/>
            designate the morning meal, Il. 24; 124—and this harmonizes with its <lb/>
            being a derivative from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦρι</foreign>, our " early." I know, however, that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄριϭτο</foreign> <unclear/> <lb/>
            an after times was made to signify the midday meal, or praudium, of <lb/>
            the Romans. </note> <pb n="215"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. II ] </note> <lb/>
            deed, then, is not any of these, or a thing that is connected <lb/>
            together; nevertheless, it subsists analogically in each thing. <lb/>
            And as in substances whatsoever is predicated of matter is <lb/>
            actual energy, this also in an eminent degree is the case <lb/>
            with the other definitions; as, for example, if it be neces­ <lb/>
            sary to define a threshold, we will say that it is a piece of <lb/>
            wood or stone situated in this way, and if a house, that it is <lb/>
            bricks and timbers disposed in such or such a way ; cr, shall <lb/>
            we further say that likewise the final cause exists in the case <lb/>
            of some things ? And if we are called on to define a lump of <lb/>
            ice, we would reply, that it is water congealed or condensed <lb/>
            in this form; and if symphony is to be defined, that it is <lb/>
            a particular sort of mixture of the sharp and the flat; and we <lb/>
            must proceed in the same manner with other things also.</p>
          <p>It is evident, therefore, from these statements, <lb/>
            that there is of different matter a different <lb/>
            energy,1 and a different definition; for of some <lb/>
            things composition is the energy and form, <lb/>
            of. Different <lb/>
            matter, there­ <lb/>
            fore, involves a <lb/>
            different <lb/>
            energy. <lb/>
            and of other things mixture, and of others something <lb/>
            else of those particulars enumerated above. Wherefore, of <lb/>
            persons engaged in defining things, those, on the one hand, <lb/>
            who say what a house is, that it is stones, bricks, timbers, <lb/>
            speak of the house in respect of potentiality or capacity, for <lb/>
            these are matter; but those who say, in addition, that it is <lb/>
            a receptacle preservative of goods and bodies, or that it is­ <lb/>
            some other such thing, speak of the house in regard of its <lb/>
            energy ; and those who put both of these together, speak of <lb/>
            the third substance—I mean, the substance composed of <lb/>
            these, that is, of potentiality and energy.2 For the defini­ <lb/>
            tion that subsists by means of differences seems to be that <lb/>
            of form and energy, but that which consists from things <note type="footnote"> 1 To show what Aristotle means by energy or activity, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνέργεια</foreign>, we <lb/>
            must bear in mind what has been already laid down touching the <lb/>
            relation of matter and form; it is a sort of mediating principle between <lb/>
            both, for where capacity exists there must be likewise some operating <lb/>
            power to move such capacities into action. Now, this is precisely what <lb/>
            takes place in the case before us. Matter, which is the capacity, is <lb/>
            moulded into its several shapes by form, which is the energy. The <lb/>
            thing may be well illustrated by the relation subsisting between voli. <lb/>
            tion and muscular action. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 As to the relation between capacity and energy, we must refer tc <lb/>
            book VIIL, where the subject is discussed at large. </note> <pb n="216"/>

            that are inherent appears to be the definition of matter <lb/>
            rather. In like manner, also, does this consequence result <lb/>
            unto the definitions which Archytas1 admitted, for they are <lb/>
            compounded of both together; as, for example, what is a <lb/>
            lull ? stillness in a mass of air; the air in this case is matter, <lb/>
            but the stillness is energy and substance : what is a calm ? <lb/>
            smoothness of sea; the subject in this case, as matter, is <lb/>
            the sea, but the energy and form are smoothness. Now, it is <lb/>
            evident, from what has been stated, what sensible substance <lb/>
            is, and how it subsists; for the one thing is as matter, but <lb/>
            the other as form when it is2 energy: but the third is that <lb/>
            which is composed of these.</p>

            houses,—viz. that it is a shelter composed of bricks, and rafters, <lb/>
            and stones, disposed in this way,-or whether it is a sign of <lb/>
            energy and form, because it is a shelter ? in the instance of a <lb/>
            line, also, whether the name signifies that it is a duad in length, <lb/>
            or, because of its being the duad, is a sign of energy and form?4 <lb/>
            And, in the case of animal, whether it is soul contained in <lb/>

          <p>These, however, differ in relation to something <lb/>
            else; but they in no wise contribute to the <lb/>
            advancement of the present investigation about <lb/>
            substance, — I mean that substance which is cogni­ <lb/>
            sant by sense ;for the essence or very nature of a <lb/>
            2. This inquiry, <lb/>
            as well as <lb/>
            others of the <lb/>
            same sort, irre* <lb/>
            levant to onto­ <lb/>
            logy. <lb/>
            thing is inherent in the form and energy. For soul, I admit, <lb/>
            and the being of a soul, are the same thing; but the being of <lb/>
            a man, and the being man, are not the same thing; unless, <lb/>
            likewise, the soul will be styled a man: and so the being of <lb/>
            man will be the same, no doubt, in one respect, but not the <lb/>
            same in another, with man. But the syllable does not appear <lb/>
            to persons engaged in such investigations as consisting of the <lb/>
            elements of speech and of composition, nor does a house <lb/>
            seem to constitute both bricks and composition: and this <lb/>
            supposition is made correctly, for the composition and the <lb/>
            mixture of anything consist not from those things to which <lb/>
            composition or mixture belongs. In like manner, also, it is <lb/>
            not the case with anything else; as, for example, a threshold <lb/>
            subsists from position, not position from a threshold, but the <lb/>
            latter rather from the former; nor is a man animal and biped, <lb/>
            but must needs be something which subsists besides these, if <lb/>
            these are matter, and which is neither an element, nor from <lb/>
            an element, but the substance; and the thing which they <lb/>
            take away they denominate matter: if, then, this is a cause <lb/>
            of existence, and if this is substance, they would term1 this <lb/>
            actual substance. Now, it is necessary that this be either a <lb/>
            thing eternal, or subject to decay without being reduced to <lb/>
            decay, and be generated without going through a process of <lb/>
            generation. But it has been demonstrated, and made appa­ <lb/>
            rent elsewhere, that no one produces form, nor generates it, <lb/>
            but that this particular thing is produced, and that what is <lb/>
            composed of these is generated. But whether there are sub­ <lb/>
            stances of things corruptible capable of having a separate <lb/>
            subsistence is in no wise evident as yet, save that thus much <lb/>
            is plain, that it is not admissible with some things at any <lb/>
            rate, such as cannot possibly subsist even beside certain par­ <lb/>
            ticulars, say a house or a utensil. Therefore, perhaps, indeed, <note type="footnote"> 1 I have followed Didot's text in omitting the particle <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ</foreign>, which the <lb/>
            Leipsic edition retains </note> <pb n="218"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK VII. </note> <lb/>
            neither such are substances—I mean sensibles—nor are these <lb/>
            very things substances in any respect, nor anything else that <lb/>
            does not consist naturally; for one may consider Nature as <lb/>
            alone the substance in things that are liable to decay.</p>
          <p>3. Refutation <lb/>
            of Antisthenes, <lb/>
            as to the inde­ <lb/>
            finability of the <lb/>
            TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">τι ἐϭτί</foreign>, or <lb/>
            quiddity.</p>
          <p>Wherefore, the doubt which the followers of <lb/>
            Antisthenes, and persons similarly uneducated, <lb/>
            indulged in, namely, that the nature of a thing <lb/>
            cannot be defined, involves some opportunity of <lb/>
            a solution at present; for what they say is, that <lb/>
            definition is a long sentence: but, certainly, as to the quality <lb/>
            of a thing, what it is, though we cannot frame any definition, <lb/>
            yet we can even give instruction of some kind or other on <lb/>
            such point; as, take the case of silver, you may not be able <lb/>
            to tell what it is, to be sure, yet you may say that it can be <lb/>
            assimilated in its appearance to tin. Wherefore, it belongs, <lb/>
            in fact, to a substance of which it is admissible that there <lb/>
            be a definition and formal principle; as, for example, of that <lb/>
            which is a composite nature, whether it be cognisant to the <lb/>
            sense or the intellect. But there cannot be such of those <lb/>
            things from which these consist primarily, if the definitive <lb/>
            reason has any signification in regard of anything, and it <lb/>
            is necessary that the one be as matter, but the other as <lb/>
            form.</p>
          <p>4. This reason­ <lb/>
            ing corrects <lb/>
            certain false <lb/>
            notions as to <lb/>
            the subsistence <lb/>
            of numbers.</p>
          <p>Now, it is likewise evident, on the supposition <lb/>
            that numbers are in a manner substances,2 why <lb/>
            it is that they subsist after this mode, and not <lb/>
            as certain philosophers say, because they are a <lb/>
            multitude or aggregation of monads. For defi­ <lb/>
            nition, also, is a certain number, (for both it is divisible and <lb/>
            resolvable into indivisible elements; for formal principles are <lb/>
            not infinite,) and number is a thing of this kind. And just <lb/>
            as when any of those things whereof number consists has been <lb/>
            either subtracted from number or added to it, no longer is <lb/>
            there the same number, but a different one, even though ever <lb/>
            so little be subtracted or added, so, in like manner, neither will <note type="footnote"> 1 The position of Antisthenes amounts to an exaggerated statement <lb/>
            of the truth, because there are some things that are incapable of defi­ <lb/>
            nition as far as we are concerned; for example, the divine or angelic <lb/>
            nature. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Aristotle already, in the first book, has been occupied in an exami­ <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. IV.] </note> <lb/>
            definition, nor the essence or very nature of a thing, be any <lb/>
            longer the same, when there is a subtraction or addition of <lb/>
            anything. And it is necessary, further, as regards number, <lb/>
            that there should be something through which it is one, which <lb/>
            in the present case they cannot assign—I mean something <lb/>
            through which it is one-if number is one thing.1 For either <lb/>
            it is not one thing, but is, as it were, a heap, or, if it is, it must <lb/>
            be stated what that is which makes it to be one out of many <lb/>
            things. Definition, also, is one thing, and similarly neither in <lb/>
            regard of this which is compounded out of many things can <lb/>
            they make assertions in this way.2 And this result naturally <lb/>
            takes place, for it is a consequence from the same reasoning; <lb/>
            and the substance in this way is one thing, but not in such a <lb/>
            way as some would make out who say, for instance, that it is a <lb/>
            certain monad, or point, but that each is actuality, and a cer­ <lb/>
            tain nature. And as number involves neither the more and <lb/>
            the less, so neither does that substance which subsists according <lb/>
            to form; but, if this be the case, it is that which is connected <lb/>
            with matter. Respecting, indeed, then, generation and cor­ <lb/>
            ruption, in regard of the aforesaid substances, in what manner <lb/>
            it is admissible, and how it is impossible that they should <lb/>
            take place, and regarding the reduction of definition into <lb/>
            number, let the foregoing distinctions be set down thus far.</p>

          <p>As regards material substance, however, it is <lb/>
            necessary that it should not escape our notice <lb/>
            that, even though all things are from the same <lb/>
            primary nature, or the same things as those that <lb/>

            and form, and has shown, in respect of generation and corruption, that <lb/>
            they are alone admissible in the case of what is a composite from <lb/>
            both matter and form; and he now shows, seemingly in opposition to <lb/>
            those who were searching up and down in the nature of things for some <lb/>
            primary element, how, even on the assumption of suck being in exist­ <lb/>
            once, every material object has its own appropriate matter. </note> <pb n="220"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK VII </note> <lb/>
            ciple, for things that are generated, nevertheless, there is a <lb/>
            certain peculiar1 matter of everything; for instance, the first <lb/>
            matter of phlegm is the sweet, or the oily, and of bile, the <lb/>
            bitter, or something else of this sort: but, perhaps, these, <lb/>
            also, are from the same thing. And there are produced many <lb/>
            substances of the same thing when one thing is the substance <lb/>
            of another, as phlegm is from the fat and the sweet, if what <lb/>
            is fat or oily be from what is sweet, and it is the case that it <lb/>
            is from bile on account of the resolution of the component <lb/>
            qualities into bile, as into their primary matter. For in a <lb/>
            twofold way does one thing proceed from another, namely, <lb/>
            either because it will be in the way of progression,2 or of <lb/>
            analysation into its first principle.</p>
          <p>2. Different <lb/>
            things may be <lb/>
            generated from <lb/>
            the same <lb/>
            matter, yet <lb/>
            where the <lb/>
            thing is dine­ <lb/>
            rent its subject- <lb/>
            matter is often <lb/>
            different.</p>
          <p>Now, on the supposition of the existence of one <lb/>
            matter, it is possible for different things to be <lb/>
            generated by reason of the cause which imparts <lb/>
            motion, as both a chest and a bed are formed <lb/>
            from wood : of some things, however, the matter <lb/>
            is necessarily different, when the things themselves <lb/>
            are different; as, for example, a saw can never be <lb/>
            made of wood, nor does it belong to the cause imparting <lb/>
            motion to accomplish this, for it can never produce a saw of <lb/>
            wool or of wood. But if, then, it is possible to make the <lb/>
            same thing of different matter, it is evident that art and the <lb/>
            first principle, as one that originates the motion in a thing, <lb/>
            are the same; for if matter were different from that which <lb/>
            imparts motion, the thing made or generated would also be <lb/>
            different. When, therefore, one may investigate what the <lb/>
            cause of a thing is—since causes are denominated in many <lb/>
            ways3—it is necessary to mention all the contingent causes: <lb/>
            as, for example, what is the cause of man as matter, that is, <lb/>
            the material cause: is it the menstrual blood? and what is <lb/>
            the cause, as that which imparts motion, or, in other words, <lb/>
            the efficient cause: is it not the seed, then ? and what is the <lb/>
            cause as form, or the formal cause: is it not the essence, or <lb/>
            very nature of the thing? and what is the final cause of his <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἰκεῖα</foreign> : this word might be translated " domestic." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The Latin version renders this, " ex eo quod progredietur." </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Aristotle means, of course, his fourfold enumeration of causes, <lb/>
            found in the Physics, in the Posterior Analytics, and in more places <lb/>
            than one in the Metal hysics. </note> <pb n="221"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. IV.] </note> <lb/>
            existence : is it not the end thereof? But, perhaps, both of <lb/>
            these are the same. And it is requisite, also, to mention the <lb/>
            most immediate or proximate causes. What is the matter of <lb/>
            man ? not fire or earth, but that which is matter peculiar or <lb/>
            domestic to the nature of man.</p>
          <p>Certainly, then, respecting physical and gener­ <lb/>
            able substances, it is necessary to advance for­ <lb/>
            wards in our investigations in this manner, if <lb/>
            one will advance correctly; since, in such a case, <lb/>
            both these causes, and causes of such a descrip­ <lb/>
            tion, are in existence, and if it be requisite to <lb/>
            have a knowledge of causes. Concerning physi­ <lb/>
            cal or natural substances, however, but such as <lb/>
            3. The reason­ <lb/>
            ing thus ap­ <lb/>
            plied to sub­ <lb/>
            stance that is <lb/>
            physical and <lb/>
            generabJe, does <lb/>
            not apply to <lb/>
            substance <lb/>
            which though <lb/>
            physical is yet <lb/>
            eternal. <lb/>
            are everlasting, there is another mode of reasoning; for some <lb/>
            of them, perhaps, do not involve matter, or do not involve <lb/>
            matter of this kind, but only that which is movable in place. <lb/>
            And, therefore, as many as possess a natural subsistence, <lb/>
            but are not substance,1 these do not involve matter, but the <lb/>
            subject to them constitutes substance; as, for instance, what <lb/>
            cause is there of an eclipse ? say, what material cause is there ? <lb/>
            for no such can be assigned, save that the moon is that which <lb/>
            is passive : and what is the cause of this phenomenon, as <lb/>
            that which imparts motion and destroys light, that is, the <lb/>
            efficient cause, the earth ? The final cause, however, does <lb/>
            not, perhaps, exist in this case : and the formal cause is <lb/>
            definition; yet this is obscure, unless the definition be along <lb/>
            with the cause : as, what is an eclipse ? it is a privation of <lb/>
            light. And if this addition be made, that this privation of <lb/>
            light is occasioned by the earth intervening in the midst, this <lb/>
            will be a definition in conjunction with the cause. But, in <lb/>
            the case of sleep, it is obscure what is the first thing that is <lb/>
            passive. Shall we say that it is the animal in its entirety? <lb/>
            yes : but in what part does this passive condition arise? and <lb/>
            what organ is it that first undergoes this passive change ? is it <lb/>
            the heart,2 or something else? then, there is the inquiry, by <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>: it is better, perhaps, to read this <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>, and trailslate the <lb/>
            words thus : " but have not a subsistence substantially." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This was the opinion of Plato, according to Alexander; at least, <lb/>
            we find this assertion in the Commentaries on this book of the Meta­ <lb/>
            physics attributed to Alexander: but Brandis looks with suspicion oil <lb/>
            all such as being the work of Alexander, beginning from book V. </note> <pb n="222"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK VII. </note> <lb/>
            reason of what agency does this passive condition ensue ? and, <lb/>
            in the next place, what is this passive condition—I mean, the <lb/>
            condition that belongs to that particular organ, and does not <lb/>
            belong to the whole body ? shall we say that it is such and <lb/>
            such a kind of immobility ? be it so: but this is such because <lb/>

          <p>AND since some things are unconnected both <lb/>
            with generation and corruption, and some are not <lb/>
            so; as, for example, points-if they really subsist <lb/>
            -and in general, species and forms; (for it is not <lb/>
            whiteness that is generated, but the white wood :) or, if also <lb/>
            everything which is generated is generated from something, <lb/>
            in such a case all contraries would not be generated from one <lb/>
            another; but in a different way would white man be from <lb/>
            black man, and whiteness from blackness: nor of everything <lb/>
            is there matter; but of as many things as there is generation <lb/>
            and mutual change; and as many things as are without altera­ <lb/>
            tion, or are not, of these there is not matter. It involves, <lb/>
            however, a subject of doubt, how matter—I mean, that which <lb/>
            belongs to each thing-stands in relation to contraries; for <lb/>
            instance, if the body be healthy in capacity, and if the oppo­ <lb/>
            site thing to health be disease, whether shall we say that both <lb/>
            subsist in capacity ? Whether shall we, also, say that water <lb/>
            in capacity is both wine and vinegar? Or shall we say that <lb/>
            the body is matter of health according to its habit, and <lb/>
            according to form; but that it is the matter of disease, <lb/>
            according to privation, and according to corruption, such as <lb/>
            is contrary to Nature ?</p>
          <p>2. Another <lb/>
            subject for <lb/>
            doubt upon this <lb/>
            point.</p>
          <p>And another certain doubt is there, also, why <lb/>
            wine is not the matter of vinegar, nor vinegar in <lb/>
            capacity, although vinegar is produced from this;2 <lb/>
            and, in respect of one that is alive, we may doubt <note type="footnote">1 Aristotle is led to the inquiry in this chapter from the investi­ <lb/>

            whether such is in potentiality a dead body, or is not; but the <lb/>
            corruptions subsist according to accident: the actual matter, <lb/>
            however, of an animal, subsists according to corruption, as <lb/>
            the capacity and matter of a dead body, and the water, also, <lb/>
            of vinegar; for from these are they generated, as night from <lb/>
            day. And as many things, therefore, as in this way undergo <lb/>
            changes into one another, ought to revert back into matter; <lb/>
            as, for instance, if from a dead body an animated one should <lb/>
            be generated, it is requisite that the dead body should first <lb/>
            be resolved into matter, in order that in this way an animated <lb/>
            body might afterwards be generated from it; and, in like <lb/>
            manner, vinegar must be resolved into water, then will wine <lb/>
            in this way be produced.</p>

          <p>BUT bearing upon the doubt mentioned above, <lb/>
            both respecting definitions and respecting num­ <lb/>
            bers, is the question, what is the cause of <lb/>
            there being one ? for of all such things as have <lb/>
            many parts, and of which the whole is not, as it <lb/>
            1. How are we <lb/>
            to account for <lb/>
            the unity of de­ <lb/>
            finition in con­ <lb/>
            nexion with <lb/>
            the plurality of <lb/>
            what is definedf <lb/>
            were, a heap, but is something else, namely, an entirety, beside <lb/>
            the parts, there is a certain cause, since also in bodies-in <lb/>
            some indeed-contact is the cause of their being one, and in <lb/>
            others viscosity or some other such passive quality. Now, <lb/>
            definition is one discursus or sentence, not by a bond of con. <lb/>
            nexion, as the Iliad, but in respect of being of one thing. <lb/>
            What, then, is it which makes man to be one thing, and why <lb/>
            is he one thing, but not many things; as, for example, <lb/>
            both animal and biped, and in the most eminent degree also, <lb/>
            if, as some say, any animal in itself, and biped in itself, have <lb/>
            a subsistence ? For why is not man those very things, and <lb/>
            why will men subsist, not according to participation of one <lb/>
            man,2 but the participation of two things, both animal and <lb/>
            biped ? And, in general, therefore, man will not be one thing, <lb/>
            but many things, namely, animal and biped. It is, therefore, <note type="footnote"> 1 From his solution of the question as to the existence in a subject <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [BOOK VII. </note> <lb/>
            evident that to persons treating the subject in such a way aa <lb/>
            they have been accustomed to frame their definitions and <lb/>
            assertions, it is not possible to adduce a reason of this and <lb/>
            solve the matter in doubt.</p>
          <p>2. The real so­ <lb/>
            lution of this <lb/>
            question lies in <lb/>
            the difference <lb/>
            between capa­ <lb/>
            city and energy.</p>
          <p>But if the case stands as we say, namely, <lb/>
            that one thing, indeed, is matter, but another <lb/>
            form,-and, again, that one thing subsists in ca­ <lb/>
            pacity, but another in energy,-no longer would <lb/>
            the matter under investigation seem a sub­ <lb/>
            ject of doubt, for this doubt is the same as if the round <lb/>
            brass were the definition of a garment. For this name would <lb/>
            be a sign of the definition ; wherefore, the object of investiga­ <lb/>
            tion is what the cause is that the circular and the brass are <lb/>
            one. No longer, however, does the doubt appear to remain, <lb/>
            because the one is matter, but the other form. What, then, is <lb/>
            the cause of this, namely, that what subsists in capacity should <lb/>
            subsist in energy beside the producing cause—I mean, in the <lb/>
            case of whatsoever things there is generation ? for there is no <lb/>
            other cause of the sphere that subsists in capacity subsisting <lb/>
            as a sphere in energy, but this was the essence in each thing. <lb/>
            And as regards matter, there is one kind that is intelligible. <lb/>
            and another that is cognisant by the senses; and as regards <lb/>
            definition, one sort, indeed, is invariably matter, and another <lb/>
            is energy, as a circle is a plain figure. As many things, how­ <lb/>
            ever, as do not involve matter, either intelligible or sensible, <lb/>
            forthwith is it possible that each of these be one certain par­ <lb/>
            ticular thing, as that which is a certain particular thing is <lb/>
            this particular thing as well as quality and quantity; where­ <lb/>
            fore, also, there does not inhere in definitions either entity or <lb/>
            unity, and the essence or very nature of a thing is forthwith a <lb/>
            certain unity, as also a certain entity; wherefore, also, there is <lb/>
            not any different cause fbr any of these being one, or of there <lb/>
            being a certain entity in them, for immediately doth each <lb/>
            constitute a certain entity and a certain unity; yet they are <lb/>
            not inherent in entity or unity as in the genus1 of these, nor <lb/>
            have they a subsistence as though they were separable from <lb/>
            singulars.</p>
          <p>8. An attempt­ <lb/>
            ed solution of <lb/>
            It from the <unclear/> <lb/>
            phenomenon of</p>
          <p>And, on account of this aforesaid doubt, some <lb/>
            philosophers maintain that participation, to wit, <lb/>
            is the cause; and what the cause of the participa- <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">γένει</foreign>: other MSS. read <foreign xml:lang="grc">γενέσει</foreign>. </note> <pb n="225"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VI.] </note> <lb/>
            tion is, and what the participation itself is, they <lb/>
            are in doubt; but some assign the intercourse <lb/>
            participation, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέθεξις</foreign>. <lb/>
            of the soul as the cause, just as Lycophron,l who says that <lb/>
            science is the union of the act of scientific knowledge and of the <lb/>
            soul: but others affirm that the principle of vitality consists in <lb/>
            the composition or conjunction of soul with body. Indeed, the <lb/>
            same reasoning holds good as regards all things; for also the <lb/>
            being in sound health will be either the union, or conjunction, <lb/>
            or composition of soul with health. And for the brass to be <lb/>
            a triangle will be a composition of brass and of triangle, and <lb/>
            for a thing to be white will be a composition of superficies and <lb/>
            whiteness; and a cause of their speaking in this way is <lb/>
            because they are searching for the uniting principle and dif­ <lb/>
            ference of capacity and actuality. But, as has been said, <lb/>
            both the ultimate matter and the form are the same; and <lb/>
            the one subsists in capacity, but the other in actuality. <lb/>
            Wherefore, the investigation of what is the cause of unity is <lb/>
            similar to the inquiry into the cause of a thing being one; for <lb/>
            everything is one particular thing subsisting both partly <lb/>
            in capacity and partly in energy, in a certain respect, as one <lb/>
            thing. Wherefore, there is no other cause, except there be <lb/>
            something that can be shown to subsist as a cause imparting <lb/>
            motion from potentiality into energy. Now, whatever <lb/>
            things do not involve matter, all of these are simply some <lb/>
            certain particular thing. <note type="footnote"> 1 Lycophron. It does not appear who this Lycophron was; the <lb/>
            commentators merely say of him that he was a sophist, probably a <lb/>
            contemporary of Aristotle. He certainly was not the graat poet of <lb/>
            that name. </note> <note type="footnote"> Q </note> <pb n="226"/>

          <p>CONCERNING substance, then—I mean, concern­ <lb/>
            ing that which is primarily entity, and to which all <lb/>
            the rest of the categories of entity are referred-­ <lb/>
            we have declared our sentiments. For according <lb/>
            to the definition of substance are denominated <lb/>
            the other entities, viz. both quantity, and quality, and the <lb/>
            rest of the things that are predicated in this way; for all <lb/>
            such will involve the definition of substance, as we have as­ <lb/>
            serted in our earliest dissertations.2 But since entity is <lb/>
            denominated partly as quiddity, or quality, or quantity, but <lb/>
            partly according to capacity and actuality, and according to <lb/>
            work, let us frame certain distinctions and definitions as <lb/>
            regards both capacity and actuality; and, in the first in­ <lb/>
            stance, as regards that capacity, or potentiality, which is <lb/>
            spoken of as such with especial precision: not, to be sure, <lb/>
            that this is of service towards the advancement of our present <lb/>
            design, for potentiality and actuality extend further than <lb/>
            things merely predicated according to motion. But when we <lb/>
            have spoken our opinions concerning this in our definitions, <lb/>
            as regards energy, we shall make matters plain concerning <lb/>
            the other points likewise.</p>

          <p>That, indeed, therefore, potentiality is predi­ <lb/>
            cated in many ways, and that the possession of <lb/>
            potentiality is expressed in many ways, has been <lb/>
            settled by us elsewhere. a But as many of these <lb/>
            as are styled potentialities equivocally may be omitted; for <note type="footnote"> 1 In the eighth book-ninth according to some—Aristotle considers <lb/>
            the subject of capacity and energy with more minuteness. It is well <lb/>
            worthy of study, not merely for the distinctions which are found drawn <lb/>
            in it, but also for the admirable classification of capacities, or poten­ <lb/>
            tialities, which it contains. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Vide book VI. chap. i. </note><note type="footnote">3 In the fourth book,-his book of metaphysical definitions,—where <lb/>

            some capacities, or potentialities, are denominated capacities <lb/>
            by reason of a certain similarity (as in geometry we speak <lb/>
            of potentiality in this way), and things that are potential and <lb/>
            impotential we call such in regard of their being, in a certain <lb/>
            respect, endued with such a capacity, or not being so. As <lb/>
            many potentialities, however, as are referred to the same <lb/>
            form or species are all certain first principles, and are pre­ <lb/>
            dicated in reference to one primary potentiality,' which is a <lb/>
            first principle of change in another body, so far forth as it is <lb/>
            another. For there is a capacity, on the one hand, of being <lb/>
            passive, which, in the actual subject of passion, constitutes a <lb/>
            first principle of a passive state through the intervention of <lb/>
            another body, so far forth as it is another. There is, on the <lb/>
            other hand, the habit of impassivity, such as tends towards a <lb/>
            condition which is worse, and the habit of corruption, which <lb/>
            arises from the instrumentality of another body, so far forth <lb/>
            as it is another—I mean, a first principle capable of bringing <lb/>
            about a change. For in all these definitions is inherent the <lb/>
            definition of the primary potentiality just mentioned. And <lb/>
            again, these potentialities are styled either those of action <lb/>
            merely, or passion, or subsistence in an excellent manner. <lb/>
            Wherefore, also, in the definitions of these are inherent, in <lb/>
            a manner, the definitions of the former potentialities.</p>
          <p>It is, therefore, evident that there is, in a <lb/>
            certain respect, one potentiality of action and <lb/>
            passion,—for a thing that is potential is such in <lb/>
            regard of itself having the potentiality of passive- <lb/>

            drawn from <lb/>
            this enumera­ <lb/>

            tialities.. <lb/>
            ness, and in regard of another thing having it by reason of <lb/>
            this,-and, in another respect, there is a different potenti­ <lb/>
            ality. For one kind of potentiality resides in the patient; for, <lb/>
            on account of its having a certain first principle, and on <lb/>
            account of matter,2 also, being a certain first principle, the <lb/>
            subject of the passion is passive, and one thing undergoes <lb/>
            a change by reason of another; for that which is fat is <lb/>
            combustible also: but that which yields in this manner <note type="footnote"> 1 These words are worthy of attention; for by thus making every <lb/>
            capacity in its action relative to the operation of a certain other capa. <lb/>
            city, we ultimately arrive at the primary capacity; and this, according <lb/>
            to principles already established, presupposes a something beyond <lb/>
            capacity, an activity, the absolute <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνέργεια</foreign>, the first cause. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕλην</foreign>: some copies read, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅλην</foreign>. </note> <note type="footnote"> Q 2 </note> <pb n="228"/>

            is a thing that is bruised; and in like manner, also, is it <lb/>
            with other things. But another kind of potentiality resides <lb/>
            in the agent, as the hot, and the capacity of house-building, <lb/>
            are involved severally, the former in that which is capable of <lb/>
            making a thing warm, and the latter in a person who is <lb/>
            qualified to build a house. Wherefore, as far forth as a <lb/>
            thing is naturally connected with itself it in no wise under­ <lb/>
            goes a passive state itself, by reason of its own agency, for it <lb/>
            is one thing, and not anything else.</p>
          <p>4. What impo­ <lb/>
            tentiality is, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀδυναμια</foreign>.</p>
          <p>And impotentiality, and that which is impo­ <lb/>
            tential (now, such is contrary to potentiality), is <lb/>
            privation. Wherefore, every potentiality belongs <lb/>
            to the same, and subsists according to the same subject with im­ <lb/>
            potentiality. Privation,1 however, is predicated in many ways ; <lb/>
            for privation is to be found where a thing does not possess <lb/>
            something else, and, though fitted by nature for the possession <lb/>
            of such, may yet not have it either entirely or when it is <lb/>
            fitted by nature : and we say either, after this manner, that <lb/>
            it is privation, for instance, altogether so, or yet even in <lb/>
            some certain respect or other. And, in the case of some <lb/>
            things, if being by nature adapted to possess a thing, they <lb/>
            may not yet have such by reason of violence, we say that <lb/>
            these are subjects of privation in this respect.</p>

          <p>1. As to poten­ <lb/>
            tialities, some <lb/>
            are, and others <lb/>
            are not, con­ <lb/>
            nected with <lb/>
            reason.</p>
          <p>SINCE, however, such first principles of poten­ <lb/>
            tiality are inherent partly in things that are <lb/>
            inanimate, and partly in things that are animate <lb/>
            and contained in soul, and in that portion of the <lb/>
            soul which possesses reason, it is evident that <lb/>
            also of potentialities some will be devoid of reason, whereas <lb/>
            others will be accompanied with reason. Wherefore, all the <lb/>
            arts, even such as are constructive,2 as well as the sciences, <lb/>
            are potentialities ; for they constitute first principles which <lb/>
            are causes of change in another subject, so far forth as <lb/>
            it is another. And all those potentialities, indeed, that are <note type="footnote"> 1 The term privation, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δτέρησις</foreign>, has been already defined in book IV. <lb/>

            of reason is alone productive of one result: as, for instance, <lb/>
            that which is hot is productive of the promotion of heat <lb/>
            merely, and the medicinal art of disease and health.</p>
          <p>And a cause of this is the following, that <lb/>
            scientific knowledge is reason, and the same <lb/>
            reason makes manifest the result produced and <lb/>
            its privation, though not after the same manner; <lb/>
            and in one way is this reason that which creates <lb/>
            2. Difference <lb/>
            in the produc­ <lb/>
            tive powers of <lb/>
            these two <lb/>
            classes of po­ <lb/>
            tentiality ac­ <lb/>
            counted for. <lb/>
            this knowledge for both,1 yet in another it affords greater <lb/>
            knowledge of the thing in existence than of its privation. <lb/>
            Wherefore, it is requisite that such sciences as these should <lb/>
            involve a knowledge of contraries; but that of the one it <lb/>
            should be thus essentially, and of the other not essentially <lb/>
            for also reason is a knowledge of the one essentially, but of <lb/>
            the other, after a certain manner, according to accident, for <lb/>
            by negation and ablation it makes manifest the contrary; <lb/>
            for primary privation is that which is contrary, and this is <lb/>
            an ablation of the other. Since, however, contraries are not <lb/>
            inherent in the same thing-now, science is a capacity in <lb/>
            respect of the possession of reason, and the soul also pos­ <lb/>
            sesses a first principle of motion-hence the healthy or <lb/>
            salubrious produces health only, and that which is capable <lb/>
            of promoting heat—warmth, and of promoting cold-chilli­ <lb/>
            ness ; but the scientific person produces both. For of both, <lb/>
            no doubt, has reason a knowledge, but not in the same <lb/>
            manner; and this reason subsists in a soul which possesses <lb/>
            a first principle of motion. Wherefore, soul will move both <lb/>
            from the same first principle, having effected coherence <lb/>
            towards the same thing; wherefore, the things which are <lb/>
            potential, or endowed with capacity according to reason, <lb/>
            produce contraries to the productions of that which is poten­ <lb/>
            tial without reason, for one first principle is comprised in <lb/>
            reason. But it is evident that also upon the <lb/>

          <p>1. False notions <lb/>
            of the Megaric <lb/>
            school as to <lb/>
            energy being a <lb/>
            necessary con­ <lb/>
            dition for po­ <lb/>
            tentiality.</p>
          <p>BUT there are some who say-for instance, <lb/>
            those of the Megaric school-that where there <lb/>
            is energy, there only is there potentiality, or <lb/>
            capacity, but that where there is no energy, there <lb/>
            is no potentiality; for example, that the person <lb/>
            who does not actually build has not the capacity of building, <lb/>
            but that he has the capacity of building when he actually <lb/>
            builds, and that it is in like manner, also, with other things. <lb/>
            Now, the absurdities which ensue with these speculators it is <lb/>
            not difficult to discover. For it is evident that neither will <lb/>
            he be a builder if he does not actually build; for the being <lb/>
            of a builder consists in the possession of the capacity of <lb/>
            building; and in like manner, also, it is the case with the rest <lb/>
            of the arts. If, therefore, it is impossible for one to possess <lb/>
            arts of this kind, if he has not at any time received instruc­ <lb/>
            tion in them, and acquired them, and not to be in the posses­ <lb/>
            sion of them, unless at some time or other he lose them, (for <lb/>
            one may do so either through forgetfulness, or a certain <lb/>
            affection, or time ; for as to the thing itself, that, at any rate, <lb/>
            has not fallen into decay, for it is in existence always;) this <lb/>
            being the case when there may be a cessation of operation <lb/>
            on the part of such a one, he will not have in possession <lb/>
            the art, and how will he again forthwith proceed to build <lb/>
            in resuming the art which he had lost ? <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristotle, by what goes before, is led to attack the Megarian philo­ <lb/>
            sophers, who confounded everything with " being," and, therefore, po­ <lb/>
            tentiality with energy. The rallying point of the Megarics was the <lb/>
            school established at Megara by Euclid, a native of the place; and <lb/>
            Aristotle, no doubt, has his eye fixed principally on Euclid, for the <lb/>
            latter was a most vehement opponent of the dogmatism of the Peri­ <lb/>
            patetics. Vide Tenneman, p. 98, translated in " Bohn's Philological <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin"> CH. III.] </note> And in like manner will it be the case, also, <lb/>
            with things that are inanimate; 1 for there <lb/>
            will be neither cold, ncr hot, nor sweet, nor, in <lb/>
            short, anything cognisable by sense, when such <lb/>
            is not an object of sensation. Wherefore, it will <lb/>
            happen with these philosophers that they should <lb/>
            2. This Megaris <lb/>
            dogma akin to <lb/>
            thE theory of <lb/>
            Protagoras re­ <lb/>
            garding the <lb/>
            pure subject­ <lb/>
            ivity of our <lb/>
            sensations. <lb/>
            put forward the same theory with Protagoras. But, unques­ <lb/>
            tionably, neither will a man possess any sense unless he per­ <lb/>
            ceives or energizes. If, therefore, that animal is blind which <lb/>
            does not possess the power of vision, though naturally <lb/>
            adapted to see, and when it is naturally adapted to see, and, <lb/>
            further, as it is thus naturally adapted, in such a case the <lb/>
            same individuals oftentimes during the same day will be blind, <lb/>
            and in like manner deaf. Further, if that which is impoten­ <lb/>
            tial be that which has been deprived of capacity, that which <lb/>
            has not been generated, to be generated will be a thing that <lb/>
            is impossible; but one who says that what is devoid of a <lb/>
            capacity of being generated, either actually exists, or will do so, <lb/>
            shall affirm what is false; for this would signify what is impo­ <lb/>
            tentiaL Wherefore, these assertions overturn both the ex­ <lb/>
            istence of motion 2 and of generation; for that which stands <lb/>
            will always stand, and that which sits will always remain in <lb/>
            a sitting posture; for a man will not rise up if he be sitting <lb/>
            down, for it will be impossible for that to rise up which <lb/>
            would not possess the capability, at least, of rising up.</p>
          <p>If, therefore, it may not be possible to affirm <lb/>
            these things, it is evident that potentiality and <lb/>
            energy are something different from each other; <lb/>
            those theories, however, make potentiality and <lb/>
            energy to be the same: and thus it is not a <lb/>
            small thing which they are seeking to over- <lb/>
            3. These erro­ <lb/>
            neous views <lb/>
            bring to light <lb/>
            the difference <lb/>
            of potentiality <lb/>
            and energy <lb/>
            from each <lb/>
            other. <lb/>
            turn. Wherefore, it happens that a thing admits of being, <lb/>
            and yet may not be, and that a thing admits of not being, <lb/>
            and yet may be. In like manner, also, is it with the rest of <lb/>
            the categories: that which is endued with the capacity of <note type="footnote"> 1 Protagoras founded his scepticism on the pure relativity of our <lb/>
            sensations, and Bishop Berkeley endeavoured to build the reality of <lb/>
            God's existence on the same foundation. What a different philosophy <lb/>
            resulted from the same suggesting cause to the mind of the impious <lb/>
            and daring sceptic, and to that of the humble and confiding Christian! </note><note type="footnote"> 2 And, therefore, such theories, when pushed forward to their legiti­ <lb/>

            walking yet may not walk, and that which does not walk <lb/>
            may yet be able to walk. This, however, is a thing that is <lb/>
            potential, in which, when the energy is present of that of <lb/>
            which it is said to have the capacity, there will not be in <lb/>
            existence anything that is devoid of potentiality. Now, <lb/>
            I mean, for instance, if one is able to sit, and it so happens <lb/>
            that such a one sits, if the sitting posture will have an exist­ <lb/>
            ence in the case of such a one, nothing impossible or impo­ <lb/>
            tential will ensue. And if anything may be moved, or may <lb/>
            impart motion, or remain at rest, or impede a body in its <lb/>
            course, or be in existence, or be generated, or not be in <lb/>
            existence, or not be generated, the case will be similar.</p>
          <p>4. The origin <lb/>
            of the name <lb/>
            energy points <lb/>
            out its nature.</p>
          <p>But the name, energy,1 which is combined <lb/>
            with actuality, and tends towards other things, <lb/>
            has proceeded forth from motions principally; for <lb/>
            motion in an eminent sense appears to constitute <lb/>
            the energy of a thing. Wherefore, also, to nonentities they do <lb/>
            not attribute the having motion imparted to them, but certain <lb/>
            other categories: as, for instance, things which are nonentities <lb/>
            are intelligible and desirable objects, but are not in motion. <lb/>
            And this is the case because nonentities in energy will, how­ <lb/>
            ever, subsist in energy; for of nonentities some are nonentities <lb/>
            in capacity, but yet have no existence because they do not <lb/>
            exist actually.</p>

          <p>I. Potentiality <lb/>
            not a necessary <lb/>
            condition to <lb/>
            energy.</p>
          <p>Now, if the potential be that which it has <lb/>
            been declared to be, upon which energy is conse­ <lb/>
            quential, it is evident that it is not possible that <lb/>
            it be true to say that this particular thing is endued with a <lb/>
            capability of being, but yet will not exist; so that, on this sup­ <lb/>
            position, what things impotential are would elude our search. <lb/>
            Now, I say, for instance, this is just as if any one affirm it to <note type="footnote"> 1 Because, if we view energy as it were in a state of rest after the <lb/>
            end to which it tends has been brought about, this presupposes that <lb/>
            it has accomplished this transition through the intervention of motion; <lb/>
            or regarding energy in this very state of transition towards an end,­ <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰς τὸ τέλος</foreign>,—we must regard it as motion itself. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Aristotle now considers the converse of the proposition ascribed <lb/>

            be possible that the diameter of a square be commensurate <lb/>
            with its side, although this commensurability will never be <lb/>
            established; not reckoning that it is a thing that is impossible, <lb/>
            because nothing hinders anything that is potential, in regard <lb/>
            of existence and of generation,l from not being, nor being <lb/>
            likely to exist. But that follows necessarily from the points <lb/>
            laid down, if, also, we should suppose a thing may be, or may <lb/>
            be generated, which is not in existence, I admit, but yet is <lb/>
            a thing that is endued with the capacity of being; because <lb/>
            there will be in such a supposition as this nothing that is <lb/>
            impossible: but, at any rate, it will be admitted that this <lb/>
            result will ensue; for, allowing the commensurability of the <lb/>
            diameter, the inference must follow that even are equal to <lb/>
            odd numbers, which is an impossibility.2 For what is false <lb/>
            is not the same also with that which is impotential; for that <lb/>
            you now are in a standing position is false, to be sure, but <lb/>
            is not a thing that is impossible.8</p>
          <p>And at the same time, also, is it evident that, <lb/>
            upon the supposition of the existence of A, B <lb/>
            must needs exist likewise; and if A exist as <lb/>
            a thing that is potential in regard of being, it <lb/>
            2. Illustration <lb/>
            of this by <lb/>
            means of <lb/>
            symbols. <lb/>
            follows that also B must needs be a thing that is potential <lb/>
            in regard of being; for if there be no necessity for its being <lb/>
            a thing potential in regard of being, nothing hinders that <lb/>
            which is a thing possible to be from not being at all. Now, <lb/>
            let A be a thing that is possible to be. Therefore, since A is <lb/>
            a thing possible to be, if A be admitted as existing, nothing <lb/>
            impossible to be would actually ensue. However, B, at any <lb/>
            rate, must necessarily exist; but this was impossible. Grant, <lb/>
            therefore, that it is impossible. If, then, it were impossible <lb/>
            for B4 to exist necessarily, it is necessary that it should be <lb/>
            impossible for A to exist. But then A was possible, there­ <lb/>
            fore will B be so likewise. If, then, A be possible, B also <note type="footnote"> 1 The commentators say that Aristotle here glances at Plato for an <lb/>

            will be possible, if they subsist in such a way as that in con. <lb/>
            sequence of the existence of A, B necessarily exists also. If, <lb/>
            therefore, on the supposition that the things signified by A B <lb/>
            subsist in this manner, it may not be a thing possible for this <lb/>
            to take place in reference to B in this way, neither will <lb/>
            A B subsist in the manner that has been laid down; and if, <lb/>
            on the supposition of the possibility of the existence of A, <lb/>
            it is necessary that B also should exist as a thing that is pos­ <lb/>
            sible to be, supposing, then, A to exist, it is necessary also <lb/>
            that B exist. For that it is possible from necessity for B <lb/>
            to exist, if it be possible for A to exist, signifies as follows, <lb/>
            that if A exists, and when it exists, and as far as it is a thing <lb/>
            that is possible to exist, that then, and in this way also, that <lb/>

          <p>AND whereas of all existing potentialities some <lb/>

            playing on a flute, and some from discipline, as <lb/>
            capacity in the arts, it is necessary that those that are <lb/>
            developed from habit and reason should be acquired by re­ <lb/>
            peated exercises of previous activity, but that those which <lb/>
            are not of this description, and such as are concerned with <lb/>
            passivity, should not necessarily be acquired in this way. <lb/>
            Since, however, that which is endued with potentiality is able <lb/>
            to effect something, both the term “sometimes” and the term <lb/>
            " somehow" must one add in the definition, and as many <lb/>
            things else as are consequential to this. And some things that <lb/>
            subsist according to reason do not possess the potentiality of <lb/>
            imparting motion, and their potentialities are accompanied <lb/>
            with reason; whereas, as regards other things that are irra­ <lb/>

            with rational-potentialities. For, as regards all of these, <lb/>
            each one is productive of one thing; whereas those are pro­ <lb/>
            ductive of contraries: wherefore, this will at the same time <lb/>
            produce contraries—a thing, however, that is impossible.</p>
          <p>It is necessary, then, that there be something <lb/>
            else which may be predominant, and this I call <lb/>
            propension, or free-will; for whatsoever is the <lb/>
            object of a particular propension, this will that <lb/>
            propension authoritatively or rightfully accom­ <lb/>
            plish,l when, as far as it is endued with capacity, <lb/>
            it may subsist, and approximate unto the passive. <lb/>
            2. The transi­ <lb/>
            tion of capacity <lb/>
            into action <lb/>
            brought about <lb/>
            through pro­ <lb/>
            pension, or free- <lb/>
            will, as a me­ <lb/>
            diating prin­ <lb/>
            ciple. <lb/>
            Wherefore, that which is endued with capacity according to <lb/>
            reason must altogether compass its object, when it feels an <lb/>
            appetite after that unto which it has a capability of attain­ <lb/>
            ing, and so far as it has this capability. Now, the power <lb/>
            to do or accomplish anything subsists when that which is <lb/>
            passive is present, and is so disposed. And if this be not the <lb/>
            case, there will be no power to accomplish it; for, in the <lb/>
            event of none of those things that are extrinsic offering any <lb/>
            obstruction, there is no further necessity for adding these <lb/>
            words, “nothing extrinsic offering obstruction,” into the <lb/>
            definition, for it involves potentiality, as it belongs to a <lb/>
            capacity of action; yet it is not so altogether, but when <lb/>
            things are disposed in some such manner as that in their <lb/>
            case will also external impediments be removed; for these <lb/>
            are taken away—I mean, some of those distinctive terms that <lb/>
            are contained in the definition. Wherefore, neither will an <lb/>
            appetite accomplish two things, or contrary things, even <lb/>
            though at the same time it may feel disposed or be actuated <lb/>
            by an inordinate desire to accomplish them; for it does not <lb/>
            involve power over their attainment in this way at the same <lb/>
            time, nor is there present the power of the simultaneous <lb/>
            accomplishment of such, since those objects of pursuit over <lb/>
            which appetite has control it will accomplish in this manner. <note type="footnote"> What Aristotle here says of propension, Butler affirms of the <lb/>
            moral faculty; in short, this necessity of subordination, as well as the <lb/>
            fact of its operation, with the Bishop is the experimental proof of <lb/>
            the existence of conscience. Vide Sermons, I.—III. </note> <pb n="236"/>

          <p>1. Advantage <lb/>
            of an examina­ <lb/>
            tion into the <lb/>
            nature of ac­ <lb/>
            tivity, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνέργεια</foreign>.</p>
          <p>BUT since we have spoken concerning poten­ <lb/>
            tiality, such as subsists according to motion, let <lb/>
            us frame some definitions and distinctions re­ <lb/>
            garding energy, both as to what energy or <lb/>
            activity is, and what sort of a thing it is. For the nature of <lb/>
            that which is potential, or endued with capacity, likewise, at <lb/>
            the same time will be apparent to those who make a division <lb/>
            in this matter, because we not only say that this is a thing <lb/>
            endued with potentiality or capacity which is fitted by <lb/>
            nature to impart motion to something else, or to have <lb/>
            motion imparted to itself by something else, either viewed <lb/>
            simply or in a certain manner, but we also assert this as <lb/>
            being the case after a different mode. Wherefore, in our <lb/>
            investigations we shall also treat of these points.</p>
          <p>2. What energy <lb/>
            is not, and <lb/>
            what it is.</p>
          <p>The existence of the thing, however, as the <lb/>
            energy, does not subsist in such a way as when <lb/>
            we speak of a thing in potentiality; now, we <lb/>
            mean by a thing subsisting in potentiality, for instance, <lb/>
            mercury in the wood, and the half in the whole, because it <lb/>
            can be taken away from the whole : and we term that a <lb/>
            scientific person in capacity, even though not actually en­ <lb/>
            gaged in speculation, provided only such may be endued <lb/>
            with a capacity for speculative pursuits; and we mean <lb/>
            by a thing's subsisting in energy,-now, by an induc­ <lb/>
            tion of singulars is the assertion evident which we wish to <lb/>
            make, and it is not expedient that we should seek after a <lb/>
            definition for everything; but it is sufficient to perceive at <lb/>
            a glance that which is analogous,-now, I say, by a thing's <lb/>
            subsisting in energy we mean that it should be as a person <lb/>
            engaged in building stands in relation to that which is fit <lb/>
            for being built, and the wakeful tc the sleeper, and one who <lb/>
            sees to one whose eyes are closed, but who nevertheless pos­ <lb/>
            sesses the power of vision, and as that which involves a <lb/>
            separable subsistence from matter to matter, and as that which <lb/>
            has been wrought by art to that which is unwrought. After <note type="footnote"> 1 One advantage gained from the treatment of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνέργεια</foreign> by Aristotle <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. VI.] </note> <lb/>
            this mode,1 then, is energy compared with capacity or poten­ <lb/>
            tiality. By one portion, however, of this difference let energy <lb/>
            be distinguished, and that which is endued with potentiality <lb/>
            by the other.</p>
          <p>All things, however, are not said to subsist in <lb/>
            energy in a similar way; but either analogically <lb/>
            as this thing in this, or relatively to this; and <lb/>
            that thing in this particular thing, or relatively <lb/>
            to this particular thing. For some things <lb/>
            3. Different <lb/>
            modes of the <lb/>
            subsistence of <lb/>
            energy, e.g. <lb/>
            analogically or <lb/>
            relatively. <lb/>
            are as motion in respect of potentiality; but other things <lb/>
            are as substance in respect of a certain matter. But <lb/>
            the infinite and the void, and such-like things, are said to <lb/>
            subsist both in potentiality and energy after another manner <lb/>
            different from many entities; as, for example, that which <lb/>
            sees, and that which walks, and that which is seen. For <lb/>
            sometimes do these things admit of being verified, and simply <lb/>
            verified; for the one is an object to be seen, because it <lb/>
            is seen, but the other because it is endued with a potenti­ <lb/>
            ality of being seen; the infinite,2 however, does not subsist in <lb/>
            potentiality after such a mode as it is likely to be in energy <lb/>
            when it involves a separable subsistence: but it does in <lb/>
            knowledge, for infinite divisibility is the cause which these <lb/>
            persons assign for the subsistence in potentiality amounting <lb/>
            to this energy; not, however, in respect of its being made to <lb/>
            involve a separate subsistence</p>
          <p>But since none of those doings of which <lb/>
            there is a termination constitutes an end, but <lb/>
            only some of those that are performed in regard <lb/>
            4. Energy must <lb/>
            be distinguish­ <lb/>
            ed from motion. <lb/>
            of the end,-as the actual end of inducing emaciation is <lb/>
            emaciation, and when these happen to induce or promote a <lb/>
            state of emaciation they are in this way in motion, not being <lb/>
            inherent as the things on account of which the motion <lb/>
            subsists,-now, on such a supposition, these things do not <lb/>
            constitute the method of doing a thing, or, at any rate, such <note type="footnote"> 1 These words are supplied by the Translator to keep before the <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [BOOK VIII. </note> <lb/>
            a method as is perfect, that is, involves au end. For they <lb/>
            do not constitute an end, but in that—I mean, the motion­ <lb/>
            are inherent the end and the method of doing a thing; as, <lb/>
            for example, a man sees, but also he exercises thought, and <lb/>
            employs his understanding, and has employed his under­ <lb/>
            standing, but he does not receive instruction, and has <lb/>
            received instruction, neither is he in a sound state of health, <lb/>
            and has he been restored to health; he may live properly, <lb/>
            and has lived properly; but also he enjoys the felicity of a <lb/>
            regular life, and has enjoyed this felicity; and if this be not <lb/>
            the case, he ought at some time or other to intermit, as <lb/>
            when he may induce emaciation; he does not, however, pro­ <lb/>
            duce this state at present, but he lives, and has lived.</p>
          <p>5. Motion falls <lb/>
            short of energy.</p>
          <p>Therefore, is it proper to denominate some of <lb/>
            these aforesaid conditions as motions, and some <lb/>
            of them as energies or activities; for every motion is im­ <lb/>
            perfect : as, for instance, emaciation, learning, walking, build­ <lb/>
            ing; and these are motions, even imperfect ones at least. <lb/>
            For a person does not walk at the same time that he has <lb/>
            walked, nor does a builder construct a house at the same <lb/>
            time that he has built one, nor is a thing generated simul­ <lb/>
            taneously with its having been generated in time past, or is <lb/>
            motion imparted simultaneously with the communication of <lb/>
            motion in time past, but it is a different thing as regards the <lb/>
            communication and the reception of motion. Now, a person <lb/>
            -to give an illustration-has- seen and sees the same thing <lb/>
            at the same time, and exercises his understanding, and has <lb/>
            exercised his understanding simultaneously in regard of the <lb/>
            same thing: a thing of this kind, indeed, do I denominate <lb/>
            energy and activity; but I call that motion.1 Therefore, <lb/>
            as to the subsistence of a thing in energy-both what it is <lb/>
            and what sort of a thing it is-from these and such-like <lb/>
            statements let this point be evident to us. <note type="footnote"> 1 Taylor has these words, and ends the chapter with them. </note> <pb n="239"/>

          <p>AND when it is that each thing subsists in <lb/>
            potentiality, and when it does not, this point <lb/>
            must now be determined by us; for a thing does <lb/>
            not subsist in potentiality at any time whatso­ <lb/>
            ever indifferently,—thus, for instance, earth, is <lb/>
            1. When a <lb/>
            thing is said to <lb/>
            subsist poten­ <lb/>
            tially, or in <lb/>
            capacity, illus­ <lb/>
            trated. <lb/>
            it, pray, man in potentiality, or is it not ? but is this the case <lb/>
            rather when seed already is generated, (nor even the case some­ <lb/>
            how, perhaps, then;) just, then, as neither by the medicinal <lb/>
            art everything would be indifferently reduced to a sound <lb/>
            state, nor from chance, but there is something which is <lb/>
            endued with a capacity of health, and this is that which <lb/>
            subsists in a healthy condition potentially. But the defini­ <lb/>
            tion of that which by reason of an exercise of intellect is in <lb/>
            a state of generation in a condition of actuality, from such a <lb/>
            cause as exists potentially, such a definition may be discovered <lb/>
            when the process of generation is accomplished by one in the <lb/>
            exercise of volition, and in a case where no impediment is <lb/>
            offered by external obstructions. Now, this takes place in <lb/>
            the instance adduced in the case of a person being reduced <lb/>
            to a sound state of health, when there is no obstruction <lb/>
            offered by those things that reside in himself.</p>
          <p>And the case is similar with a house also in potentiality, if <lb/>
            there is no hindrance to its construction as a house from ob­ <lb/>
            stacles discoverable in the builder of that house or the matter <lb/>
            of it; and if there is not that which it is requisite should be <lb/>
            added, or subtracted, or changed, this constitutes a house in <lb/>
            potentiality. And this is the case, likewise, with the rest of <lb/>
            those things of which there is a first principle of generation <lb/>
            that is extrinsic, and in regard of as many things, doubtless, as <lb/>
            are contained in the thing itself in possession of them, what. <lb/>
            ever will subsist by meaDS of this, in the absence of external <lb/>
            impediments offering any hindrance; for example, the seed <lb/>
            does not as yet subsist in potentiality, for it is necessary that <lb/>
            it also accomplish a change in another body. But when now, <lb/>
            by means of its own first principle, it may subsist as a thing <note type="footnote">1 The subject of this chapter will be better understood by com­ <lb/>
            paring what Aristotle says on the subject of capacity in book IV. <lb/>
            chap. xii. </note> <pb n="240"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK VIII. </note> <lb/>
            of this kind, it is now this thing in potentiality; and that <lb/>
            requires a different first principle, just as earth is not yet <lb/>
            a statue in capacity or potentiality, for when it is being <lb/>
            changed it will become brass.</p>
          <p>2 When does <lb/>
            a composite <lb/>
            substance sub­ <lb/>
            sist in capacity?</p>
          <p>But what we are speaking of seems to be not <lb/>
            this particular thing, but a thing composed of <lb/>
            this or that material, just as a chest is not wood, <lb/>
            but wooden, nor is the wood earth, but earthy. <lb/>
            Again, if earth, after this manner, is not anything else, but <lb/>
            is termed derivatively, or a thing that is composed from <lb/>
            that material, in such a case that which subsists invariably <lb/>
            in capacity simply is that which is subsequent, just as the <lb/>
            chest is neither earthy nor earth, but wooden. For this <lb/>
            amounts to the subsistence of the chest in capacity, and <lb/>
            this is the matter of the chest, simply considered as of that <lb/>
            which is viewed simply; but of this particular chest is this <lb/>
            particular piece of wood the matter.</p>
          <p>3. The case <lb/>
            where we can <lb/>
            arrive at its <lb/>
            primary matter.</p>
          <p>If, however, there is something primary that is <lb/>
            not any longer denominated according to some­ <lb/>
            thing else, as a thing composed from that material, <lb/>
            this is primary matter; for example, if earth is of <lb/>
            air, and air is not fire, but composed of fire, in this case fire is <lb/>
            the primary matter of earth, as this certain particular thing <lb/>
            and substance. For in this respect is the universal different <lb/>
            from the subject in regard of being the one this certain parti­ <lb/>
            cular thing contrasted with the other which is not; for, to <lb/>
            give an example, man, and body, and soul, are each the subject <lb/>
            of passive conditions,—the passive condition, however, is the <lb/>
            being musical and white. But when the musical is ingenerated <lb/>
            as a capacity, that thing is not styled a musical capacity, but <lb/>
            a thing that is musical, and man is not termed whiteness, but <lb/>
            a thing that is white, nor walking, or motion, but a thing <lb/>
            which walks or is moved, just as a thing that is composed <lb/>
            of something else. Now, as regards, then, as many things <lb/>
            as are denominated in this manner, that which is last is sub­ <lb/>
            stance ; but in respect of as many things as are not styled in <lb/>
            this way, but of which a certain species and this certain <lb/>
            particular thing are predicated, that which is last is matter, <lb/>
            and a material substance. And therefore it happens correctly <lb/>
            that what is composed of the material of something else is <lb/>
            not predicated according to its matter and its passive con- <pb n="241"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            ditions, for both of these are indefinite. When, therefore, <lb/>
            a thing must be styled as that which subsists in capacity, and <lb/>
            when it does not subsist thus. has been declared.</p>

            <title type="sub">CHAPTER VIII.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>SINCE, however, it has been determined in how <lb/>
            many ways that which has a priority of subsist­ <lb/>
            ence is predicated, it is evident that energy, or <lb/>
            activity, is prior to potentiality. Now, I mean by <lb/>
            potentiality not merely a definite potentiality, <lb/>
            1. Nature is a <lb/>
            potentiality in <lb/>
            Aristotle's <lb/>
            sense of the <lb/>
            wcrd poten­ <lb/>
            tiality. <lb/>
            which is styled an alterative first principle in another body, so <lb/>
            far forth as it is another, but, in general, every first principle <lb/>
            which is the originator of motion or of rest. For Nature,1 also, <lb/>
            may be ranked in the same genus with potentiality; for she <lb/>
            is a first principle which is fit to be the cause of motion, not, <lb/>
            however, in another body, but in itself, so far forth as it is itself.</p>
          <p>Therefore, prior to every principle of this sort <lb/>
            is energy, or activity, both in definition and in <lb/>
            substance; but it is, also, in a certain respect <lb/>
            prior in duration, and in a certain respect it is not <lb/>

            energy to capa­ <lb/>
            city in defini­ <lb/>
            tion. <lb/>
            so. That, indeed, therefore, it is prior in definition is evident, <lb/>
            for that which is potential in regard of its possibility of ener­ <lb/>
            gizing, or assuming a state of activity, such is a thing that is <lb/>
            primarily endued with capacity or potentiality; for example, <lb/>
            I speak of one that is skilled in building-now, I mean one <lb/>
            that has a capacity of building, and I speak of one that is <lb/>
            able to see, and I mean one that possesses the capacity of <lb/>
            seeing, and of a thing that may be seen, as that which involves <lb/>
            the capacity of being seen : and the same reasoning, also, <lb/>
            holds good as regards other things. Wherefore, the definition <lb/>
            and knowledge of energy must needs pre-exist the definition <lb/>
            and knowledge of potentiality.</p>
          <p>But energy,2 likewise, is in time prior to <lb/>
            capacity after this mode: namely, the priority <lb/>
            3. And in the <lb/>
            order of its <note type="footnote"> 1 As to a more complete consideration of Nature, in this point of <lb/>

            development in <lb/>
            point of time <lb/>
            is energy prior <lb/>
            to capacity. <lb/>
            of that which actively accomplishes the same <lb/>
            thing in species, but not in number. Now, I <lb/>
            mean to say this, that, in the case of this parti <lb/>
            cular man existing at present according to energy, and in <lb/>
            the case of the corn, and the horse, and the person who sees, <lb/>
            prior in time are the matter, and the seed, and that which <lb/>
            is able to see, which in potentiality constitute man, and corn, <lb/>
            and one who sees, but are not as yet these in energy. Prior, <lb/>
            however, to these in time are those different things that <lb/>
            subsist in energy, and from which these have been generated; <lb/>
            for always from an entity in capacity arises, or is generated, <lb/>
            an entity in energy by means of an entity in energy-as <lb/>
            man is generated from man, a musician by means of a <lb/>
            musician-on the condition of something that is primary in <lb/>
            its nature always imparting motion: the moving power at <lb/>
            present, however, subsists in energy, or activity. But it <lb/>
            has been declared, in our disquisitions concerning substance, <lb/>
            that everything that is generated is generated1 from some­ <lb/>
            thing, and by something, and that this is the same in species. <lb/>
            Wherefore, also, it seems to be impossible that a builder be a <lb/>
            person not likely to have built anything, or a harpist to be <lb/>
            one who has not harped anything; for one who learns to play <lb/>
            upon the harp learns to play upon the harp by actually <lb/>
            playing upon the harp: it is also the case, in like manner, <lb/>
            with other artists.</p>
          <p>4. A quibble of <lb/>
            the Sophists on <lb/>
            this subject re­ <lb/>
            futed.</p>
          <p>Whence arose the argument, by refutation,2 of <lb/>
            the Sophists, that one who is not in possession of <lb/>
            scientific knowledge will accomplish the mastery <lb/>
            of that about which such scientific knowledge is <lb/>
            conversant, for the learner of a science is not in possession of it. <lb/>
            But, in reply to this, we may observe, that from the fact that <lb/>
            something of that which is being produced, or generated, has <lb/>
            been produced, and that, in general, something of that which is <lb/>
            being moved has been moved-now, this is evident, according <lb/>
            to what has been proved in our disquisitions concerning motion3 <note type="footnote"> 1 Vide book VI. chap. vii., and book VII. chap. v. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔλεγχος</foreign> • as to this word, the student is referred for an explanation <lb/>
            of it to a note on the first chapter of “The Sophistical Elenchi,” in <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            -the learner, also, in this case, must needs possess some­ <lb/>
            thing, perhaps, of scientific knowledge. But then, also, by this <lb/>
            it is, at any rate, evident that energy in this way, likewise, is <lb/>
            prior to potentiality in regard of generation and time.</p>
          <p>But, unquestionably, it is also prior in sub­ <lb/>
            stance, at least, in the first place, indeed, then, <lb/>
            because those things that are subsequent in gene- <lb/>
            5. Energy prica <lb/>
            to capacity in <lb/>
            substance. <lb/>
            ration are prior in form and substance; as a man to a child, <lb/>
            and a human being to seed : for now the one possesses the <lb/>
            form, but the other does not. And, in the second place, this <lb/>
            is so because everything that is being produced advances <lb/>
            towards a first principle and an end; for the final cause is a <lb/>
            first principle, and the generation or production is on account <lb/>
            of the end. But energy is an end, and on account of this <lb/>
            is potentiality assumed; for not in order that they may have <lb/>
            the power of vision do animals see: but they have the power <lb/>
            of vision1 that they may see.</p>
          <p>In like manner, also, persons are in possession <lb/>
            of the building art, or capacity, that they may <lb/>
            6. Illustrations <lb/>
            of this in art. <lb/>
            actually build, and of the speculative art that they may devise <lb/>
            systems of speculation; they do not, however, devise specu­ <lb/>
            lative systems that they may have the speculative capacity, <lb/>
            unless those who do so for the sake of meditation: yet these <lb/>
            by no means speculate absolutely; but they either speculate <lb/>
            in this manner, or the fact is so that they have not in any <lb/>
            wise an occasion to speculate. Moreover, matter subsists in <lb/>
            potentiality because it may advance onwards to form; but <lb/>
            when, at least, it subsists in energy, then doth it subsist in <lb/>
            form. In like manner, also, is it the case with other things, <lb/>
            and those of which the end is motion. Wherefore, as those <lb/>
            engaged in teaching by showing, in the way of example, one <lb/>
            energizing—say their pupil-think that they have adduced the <lb/>
            end, it is so with Nature in like manner. For, if this be not <lb/>
            the case, a circumstance, like the Mercury of Passo,2 will <note type="footnote"> tions, where subjects connected with motion are fully discussed, as <lb/>
            well as to the third book of the same Treatise. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 This remark may be applied to our particular propensions. The <lb/>

            whether it might be internal or external, as was the case with <lb/>
            Passo’s Hermes likewise, for an end is the work, and the <lb/>
            work constitutes the energy. Wherefore, the name energy is <lb/>
            denominated according to the work, and converges towards <lb/>
            actuality.</p>
          <p>7. An apparent <lb/>
            objection to <lb/>
            the foregoing <lb/>
            statement.</p>
          <p>And since of some things that which is ulti­ <lb/>
            mate is the use-as, for example, of the power <lb/>
            of vision the act of vision, and besides this no <lb/>
            other work is produced different from the <lb/>
            power of vision-yet in certain things is there something else <lb/>
            generated; for example, from the art of housebuilding a house <lb/>
            is produced in addition to the act of building, notwithstand­ <lb/>
            ing that energy, nevertheless, will be the end of potentiality, <lb/>
            in both instances, to be sure, though it is more the end of it <lb/>
            in the latter than in the former. For building is contained <lb/>
            in that which is being built, and is generated and exists at <lb/>
            the same time with the house. Of as many things, therefore, <lb/>
            as there is something different (namely, that which is being <lb/>
            produced) from their use, of these doth there subsist the <lb/>
            energy in that which is being constructed, just as both the <lb/>
            building resides in that which is being built, and the weaving <lb/>
            in that which is being woven; in like manner, also, is it the <lb/>
            case with other things, and, in general, doth motion subsist in <lb/>
            that to which motion is being imparted. Of as many things, <lb/>
            however, as there is not some different work beside the energy, <lb/>
            in these is energy inherent; as, for instance, the act, or power, <lb/>
            of seeing resides in the person who sees, and theory in the <lb/>
            theoriser, and vitality, or life, in the soul: therefore, also, is <lb/>
            happiness resident in the soul, for it also constitutes a certain <lb/>
            sort of vitality. Wherefore, is it evident, that substance and <lb/>
            form are each of them a certain energy. And therefore, <lb/>
            according to this reasoning, it is evident that in substance <lb/>
            energy is prior to potentiality. And, as we have stated, one <note type="footnote"> in the text, was, as to whether it was inside or outside the stone. People <lb/>
            said that it could not be outside, for the stone itself was smooth, and <lb/>
            presented no apparent inequalities ; and that, on the other hand, it <lb/>
            was hard to think the image could be within the stone, for the latter <lb/>
            would have manifested one or more joinings, being perhaps, so to say, <lb/>
            set or embedded in the midst of other stones, whereas there was an <lb/>
            matter absence of superficial roughness. Such is the account given by <lb/>
            she commentators of the allusion made in this passage by Aristotle. </note> <pb n="245"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            energy invariably is antecedent to another in time, up to that <lb/>
            which is primarily and eternally the moving cause.'</p>
          <p>But. assuredly, also, in a more strict and <lb/>
            important sense is energy prior to capacity; <lb/>
            for the things that are eternal are in sub­ <lb/>
            stance prior to things that are perishable, yet <lb/>
            nothing subsisting in potentiality is everlasting. <lb/>
            And a reason of this is the following:- every <lb/>
            8. Priority of <lb/>
            energy to capa­ <lb/>
            city proved <lb/>
            from the <lb/>
            priority of the <lb/>
            eternal to the <lb/>
            corruptible. <lb/>
            potentiality is at the same time a potentiality of its contra­ <lb/>
            diction ; for that which is not endued with the capacity <lb/>
            of existing will not subsist in anything : but everything that <lb/>
            is endued with capacity admits of not energizing. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, that thing the existence of which is potential admits <lb/>
            of both being and not being: the same thing, then, is that <lb/>
            which is potential, or endued with a capacity of both being <lb/>
            and not being. But that thing the non-existence of which <lb/>
            is potential admits of not being, and that which admits of <lb/>
            not being is subject to decay, either simply, or it is not this <lb/>
            very thing the admissibility of whose non-existence is affirmed, <lb/>
            either according to place, or according to quantity, or accord­ <lb/>
            ing to quality; but simply is a thing exposed to corruption <lb/>
            according to substance.</p>
          <p>None, then, of those things that are simply <lb/>
            incorruptible is an entity in potentiality, simply <lb/>
            considered; but in a certain respect there is no <lb/>
            hindrance to this being so ; for instance, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to quality, or the place where. All things, <lb/>
            then, subsist in energy : nor, even on the suppo- <lb/>
            9. What is <lb/>
            eternal does <lb/>
            not subsist in <lb/>
            capacity, <lb/>
            though, in a <lb/>
            certain sense, it <lb/>
            may. <lb/>
            sition of things being from necessity, are these things, how­ <lb/>
            ever, primary, for unless these were so there would be <lb/>
            nothing so. Nor, therefore, again, supposing there is any <lb/>
            eternal motion, does such a motion subsist in capacity ;2 <lb/>
            nor, supposing that there is anything that is being eternally <lb/>
            moved, such a thing that is being moved does not subsist <lb/>
            according to capacity, unless so far as it proceeds from a cer- <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῆς τοῦ ἀεὶ κίνουντος πρώτως ἐνέργειας</foreign>. These words might be <lb/>

            of this in the <lb/>
            heavenly <lb/>
            bodies.</p>
          <p>Wherefore, the sun and stars, and the entire <lb/>
            firmament, perpetually energize. No apprehen­ <lb/>
            sion, also, is there lest at any time they may <lb/>
            come to a stand-still,1 which dread overwhelms <lb/>
            some of the Natural Philosophers. For neither are the <lb/>
            heavenly bodies wearied in this operation of revolving, (for <lb/>
            their motion does not happen to subsist in regard of the ca­ <lb/>
            pacity of the contradiction of those,)—as, for example, is the <lb/>
            case with things subject to decay—so as to render the con­ <lb/>
            tinuity of the motion a laborious operation; for substance, <lb/>
            which is matter and potentiality, and does not subsist in <lb/>
            energy, is the cause of this.</p>
          <p>11. What is <lb/>
            corruptible <lb/>
            models itself <lb/>
            after the incor­ <lb/>
            ruptible.</p>
          <p>There is, however, an imitation 2 between things <lb/>
            incorruptible and those that are in a state of <lb/>
            change; for instance, earth and fire: for these, <lb/>
            also, invariably energize, seeing that they involve <lb/>
            motion essentially and in themselves. But all the rest of <lb/>
            the potentialities about which we have discoursed, (from the <lb/>
            distinctions and definitions that have been framed,) it is <lb/>
            evident are conversant about contradiction; for that which is <lb/>
            endued with the capacity of imparting motion in this par­ <lb/>
            ticular way can also do so in another way, and not in this <lb/>
            way—I mean, as many things, at any rate, as subsist as po­ <lb/>
            tentialities according to a rational principle. Potentialities, <lb/>
            however, that are devoid of reason, in respect of presence and <lb/>
            absence, will as the same be conversant about contradiction.</p>
          <p>12. The fore­ <lb/>
            going exposes <lb/>
            an absurdity in <lb/>
            the ideal <lb/>
            theory.</p>
          <p>If, then, there are certain natures of such a <lb/>
            sort, or substances of such a description, as those <lb/>
            speculators who have been engaged in such <lb/>
            theories affirm ideas to be, something would <lb/>
            there be which would be skilled in scientific knowledge in a <lb/>

            cellent, is evident from these statements. For <lb/>
            1. Energy Is <lb/>
            more a proof of <lb/>
            excellence than <lb/>
            capacity. <lb/>
            as many things as are denominated according to the being <lb/>
            potential, as far as these are concerned, it is the same thing the <lb/>
            being what is potential in regard of contraries; for instance, <lb/>
            that which is said to be endued with a capacity of health and <lb/>
            sickness is the same thing, and that, too, at the same time, <lb/>
            for there is the same capacity, or potentiality, of being in a <lb/>
            sound state of health and being indisposed, and of being at <lb/>
            rest and in motion, and of building and of demolishing what <lb/>
            is built, and of being built and falling into ruin.</p>
          <p>The capacity, then, of accomplishing contra­ <lb/>
            ries exists at the same time; but the actual <lb/>
            subsistence of these contraries at the same time <lb/>
            2. How energy <lb/>
            may be inferior <lb/>
            to capacity. <lb/>
            is a thing that is impossible: and it is a thing that is im­ <lb/>
            possible that contrary2 energies be also present at the same <lb/>
            time; for instance, in the case of being healthy and being <lb/>
            indisposed. Wherefore, either of these must needs be that <lb/>
            which is good, and it must in like manner be possible that <lb/>
            this be the case with both or neither. Energy, accordingly, <lb/>
            is the more excellent of the two. There is, however, a <lb/>
            necessity that, as regards that which is bad, the end and <lb/>
            energy should be worse than the potentiality; for that which <lb/>
            is endued with capacity, as regards both the contraries, is the <lb/>
            same thing. <note type="footnote"> 1 What Aristotle lays down in this chapter will be the more apparent <lb/>

          <p>It is evident, then, that what is evil is not any­ <lb/>

            that which is evil is by the constitution of Nature <lb/>

            as subsisting in energy; for persons discover <lb/>
            such2 in the act of division ; and if such <lb/>
            had been divided in twain,3 these mathematical <lb/>
            figures would have been apparent: but now are they in­ <lb/>
            herent potentially. Why, let me ask, has a triangle angles <lb/>
            equal to two right angles? because the angles about one <lb/>
            point are equal to two right angles. If, therefore, the line <lb/>
            about the side be produced, to one who merely glances at <lb/>
            the figure the thing is at once obvious. Why, too, in a <lb/>
            semicircle, is the angle universally a right angle ? because, if <lb/>
            there are three equal right lines, or even two at the base, and <lb/>
            one right line raised thereupon from the central point, the <lb/>
            thing will be obvious to any one at a glance, provided he be <lb/>
            a person that has some knowledge of mathematics. Where­ <lb/>
            fore, it is evident that mathematical diagrams, subsisting as <lb/>
            they do in potentiality, are discovered when they are being <lb/>
            reduced to energy; and the cause of this is the following,- <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristotle thus might have taught the Manichæans a better founda­ <lb/>

            strictest sense of the word, is what is true or false, and this <lb/>
            in the case of things consists in composition or division, so <lb/>
            that one can verify his assertion who considers that which <lb/>
            has been divided to be divided, and that which has been <lb/>
            compounded to be compounded; but he speaks falsely <lb/>
            who, when either things are or when they are not,2 makes <lb/>
            assertions about them in a contrary way to that in which <lb/>
            they actually subsist: seeing, then, that this is the case, <lb/>
            the thing is termed true or false; for it is fitting that we <lb/>
            should take into consideration what this is which is termed <lb/>
            true or false. For it is not on account of a true supposition, <lb/>
            on our parts, of your being white that you are in reality <lb/>
            white, but, on account of your being white, we who make <lb/>
            this assertion as to your whiteness can verify our assertion.</p>
          <p>If, therefore, some things are invariably <lb/>

            than one thing. Respecting, then, admissible or contingent <lb/>
            natures, the same opinion becomes false and true; and thi? <lb/>
            is the case with the same definition, or discursus : and <lb/>
            they involve the possibility of true assertions being made <lb/>
            of them ia one instance, but false assertions in another. <lb/>
            Regarding, however, things that are devoid of a potentiality <lb/>
            of being disposed otherwise than they are, a thing in this <lb/>
            case is not generated so as at one time to be true, <lb/>
            but at another false; but these things are invariably true <lb/>
            and in the <lb/>
            case of incom­ <lb/>
            posite natures. <lb/>
            and false. And, therefore, in regard of incom. <lb/>
            posite natures, what, let me ask, is the being <lb/>
            or not being, and what the true and the false <lb/>
            in respect of these I for it is not a thing that is compounded <lb/>
            so that it actually involves existence when it may be in a <lb/>
            state of composition, but does not involve existence when it <lb/>
            may subsist in a state of division,-as a piece of white wood, <lb/>
            or the incommensurability of the diagonal of a square with <lb/>
            its side,—neither will the true and the false, in like manner, <lb/>
            be still inherent, also, in those things—I mean, incomposite <lb/>
            natures. Or, shall we say that, as neither that which is true <lb/>
            in regard of these, so neither is their actual existence the <lb/>
            same; but the one is that which is true, while the other is <lb/>
            that which is false? Contact and assertion give us that <lb/>
            which is true, for not the same thing is affirmation with <lb/>
            assertion;1 not, however, to pass into contact amounts to <lb/>
            ignorance, for deception about the nature of anything has no <lb/>
            existence, save by accident. In like manner, also, is it in the <lb/>
            case of substances that are uncompounded; for deception in <lb/>
            regard of them is not a thing that is possible.</p>
          <p>3. Application <lb/>
            of the foregoing <lb/>
            to the principle <lb/>
            that truth is <lb/>
            assimilated <lb/>
            more with <lb/>
            energy than <lb/>
            capacity.</p>
          <p>And all such substances subsist in energy, <lb/>
            not in potentiality; for if they subsisted in <lb/>
            potentiality they would be generated, and in <lb/>
            process of time would be corrupted; but in the <lb/>
            present instance the actual entity is not gene­ <lb/>
            rated, nor is it reduced into corruption, for it <lb/>
            would be generated from something. And as regards what- <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">φάσις</foreign> : some of the copies must have <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπόφασις</foreign>, from the reference <lb/>

            soever things, therefore, that amount to the existence of any <lb/>
            certain particular thing, and its subsistence in energy or <lb/>
            activity, as regards these, I say, there is no possibility of <lb/>
            labouring under deception, but either one understands them <lb/>
            or he does not. But the inquiry as to the nature of any­ <lb/>
            thing is being instituted by us in respect of these natures, as to <lb/>
            whether there are things of this sort at all, or not; and the fact <lb/>
            is, the existence of a thing is as that which is true, and its <lb/>
            non-existence as that which is false; in one way, if it is that <lb/>
            which is compounded, it is true, whereas, in the other, if it <lb/>
            is not a composite nature, it is false: and in another way, <lb/>
            if we suppose it to exist in this way, it is true, but if not <lb/>
            in this way, it is not true. Now, that which is true amounts <lb/>
            to the intellectual apprehension of these,l but that which is <lb/>
            false does not exist, nor does it amount to deception, but <lb/>
            ignorance; not, however, such as may be assimilated unto <lb/>
            blindness, for blindness is just as if one, in short, did not <lb/>
            possess the capacity of intellectually apprehending any sub­ <lb/>
            ject. And it is also evident that, respecting things that are <lb/>
            immovable, there is no deception as to the time when of <lb/>
            their existence, supposing that one consider them as things <lb/>
            that are immovable; for instance, the triangle-unless viewed <lb/>
            as that which is subject to mutation-a mathematician will <lb/>
            not consider as being at one time in possession of angles <lb/>
            equal to two right angles, but at another not so, for it would <lb/>
            undergo a certain mutation; yet he might consider one thing <lb/>
            in this point of view, but not another: for example, that <lb/>
            there be no even number, first, or that some are so, but that <lb/>
            other numbers are not so. In regard, however, of one thing <lb/>
            in number we cannot expect that he should entertain this <lb/>
            opinion, for no longer would he do so as regards certain <lb/>
            things, yet not as regards others; but he will speak truth or <lb/>
            falsehood so far as he makes assertions of it as a thing that is <lb/>
            invariably disposed in this way. <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristotle's words are, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ δὲ ἀληθὲς τὸ νοεῖν αὐτἀ</foreign> : how brief, yet <lb/>

            to motion, per­ <lb/>
            ception, and <lb/>
            definition.</p>
          <p>THAT unity is denominated in many ways haf <lb/>
            been previously declared in our divisions on its <lb/>
            multifarious predications;2 and whereas it is <lb/>
            denominated in many ways, there are summarily <lb/>
            arranged four modes of things that are styled <lb/>
            one, primarily and essentially, but not according to accident <lb/>
            For both that which is continuous, either simply considered, <lb/>
            or especially what is so by nature, at least, and not by con­ <lb/>
            tact, or by a bond of connexion, such is one thing; and that <lb/>
            in a more eminent degree is. one thing, and prior to these <lb/>
            of which the motion is more indivisible, and simple, rather. <lb/>
            Moreover, is unity a thing of this sort; and in a more eminent <lb/>
            degree is that which is a whole one thing, and that which <lb/>
            possesses a certain form and species: but particularly we <lb/>
            look for unity if a thing of this sort subsists by the constitu­ <lb/>
            tion of Nature, and not by violent or abnormal means; in <lb/>
            like manner as whatever things are joined together by glue, <lb/>
            or by a nail, or by a chain, are one thing, but contains in <lb/>
            itself the cause of its own continuity. And it is a thing of <lb/>
            this kind in respect of its motion being one and indivisible in <lb/>
            place and time ; so that it is evident if anything by the <lb/>
            constitution of Nature involves a principle of the earliest <lb/>
            motion—I mean, such a principle as is primary-that it is <lb/>
            the first magnitude ; as, for example, I speak of the circular <lb/>
            motion of a body,8 for this is the earliest motion. Therefore, <note type="footnote"> 1 In book IX.—according to others, book X.—Aristotle having already <lb/>
            examined fully into the subject of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ δν</foreign>, comes now to treat of the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἕν</foreign>, which, with the ontologist, are interchangeable terms. The points <lb/>
            investigated in this book wear a decidedly logical aspect; and it has <lb/>
            been thought that there has been some error or confusion in this <lb/>
            portion of the Metaphysics. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The term <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕν</foreign>' has already been defined by Aristotle, in book IV. <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. I.] </note> <lb/>
            in this way are some things one either as what is con­ <lb/>
            tinuous or entire; others, however, are one of which the <lb/>
            definition may be one. And things of this sort are such as <lb/>
            those of which the intellectual apprehension is one, and such <lb/>
            as those of which it is indivisible, and of which there is an <lb/>
            indivisible apprehension of what is indivisible in form or <lb/>
            number. In number, therefore, is the singular indivisible; <lb/>
            but in form that is indivisible which resides in what is <lb/>
            an object of knowledge, and in scientific knowledge itself: <lb/>
            wherefore, that would be one thing primarily which is the <lb/>
            cause of the subsistence of unity in substances. Therefore, <lb/>
            no doubt, is unity denominated in such many ways, as both <lb/>
            that which is continuous by the constitution of Nature, and is <lb/>
            an entirety and a singular, and that which is universal. Now, <lb/>
            all these are one in respect of the indivisibility-of the motion <lb/>
            of some of them, but of the intellectual perception or the <lb/>
            definition of others.</p>
          <p>It is requisite, however, to understand that we <lb/>
            should not assume that the same assertions should <lb/>
            be made alike in the inquiries both as to what <lb/>
            sort of things are styled one, and what is the <lb/>
            2. Certain dis­ <lb/>

            quiries relating <lb/>
            to unity. <lb/>
            nature of the existence of unity, and what is the definition of <lb/>
            it; for unity is predicated in thus many ways, and each of <lb/>
            those things will be one in which any one of these modes will <lb/>
            be inherent. The being or existence of unity, however, some­ <lb/>
            times will be in accordance with one of these, and sometimes <lb/>
            with another which also is nearer to the name, but those are one <lb/>
            in regard of capacity; just as, also, if it may be expedient to <lb/>
            discuss the subject relating to element and cause, it would be <lb/>
            necessary, in the treatment of these matters, both to frame <lb/>
            distinctions and to assign the definition of the name. For <lb/>
            fire,1 in one sense, is an element,-and perhaps, also, with <lb/>
            the Infinite 2 in itself this is the case, or it is something else of <lb/>
            the sort,-and, in another sense, it is not so ; for the essence <lb/>
            of element is not the same thing with the essence of fire and <lb/>
            of element; but so far forth as fire is a certain thing and <note type="footnote"> carried along. The subject here glanced at is treated of at large by <lb/>
            Aristotle in the eighth book of the Physics, where the perpetuity of <lb/>
            natural motion is investigated. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 The Leipsic edition puts a stop after o --<foreign xml:lang="grc">οιχεῖον</foreign>,—omitted in the <lb/>

            a certain nat are, so far is it an element; but the name signi. <lb/>
            fies that this particular quality is an accident in this, because <lb/>
            there is something subsisting from this as from a thing that <lb/>
            is primarily inherent. So, also, is it in the case of cause and <lb/>
            unity, and all things of this sort. Wherefore, also, the essence <lb/>
            or existence of one consists in being indivisible; namely, in <lb/>
            being this certain particular thing, and incapable of a separate <lb/>
            subsistence either in place or form, or in the faculty of <lb/>
            thought, or in that which is entire, and has been made the <lb/>
            subject of definition.</p>
          <p>3. Unity, as a <lb/>
            measure, found <lb/>
            in quantity.</p>
          <p>But especially doth the nature or essence of <lb/>
            unity consist in being the first measure of every <lb/>
            genus, and the principal portions of quantity ;1 <lb/>
            for from this quarter, likewise, hath it proceeded to other <lb/>
            things, for measure is that whereby quantity is known. <lb/>
            But quantity, so far forth as it is quantity, is known either <lb/>
            by unity or by number; for every number is known by <lb/>
            unity. Wherefore, every quantity, so far forth as it is <lb/>
            quantity, is discoverable by unity; and that by which as <lb/>
            primary it is known, this itself is one. Wherefore, unity is <lb/>
            a first principle of number, so far forth as it is number. <lb/>
            And hence, also, in the case of other things, that is denomi­ <lb/>
            nated a measure whereby as primary each thing is known ; <lb/>
            and the measure of everything is one in length, in breadth, <lb/>
            in depth, in gravity, in velocity. For gravity and velocity <lb/>
            are what is common in the case of contraries, for in a twofold <lb/>
            sense may each of them be taken ; as, for instance, gravity is <lb/>
            both that which involves any momentum whatsoever, and <lb/>
            that which possesses a superabundance of momentum : and <lb/>
            velocity is both that which involves any motion whatever, <lb/>
            and an excess of motion ; for likewise is there a certain <lb/>
            velocity even of that which is slow, and there is a certain <lb/>
            gravity of that which is rather light.</p>
          <p>4. Measure de­ <lb/>
            rivable from <lb/>
            number in re­ <lb/>
            gard of other <lb/>
            Quantities, e.g. <lb/>
            lines, See.;</p>
          <p>Now, a measure and first principle in all of <lb/>
            these is a sort of unity, and a thing that is indi­ <lb/>
            visible; since- to give an instance-in lines, also, <lb/>
            they employ that which measures a foot as a <lb/>
            thing that is indivisible : for everywhere, or in <note type="footnote">1 If we do not allow the truth of this view of unity, it is implied, in <lb/>
            what Aristotle lays down that even the notion of quantity would be <lb/>
            inconceivable. </note> <pb n="255"/>
            <note type="margin"> III. I.] <lb/>
            </note>every instance, do investigators search for measure as a certain <lb/>
            unity, and as a thing that is indivisible; and this constitutes <lb/>
            what is simple, either in the quality or in the quantity. <lb/>
            Wheresoever, indeed, therefore, there does not appear to be <lb/>
            anything subtracted or added, this is the most accurate <lb/>
            measure. Wherefore, the measure of number1 is the most <lb/>
            precise of all measures, for the monad they have posited as in <lb/>
            every way indivisible ; but, in the case of other things, they <lb/>
            imitate a measure of this sort: for from a stadium and a <lb/>
            talent, and that which is invariably greater, would anything <lb/>
            that has been both added and taken away rather escape our <lb/>
            notice, than from that which is less. Wherefore, that from <lb/>
            which, considered as primary, a thing does not admit of <lb/>
            subsisting according to sense, this all men constitute as a <lb/>
            measure, both of things moist and dry, and of gravity and <lb/>
            magnitude; and they imagine that they then know the <lb/>
            quantity of a thing when they happen to know it by means <lb/>
            of this measure. And, therefore, also, motion do <lb/>
            they measure by a simple motion, and one which <lb/>
            and in regard <lb/>
            of motion. <lb/>
            is the most rapid; for this involves the very smallest possible <lb/>
            duration.2 Wherefore, in astronomy a unity of this kind is <lb/>
            a first principle and a measure-for their hypothesis is, that <lb/>
            the motion of the heavens is equable, and that it is of the <lb/>
            utmost velocity; and, in accordance with this, astronomers <lb/>
            adjust the other motions--and in music diesis is adopted as <lb/>
            a measure, because it constitutes the least perceptible sound ;3 <lb/>
            and in the case of vocal sounds it is an element of speech <lb/>
            that is such. And all these things in this way are a certain <lb/>
            one, not in such a manner as that the one is a thing common <lb/>
            to them, but in such a way as has been declared.</p>
          <p>A measure is not, however, invariably one in <lb/>
            number, but sometimes more than one; as, for <lb/>
            instance, two dieses such as are not understood <lb/>
            according to hearing, but are contained in the <lb/>

            down relating <lb/>
            to measure. <lb/>

            more numerous, and the diameter of the square, likewise, is <note type="footnote"> And hence it is that the mathematical sciences are characterised <lb/>

            measured by two things, and this is the case with the side <lb/>
            and with all magnitudes. Thus, therefore, is unity a measure <lb/>
            of all things, because we thereby know those things of which <lb/>
            substance consists, by making a division of it either according <lb/>
            to quantity or according to form; and on this account is <lb/>
            unity indivisible, because the original of everything is that <lb/>
            which is indivisible. But each thing is not indivisible in the <lb/>
            same manner as a foot and the monad; but the latter is <lb/>
            indivisible in every respect, and the former has a tendency <lb/>
            towards things that are indivisible according to sense, as just <lb/>
            now has been remarked ; for, perhaps, everything continuous <lb/>
            is divisible. The measure, however, is always a thing of <lb/>
            a kindred nature; for of magnitudes is magnitude the <lb/>
            measure : and, in regard of an individual thing, length is a <lb/>
            measure of length, breadth of breadth, of vocal sounds voice <lb/>
            is a measure, weight a measure of weight, a monad of monads. <lb/>
            For in this way must we receive this assertion, but not to the <lb/>
            effect that number is a measure of numbers. Although this <lb/>
            ought to be the case, if measure, in like manner, in this case <lb/>
            is to be kindred with what is measured ;1 but he who entertains <lb/>
            this opinion does not think similarly of this instance, but <lb/>
            just as if one would suppose that monads are a measure of <lb/>
            monads, but not a monad; number, however, is a multitude <lb/>
            of monads.</p>
          <p>6. Transferred <lb/>
            meaning of the <lb/>
            word measure.</p>
          <p>And science we pronounce to be the measure <lb/>
            of things and sense, likewise, for this very reason, <lb/>
            because we attain unto some knowledge through <lb/>
            the instrumentality of these, since rather are they measured <lb/>
            than are they standards of measure. But it happens unto us <lb/>
            just as if another were measuring us we should know how <lb/>
            large we were by reason of the cubital measure being extended <lb/>
            over us thus far. Protagoras, however, says that man is the <lb/>
            measure of all things; just as if he should say that one who <lb/>
            possesses scientific knowledge, or who goes through an act of <lb/>
            perception by sense, is a measure, and that this is so with <lb/>
            these because the one possesses sense, but the other scientific <lb/>
            knowledge, which we affirm to be measures of those things <note type="footnote"> I I have added these words to complete the sense. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The remarks following draw our attention to what Bacon would <lb/>

            that are subjects to either one or the other. Doubtless, such <lb/>
            persons, in their assertion of nothing that is extraordinary <lb/>
            appear to say something pertinent to the matter in hand.</p>
          <p>That therefore, indeed, the being or essence of <lb/>

            -and the most important measure-of quantity, and, in the <lb/>
            next place, of quality, this is evident. Now, a measure of <lb/>
            this sort will be of one kind, if it may be indivisible as far <lb/>
            as regards quantity, but of another, if it be so as regards <lb/>
            quality. Wherefore, unity is indivisible either simply or so <lb/>
            tar forth as it is unity.</p>

          <p>BUT as regards Substance and Nature we <lb/>
            must institute an inquiry how they are disposed, <lb/>
            in like manner as in the doubts 2 mooted in the <lb/>
            earlier portions of this work we have taken a <lb/>
            1. Whether <lb/>
            unity is the <lb/>
            very substar <unclear/><lb/>
            of a thing f <lb/>
            review of what unity is, and how one ought to take up his <lb/>
            opinions respecting the same,-whether as though this unity <lb/>
            were to be considered as a certain substance (as both the <lb/>
            Pythagorics3 affirm in the first instance, and Plato subse­ <lb/>
            quently), or rather, whether some nature is subjected to it,. <lb/>
            and in what manner this ought to be more intelligibly <lb/>
            discoursed of, and whether rather is it the case that we <lb/>
            should look at unity from the point of view that some <lb/>
            of the natural philosophers do ? for of those a certain one <lb/>
            says that unity is harmony, but another air, and a third <lb/>
            the Infinite. Now, if it is not possible for any of the uni­ <lb/>
            versals to be substance,4 as has been declared in our disquisi­ <lb/>
            tions concerning substance, and in those concerning entity, <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ούσία</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">φύσις</foreign> are terms that already have been explained- <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>, <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [ BOOK IX. </note> <lb/>
            nor that this very thing be substance so as to be endued <lb/>
            with the capacity of subsisting as a certain one thing separate <lb/>
            from plurality, (for a thing of this kind is what is common, <lb/>
            but alone may be ranked as a category, it is evident, if the­ <lb/>
            foregoing be true, that neither is unity itself a substance, <lb/>
            for entity and unity, in an eminent degree above other things, <lb/>
            are predicated universally of all things. Wherefore, neither <lb/>
            are genera certain natures and substances capable of a <lb/>
            separable subsistence from other things, nor does unity admit <lb/>
            of being a genus, on account of the same causes, through <lb/>
            which neither does unity or substance admit of being a genus. <lb/>
            And, further, in like manner it is expedient that the case <lb/>
            stand in regard of all things. Now, unity and entity are <lb/>
            predicated in an equal number of ways: wherefore, since in <lb/>
            quantities there is a certain unity and a certain nature, and <lb/>
            since, in like manner, both of these reside in quantities, it is <lb/>
            plain that likewise, in general, we must investigate what unity <lb/>
            is, as well as what entity is also; as if it were not sufficient <lb/>
            to determine that this very thing is the nature of it.</p>
          <p>J. Illustrated <lb/>
            by the case of <lb/>
            colours;</p>
          <p>But, unquestionably, in colours, at least, there is <lb/>
            the one colour,-for example, white,—afterwards <lb/>
            the rest appear to be produced from this and black; <lb/>
            but black is a privation of white, as darkness also is of light, <lb/>
            but this is a privation of light. Wherefore, if entities were <lb/>
            colours, entities would constitute a certain number-but of <lb/>
            what ? let me ask—without doubt, manifestly of colours; and <lb/>
            unity would be a certain one thing, as, for example, white. <lb/>
            and of music <lb/>
            and vocal <lb/>
            sounds. <lb/>
            And in like manner, also, if entities were me­ <lb/>
            lodies there would be a number of dieses,1 how­ <lb/>
            ever; but the substance of them would not be <lb/>
            number, and unity would be something the substance of <lb/>
            which would not be unity, but diesis. In like manner, also, <lb/>
            in the case of the elements of sounds, if all entities were <lb/>
            sounds they would constitute the number of the elements, <lb/>
            and unity would be a vocal element; and if entities were <lb/>
            right-lined figures they would constitute the number of <lb/>
            figures, and unity would be a triangle: and the same reason­ <lb/>
            ing stands good, likewise, in the case of the other genera of <lb/>
            things. Wherefore, if also in passive properties, and in <lb/>
            qualities, and in quantities, and in motion, there subsist <note type="footnote"> 1 The Leipsic edition reads this in the singular. </note> <pb n="259"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. III.] </note> <lb/>
            numbers, and a certain one thing in all these, unity would <lb/>
            be both a number of certain things, and it would constitute <lb/>
            a certain entity ; 1 but by no means would this be the sub­ <lb/>
            stance of that thing: and as regards substances the case <lb/>
            must needs be the same; for in like manner is it in the case <lb/>
            of all things. That, therefore, unity in every genus is a sort <lb/>
            of nature, and that this very thing-namely, unity—is2 not <lb/>
            the nature of anything, is evident; but as in colours there is <lb/>
            one colour to be sought for as unity itself, so, also, in sub­ <lb/>
            stances is one substance to be sought for as unity itself.</p>
          <p>But that somehow unity and entity are <lb/>
            equivalent in their meaning is evident from the <lb/>
            fact that unity follows upon the categories in an <lb/>
            equal number of ways with entity, and yet does <lb/>
            3. Unity and <lb/>
            entity equipol­ <lb/>
            lent in mean­ <lb/>
            ing. <lb/>
            not subsist in any of them; as, for example, neither in <lb/>
            quiddity nor in quality, but it subsists in like manner as <lb/>
            entity. And from this fact it follows that there is not any­ <lb/>
            thing different from man additionally predicated in the pre­ <lb/>
            dication of one man, as neither is entity3 anything inde­ <lb/>
            pendent of quiddity, or quality, or quantity, and that the <lb/>
            being of unity is the same thing as the being of some indi­ <lb/>
            vidual thing.</p>

            and plurality. <lb/>
            divisible and what is divisible: for that which has been <lb/>
            divided, or is actually divisible, is styled a certain multitude; <lb/>
            but what is indivisible, or that which has not been di­ <lb/>
            vided, is styled one. Since, therefore, the oppositions are <lb/>
            fourfold,4 and one of these is expressed according to priva­ <lb/>
            tion, there would subsist what is contrary, and neither would <lb/>
            they be denominated as contradictions, nor as things predi- <note type="footnote"> 1 Some copies read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἓν</foreign> instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">δν</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This sentence is not quite intelligible. </note><note type="footnote"> a <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ εἶναι</foreign>, that is, the " esse." </note><note type="footnote"> 4 This subject was examined into by Aristotle in a Treatise <foreign xml:lang="grc">Περὶ <lb/>

            cated relatively. But unity is predicated from its contrary, <lb/>
            and thereby made evident,—viz. that which is indivisible from <lb/>
            that which is divisible,—from the fact that multitude, and that <lb/>
            which is divisible, are rather cognisable by sense than that <lb/>
            which is indivisible. Wherefore, in the definition the multi­ <lb/>
            tude is prior to that which is indivisible by reason of per­ <lb/>
            ception by sense.</p>
          <p>2. Concomi­ <lb/>
            tants of unity, <lb/>
            e.g. sameness, <lb/>
            similarity, and <lb/>
            equality.</p>
          <p>There also belong to unity-as we have likewise <lb/>
            described in our division of contraries1—same­ <lb/>
            ness, and similarity, and equality; but to multi­ <lb/>
            tude belong diversity, and dissimilarity, and in­ <lb/>
            equality. Seeing, however, that sameness is predicated in many <lb/>
            ways, after one mode also-namely, according to number- <lb/>
            subsists that which we denominate occasionally as this, and <lb/>
            after another mode if a thing be one both in definition and in <lb/>
            number; for instance, you are the same with yourself both in <lb/>
            form and matter. Further, are those things said to be the <lb/>
            same to the primary substance of which there may belong one <lb/>
            definition; as, for instance, equal right lines are the same, and <lb/>
            equal and equal-angled quadrangular figures, notwithstanding <lb/>
            that they are many in number; but in these the equality is <lb/>
            unity. And things are said to be similar if they be not the <lb/>
            same simply considered, nor without a difference in regard of <lb/>
            subject-substance, but yet may be the same as regards form ; <lb/>
            for example, the greater square is similar to a less: and so it <lb/>
            is with unequal right lines, for these are similar, no doubt, <lb/>
            but not the same absolutely. And some things are called <lb/>
            similar if they possess the same form wherein reside the more <lb/>
            and less, as properties in generated, while the things themselves <lb/>
            are neither greater nor less. And other things are so styled if <lb/>
            there belong to them the same passive condition, and such as <lb/>
            is one in species; as, for instance, that which is exceedingly <lb/>
            white, and what is so in a less degree, they say that such <lb/>
            are similar because the form of them is one. And other <lb/>
            things are so called if they possess more of sameness than of <lb/>
            diversity, either considered simply, or provided they be more <lb/>
            obvious to perception as possessing such; for instance, tin is <note type="footnote"> 1 For the subject of contrariis, vide the Categories, chap. x.; Topics, <lb/>
            book II. chap. vii. Aristotle is thought to have written a distinct <lb/>
            treatise on contraries, entitled '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ε.κλογὴ τῶν ἐνανίων</foreign>, mentioned in the <lb/>

            more similar to silver than to gold, and gold is similar to fire, <lb/>
            so far forth as it is ruddy and brilliant.</p>
          <p>Wherefore, it is evident that both diversity <lb/>
            and dissimilarity are denominated in many <lb/>
            ways; and that which is another thing is ex­ <lb/>
            pressed in opposition to that which is the same. <lb/>
            3. Concomt­ <lb/>
            tants of plura­ <lb/>
            lity,—dissimi­ <lb/>
            larity,diversity. <lb/>
            and difference. <lb/>
            Wherefore, everything in relation to everything is either the <lb/>
            same or different; but that is said to take place if the matter <lb/>
            and the definition be not one: wherefore, you and your <lb/>
            neighbour are different But a third signification of the <lb/>
            foregoing is when things subsist as in mathematical entities. <lb/>
            Therefore, indeed, on this account, everything of those, as <lb/>
            many as are denominated unity and entity, are so deno­ <lb/>
            minated in reference to everything as different or the same. <lb/>
            For neither is there any contradiction of sameness. Where­ <lb/>
            fore, the assertion is not made in the case of nonentities, but <lb/>
            of all eutities,—the "not-same," however, is predicated of <lb/>
            entities,-for sameness and diversity being constituted by <lb/>
            nature an entity and one thing, are either one or not one. <lb/>
            That, then, which is diversity, and that which is sameness, <lb/>
            are in this way opposed. Difference, however, and diversity <lb/>
            are something else; for it is not requisite that a thing which <lb/>
            is diverse, and that in reference to, or because of which, <lb/>
            a thing is diverse, should be a diverse thing by reason of <lb/>
            something common ;1 for everything whatsoever, in regard <lb/>
            of its being an entity, is either diverse or the same. That, <lb/>
            however, which is different from something is different by <lb/>
            something, or in some respect, so that it is necessary that <lb/>
            something wherein they differ should be the same, and <lb/>
            this something which is thus the same is either genus or <lb/>
            species; for everything that is different differs either in <lb/>
            genus or in species; those things differ in genus of which <lb/>
            neither the matter is common nor their generation into one <lb/>
            another-for instance, take the case of those things of as <lb/>
            many as there is another figure of predication—but things <lb/>
            are different in species of which the genus may be the same, <lb/>
            and that is called a genus in respect of which both of the <lb/>
            things that are different are styled the same according tc <lb/>
            substance. But contraries are things different, and con­ <lb/>
            trariety is a certain difference. <note type="footnote"> 1 Taylor supplies this word. </note> <pb n="262"/>

          <p>And that we have made this foregoing suppo­ <lb/>
            sition correctly is evident from induction; for all <lb/>
            those things that are different their difference is <lb/>

            are diverse; but some things are diverse in genus, but <lb/>
            others are diverse which belong to the same coordination <lb/>
            of predication. Wherefore, also, those same things that are <lb/>
            contained in the same genus are also involved in the same <lb/>
            species. Now, it has been determined in the case of other <lb/>

          <p>1. Contrariety <lb/>
            defined as the <lb/>
            greatest differ­ <lb/>
            ence.</p>
          <p>BUT since it is admissible that things which <lb/>
            are different should differ cne from another <lb/>
            more and less, there is, likewise, a certain greatest <lb/>
            difference; and I mean by this contrariety: and that there <lb/>
            does exist this greatest difference is evident from induc­ <lb/>
            tion. For some things that are different in genus do not <lb/>
            possess a way one towards another, but are distant to a con­ <lb/>
            siderable extent, and are not things that may be compared <lb/>
            together. To those things, however, that differ in species <lb/>
            belong generations that take their rise from contraries as <lb/>
            from extremes, but the last interval is the greatest. Where­ <lb/>
            fore, also, is this the case with that which lies between the con- <lb/>
            2 Deductions <lb/>
            therefrom. <lb/>
            traries. But, surely, this which is the greatest <lb/>
            in each genus, at any rate, is that which is perfect; <lb/>
            for greatest is that of which there is no excess, or superabun­ <lb/>
            dance and finished is that beyond which there is no possi­ <lb/>
            bility of assuming anything, for the perfect difference involves <lb/>
            an end: in like manner as other things are called perfect, or <lb/>
            finished in respect of their involving an end. But to the <lb/>
            end there is nothing extrinsic; for it is the ultimate thing <lb/>
            in everything, and comprises those things of which it is the <lb/>
            end. Wherefore, nothing is extrinsic to the end, nor does <lb/>
            the perfect require anything of the sort. That therefore, <note type="footnote"> I The logical questions discussed in this and the following chapters <lb/>
            would appear somewhat out of place. Perhaps the subject of the <lb/>
            exposition between unity and plurality suggested them to Aristotle's <lb/>
            mind. </note> <pb n="263"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. IV.] </note> <lb/>
            indeed, contrariety constitutes a perfect difference is evident <lb/>
            from these statements. And whereas contraries1 are denomi­ <lb/>
            nated in many ways, subsistence in a perfect manner will follow <lb/>
            in such a way as that the subsistence also of contraries would <lb/>
            be inherent in them. Now, seeing that these things are so, it <lb/>
            is plain that there is no possibility of one thing involving <lb/>
            many contraries; for neither could there be anything more <lb/>
            ultimate, or final, than the extreme, nor of one interval would <lb/>
            there be more than two extremes. And, in general, if con­ <lb/>
            trariety be a difference, yet difference is the difference be­ <lb/>
            tween two things: wherefore, also, this will be the case with <lb/>
            the perfect difference.</p>
          <p>It is necessary, however, that the rest of the <lb/>
            definitions also of the contraries be correct; <lb/>
            for likewise doth the perfect difference evince <lb/>
            the greatest amount of difference: for of things <lb/>
            that differ in genus and in species there is no <lb/>
            possibility of assuming anything that is more <lb/>
            3. The truth of <lb/>
            all definitions <lb/>
            of contraries <lb/>
            dependent on <lb/>
            their being <lb/>
            framed in ac­ <lb/>
            cordance with <lb/>
            the foregoing. <lb/>
            external; for it has been demonstrated that, respecting things <lb/>
            extrinsic to the genus, there subsists not a difference, and of <lb/>
            these this is the greatest difference: and those things that <lb/>
            belong to the same genus, and involve the greatest difference, <lb/>
            are contraries, for the greatest difference of these is the <lb/>
            perfect difference. And those things that involve the <lb/>
            greatest amount of difference in the same recipient are con­ <lb/>
            traries, for there is the same matter for the contraries; and <lb/>
            things that rank under the same potentiality, and involve <lb/>
            the greatest difference, are also contraries; for also the science <lb/>
            is one concerning one genus of those things in which the <lb/>
            perfect difference is the greatest.</p>
          <p>The first or chief contrariety, however, consists <lb/>
            in habit and privation; yet not every privation <lb/>
            (for privation2 is predicated in many ways), but <lb/>
            whatsoever such as may be perfect. And the other <lb/>

            contraries will be denominated according to these, seme, on <lb/>
            the one hand, in respect of possession, and others from action, <lb/>
            or from being fit subjects for action; and, on the other hand, <lb/>
            some in respect of their being recipients, and rejections of <lb/>
            these, or of other contraries. <note type="footnote"> 1 Vide note on contraries, chap. iii. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The term <foreign xml:lang="grc">στέρησις</foreign> is defined in book IV. chap. xxii. </note> <pb n="264"/>

            is not contra­ <lb/>
            diction.</p>
          <p>Now, if they are opposed—I mean, contra­ <lb/>
            diction and privation, and contrariety and rela­ <lb/>
            tions—and if of these contradiction is the <lb/>
            first, and of contradiction there is nothing intermediate <lb/>
            but if of contraries this is admissible, it is evident that <lb/>
            contradiction is not the same thing with contrariety, and <lb/>
            that privation constitutes a certain contradiction; for pri­ <lb/>
            vation belongs either to what is entirely devoid of a capacity <lb/>
            of possessing, or to that which, even though adapted by nature <lb/>
            for possession, may yet not actually possess either entirely <lb/>
            or in a certain definite manner; for we now express this in <lb/>
            many ways, just as the distinctions have been drawn by us <lb/>
            elsewhere. Wherefore, privation is a certain contradiction, <lb/>
            or a defined impotentiality, or one which is conjoined along <lb/>
            with what is receptive. Wherefore, of contradiction there <lb/>
            is not anything that is intermediate; but of a certain <lb/>
            privation there is, for everything is either equal or not <lb/>
            equal; but not everything is equal or unequal, but only if it <lb/>
            be contained in that which is receptive of equality.</p>
          <p>6. Contrariety <lb/>
            is privation, <lb/>
            but not every <lb/>
            privation is <lb/>
            contrariety.</p>
          <p>If, now, there are generations in matter from <lb/>
            contraries, and these are produced either from form <lb/>
            and the habit of the species, or from a certain <lb/>
            privation of the species and of the form, it is evi­ <lb/>
            dent that every contrariety would constitute a certain priva­ <lb/>
            tion, but not every privation, perhaps, would constitute con­ <lb/>
            trariety. And a cause of this is the following: that whatever <lb/>
            is a subject of the privation admits of being a subject of <lb/>
            privation in many ways; for those things from the extremities <lb/>
            of which changes are generated, these are contraries.</p>
          <p>7. The fore­ <lb/>
            going view con­ <lb/>
            firmed from <lb/>
            induction.</p>
          <p>And this is evident, likewise, from induction; <lb/>
            for every contrariety involves a privation of <lb/>
            either of the contraries. Not similarly, however, <lb/>
            is it the case with all things; for inequality is <lb/>
            a privation of equality, but dissimilarity of similarity, and <lb/>
            vice of virtue.1 But there is the same difference as has been <note type="footnote"> I To make evil a mere negation of good is to be expected in a Pagan. <lb/>
            whose mind was in the dark as to those various sources of evil which <lb/>
            our Redeemer has put us on our guard against. Vide Dean Trench'a <lb/>
            "Notes on the Parables," where, in his exposition of the " Parable of <lb/>
            ths Tares," the influence of the Devil, viewed as a personal influence <lb/>
            over frail humanity, is most beautifully extracted from the symbol of <lb/>
            " the tares." </note> <pb n="265"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. V.] </note> <lb/>
            stated; for one thing is a subject of privation if it may <lb/>
            happen to be deprived of anything, but another if it may <lb/>
            be so at any time, or in any subject; as, for example, <lb/>
            would be the case at a certain age either in that which is <lb/>
            the principal age, or altogether so. Wherefore, of some <lb/>
            contraries is there a medium, and there is a man who is <lb/>
            neither good nor evil; but of others there is not a medium, <lb/>
            but a number must needs be either odd or even: further, do <lb/>
            some things involve a definite subject, but others do not. <lb/>
            Wherefore, it is evident that invariably either of the con­ <lb/>
            traries is denominated according to privation: it is sufficient, <lb/>
            however, if there are in existence the primaries and the <lb/>
            genera of contraries; as, for instance, unity and plurality are <lb/>
            styled such, for the rest are referred or reduced to these.</p>

          <p>BuT since one thing is contrary to one thing, <lb/>
            a person would feel perplexed as to how unity <lb/>
            and plurality are opposed, and how the equal is <lb/>
            opposed to the great and the small. For there <lb/>
            is the question whether invariably we speak of <lb/>
            a thing in the way of opposition-for example, <lb/>

            regard of the <lb/>
            mode of oppo­ <lb/>

            equality and <lb/>
            greatness, as <lb/>
            well as equality <lb/>
            and smallness. <lb/>
            whether it is white or black, and whether it is white or not <lb/>
            white-but we do not say whether such is a man or a thing <lb/>
            that is white, unless hypothetically, and in such an inquiry, <lb/>
            as, for instance, whether Cleon came or Socrates ? but there <lb/>
            is no necessity for this inquiry being found in any genus; <lb/>
            but this, likewise, has proceeded from thence. For things in <lb/>
            opposition do not admit of subsisting alone at the same time; <lb/>
            which aforesaid mode of speaking of a thing one employs in <lb/>
            the present instance,—I mean, in the inquiry, which of the <lb/>
            two came first? for if both could do so at the same time, the <lb/>
            question would be ridiculous. And if this were possible <lb/>
            in this way also, in like manner would the person who <note type="footnote"> 1 In this chapter Aristotle, by the mention of the opposition between <lb/>
            unity and plurality, is led into discussions purely logical. The subject <lb/>
            of opposition is treated of in the seventh and following chapters of <lb/>
            Aristotle's Treatise " On Interpretation," and by Archbishop Whately <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [BOOK IX </note> <lb/>
            makes the inquiry fall into opposition, viz. into unity, or <lb/>
            plurality; as, for example, whether both came, or either of <lb/>
            the two ? If, therefore, in things that are opposed the question <lb/>
            whether a thing " is so and so " is to be found inviriably— <lb/>
            now, we speak of a thing as to whether it is greater, or less, <lb/>
            or equal-what opposition is there of equality in respect of <lb/>
            these, for neither is it contrary to either only, nor to both ? <lb/>
            for why should it be contrary to the greater more than to <lb/>
            the less? Further, is the equal contrary to that which is <lb/>
            unequal; wherefore, it will be contrary to more than one. If, <lb/>
            however, inequality signifies the same thing with both of <lb/>
            these at the same time, it would be in opposition to both, <lb/>
            and the doubt renders assistance to those who say that <lb/>
            inequality constitutes the duad; it happens, however, that <lb/>
            one is contrary to two, which is impossible. Moreover, <lb/>
            equality seems to be a medium between the great and the <lb/>
            small; but no contrariety seems to be either of the nature <lb/>
            of a medium, nor from the definition is it a thing possible <lb/>
            that it should; for it would not be perfect if it were a mean <lb/>
            between anything: yet it rather invariably involves some­ <lb/>
            thing that is a medium with respect to itself.</p>
          <p>2. Something <lb/>
            as regards this <lb/>
            opposition.</p>
          <p>It therefore remains that equality be opposed <lb/>
            either as negation or as privation. Now, certainly, <lb/>
            it is not possible that it should be in opposition to <lb/>
            either; for why should it be opposed to the large more than to <lb/>
            the small ? in such,then,there would subsist a privative negation <lb/>
            of both. Wherefore, also, the question " whether " is predicated <lb/>
            in respect of both, but not in respect of either; as we do not <lb/>
            say whether a thing is greater or equal, or whether it is equal <lb/>
            or less; but the question of " whether" invariably subsists in <lb/>
            reference to three things. It does not, however, constitute <lb/>
            privation from necessity; for it does not follow that everything <lb/>
            is equal which is not greater or less: but that takes place in <lb/>
            the case of the things in which those—I mean, the greater or <lb/>
            less—are naturally1 inherent. Now equality is that which is <lb/>
            neither great nor small, but that which by nature is adapted <lb/>
            for becoming great or little; and as privative negation is it <lb/>
            opposed to both. Wherefore, also, it is a thing that is a <note type="footnote"> 1 The discussions in this book of the Metaphysics are illustrative of <lb/>
            the subtlety of the verbal distinctions of the Aristotelians, and, as <lb/>
            some would say, of their inanity also. </note> <pb n="267"/>

            medium; and that which is neither evil nor good is in OPPOSI­ <lb/>
            tion to both, but without a name: for in many ways is each <lb/>
            denominated, and that which is receptive is not one thing, <lb/>
            but rather that which is neither white nor black. Neither, <lb/>
            however, is this styled one thing; but colours are somehow <lb/>
            defined in respect of which this negation is affirmed priva- <lb/>
            tively; for it is requisite that this be either a negation of <lb/>
            white and black, or that it be a thing devoid of colour, or <lb/>
            something else of the sort.</p>
          <p>Wherefore, those persons do not correctly <lb/>
            reprehend our remark on this point who are of <lb/>
            opinion that all things are expressed similarly:1 <lb/>
            wherefore, there will be between a shoe and a <lb/>

            censure incur­ <lb/>

            count of this <lb/>
            opposition <lb/>
            hand something that is a medium which will be neither shoe <lb/>
            nor hand; since, also, that which is neither good nor bad <lb/>
            will be a medium between what is good and what is bad; as <lb/>
            if there were likely to be something intermediate between all <lb/>
            things. It is not, however, necessary that this result should <lb/>
            ensue; for this co-negation of things that are opposed be­ <lb/>
            longs to those things of which there is a certain medium, and <lb/>
            between which a certain interval has been fitted by nature <lb/>
            to exist; but as regards these there is not a difference in <lb/>
            existence, for in another genus are those things to be classed <lb/>
            of which there are co-negations: wherefore, the subject of <lb/>
            them is not one.</p>

          <p>AND, in like manner, also, concerning unity <lb/>
            and plurality a person might express the follow­ <lb/>
            ing doubt. For if plurality be opposed to unity, <lb/>
            absolutely or simply considered, there ensue cer­ <lb/>
            tain consequences that are impossible; for unity <lb/>
            1. Question in <lb/>
            regard of the <lb/>
            mode of opposi­ <lb/>
            tion between <lb/>
            unity and plu­ <lb/>
            rality. <lb/>
            will be a thing that is few in number, or will amount to few <lb/>
            things, for plurality is likewise opposed to the few. Further, <lb/>
            are two things many, since the twofold is manifold; and <lb/>
            to also is two denominated twofold. Wherefore, unity is a <lb/>
            thing that is few in number; for relatively to what are two <note type="footnote"> 1 Notwithstanding all his verbal niceties, Aristotle will not allow <lb/>
            that they are mere distinctions without a difference. </note> <pb n="268"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK IX. </note> <lb/>
            things styled many, unless in reference to unity and fewness ? for <lb/>
            nothing else appears to be less. Further, must this be admitted, <lb/>
            if as what in length are the long and the short, so in multi­ <lb/>
            tude are the much and the few; and whatever may be much <lb/>
            is also many, and the many is also much : unless there is <lb/>
            some difference, then, in a thing that is continuous and easily <lb/>
            defined, fewness will be a certain multitude. Wherefore, will <lb/>
            unity be a certain multitude if, also, it be that which is few. <lb/>
            And this must needs be so if two things are many.</p>
          <p>2. Proposed so­ <lb/>
            lution of this <lb/>
            question.</p>
          <p>But, perhaps, plurality! is styled somehow <lb/>
            also as the much, yet as being a thing that <lb/>
            is different, as water, which is much, but not <lb/>
            many. But in respect of as many things as are divisible <lb/>
            therein subsists the many, or plurality, in one way, if the <lb/>
            multitude involves superabundancy either absolutely or rela­ <lb/>
            tively to something-and, in like manner, it is the case with <lb/>
            fewness, if the multitude should involve deficiency—but, <lb/>
            in another way, plurality subsists as number, which also <lb/>
            alone is opposed to unity. For in this way do we denominate <lb/>
            unity, or plurality, just as if one should say unit and units, <lb/>
            or a white thing and white things, and things that have been <lb/>
            measured in respect of measure, and that which is capable of <lb/>
            being measured. So, also, things which are manifold are de­ <lb/>
            nominated many; for each number is many because it is one,2 <lb/>
            and because each is measurable by one, and as being that <lb/>
            which is opposed to unity, not to fewness. So, indeed, then, <lb/>
            two things are many, likewise; yet they are not so as a mul. <lb/>
            titude involving superabundancy either relatively or absolutely, <lb/>
            but primarily. And two things are simply what are few; for <lb/>
            it is the first multitude which involves deficiency, and two is <lb/>
            the first multitude in number.8</p>
          <p>3. Error of <lb/>
            Anaxagoras on <lb/>
            this point.</p>
          <p>Wherefore, Anaxagoras did not correctly with­ <lb/>
            draw his assent from the current opinion when <lb/>
            he laid down that all things had a subsistence at <lb/>
            the same time,4 and were infinite both in multitude and <note type="footnote"> 1 Vide book XII. chap. ix. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Some copies have <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕνα</foreign> and some <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑνός</foreign>. I have followed the former <lb/>

            smallness ; but he ought to have said, instead of this expres­ <lb/>
            sion, that things were infinite both in smallness and paucity , <lb/>
            for paucity or fewness does not constitute infinity, since few­ <lb/>
            ness does not subsist on account of unity, as some philosophers <lb/>
            would make out, but through duality.</p>
          <p>Unity, therefore, and plurality, such as are to <lb/>
            be found in numbers, are opposed in the way a <lb/>
            measure is opposed to that which is measurable; <lb/>
            and these things are opposed as those that are <lb/>
            4. The opposi­ <lb/>
            tion between <lb/>
            unity and <lb/>
            plurality. <lb/>
            relative to something mean, as many things of those <lb/>
            that are relative as do not involve an essential subsistence. <lb/>
            Now, a distinction has been drawn by us elsewhere,1 to the <lb/>
            effect that relatives are predicated in a twofold way,-partly <lb/>
            as contraries, and partly as scientific knowledge is related <lb/>
            to that which may be made an object of science, because <lb/>
            something else is predicated with respect to them. But that <lb/>
            the one may be less than a certain thing-as, for example, <lb/>
            than two-there is no hindrance to this being the case; for <lb/>
            though it be less, it does not follow that it also be what is <lb/>
            few in number. Multitude, however, is, as it were, the genus <lb/>
            of number, for number constitutes multitude, which is mea­ <lb/>
            surable by one: and unity and number are, in a manner, <lb/>
            opposed,-not as a thing that is contrary, but, as has been <lb/>
            stated, as some of those things that are relatives; for as far <lb/>
            forth as unity is a measure, and number that which may be <lb/>
            measured, thus far are they opposed to each other. Where­ <lb/>
            fore, not everything that may be one constitutes number; <lb/>
            as, for example, on the supposition that there is anything <lb/>
            that is indivisible.</p>
          <p>But though science is denominated in like <lb/>
            manner in relation to that which may be made <lb/>

            tion illustrated. <lb/>
            an object of scientific knowledge, it is not yet similarly <lb/>
            attributed as such; for science would appear to be a mea­ <lb/>
            sure, but that which may be an object of science woull <lb/>
            appear as that which is being measured.2 It happens, how­ <lb/>
            ever, that every science is a thing fit to be an object of <lb/>
            scientific knowledge; yet everything that is an object of <lb/>
            science is not a science, because, in a certain respect, is science <note type="footnote"> 1 The subject of relation is fully examined into in book IX. chap xv. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This illustration is worthy of our attention. </note> <pb n="270"/>

            measured by that which may be made an object of scientific <lb/>
            inquiry.</p>
          <p>6. Multitude <lb/>
            not opposed to <lb/>
            the few.</p>
          <p>But neither is multitude contrary to fewness; <lb/>
            but the much is opposed to this as a multitude <lb/>
            which is excessive is opposed to a multitude that <lb/>
            is exceeded. Nor is multitude contrary to unity altogether; <lb/>
            but in respect of unity the case stands just as has been <lb/>
            stated, namely, that one sort is divisible, but another indi­ <lb/>
            visible, and again, a third subsists as a relative, just as science <lb/>
            subsists with respect to what may be made an object of <lb/>
            science, on the supposition that science constituted number, <lb/>
            and that unity were a measure.</p>

          <p>1. The relation <lb/>
            between media <lb/>
            and contraries.</p>
          <p>AND since between contraries there is a possi­ <lb/>
            bility of there being something that is a medium, <lb/>
            -and of some there is a medium,—it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary that media should derive their being from contraries ; <lb/>
            for all media, and the things of which they are media, are <lb/>
            contained in the same genus. For we denominate those <lb/>
            things media into whatsoever a thing that is undergoing a <lb/>
            change must needs be changed in the first instance; foi <lb/>
            example, if one should pass from the hypate to the nete,2 if <lb/>
            the transition be made in a short space of time, he will pre­ <lb/>
            viously reach the intermediate sounds; and the case is the <lb/>
            same in colours,-if one will pass from white to black, he will <lb/>
            come to the purple and that which is duskish previously to <lb/>
            his reaching what is black: and in like manner is it with <lb/>
            other things. But that a change should take place from one <lb/>
            genus to another genus is not possible, except according to <lb/>
            accident; as, for instance, in a transition from colour into <lb/>
            figure. It is requisite, then, that media, and the things of <lb/>
            which they are media, should be contained in the same <lb/>
            genus also with themselves. <note type="footnote"> 1 The student will do well to compare the statements in this chapter <lb/>
            with those in chap. x., and in book XI. chap. x. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 These terms have been already explained in a note, in bock IV <lb/>

            </note>But, unquestionably, is it the case that all media are, at any rate, media of certain things that are <lb/>
            opposed; for from these alone is it possible should <lb/>
            2. All media <lb/>
            presuppose op­ <lb/>
            position. <lb/>
            arise a change that is essential. Wherefore, it is impossible <lb/>
            that there should subsist any medium of things that are not <lb/>
            opposed; for otherwise would there be a change, and that <lb/>
            not from things that are opposed. But there is no medium <lb/>
            of contradiction in things that are opposed, for this consti­ <lb/>
            tutes contradiction, and amounts to antithesis or opposition; <lb/>
            and to an opposition of which, in any respect whatever, one of <lb/>
            the members is present, having no medium1 between that of <lb/>
            which, in any respect, either of the members-the yes or the <lb/>
            no-is present, or, in other words, not having any medium <lb/>
            at all. But of the rest some are relatives, but others are <lb/>
            privation, and some are contraries. But as many things <lb/>
            belonging to those that are relatives as are not contraries do <lb/>
            not involve a medium. And a cause of this is the following, <lb/>
            inasmuch as they are not contained in the same genus; for <lb/>
            what is there that is a medium between science and that <lb/>
            which may be made an object of scientific knowledge ? but <lb/>
            there is a medium between the great and the small.</p>
          <p>Now, if media are contained in the same genus, <lb/>
            as has been demonstrated, and are media be­ <lb/>
            tween things that are contrary, it is necessary <lb/>
            that these, likewise, be compounded of these con- <lb/>
            3. Media com­ <lb/>
            posed of con­ <lb/>
            traries proved <lb/>
            in three ways. <lb/>
            traries; for either will there be a certain genus of them, <lb/>
            or there will not be any such. And if there will be a <lb/>
            genus of them in such a way as that there be something <lb/>
            antecedent to the contraries, those contrary differences will <lb/>
            be antecedent which may make the contraries as species of <lb/>
            genus: for from genus and differences subsist species; for <lb/>
            example, if white and black be contraries, and the one <lb/>
            is a segregative colour, but the other a congregative colour, <lb/>
            these actual differences—I mean, discretive and syncre­ <lb/>
            tive colours-will have an antecedent subsistence. Where­ <lb/>
            fore, these contraries involve a subsistence prior to one <lb/>
            another; but, surely, contraries, at any rate, that are dif­ <lb/>
            ferent are contraries in preference. And the other things <lb/>
            and the media will arise from genus and differences; as, for <note type="footnote"> 1 The words which follow <foreign xml:lang="grc">ούδὲν μεταξὺ</foreign> are not found in all the MSS. <lb/>

            these it is necessary should be denominated as consisting from <lb/>
            venus, (but colour is a genus,) and from certain differences. <lb/>
            They themselves, however, will not constitute primary con­ <lb/>
            traries ; and if this be not the case, everything will be either <lb/>
            white or black. These, then, are other colours ; accordingly, <lb/>
            these will be the media between primary contraries: primary <lb/>
            differences, however, are those which are segregative and con­ <lb/>
            gregative. Wherefore, in regard of these primaries (as many <lb/>
            as are contraries not in genus), we must investigate the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing point,-from what the media of these consist; for it <lb/>
            is necessary that things contained in the same genus should <lb/>
            be compounded either of things incomposite in that genus, <lb/>
            or that they should be incomposite natures. Therefore, are <lb/>
            contraries uncompounded one of another, so that they are <lb/>
            first principles; but the media constitute either all things or <lb/>
            not any at all: and from things contrary something is gene­ <lb/>
            rated. Wherefore, there will ensue a change into this pre­ <lb/>
            viously to a change into contraries; for of each thing will <lb/>
            there be both less and more: accordingly, will there subsist <lb/>
            a medium, and this a medium between contraries. And all <lb/>
            the other things that are media are composites then; for that <lb/>
            which is a medium is more than one thing and less than <lb/>
            another, and is in a manner compounded of those things of <lb/>
            which it is said to consist,-as greater than one of them and <lb/>
            less than the other. And since, as regards contraries, things <lb/>
            that have an antecedent existence are not homogeneous, all <lb/>
            media would arise from contraries; wherefore, both all things <lb/>
            to be found in the scale of existence downwards, and con­ <lb/>
            traries and media, will consist from primary contraries.</p>
          <p>4. Recapitula­ <lb/>
            tion.</p>
          <p>That, indeed, therefore, the media are all con­ <lb/>
            tained in the same genus, and that they are <lb/>
            media between contrary and that these media are all com­ <lb/>
            posed of contraries, this is evident.</p><pb n="273"/>

          <p>DIVERSITY, however, in species is a something <lb/>
            that is diverse from a certain thing; and this <lb/>
            must needs subsist in both; as, for instance, if <lb/>
            animal were a thing diverse in species, both <lb/>
            1. Diversity <lb/>
            according to <lb/>
            species apper­ <lb/>
            tains to con­ <lb/>
            trariety. <lb/>
            would be animals: it is necessary, then, that in the same genus <lb/>
            there be contained those things that are diverse in species. <lb/>
            For by genus I mean a thing of such a sort as that by which <lb/>
            both are styled one and the same thing, not involving a dif­ <lb/>
            ference according to accident, whether subsisting as matter or <lb/>
            after a mode that is different from matter; for not only is it <lb/>
            necessary that a certain thing that is common be inherent in <lb/>
            them, (for instance, that both should be animals,) but also <lb/>
            that this very thing-namely, animal-should be diverse from <lb/>
            both : for example, that the one should be horse but the <lb/>
            other man. Wherefore, this common characteristic simul­ <lb/>
            taneously is found in things that are different in species from <lb/>
            one another: therefore, this will be such a particular animal <lb/>
            essentially, and that will be an animal essentially different; <lb/>
            as that will be a horse and this a man. It is necessary, <lb/>
            accordingly, that this difference should amount to a diversity <lb/>
            of genus; for I term a difference of genus diversity which <lb/>
            makes this very thing to be diverse: therefore, will this con­ <lb/>
            stitute contrariety.</p>
          <p>And the same is evident from induction, like­ <lb/>
            wise ; for all things are distinguished by things <lb/>
            2. Proof of this <lb/>
            from induction. <lb/>
            that are opposite: and it has been demonstrated that con­ <lb/>
            traries are contained in the same genus, for contrariety <lb/>
            amounts to perfect difference, and every difference which is <lb/>
            contained in a species is something belonging to a certain <lb/>
            thing. Wherefore is this both the same and a genus in both : <lb/>
            wherefore, also, all contraries are contained in the same co­ <lb/>
            ordination of predication, as many as are different in species <lb/>
            and not in genus, and diverse particularly one from another; <lb/>
            for perfect is the difference between them, and they are not <lb/>
            generated simultaneously with one another. Difference, then, <lb/>
            amounts to contrariety, for this constitutes what it is to be <note type="footnote"> 1 The inquiries in this chapter obviously belong to the province of <lb/>

            diverse in species; namely, for things to involve contrariety <lb/>
            when they are contained in the same genus,-things, I say, <lb/>
            that are individual. Now, things are the same in species—as <lb/>
            many as do not involve contrariety—when they are individual <lb/>
            existences; for in division and in media are contrarieties gene­ <lb/>
            rated, before one comes to those things that are individual.</p>
          <p>3. Inference <lb/>
            from the fore­ <lb/>
            going.</p>
          <p>Wherefore, it is evident that respecting that <lb/>
            which is said to be a genus, neither the same ncr <lb/>
            diverse in species is any of those things which are <lb/>
            adapted for being species as of a genus ; for matter is made <lb/>
            manifest by negation, and genus is the matter of that of which <lb/>
            it is termed a genus-not as the genus of the Heracleids,l but <lb/>
            as that which subsists in Nature. Nor is genus denominated <lb/>
            in relation to those that are not contained in the same genus, <lb/>
            but in relation to those of which there will be a difference <lb/>
            from them in genus; and things differing in species differ <lb/>
            from those that are in the same genus : for the difference of <lb/>
            that from which it is a difference in species must needs be <lb/>
            contrariety, and contrariety belongs to those things that are <lb/>
            alone in the same genus.</p>

          <p>1. Why contra­ <lb/>
            ries may belong <lb/>
            to the same <lb/>
            species.</p>
          <p>BUT, perhaps, one would raise the question, <lb/>
            why woman does not differ from man in species, <lb/>
            when the female and male are contraries, and <lb/>
            when contrariety amounts to difference? But <lb/>
            neither are female and male diverse in species, although they <lb/>
            are the essential differences of animal, and are not as white­ <lb/>
            ness or blackness, but the male and female are inherent in <lb/>
            animal, so far forth as it is animal. Now, the following doubt <lb/>
            is almost the same as the foregoing-namely, why it is that <lb/>
            contrariety partly makes things diverse in species, and partly <lb/>
            does not so; for example, why does it make that which has <note type="footnote"> 1 The Heracleidæ were the descendants of Hercules, and lords of <lb/>
            Peloponnesus. Their place in the history of Greece, and the story of <lb/>

            alluded to-they are pretty generally known. The best account of the <lb/>
            Heracleidæ is to be found in C. 0. Müller’s History and Antiquities <lb/>

            the support of feet, and that which is furnished with wings so, <lb/>
            but does not make whiteness and blackness ? Is <lb/>
            this the case because some things are the proper <lb/>
            affections of genus, and other things are less so; <lb/>
            2. Proposed <lb/>
            solution there­ <lb/>
            of. <lb/>
            and since the one is form and the other is matter, as many <lb/>
            contrarieties as are contained in form create a difference in <lb/>
            species, and as many as reside in form, when assumed together <lb/>
            with matter, do not give rise to a specific difference ?</p>
          <p>Wherefore, whiteness does not give rise to a <lb/>
            difference of man, nor blackness; nor are these <lb/>
            the specific difference of a white man in relation <lb/>
            to a black man, nor would one name be assigned <lb/>
            3. Illustrated in <lb/>
            the case of <lb/>
            whiteness and <lb/>
            blackness in a <lb/>
            man. <lb/>
            to both; for man is as matter, but matter does not create <lb/>
            a difference : for men are not forms1 of man. For this reason, <lb/>
            although the flesh and bones are diverse from which this <lb/>
            man and that are made, yet the entire compound is a thing <lb/>
            that is diverse, to be sure, but not different in species, because <lb/>
            contrariety does not exist in reason or form, but this entire <lb/>
            compound is an individual thing. Now, Callias is form in <lb/>
            conjunction2 with matter; and this, therefore, is the case <lb/>
            with white man,—because Callias is white, therefore man is <lb/>
            white according to accident. Neither, doubtless, do a brazen <lb/>
            and wooden circle, nor a brazen triangle and wooden circle, <lb/>
            differ in species on account of matter, but because contrariety <lb/>
            is present in the form.</p>
          <p>But whether shall we say that matter does not <lb/>
            render things diverse in species, though being <lb/>
            somehow diverse itself, or is it the case that it <lb/>
            makes them so partly ? for why is this horse <lb/>
            4. Further illus­ <lb/>
            tration in the <lb/>
            case of horse <lb/>
            and man com­ <lb/>
            pared together. <lb/>
            diverse from this man in species, and yet the forms of these <lb/>
            subsist along with matter ? Is it because contrariety is in­ <lb/>
            herent in the form ? for there is obviously a contrariety sub­ <lb/>
            sisting between a white man and a black horse. And this, at <lb/>
            any rate, is a specific difference, but not so far forth as the one <lb/>
            is white and the other black; since even if both were white, <lb/>
            nevertheless in species they would be diverse. But the male <lb/>
            and female are appropriate affections of animal; but not ac­ <lb/>
            cording to substance, but in matter and body. Wherefore, <note type="footnote"> 1 Some copies read <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἵδη</foreign>, and others <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἵδει</foreign> ; the Leipsic edition <lb/>

            and incorrup­ <lb/>
            tibles.</p>
          <p>Already, indeed, therefore, have we declared <lb/>
            our sentiments respecting these universal appel­ <lb/>
            lations.2 So that it would not appear to be <lb/>
            necessary that anything whatsoever that is in­ <lb/>
            corruptible and corruptible should be diverse in species; as <lb/>
            neither white and black should be so. For it is admis­ <lb/>
            sible that the same thing at the same time should be both <lb/>
            corruptible and incorruptible, if there may be in subsist­ <lb/>
            ence aught of things that are universal, as man would be <lb/>
            both white and black; and the case is similar with the mode <lb/>
            of the subsistence of singulars, for the same man would not <lb/>
            be white and black at the same time, although what is <lb/>
            white is contrary to what is black. Of contraries, however, <lb/>
            some according to accident are inherent in certain things; <lb/>
            for instance, those that have been just now mentioned, and <lb/>
            many others: but in the case of others this is impossible—I <lb/>
            mean, those to which both that which is corruptible and <lb/>
            that which is incorruptible belong; for nothing is cor­ <lb/>
            ruptible according to accident: for that which is accidental <lb/>
            admits of not being; but that which is corruptible belongs to <lb/>
            those things which subsist of necessity in those things in <lb/>
            which it is inherent, or that which is corruptible will be one <note type="footnote"> 1 Vide book IV. chaps. xii. and xxii. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 I presume Aristotle alludes to his investigation in the second book, <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH I.] </note> <lb/>
            and the same thing with that which is incorruptible, if what <lb/>
            is corruptible admits of not being inherent therein. Either, <lb/>
            then, substantially, or as inherent in substance, must that <lb/>
            which is corruptible subsist in each of the things that are <lb/>
            corruptible. But there is the same reasoning, likewise, ap­ <lb/>
            plicable to the case of that which is incorruptible;1 for both <lb/>
            belong to things that possess a necessary existence. So far <lb/>
            forth, therefore, as one is primarily corruptible, and the other <lb/>
            primarily incorruptible, so far are they in opposition to each <lb/>
            other ; so that they must needs be generically diverse.</p>
          <p>It is evident, therefore, that it is not possible <lb/>
            that there be such forms as some affirm; for in <lb/>
            such a case, as regards man, there will be one <lb/>

            throws the <lb/>
            ideal theory. <lb/>

            forms are said to be the same in species with certain parti­ <lb/>
            culars, and not equivocal in respect of them: things that <lb/>
            are diverse in genus, however, are at a wider interval from <lb/>
            one another than those that are diverse in species.</p>

          <p>THAT, indeed, Wisdom is a certain science <lb/>

            to suppose Wisdom or Ontology to constitute one science <lb/>

            stances. Further, the question arises as to whether demon­ <lb/>
            stration 2 is conversant about substances only, or also about <lb/>
            accidents ? for if demonstration be conversant, at least, about <lb/>
            accidents, it is not conversant about substances. But if there <lb/>
            is one demonstrative3 science about accidents, and another <lb/>
            about substances, what, may I ask, is the character of both, and <lb/>
            which of the two constitutes Wisdom or Metaphysics? for <lb/>
            demonstrative wisdom is that which is conversant with acci <lb/>
            dents; that, however, which is conversant with first principles <lb/>
            is the wisdom that takes cognisance of substances.</p>

            at present under investigation as a science re­ <lb/>
            specting the causes that have been already <lb/>
            enumerated in our treatise on Physics. For neither should <lb/>
            we act thus in regard of " the final cause;” for a thing of this <lb/>
            kind is that which is good: and this resides in practical things, <lb/>
            and in those entities that .are in motion; and this imparts <lb/>
            motion in the first instance, for the end is a thing of this <lb/>
            sort: but the imparter of motion in the first instance does <lb/>
            not inhere in those things that are incapable of motion. <note type="footnote"> 1 Although most of the subjects treated of in this book have been <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin"> CH. I.] </note> And, in general, one feels doubtful as to <lb/>
            whether the science now under investigation is <lb/>
            conversant about sensible substances at all,1 or <lb/>
            not about these, but about certain other sub- <lb/>
            3. What is its <lb/>
            subject-matter <lb/>
            -is it forms, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ <lb/>
            εἴδη</foreign> f <lb/>
            stances ? for if metaphysical science be conversant with sub­ <lb/>
            stances different from those cognisable to the senses, it will <lb/>
            be conversant either with forms or mathematical entities. <lb/>
            As regards forms, then, it is evident that they have no exist­ <lb/>
            ence. But, nevertheless, one would feel doubtful, even though <lb/>
            he should admit the existence of these forms,2 why, forsooth, <lb/>
            as in the case of mathematical entities, the same truth does <lb/>
            not hold good in regard of other things of which there are <lb/>
            forms? Now, I say that they have placed mathematical <lb/>
            entities, no doubt, as intermediate between forms and things <lb/>
            cognisant by sense, as it were3 certain third natures beside <lb/>
            both forms and those things that are here—I mean, sensibles <lb/>
            -but there is no third man, nor a third horse, beside both <lb/>
            actual man, and actual horse, and singulars. And if, on <lb/>
            the other hand, these mathematical entities do not subsist <lb/>
            in the manner they affirm, about what sort of entities are we <lb/>
            to assert that the mathematician is engaged ? for, surely, <lb/>
            he is not engaged about those things that are here,­ <lb/>
            that is, about sensibles,—for none of these constitutes the <lb/>
            description of entity which the mathematical sciences investi­ <lb/>
            gate. Neither, certainly, is the science now under <lb/>
            investigation — I mean, Metaphysics—conversant <lb/>
            about mathematical entities,4 for no one of these <lb/>
            or, is it mathe­ <lb/>
            matical enti­ <lb/>
            ties ? <lb/>
            possesses a separable subsistence. Nor, however, is it a <lb/>
            science belonging to substances cognisant by the senses, for <lb/>
            these are corruptible. And, in short, one would feel doubtful <lb/>
            as to what sort of a science 5 belongs the investigation of the <lb/>
            matter of mathematical entities; for neither does it belong to <note type="footnote">1 This, in fact, might be set down as the chief point which Aristotle <lb/>

            things that contain in themselves the first principle of motion <lb/>

            that institutes an inquiry respecting both demonstration and <lb/>
            scientific knowledge ; for respecting this very genus it creates <lb/>
            for itself an investigation. It remains, therefore, that this <lb/>
            proposed Philosophy of Ontology, or Metaphysics, should <lb/>
            make these a subject of its inquiry.</p>

          <p>And, again, one would feel doubtful as to <lb/>
            whether it is requisite to consider the science <lb/>
            under investigation in the present Treatise as <lb/>
            conversant about first principles—I mean, such <lb/>
            as by some speculators are denominated elements ? These, <lb/>
            however, have been regarded by all philosophers as things <lb/>
            that are inherent in composite natures. But it would rather <lb/>
            appear to be a thing that is necessary that the science of <lb/>
            ontology, under investigation at present, ought to be con­ <lb/>
            versant with universals; for every rational principle, and <lb/>
            every science, are conversant about universals, and not about <lb/>
            the extremes of things. Wherefore, in this case ontology <lb/>
            would be conversant about primary genera.</p>
          <p>5. The TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅν</foreign> <lb/>
            and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἕν</foreign> <lb/>
            fall under its <lb/>
            notice as pri­ <lb/>
            mary genera.</p>
          <p>And these would constitute both entity and <lb/>
            unity ; for these especially would be supposed to <lb/>
            comprise all existences, and in the most eminent <lb/>
            degree to be assimilated unto first principles, on <lb/>
            account of their being classed in the category of things that <lb/>
            derive their primary existence from Nature : for when these <lb/>
            have been corrupted, other things also are corrupted at the <lb/>
            same time along with them; for everything amounts to entity <lb/>
            and unity. As far forth, however, as it is necessary that <lb/>
            differential qualities participate of these, if one will admit <lb/>
            the subsistence of these genera,-now no difference parti­ <lb/>
            cipates in the genus,-thus far, likewise, would it appear that <lb/>
            we ought not to establish these either as genera or first prin­ <lb/>
            ciples. But, further, on the supposition that that which is <lb/>
            more simple is more a first principle than that which is less <lb/>
            simple, but the extremes of those things that descend from <lb/>
            the genus are more simple than the genera,-for these are <lb/>
            individuals, whereas the genera are divided into numerous <note type="footnote"> 1 Vide book II. chap. iii, and book XII. chap. x. </note> <pb n="281"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. II.] </note> <lb/>
            species and such as are different,-hence species would ap­ <lb/>
            pear to be a first principle more than genera. As far forth, <lb/>
            however, as species are liable to corruption in conjunction with <lb/>
            their genera, the genera rather would seem to be more similar <lb/>
            to first principles ; for that which brings about the destruction <lb/>
            of other things in conjunction with itself is a first principle.</p>
          <p>These, then, and other such points are some of those <lb/>
            questions that involve matter of doubt.</p>

          <p>FURTHER, may the question be raised as to <lb/>
            whether it is expedient to admit the existence of <lb/>
            something besides1 and independent of singulars, <lb/>
            or not ? but the science now under investigation <lb/>
            1. Is there any. <lb/>
            thing subsist­ <lb/>
            ing separable <lb/>
            from singulars? <lb/>
            is conversant with these. These are, however, infinite. Those <lb/>
            things, at any rate, which have a subsistence independent <lb/>
            of and beside singulars are, without doubt, either genera or <lb/>
            species; but the science at present under investigation is not <lb/>
            a science conversant about either of these; for the reason <lb/>
            why this is impossible has been already stated. For in <lb/>
            general, likewise, doth the following question involve a doubt- <lb/>
            namely, as to whether it is necessary to suppose the existence <lb/>
            of any substance separable from sensible substances and those <lb/>
            which are here,2 or whether this is not the case ? but shall we <lb/>
            say that these sensible things are entities, and that Wisdom is <lb/>
            conversant about these ? for the fact is we seem to investigate <lb/>
            some different science ; and this stands forth as the point pro­ <lb/>
            posed by us for investigation. Now, what I mean is this, <lb/>
            that our aim is to discover whether there is anything that <lb/>
            essentially involves a separable subsistence, and which does <lb/>
            not reside in any nature belonging to those objects that are <lb/>
            cognisant by the senses ?</p>
          <p>But, further, allowing that there is beside <lb/>
            sensible substances any different substance, what <lb/>
            sort of sensibles are those beside which it is <lb/>
            2. If so, what <lb/>
            sort are these <lb/>
            singulars ? <note type="footnote">1 This subject is discussed at intervals throughout the whole <lb/>
            Treatise; vide, e.g., book V. chap. i. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This, I take it, means the objects with which we are conversant in <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [BOOK X. </note> <lb/>
            requisite to establish the subsistence of this substance ? for <lb/>
            why should one seek to establish its existence beside men <lb/>
            rather than horses, or beside these in preference to the rest <lb/>
            of the animal creation, or in general to inanimate things like­ <lb/>
            wise ? Notwithstanding, the providing of different substances <lb/>
            eternal in duration, equal in amount to substances that are <lb/>
            cognisant by sense and subject to decay, would appear, per­ <lb/>
            haps, to fall outside the province of the rational1 sciences.</p>
          <p>3. The absurd­ <lb/>
            ity of thin king <lb/>
            that there is <lb/>
            nothing capable <lb/>
            of a separable <lb/>
            subsistence.</p>
          <p>If, however, the first principle now under <lb/>
            investigation be not separable from bodies, <lb/>
            what other would one admit as existing in pre­ <lb/>
            ference to matter ? This, however, does not <lb/>
            involve a subsistence in energy, indeed, but in <lb/>
            capacity. Rather would species and form seem to be a first <lb/>
            principle in a stricter sense of the word than this. Now, this <lb/>
            is a thing that is subject to corruption: wherefore, in short, <lb/>
            there does not subsist an eternal substance that involves <lb/>
            a separable existence as well as an essential subsistence. But <lb/>
            such a position as this is absurd ;2 for it appears to be the <lb/>
            fact-and such are the subjects of inquiry at the hands nearly <lb/>
            of all those that are most accomplished philosophers-that <lb/>
            there is in subsistence a certain first principle and substance <lb/>
            of this description; for how, let me ask,3 will there prevail <lb/>
            order on the supposition that there is no subsistence of that <lb/>
            which is eternal, and which involves a separable existence, <lb/>
            and is permanent ?</p>
          <p>4. If there is <lb/>
            something that <lb/>
            is separable, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">χωρίστον</foreign>, does <lb/>
            it bear the <lb/>
            same relation <lb/>
            to things cor­ <lb/>
            ruptible as to <lb/>
            those that are <lb/>
            Incorruptible ?</p>
          <p>But, further, admitting that there is a certain <lb/>
            substance, and first principle, naturally of such <lb/>
            a description as we are at present investigating, <lb/>
            and this one principle belongs to all things, and <lb/>
            the same is the principle of those things that are <lb/>
            eternal, and those that are corruptible, the <lb/>
            question, in such a case, arises, why, on the sup­ <lb/>
            position of the existence of the same first prin- <note type="footnote">1 It is Aristotle's aim in this Treatise to combat such an erroneous <lb/>
            view as regards the subdivision of the sciences. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Could any words give stronger proof of the transcendental element <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. II.] </note> <lb/>
            ciple, some things are eternal1 amongst those that may be <lb/>
            ranked under this first principle, but others are not eternal ? <lb/>
            for this constitutes the absurdity. If, however, there is <lb/>
            one first principle of things that are corruptible, and another <lb/>
            of those that are eternal,—if, indeed, the principle, likewise, <lb/>
            of those that are corruptible be eternal,—we shall be involved <lb/>
            in similar perplexity; for why, on the supposition of the <lb/>
            existence of an eternal first principle, are not those things <lb/>
            that may be classed as effects under this first principle <lb/>
            eternal likewise? and, on the supposition of the existence of <lb/>
            a corruptible first principle, there arises a certain other prin­ <lb/>
            ciple of this, and again a different one of that; and so this <lb/>
            progression of causes goes on to infinity.</p>
          <p>But if, on the other hand, one will seek to <lb/>
            establish the existence of both entity and unity,2 <lb/>
            as those things that appear in the most eminent <lb/>
            5. Are entity <lb/>
            and unity first <lb/>
            principles ? <lb/>
            degree to be immovable first principles, in the first place,, <lb/>
            unless each of them signifies this certain particular thing and <lb/>
            substance, how will they involve a separate subsistence, and <lb/>
            an essential one? But it is respecting those eternal and <lb/>
            original first principles of this description that we are engaged <lb/>
            in our investigations in the present Treatise. Nevertheless, <lb/>
            supposing both of them to signify this certain particular <lb/>
            thing, and substance, all the entities will be substances;3 for <lb/>
            entity is predicated of all things, and unity, also, of some. <lb/>
            That all entities, however, are substances is an assertion that <lb/>
            is false.</p>
          <p>But, further, how can the position of those be <lb/>
            true who make out that unity is the first prin­ <lb/>
            ciple, and that this constitutes substance, and <lb/>
            who from unity and matter generate the first <lb/>
            6. The dogma <lb/>
            that unity con­ <lb/>
            stitutes sub­ <lb/>
            stance. <lb/>
            number, and say that it is the substance of these,-how, I say, <lb/>
            does this assertion of theirs admit of being true? for how is <lb/>
            it requisite intellectually to apprehend, as one, the duad and <lb/>
            each of the other compound numbers? for on this point <lb/>
            they neither say anything, nor would it be easy to make <lb/>
            any assertion on the subject. Suppose, however, that any <lb/>
            one will seek to establish, as first principles, lines, or the <lb/>
            things that are connected consequentially with these—now, I <note type="footnote"> 1 This question is discussed in book II. chap. iv. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Vide book II. chap. ii. </note><note type="footnote">3 Some copies read, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>. </note> <pb n="284"/>

            mean, surfaces such as are primary—yet these are not sub­ <lb/>
            stances capable of a separate subsistence, but are sections <lb/>
            and divisions; the former of surfaces, but the latter of <lb/>
            bodies: but points are sections and divisions of lines; and, <lb/>
            further, they are the limits of these very same things, and all <lb/>
            these are inherent in others, and there is no one of them that <lb/>
            is separable. Further, in what way is it necessary for us to <lb/>
            conceive the existence of a substance of unity and of a point ? <lb/>
            For of every substance is there generation, but of a point <lb/>
            there is not, for a point amounts to division.</p>
          <p>7. How, then, is <lb/>
            there a science <lb/>
            of substance if <lb/>
            it is not what is <lb/>
            universal ?</p>
          <p>And this, likewise, furnishes a subject of doubt; <lb/>
            namely, that every science should be conver­ <lb/>
            sant about things that are universal,1 and about <lb/>
            that which is of such and such a quality, but <lb/>
            that substance should not belong to things Universal, but <lb/>
            rather should constitute this certain particular thing, and <lb/>
            that which possesses a separable subsistence. Wherefore, it <lb/>
            we admit that science is conversant about first principles, <lb/>
            how is it necessary to consider substance as the first prin­ <lb/>
            ciple of things ?</p>
          <p>8. Is there any­ <lb/>
            thing beside <lb/>
            entirety the <lb/>
            TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">σύνολον</foreign> ?</p>
          <p>Further, the question may be asked, is there <lb/>
            anything beside entirety, or not ? now, I mean by <lb/>
            entirety, matter, and that which subsists in con­ <lb/>
            junction with this; for if, in fact, this be not <lb/>
            the case, all things, at least, that reside in matter are subject <lb/>
            to corruption. If, however, there subsists anything beside <lb/>
            entirety, it would constitute the species and the form.2 In <lb/>
            the case of what things, therefore, this would subsist, and in <lb/>
            the case of what things it would not, it would be difficult to <lb/>
            determine; for in the case of some things is it evident that <lb/>
            the form is not a thing that is capable of a separate subsist­ <lb/>
            ence : as, for example, the form of a house is not separable <lb/>
            from the house. And, further, there is the question whether <lb/>
            first principles are the same in species, or in number ? for if <lb/>
            they are one in number, all things will constitute these. <note type="footnote"> 1 Vide book XII. chap. x. </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 Vide book VI. chap. viii. </note> <pb n="285"/>

          <p>SINCE the science of the philosopher, however,1 <lb/>
            is conversant about entity, so far forth as it is en­ <lb/>
            tity, and this universally, and not as regards any <lb/>
            one part, and since entity is multifariously predi­ <lb/>
            cated, and not in one way merely—this being the <lb/>
            I. The unity of <lb/>
            ontology not <lb/>
            destroyed by <lb/>
            the manifold <lb/>
            subdivisions of <lb/>
            its subject- <lb/>
            matter. <lb/>
            case if entity be predicated equivocally, and not according to <lb/>
            anything that is common-it does not fall under the province <lb/>
            of one science to inquire into it, (for there is not one genus of <lb/>
            things of this kind;) but if it be predicated according to anything <lb/>
            that is common, it would fall under the notice of one science.</p>
          <p>Now, it appears that it is predicated after the <lb/>
            same manner as both what is medicinal and salu­ <lb/>
            brious ; for, likewise, are both of these predicated <lb/>
            multifariously. And in this way each is predi- <lb/>
            2. Proof of this <lb/>
            from the ana. <lb/>
            logy of medi­ <lb/>
            cine. <lb/>
            cated in respect of the one being somehow referred to medicinal <lb/>
            art, but the other to health, and a third to something else; <lb/>
            yet each is referred to the same thing. For a medicinal <lb/>
            discourse, and a small knife, are denominated in respect <lb/>
            the former of proceeding from medicinal science, but the <lb/>
            other because it is serviceable to this art of medicine; and <lb/>
            in like manner it is so with that which is salubrious: for a <lb/>
            thing is termed thus partly because it is indicative of health, <lb/>
            and partly because it is productive of it.</p>
          <p>And the same mode exists in the case of other <lb/>
            things: in the same way, therefore, is denominated <lb/>
            entity in its entirety; for each of them is styled <lb/>
            3. This illus­ <lb/>
            tration applied <lb/>
            to the TO of: <lb/>
            entity in respect of being a passion, or habit, or disposition, or <lb/>
            motion, or something else of this sort, belonging unto entity, <lb/>
            so far forth as it is entity. Since, however, there is a reduc­ <lb/>
            tion of every entity to a certain one thing, and something <lb/>
            which is common, so of contrarieties, likewise, each will be <lb/>
            reduced to the primary differences and contrarieties of entity, <lb/>
            whether multitude and unity, or similarity and dissimilarity, <lb/>
            are the primary differences of entity, or whether there are <lb/>
            certain other differences of such; for let these stand over as <lb/>
            subjects for future discussion.2- But there is no difference <note type="footnote"> I Vide book III. chap. ii. for an examination into this point. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Aristotle probably alludes to some other portion of his writings; <lb/>
            e g. his ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εκλογὴ τω̃ν ἐναντίων</foreign>, which has not come down tc us. </note> <pb n="286"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK X. </note> <lb/>
            or, what is the <lb/>
            same, the TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕν</foreign>. <lb/>
            whether the reduction of entity be made to <lb/>
            entity or to unity. For even if they be not <lb/>
            the same, but something different, they are, at any rate, <lb/>
            convertible terms; for both unity, also, in a manner consti­ <lb/>
            tutes entity, and entity constitutes unity.</p>

            between a <lb/>
            science of con­ <lb/>
            traries and pri­ <lb/>
            vation.</p>
          <p>Since, however, it is the province of one and <lb/>
            the same science to speculate into all contraries, <lb/>
            and since each of those is predicated according to <lb/>
            privation,-although, as regards some contraries, <lb/>
            at least, of which there is a certain medium, one would feel <lb/>
            perplexed as to how they are predicated according to priva­ <lb/>
            tion ; as, for example, of the unjust and the just,—this being <lb/>
            the case, concerning all such contraries, I say, is it necessary, <lb/>
            therefore, to posite privation as existing, not of the whole <lb/>
            definition, but of the ultimate species; for instance, if one is <lb/>
            a just man who, through a certain habit, has been from time <lb/>
            to time obedient to the laws, the unjust man will not be alto­ <lb/>
            gether deprived of the entire definition of just man: but <lb/>
            inasmuch as in respect of habitual obedience to the laws he is <lb/>
            in some point or degree deficient, in this respect, likewise, <lb/>
            will there be inherent in him a privation of this definition. <lb/>
            And in the same manner is it the case with other things.</p>
          <p>5. Metaphysics, <lb/>
            as a science of <lb/>
            the TO of, illus­ <lb/>
            trated by the <lb/>
            case of mathe­ <lb/>
            matics ;</p>
          <p>But as the mathematician1 institutes for him­ <lb/>
            self an inquiry regarding abstract quantities,­ <lb/>
            for he conducts his speculations by removing out <lb/>
            of his consideration all sensible natures, such as <lb/>
            gravity and lightness, and hardness, and its con­ <lb/>
            trary, and further, also, heat and cold, and other sensible <lb/>
            contrarieties, but he merely leaves remaining quantity and <lb/>
            continuity-some of which pertain to one, but others are in <lb/>
            reference to two, and others to three, dimensions-as well as <lb/>
            the passive conditions of these, as far forth as they are quan­ <lb/>
            tities and continuous ; and this being the case, the mathema­ <lb/>
            tician does not speculate into them in reference to anything <lb/>
            else; and of some things he examines into their natures and <lb/>
            positions, one in respect of another, and into those things <lb/>
            that are inherent in these, but of others into their commen­ <lb/>
            surations and incommensurations, and of others into their <lb/>
            ratios )r proportions: but we, nevertheless, have established <lb/>
            one an 1 the same science as being conversant about all sub- <note type="footnote"> 1 Vide book III. chap. iL </note> <pb n="287"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. IV.] <lb/>
            </note>loots of this kind, I mean, the science of the geometrician,— <lb/>
            in the same manner, therefore, is it the case in respect <unclear>of</unclear> <lb/>
            entity likewise. For the things that are acci­ <lb/>
            dental in this, so far forth as it is entity, and <lb/>
            and of physics, <lb/>
            and dialectics. <lb/>
            the contrarieties of this, as far forth as it is entity, it is not <lb/>
            the province of a different science from Philosophy, that is, <lb/>
            Ontology, to investigate; for to Physical or Natural Science <lb/>
            may one ascribe the speculation of these, not as far forth as <lb/>
            they are entities, but rather as far forth as they partake of <lb/>
            motion. As to the sciences of the Dialectician, however, and the <lb/>
            Sophist, they are sciences of the accidents, I admit, that reside <lb/>
            in entities, but not so far forth as they are entities; nor do <lb/>
            they speculate about entity itself, as far forth as it is entity. <lb/>
            Wherefore, it remains that the Philosopher, or Metaphysician, <lb/>
            should be a person qualified for speculating into the points <lb/>
            we have just stated, in so far as they relate unto entities.</p>
          <p>Since, however, every entity is expressed ac­ <lb/>
            cording to some one thing, and something that <lb/>
            is common, which is multifariously predicated,1 <lb/>
            and as contraries are expressed in the same <lb/>

            manner-for they are referred to the primary contrarieties, <lb/>
            and differential qualities of entity-and since it is possible <lb/>
            that things of this kind should fall under the notice of one <lb/>
            science, hence the doubt expressed in the opening parts of <lb/>
            this work respecting first principles would be dissolved in <lb/>
            this way. Now, the doubt I allude to is that wherein the <lb/>
            matter of perplexity is involved in the question as to how <lb/>
            there will be one science about entities that are many in <lb/>
            number, and which are generically different ?</p>

          <p>BUT since, also, the mathematician employs <lb/>
            things that are common in a manner peculiar to <lb/>
            himself, it would be the province of the First <lb/>
            Philosophy, that is, of Ontology, to speculate into <lb/>
            1. How far <lb/>
            mathematics <lb/>
            and physics are <lb/>
            parts of meta­ <lb/>
            physics. <lb/>
            the original principles of these things. For that when from <note type="footnote"> 1 This is precisely the mode of reasoning pursued by Aristotle in <unclear/> <lb/>
            book III. chap. iL, already referred to. </note> <pb n="288"/>

            equals equals are taken away the remainders are equal is, <lb/>
            indeed, a dogma that is common to all quantities. Matne­ <lb/>
            matical science, however, speculates about a certain portion of <lb/>
            matter, properly so called, appropriating it to itself; as, for <lb/>
            instance, about lines, or angles, or numbers, or something <lb/>
            else pertaining to other quantities: not, however, as far forth <lb/>
            as they are entities, but so far forth as each of them is that <lb/>
            which is continuous in one, or two, or three dimensions. <lb/>
            Philosophy, however, does not institute an inquiry respecting <lb/>
            those particulars that are contained in a certain portion of <lb/>
            matter, as far forth as something amongst them is an <lb/>
            accident in each of these, but it contemplates everything of <lb/>
            this kind respecting entity, so far forth as it is entity. And <lb/>
            in the same manner, also, does the case stand in regard of <lb/>
            physical science as with mathematical; for physical or natural <lb/>
            science speculates into the accidents or first principles of <lb/>
            entities, so far forth as they are in motion, and not so far <lb/>
            forth as they are entities. But we have said that Ontology, <lb/>
            or the First Science, is conversant about these in as far as <lb/>
            the subjects of them are entities, but not so far forth as they <lb/>
            are anything that is different. Wherefore, we may set down <lb/>
            that both this and the science of the mathematician are parts <lb/>
            of Wisdom or Metaphysical Science.</p>

            lie at the basis <lb/>
            of all demon­ <lb/>
            stration.</p>
          <p>THERE is involved, however,1 in entities a cer­ <lb/>
            tain first principle about which it is not possible <lb/>
            to labour under any deception, but it is necessary <lb/>
            invariably to do the contrary; now, I mean to <lb/>
            speak conformably with truth : as, for instance, that it is not <lb/>
            admissible that the same thing should be and not be in one and <lb/>
            the same period of time; and the case is so with other things <lb/>
            that are opposed to themselves in the same manner. And, <lb/>
            respecting points of this kind, demonstration, indeed, has no <lb/>
            existence absolutely speaking; but in respect of this principle <lb/>
            it has, (for it is not possible to construct a process of <note type="footnote"> 1 Vide book III. chap. iii. </note> <pb n="289"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. V.] </note> <lb/>
            syllogistic reasoning from a more trustworthy principle than <lb/>
            this very axiom just mentioned,) and it ought to be so, at any <lb/>
            rate, if it is possible that there should subsist such a thing as <lb/>
            a demonstration in absolute terms.</p>
          <p>As regards a person, however, who makes an <lb/>
            assertion of opposite statements,1 for the purpose <lb/>
            of proving wherefore it is false, must some such <lb/>
            position be assumed, as that although the thing <lb/>

            of those who <lb/>
            would deny <lb/>
            such funda­ <lb/>
            mental axioms, <lb/>
            will actually be the same with the non-possibility of being <lb/>
            the same thing, and not being so at one and the same time, <lb/>
            yet that it will not appear to be the same thing with it; for <lb/>
            after this manner only can a demonstration be brought about <lb/>
            in regard of one who affirms the admissibility of opposite <lb/>
            assertions being verified of the same thing. And, <lb/>
            in the next place, those people who are likely to <lb/>
            take their share in mutual discussion ought, in <lb/>
            some degree, to understand themselves; for, in case <lb/>
            the na­ <lb/>
            from of philo­ <lb/>
            ture <lb/>
            sophic discus­ <lb/>
            sion, <lb/>
            this be not done, how will there subsist with these persons a <lb/>
            community in regard of such mutual discussion ? It is neces­ <lb/>
            sary, then, that each of the denominations should be known, <lb/>
            and that they manifest some one thing, and not many <lb/>
            things, but only one; and if it is equivalent in its significa­ <lb/>
            tion to many things, one ought to make it evident towards <lb/>
            which of these significations the denomination conducts one. <lb/>
            Now, as regards a person who affirms that this thing both <lb/>
            is and is not, this which he in general affirms to be, he <lb/>
            affirms not to be : wherefore, he asserts that the name <lb/>
            signifies that which it does not signify; but this is impos­ <lb/>
            sible. Wherefore, if the assertion that the being of this <lb/>
            particular thing involves any signification, it is impossible <lb/>
            that contradiction concerning the same thing should be veri­ <lb/>
            fied. Further, if a name has any meaning, and this be <lb/>
            capable of verification, this also must needs be from necessity; <lb/>
            but that which is from necessity it is not admissible at any <lb/>
            time should not be: it is not for this reason, then, admissible <lb/>
            that opposite assertions be true concerning the same thing. <note type="footnote">1 This book contains a somewhat more elaborate refutation of Scep­ <lb/>

            tion compared <lb/>
            with negation. <lb/>
            Further, on the supposition that assertion in no <lb/>
            degree is more true than negation, the person <lb/>
            who makes the affirmation that one is a man <lb/>
            will in nowise the rather make a true statement than if be <lb/>
            were to affirm that he is not a man: and a person who <lb/>
            affirms a man Dot to be a horse would appear to speak truth <lb/>
            either in a greater or not in a less degree than if he affirms <lb/>
            that man is not man. Wherefore, one who affirms, also, that <lb/>
            the same is a horse will speak true; for, in a similar way, it <lb/>
            would be possible that opposite assertions should admit of <lb/>
            verification. Wherefore, the consequence ensues that the same <lb/>
            creature should be man and horse, or something else belonging <lb/>
            to the animal kingdom. There does not, therefore, subsist in <lb/>
            regard of these any demonstration in absolute terms: as <lb/>
            relates, however, to the person who is for establishing these <lb/>
            foregoing points, demonstration has an existence.</p>

            system of the <lb/>
            Heraclitics.</p>
          <p>And quickly would one, likewise, who after <lb/>
            this manner had put the question to Heraclitus <lb/>
            himself, force him to acknowledge that it is never <lb/>
            a thing that is possible that opposite assertions <lb/>
            should be verified of the same things; but at present, not com­ <lb/>
            prehending his own theory in regard of what he says at all, <lb/>
            he has embraced this particular opinion we have been just <lb/>
            endeavouring to overthrow. And in general, if the statement <lb/>
            made by Heraclitus be true, neither would this very position <lb/>
            of his be true; now, I mean the admissibility that at one and <lb/>
            the same time the same thing should be and not be. For as <lb/>
            also, on the supposition of these assertions having been <lb/>
            divided, in no respect the more will affirmation be true than <lb/>
            negation, in the same manner, likewise, will it be the case <lb/>
            when both are conjoined and connected together-just as <lb/>
            if affirmation is regarded as being one certain thing, in no <lb/>
            degree the more will negation be true than the entire of the <lb/>
            assumption which is made in an affirmation. Moreover, if it <lb/>
            is possible to make no affirmation that is true, even would <lb/>
            this very position be false—I mean, the assertion that no <lb/>
            affirmation is true: if, however, there exists any assertion <lb/>
            that is true, that point which is put forward by these Hera­ <lb/>
            cities would be decided—I mean, such philosophers as resist <note type="footnote"> 1 Heraclitus and Protagoras are the sceptics whom Aristotle chiefly <lb/>

          <p>BUT similar to the statements1 that have been <lb/>
            just made is that which has been asserted by <lb/>
            Protagoras; for, likewise, he said that man is <lb/>
            a measure of all things,-in this way affirming <lb/>
            1. The Prota­ <lb/>
            gorean dogma <lb/>
            that man was <lb/>
            the measure of <lb/>
            all things. <lb/>
            nothing else than that what appeared to every man, that this, <lb/>
            also, indubitably is that which it appeared to be : if, how­ <lb/>
            ever, this is admitted, the same thing will happen to be and <lb/>
            not be, and to be both evil and good, and the rest of those <lb/>
            things that are expressed in accordance with opposite asser­ <lb/>
            tions, from the fact that frequently to some persons, indeed, <lb/>
            this particular thing appears to be fair, and the contrary to <lb/>
            others, and from that which is apparent to every one consti­ <lb/>
            tuting a measure.</p>
          <p>Now, this doubt would be resolved if persons <lb/>
            considered whence the origin of this supposition <lb/>
            has been derived; for to some speculators, no <lb/>
            doubt, it would appear to have originated from <lb/>
            the opinion of the Physiologists, or Natural Phi- <lb/>
            2. The origin <lb/>
            of this dogma <lb/>
            its own refuta­ <lb/>
            tion—whether <lb/>
            it be from natu­ <lb/>
            ral philosophy, <lb/>
            losophers, but to others from the circumstance that all men <lb/>
            do not possess the same points of knowledge in respect of the <lb/>
            same subjects, but that to some this particular thing seems <lb/>
            to be sweet, and to others the contrary. For that nothing is <lb/>
            generated from nonentity, but everything from entity, is <lb/>
            almost a commonly received dogma amongst all Natural <lb/>
            Philosophers. Since, therefore, that which is not white is <lb/>
            generated from that which is perfectly white, and by no <lb/>
            means not white, supposing, now, that what is not white has <lb/>
            been generated from that which is not a white entity, that <lb/>
            which is being generated as not white would be produced. <note type="footnote">1 This error of Protagoras is an inveterate failing in human philo­ <lb/>
            sophy. It is noticed by Bacon in terms of strong reprehension. Its <lb/>
            effects on theology might be illustrated in the rise of Anthropo­ <lb/>

            Wherefore, such would be generated from nonentity, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to their doctrine, unless that which is not white were the <lb/>
            same with that which is white. It would not, however, be <lb/>
            difficult to decide this doubt; for it has been declared, in our <lb/>
            treatise on Physics, in what manner from that which is non­ <lb/>
            entity are generated the things that are being produced, and <lb/>
            how it is that they are generated from entity. Notwith­ <lb/>
            standing the giving heed, in like manner, to both opinions, <lb/>
            and to the fanciful statements of persons who doubt in <lb/>
            opposition to themselves, this would be a silly proceeding; <lb/>
            for it is evident that one party amongst these sceptics must <lb/>
            or from ob­ <lb/>
            serving the <lb/>
            phenomena of <lb/>
            sense. <lb/>
            needs labour under fallacies. And this statement <lb/>
            is manifest from observing things that are gene­ <lb/>
            rated according to sense; for at no time does the <lb/>
            same thing appear to some, indeed, sweet, and to <lb/>
            others the contrary, provided that the organ which has the <lb/>
            power of perceiving and deciding the above-enumerated tastes <lb/>
            has not undergone any corruption and injury in the case of <lb/>
            these others. But, on the understanding of such a state of <lb/>
            things as this, we may suppose that some of them are a stand­ <lb/>
            ard of measure, and suppose that others are not so. And, in <lb/>
            like manner, I assert this to be the case as regards both what <lb/>
            is good and evil, and what is beautiful and disgraceful, and <lb/>
            other things of the sort; for to lay down this as a principle, <lb/>
            or to affirm the reality of nothing save the apparent, is a <lb/>
            course nowise different from those who place their finger <lb/>
            beneath the organ of vision, and thus from the one object <lb/>
            make two to appear, and who really believe that there are <lb/>
            two objects before them, on account of their appearing such, <lb/>
            and again that there is but one in reality; for to those per­ <lb/>
            sons who do not move their organ of vision that which is one <lb/>
            appears one.</p>
          <p>3. The difficulty <lb/>
            of attaining <lb/>
            unto truth in <lb/>
            this matter.</p>
          <p>In general however, it v juld be absurd, from <lb/>
            the appearance of things that are here as subject <lb/>
            to change, and which never permanently con­ <lb/>
            tinue in the same dispositions, from this to come <lb/>
            to any decision as regards truth; for it is necessary that <lb/>
            we should go in pursuit of that which is true from amongst <lb/>
            those things that invariably do subsist according to the same <note type="footnote"> 1 Sextus Empiricus has laid hold on a principle such as this to <lb/>
            establish his philosophic system. </note> <pb n="293"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VI.] </note> <lb/>
            dispositions, and that never are instrumental in bringing <lb/>
            about their own change. Now, of this description are those <lb/>
            bodies that are regulated according to the orderly system of <lb/>
            the Universe; for these do not at one time appear of <lb/>
            this particular sort, but at another time of a different kind, <lb/>
            but invariably the same, and as participating in no change.</p>
          <p>But, further, on the supposition of the exist­ <lb/>
            ence of motion, and of something that is being <lb/>
            moved,-now, everything which has motion im­ <lb/>
            pressed upon it is put in motion by something, <lb/>
            4. This thecTy <lb/>
            refuted from <lb/>
            the very nature <lb/>
            of flux and <lb/>
            motion. <lb/>
            and in the direction of something,-in such a case, that which <lb/>
            is being moved ought to be found, moreover, in that from <lb/>
            which it will derive its motion, and yet not be found therein, <lb/>
            and that it should be moved towards this particular place, <lb/>
            and yet should not be generated in this : but how can such be <lb/>
            the case ? for we must bear in mind, that, even according to <lb/>
            their own doctrines, that simultaneous verification1 is not <lb/>
            possible as regards contradiction. And if, according to quan­ <lb/>
            tity, things which are here are continuously in a state of <lb/>
            flux, and are being moved,-and if one admits this, although <lb/>
            it should not be true,-why are they not permanent as regards <lb/>
            quality ? for these speculators in no small degree appear to <lb/>
            predicate those things of the same thing, according to their <lb/>
            contradictions, from the supposition that quantity does not <lb/>
            continue permanently in bodies. Hence with them the same <lb/>
            thing is and is not of four cubits in its dimensions. Sub­ <lb/>
            stance, however, subsists according to quality, for this is of <lb/>
            a definite nature; but quantity belongs to one which is <lb/>
            indefinite.</p>
          <p>Further, why, let me ask, when the physician 2 <lb/>
            gives a prescription that his patients should take <lb/>
            this particular food,-why, I say, do they take <lb/>
            it? for why is this particular piece of food <lb/>
            5. Practical <lb/>
            argument <lb/>
            against Prota­ <lb/>
            goras. <lb/>
            bread rather than it is not bread ? Wherefore, there would <lb/>
            be no distinction in eating from not eating. At present, <lb/>
            however, as the physician makes a true assertion about this <lb/>
            thing, and this food that has been prescribed being in reality <lb/>
            in existence, the patients accordingly take this food—although <lb/>
            they ought not, at least, to do so on the supposition that <note type="footnote"> 1 The word thus rendered is <foreign xml:lang="grc">συναληθεύεσθαι</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Vide book III. chape, iT. v. and vi. </note> <pb n="294"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK X. </note> <lb/>
            there is no nature that is firmly permanent in sensibles, but <lb/>
            that invariably all things are in motion and in a state of <lb/>
            6. Argument <lb/>
            against him <lb/>
            from the sub­ <lb/>
            jectivity of our <lb/>
            sensations. <lb/>
            flux. But further, if, indeed, we are always <lb/>
            undergoing a changer and never remaining per­ <lb/>
            manently the same persons, why is it surprising <lb/>
            if things never appear at any time to be the <lb/>
            same as they do to those that are sick ?For to these, also, on <lb/>
            account of their habit being not similarly disposed as when <lb/>
            they are in a healthy state, the things that subsist according <lb/>
            to the senses do not appear to subsist in a similar manner; <lb/>
            though sensibles themselves participate in no change on <lb/>
            account of this, at least, but produce different sensations in <lb/>
            the sick, and sensations that are not the same. In the same <lb/>
            manner, therefore, is it requisite, perhaps, that consequences <lb/>
            be disposed as if the aforesaid- change took place. If, however, <lb/>
            we do not undergo a change, but continue to be the same, <lb/>
            there would be something in existence that is permanent.</p>
          <p>7. One class of <lb/>
            sceptics easier <lb/>
            refuted than <lb/>
            another.</p>
          <p>Respecting, to be sure, those persons, therefore, <lb/>
            who entertain from principles of reason the <lb/>
            doubts enumerated, it would not be easy to <lb/>
            advance a refutation when they are not for <lb/>
            admitting anything, and no longer demand a reason of those <lb/>
            things, for all reasoning, and every demonstration, arise in <lb/>
            this way; for when they are disposed to admit nothing, they <lb/>
            overturn the thing in dispute, and, in general, all rational <lb/>
            discussion. Wherefore, with such speculators, of course, there <lb/>
            is no such thing at all as rational discussion; but in regard of <lb/>
            those that labour under perplexity, from the doubts that <lb/>
            have been handed down, it would be easy to reply, and to <lb/>
            unravel the difficulties that create in them the doubt referred <lb/>
            to; now this statement is evident from those that have been <lb/>
            made</p>
          <p>8. Neither, <lb/>
            therefore, con­ <lb/>
            tradiction, nor <lb/>
            contrariety, nor <lb/>
            media, can be <lb/>
            affirmed of one <lb/>
            and the same <lb/>
            thing at the <lb/>
            same time.</p>
          <p>Wherefore, it is evident from these things that <lb/>
            it does not admit of being possible that opposite <lb/>
            assertions about the same thing should be veri­ <lb/>
            fied at one and the same time, nor that con­ <lb/>
            traries should, on account of the denomination of <lb/>
            all contrariety according to privation. This, how­ <lb/>
            ever, will be evident to those who resolve into <note type="footnote">1 Thus Aristotle turns the weapons of attack employed by Prota <lb/>
            goras to inflict wounds on the sceptic himself. </note> <pb n="295"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VII.] </note> <lb/>
            their first principles the definitions of contraries. And, in <unclear>ke</unclear> <lb/>
            manner, neither is it possible that any of those things that <lb/>
            are media should be predicated of one and the same thing; <lb/>
            for, on the supposition of the subject being white, when we <lb/>
            assert that this is neither white nor black we shall make a false <lb/>
            assertion, for it happens that this is white, and yet that it is <lb/>
            not; for either of these connected together will be verified <lb/>
            concerning this, but this amounts to a contradiction of what <lb/>
            is white.</p>
          <p>Neither, therefore, is it possible for one who <lb/>
            makes an assertion, in accordance with the theory <lb/>
            of Heraclitus, nor of Anaxagoras, to assert what <lb/>
            is true ; and if this be not admitted, the conse­ <lb/>
            quence will ensue that they predicate contrary <lb/>
            things of the same subject: for when Anaxagoras <lb/>
            9. This shows <lb/>
            where the error <lb/>
            lies in the <lb/>
            system of <lb/>
            Anaxagoras <lb/>
            and the Hera­ <lb/>
            clitics. <lb/>
            says that in everything is contained a part of everything, he <lb/>
            says that a thing is not more sweet than bitter, or anything <lb/>
            else of the other contrarieties, if in everything all things <lb/>
            subsist not merely in potentiality, but in energy or activity, <lb/>
            and in a state of separation. And, in like manner, neither <lb/>
            is it possible that all assertions be false, nor all true,1 as well <lb/>
            on account of many other difficulties which would be uttered <lb/>
            in consequence of this position, as also because as regards <lb/>
            all assertions, supposing that they are false, neither will <lb/>
            one who makes this very assertion speak what is true ; but if <lb/>
            all assertions are true, the person who says that all are false <lb/>
            will not speak falsely.</p>

            matter, why <lb/>
            may not this be <lb/>
            the case with <lb/>
            ontology too ?</p>
          <p>Since, however, there exists a certain science 1 <lb/>
            which is conversant about Nature, it is manifest <lb/>
            that it will be different from both that which is <lb/>
            practical science and that which is productive or <lb/>
            effective. For of productive science the first <lb/>
            principle of motion resides in the producing or <lb/>
            efficient cause, and not in that which is being pro­ <lb/>
            duced; and this either is some art, or some other <lb/>
            potentiality. And, in like manner, does the case stand with <lb/>
            practical science also; the motion does not reside in the <lb/>
            thing done, but rather in those who are agents. But the <lb/>
            science of the Natural Philosopher is conversant about those <lb/>
            bodies that involve in themselves a first principle of motion. <lb/>
            That, indeed, therefore, Physical Science must needs be neither <lb/>
            practical nor productive, but speculative or contemplative, is <lb/>
            evident from these statements; for there is the necessity of its <lb/>
            falling under the classification of some one of these genera. <lb/>
            And since, in a manner, it is requsite for each of the sciences <lb/>
            to possess a knowledge of the nature of a thing, and to <lb/>
            employ this as a first principle, we ought not to forget how <lb/>
            a definition of this quiddity should be framed by the phy­ <lb/>
            sical inquirer, and how the definition of substance is to be <lb/>
            assumed, whether as the flat-nose, or rather as the hollow; <lb/>
            for, as regards these, the formal principle, no doubt, of flat-nose <lb/>
            is denominated along with matter—I mean, such as belongs <lb/>
            to the thing itself; the formal principle, however, of hollow- <lb/>
            nose is expressed without matter, for flatness of nose is <note type="footnote"> 1 Vide book V. chaps. i. and ii. </note> <pb n="297"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VII.] </note> <lb/>
            generated in the nose. Wherefore, also, the definition or formal <lb/>
            principle of it is inquired into along with this, for the flat- <lb/>
            nose constitutes a hollow-nose. It is evident, therefore, that <lb/>
            the definition both of flesh, and of the eye, and of the <lb/>
            other parts of the body, is always to be assumed along with <lb/>
            matter.</p>
          <p>But since there exists a certain science of <lb/>
            entity,1 so far forth as it is entity, and so far <lb/>
            forth as it involves a separable subsistence, we <lb/>
            must examine whether at all we are to con­ <lb/>
            sider this to be the same with Natural or Phy- <lb/>
            3. What it is in <lb/>
            ontology, as a <lb/>
            science, that <lb/>
            distinguishes <lb/>
            it from physics, <lb/>
            or mathematics. <lb/>
            sical Science, or rather to be different from it. Physical <lb/>
            Science, indeed, then, is conversant about those bodies that <lb/>
            involve in themselves a first principle of motion; but the <lb/>
            science of the mathematician is itself a certain science that is <lb/>
            speculative, I admit, and that, too, in regard of things that are <lb/>
            permanent, but which do not involve a subsistence separable <lb/>
            from sensibles. Respecting, then, that which is an entity <lb/>
            capable of separate subsistence, and which is immovable, <lb/>
            there exists a certain science different from both of these, on <lb/>
            the supposition, of course, that there is some substance of this <lb/>
            description in existence-now, I speak of a substance separ­ <lb/>
            able and immovable; and it is the validity of this very <lb/>
            position that we shall attempt to demonstrate.</p>
          <p>And if we admit that there subsists any sub­ <lb/>
            stance of this sort in entities, here also, in a <lb/>
            manner, would there be found Divinity residing, <lb/>
            and this would be an original and most dominant <lb/>
            4. Out of the <lb/>
            three specula­ <lb/>
            tive sciences, <lb/>
            theology the <lb/>
            most dignified. <lb/>
            principle. It is evident, therefore, that there are three genera <lb/>
            of the speculative sciences-namely, the physical or natural, <lb/>
            the mathematical, and the theological. The most excellent, <lb/>
            then, is certainly the genus of the speculative or contempla­ <lb/>
            tive sciences; and of these very sciences that one which is <lb/>
            mentioned last of the three possesses 2 the greatest amount <lb/>
            of excellence, for it is conversant about that one amongst <lb/>
            entities which is more entitled to respect than the rest. Each <lb/>
            science, however, is termed more excellent, and more inferior, <lb/>
            according to its appropriate object of scientific knowledge. <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare what is said in chap. IV. of this book. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This point has been established by Aristotle in the opening <unclear>chaptors</unclear> <lb/>

            the universal science, however, speculates in common respect­ <lb/>
            ing all things. If, indeed, therefore, we admit physical <lb/>

            or Natural Science would also be the chief one amongst the <lb/>
            sciences ; but, on the other hand, if there exists a nature that <lb/>
            is different, and a substance that involves a separable subsist­ <lb/>
            ence, and is immovable, it is necessary, also, that there belong <lb/>

            TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">συμβεβηκός</foreign>.</p>
          <p>SINCE, however, that which is entity simply <lb/>
            considered is denominated in many1 ways, of <lb/>
            which one is that which is spoken of as subsisting <lb/>
            according to accident, in the first instance our examina­ <lb/>
            tion must be instituted concerning entity in this point of <lb/>
            view. That, indeed, therefore, no one of the sciences that <lb/>
            have been handed down from former generations is employed <lb/>
            ibout what is accidental is evident; for neither does that <lb/>
            relating to house-building or architectural art investigate into <lb/>
            what is likely to be accidental with those who will make use <lb/>
            of the house ; for example, as to whether they will dwell there <lb/>
            sorrowfully or the contrary : nor is it so with the art of <lb/>
            weaving, nor of shoe-making, nor the cooking art. Each of <lb/>
            these sciences, however, examines into that which is peculiar <lb/>
            to its own department only; and this is its appropriate end. <lb/>
            Neither does it consider a person so far as he is a musician <lb/>
            and a grammarian, nor does it assert that he who is a musician, <lb/>
            should he become a grammarian, will at the same time be <lb/>
            both, though he were not so previously. But that which is <lb/>
            not always an entity, this was generated at some time or <lb/>
            other; so that such a person would at the same time become <note type="footnote"> 1 Vide book V. chap. ii. </note> <pb n="299"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            a musician and a grammarian. This, however, no one of <lb/>
            those that are confessedly sciences examines into, with the <lb/>
            exception of the science of the Sophist; for this alone is <lb/>
            employed about what is accidental. Wherefore, Plato has <lb/>
            not inaptly expressed himself when he affirms that the <lb/>
            sophist wastes his time in the consideration of nonentity.</p>
          <p>But that it is not a thing that is admissible that <lb/>
            there should be in existence a science of the <lb/>
            accidental, will be manifest to those who attempt <lb/>
            to discern what an accident is at all. Therefore, <lb/>
            as regards everything, we affirm one thing, indeed, <lb/>
            2. The nature <lb/>
            of the accident <lb/>
            proves that <lb/>
            there could not <lb/>
            be a science <lb/>
            thereof. <lb/>
            to subsist always and from necessity-now, I mean by neces­ <lb/>
            sity not that which is denominated according to what is <lb/>
            violent, but what we employ in cases pertaining to demon­ <lb/>
            strations—but another thing we affirm as subsisting for the <lb/>
            most part, and another, neither as for the most part, nor <lb/>
            always, and from necessity, but as may happen at any time <lb/>
            to be casual; for example, cold might be prevalent when the <lb/>
            sun is in Canis : but a thing of this sort would take place <lb/>
            neither as always from necessity, nor as for the most part, <lb/>
            but might, nevertheless, accidentally occur sometimes. There­ <lb/>
            tore, does that constitute an accident which is produced, not <lb/>
            always, nor from necessity, nor as for the most part. What, <lb/>
            indeed, then, an accident is, has been declared; but why there <lb/>
            is not a science of a thing of this kind is evident: for every <lb/>
            science is conversant about that which is an entity always, or <lb/>
            as for the most part; but the accidental is not ranked amongst <lb/>
            either of these.</p>
          <p>But it is evident that of what subsists accord­ <lb/>
            ing to accident there are not causes and first <lb/>
            principles of such a description as there are of <lb/>
            that which is an entity that involves an essential <lb/>
            subsistence; for, if this be admitted, all things <lb/>
            3. The same <lb/>
            proved from <lb/>
            the principles of <lb/>
            the accidental <lb/>
            and the essen­ <lb/>
            tial being diffe­ <lb/>
            rent. <lb/>
            will be from necessity. For, if on the supposition of this <lb/>
            particular thing being a consequence of that particular entity, <lb/>
            but this a result from that, and if this subsists not from its <lb/>
            being casual, but from necessity, from necessity will be like­ <lb/>
            wise that of which this was the cause, until that which is <lb/>
            denominated the last effect, this, however, subsisted accord­ <lb/>
            ing to accident. So that all things will be from necessity, <lb/>
            and the possibility for anything whatsoever casually to occur. <pb n="300"/>

            and the existence of contingency, and the being generated, <lb/>
            and the not being generated, will altogether be taken away <lb/>
            from things that are being generated. For, although a cause <lb/>
            may be supposed not to be an entity, but that also which is <lb/>
            being generated, the same consequences will ensue; for every­ <lb/>
            thing will be generated from necessity. For, to give an in­ <lb/>
            stance, to-morrow's eclipse 1 will take place if this particular <lb/>
            thing may happen, and this will happen if something else <lb/>
            does, and this last if something else ensues; and, doubtless, <lb/>
            in this manner, on the supposition that a portion of duration <lb/>
            be taken away from that definite time which may be mea­ <lb/>
            sured from the present moment until to-morrow, one will <lb/>
            ultimately arrive at that which is in being. Wherefore, since <lb/>
            this is the case, all things that are subsequent to this will be <lb/>
            from necessity: wherefore, will it be the case that all things <lb/>
            will be generated from necessity.</p>
          <p>4. A certain as­ <lb/>
            pect of entity <lb/>
            omitted in on­ <lb/>
            tology.</p>
          <p>As regards, however, that which is entity in <lb/>
            reality, and not according to accident, one kind, <lb/>
            indeed, is that which is contained in the com­ <lb/>
            prehension of the intellect,2 and is a passive con­ <lb/>
            dition in this. Wherefore, respecting that which constitutes <lb/>
            entity in this way first principles are not investigated; but <lb/>
            respecting that which is an entity external to this, and pos­ <lb/>
            sessing a separable subsistence, they are; and that which <lb/>
            subsists according to accident is not necessary, but indefinite <lb/>
            -now I mean, what subsists according to what is accidental, <lb/>
            as in a less degree ; but the causes of a thing of this sort are <lb/>
            inordinate and infinite.</p>
          <p>5. Chance de­ <lb/>
            fined as a cause <lb/>
            generated per <lb/>
            accident.</p>
          <p>But that on account of which a thing subsists, <lb/>
            that is, the final cause, is classified amongst those <lb/>
            things that are generated by Nature, or that <lb/>
            spring from Intellect. It is chance, however, <lb/>
            that generates them when any of these may be generated <lb/>
            according to accident; for, in like manner, just as also entity <lb/>
            constitutes in one respect that which is essential, but in another <lb/>
            that which subsists according to accident, so also is it the <note type="footnote"> 1 This is the mode of reasoning already adopted by Aristotle in <lb/>

            case with a cause. But chance is a cause according to acci­ <lb/>
            dent in those things that are being generated in accordance <lb/>
            with free-will, for the sake of something. Wherefore, chance <lb/>
            and intellect are conversant about the same object,1 for free- <lb/>
            will is not devoid of a connexion with intellect. The causes, <lb/>
            however, are indefinite from which might be generated that <lb/>
            which arises from chance: wherefore, obscure to human cal­ <lb/>
            culation is chance, even as a cause subsisting according to <lb/>
            accident, but, absolutely considered, such is not a cause of <lb/>
            anything; and chance is good and evil when what is good or <lb/>
            worthless may happen to be the result: but mischance and <lb/>
            misfortune are conversant about the magnitude of these. <lb/>
            But since nothing that subsists according to accident is ante­ <lb/>
            cedent to those things that possess an essential subsistence, <lb/>
            neither, then, are causes so. If, then, chance, or even spon­ <lb/>
            taneity,2 be a cause of the firmament, prior as a cause will be <lb/>
            Mind and Nature.</p>

            so far forth as it is being built; and this constitutes the <lb/>
            structure, or the mode of building. In like manner stands <lb/>
            the case with disciplinary learning, healing, and rolling, <lb/>
            walking, leaping, growing old, advancing towards a state of <lb/>
            maturity. It happens, however, that a thing is in motion <lb/>
            when the actuality itself may exist, and when it is a thing <lb/>
            neither antecedent nor subsequent to this. Therefore, ente­ <lb/>
            lecheia, or actuality, belonging to that which subsists in <lb/>
            capacity, when subsisting in actuality it energizes either as <lb/>
            that which it is, or something else, so far forth as it is <lb/>
            movable-this constitutes motion. Now, I mean by the <lb/>
            expression " so far forth " a subsistence whose mode I would <lb/>
            illustrate as follows.</p>
          <p><unclear/> Illustrated <lb/>
            by a statue, and <lb/>
            in the case of <lb/>
            eontraries.</p>
          <p>For brass is a statue in capacity; but, never­ <lb/>
            theless, actuality of the brass, so far forth as it <lb/>
            is brass, does not constitute motion. For it is <lb/>
            not the same thing, the belonging to brass and <lb/>
            to a certain capacity; since if it were the same, absolutely <lb/>
            speaking, according to definition, the entelecheia, or actuality, <lb/>
            of the brass would amount to a certain motion: it is not, <lb/>
            however, the same. And this statement is evident as regards <lb/>
            contraries; for the capacity of being in sound health, and <lb/>
            the capacity of being indisposed, are not the same; for in <lb/>
            such a case would the actual conditions of health and sick­ <lb/>
            ness be the same: but the subject that is capable of being <lb/>
            made both healthy and diseased, whether it be moisture, or <lb/>
            whether it be blood, is one and the same thing. Since, however. <pb n="303"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH IX.] </note> <lb/>
            the being of a- thing is not the same with the being of a <lb/>
            certain capacity, in the same way as neither is colour the <lb/>
            same with what is visible, so the entelecheia,1 or actuality, of <lb/>
            that which is potential, so far forth as it is a thing that is <lb/>
            potential, constitutes motion.</p>
          <p>That, indeed, therefore, motion actually exists, <lb/>
            and that a thing happens to be moved at the <lb/>
            same time with its being itself actuality, and <lb/>
            that it is a thing that is neither antecedent nor <lb/>
            4. This connex­ <lb/>
            ion between <lb/>
            motion and <lb/>
            energy, &amp;c., <lb/>
            reaffirmed. <lb/>
            subsequent to this, is evident; for everything admits of sub­ <lb/>
            sisting at one time in energy, but at another time not in this <lb/>
            state: as, for example, that which is fit for being built, so far <lb/>
            forth as it is fit for being built, and the energy of that which <lb/>
            is fit for being built, so far forth as it is fit for being built, <lb/>
            constitute the mode or act of building; for the energy of this <lb/>
            amounts either to the mode of building or the house built. <lb/>
            But when the house may be finished-that is, when it con­ <lb/>
            stitutes the energy-it will no longer be a thing that is fit <lb/>
            for being built; but, on the other hand, that which is fit for <lb/>
            being built is actually built. It is necessary, then, that <lb/>
            the mode or act of building amount to energy: but the <lb/>
            mode or act of building amounts, likewise, to a certain <lb/>
            motion. And the same reasoning holds good in the case <lb/>
            of other motions.</p>
          <p>Now, that these assertions have been made <lb/>
            correctly is evident from the statements which <lb/>
            other philosophers have from time to time put <lb/>
            forward in regard to motion; as also from the <lb/>
            fact of its not being an easy matter to frame <lb/>
            5. This mode <lb/>
            of defining vindicated <lb/>

            to by other philo­ <lb/>
            sophers. <lb/>
            a. definition of it in a different manner from the foregoing: <lb/>
            for neither is one able to set it down as being contained in <lb/>
            another genus. And it is evident from what these specu­ <lb/>
            lators say on the subject; for some of them, indeed, regard it <lb/>
            as equivalent with diversity, and inequality, and nonentity ; <lb/>
            and yet not one of these necessarily should have motion <lb/>
            imparted to it. But neither does there exist change or <lb/>
            mutation into these either, nor from things of this kind more <lb/>
            than from such as are opposed. But a cause of their setting <lb/>
            down motion amongst things of this kind is as follows,— <note type="footnote"> 1 As to the import of this Peripatetic term, vide Suidas (Gaisford's Ed.) <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [BOOK X </note> <lb/>
            because motion appears with them as something that is inde­ <lb/>
            finite. Now, the first principles of a different co-ordinate <lb/>
            series, from the fact of their being privative, are indefinite; <lb/>
            for not one of these is either this particular thing, or any <lb/>
            other of the rest of the categories.</p>
          <p>6. What has <lb/>
            led these specu­ <lb/>
            lators to regard <lb/>
            motion as what <lb/>
            is indefinite.</p>
          <p>But a cause of this view of motion—I mean, <lb/>
            of its appearing to be a thing that is indefinite <lb/>
            -results from the fact that it is not possible to <lb/>
            set it down under the category of the poten­ <lb/>
            tiality of entities, or under that of their energy or activity; <lb/>
            for neither that which involves a capacity of being quantity <lb/>
            has motion imparted to it necessarily, nor that which sub­ <lb/>
            sists as quantity in energy. And motion appears to amount <lb/>
            to a certain energy or activity, no doubt,1 but an energy or <lb/>
            activity which is imperfect: and a cause of this is the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing-that that which is potential to which the energy <lb/>
            belongs is itself imperfect, and on this account it would be <lb/>
            difficult, as regards this, to apprehend what it is; for it must <lb/>
            necessarily be classed either into privation, or into capacity, <lb/>
            or into simple energy; and not one of these does it appear <lb/>
            admissible that motion should be considered. Wherefore, it <lb/>
            remains that it be what it has been declared to be-namely, <lb/>
            both an energy or activity; and yet not such an energy as <lb/>
            has been mentioned, for this would be an energy difficult to <lb/>
            discern, indeed; but, nevertheless, one which it is admissible <lb/>
            should subsist.</p>
          <p>7. Motion re­ <lb/>
            sides in a mo­ <lb/>
            tive nature.</p>
          <p>And that motion is to be found in that which <lb/>
            is capable of being moved is evident; for the <lb/>
            actuality of this lies under the influence of that <lb/>
            which is capable of being moved. And the energy of that <lb/>
            which is movable is not different from this; for it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary, surely, that there should subsist actuality in both ; for <lb/>
            a thing is movable in respect of its involving a capability of <lb/>
            having motion impressed upon it, and that which imparts <lb/>
            motion does so from energy or activity, but it thus acts <lb/>
            from this energy in regard of that which is adapted for <lb/>
            motion. Wherefore, in like manner, there resides one energy <lb/>
            in both, just as from one to two is the same interval as from <lb/>
            two to one. And in regard of ascent and descent the case if <lb/>
            the same; but the essence in this instance is not one. And <note type="footnote"> 1 Vide book VIII. chaps. iii. and vi., already referred to. </note> <pb n="305"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. X.] </note> <lb/>
            the same remark holds good, in like manner, with the power <lb/>
            that imparts motion, and that which has motion impressed <lb/>
            upon it thereby.</p>

          <p>BUT the Infinite either is that which it is <lb/>
            impossible to pass through, in respect of its not <lb/>
            being adapted by nature to be permeated, in the <lb/>
            1. The Infinite, <lb/>
            TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄπειρον</foreign>,de­ <lb/>
            fined. <lb/>
            same way as the voice is invisible, or it is that which possesses <lb/>
            a passage without an end, or that which is scarcely so, or that <lb/>
            which by nature is adapted to have, but has not, a passage or <lb/>
            termination. Further, a thing is infinite from subsisting by <lb/>
            addition, or subtraction, or both.</p>
          <p>It is, indeed, possible, therefore, that the In­ <lb/>
            finite should constitute a certain entity that <lb/>
            involves a separable subsistence,2 but that it is <lb/>
            cognisant by sense is not possible; for, if it con­ <lb/>
            stitutes neither magnitude nor multitude, and if <lb/>
            2. The Infinite <lb/>
            involves a <lb/>
            separable sub­ <lb/>
            sistence, but is <lb/>
            not cognisant <lb/>
            by the senses. <lb/>
            the Infinite be a substance, and not an accident of this, it <lb/>
            will be indivisible; for that which is divisible amounts either <lb/>
            to magnitude or multitude: but if it be indivisible it will <lb/>
            not be infinite, unless in the same way as the voice is in­ <lb/>
            visible. They do not, however, say so, nor do we inquire <lb/>
            into the subject; but we consider it as a thing without any <lb/>
            passage, or, in other words, impermeable. Further, let me <lb/>
            ask, how is it possible that what is essentially infinite should <lb/>
            exist, unless there should happen to subsist number and <note type="footnote"> 1 The subject of the Infinite, discussed in this chapter, is most im­ <lb/>
            portant. The best modem author on this point is the late Sir William <lb/>
            Hamilton, in his review of Cousin's doctrine of the Infinite-absolute. <lb/>
            Vide also Calderwood's Philosophy of the Infinite; Vera's Inquiry into <lb/>
            Speculative Philosophy; and Professor Ferrier's Institutes of Meta­ <lb/>
            physics, sect. I. props. xx. xxi.; sect. III. props. i.—viii. inclusive. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 I have not followed Taylor in his erroneous rendering of this <lb/>
            passage. A carelessness in language, in translating the Greek, might <lb/>
            convey the notion that Aristotle in these words was actually denying <lb/>
            the separate existence of the Infinite, when nothing could be further <lb/>
            from his intention. The Latin version paraphrases the passage thus <lb/>
            “ Separatum sane ipsum quum sit, sensibus percipi impossibile est. <lb/>
            It must, however, be acknowledged that upon the whole Aristotle does <lb/>
            not express himself on the subject of the Infinite as fully or as <lb/>
            determinately as we might have expected. His definition of it is <lb/>
            almost entirely made up of negations. </note> <note type="footnote"> <unclear/></note> <pb n="306"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK X. </note> <lb/>
            magnitude, of which two the Infinite is a passive condition ? <lb/>
            Moreover, if the Infinite subsists according to accident, it <lb/>
            would not constitute an element of entities, as far forth as it <lb/>
            is a thing that is infinite, in the same manner as neither is <lb/>
            that which is invisible an element of speech although the <lb/>
            voice is invisible.</p>
          <p>a. Nor can the <lb/>
            Infinite sub­ <lb/>
            sist in energy;</p>
          <p>And that it is not possible for the Infinite to <lb/>
            subsist in energy1 is evident, for any part what­ <lb/>
            soever of itself that is assumed will be infinite; <lb/>
            for the being of the infinite and a thing which is infinite are <lb/>
            the same, if the Infinite be substance and not that which is <lb/>
            predicated of a subject. Wherefore, it is either indivisible, or <lb/>
            divisible in a progression ad infinitum, if it be made up of parts <lb/>
            that are or may be divisible. That many infinites, however. <lb/>
            should be the same thing is impossible; for as air is a part of <lb/>
            air, so infinite is a part of that which is infinite, if it is a sub­ <lb/>
            stance and a first principle. The infinite, then, is devoid <lb/>
            nor in actu­ <lb/>
            ality. <lb/>
            of parts and indivisible. But it is impossible <lb/>
            that an entity that subsists in actuality should <lb/>
            be infinite, for it must needs constitute quantity. It sub­ <lb/>
            sists, then, according to accident: but if this be the case, it <lb/>
            has been declared that it is not possible that it should be <lb/>
            a first principle; but this must be affirmed of that to which <lb/>
            it happens that number or evenness should be such. The <lb/>
            investigation, therefore, is itself universal.</p>
          <p>4. That the In­ <lb/>
            finite does not <lb/>
            subsist in sen­ <lb/>
            sibles proved <lb/>
            from its not <lb/>
            being of a com­ <lb/>
            posite nature.</p>
          <p>That the Infinite, however, does not. subsist in <lb/>
            things that are cognisant by sense is evident <lb/>
            from the following circumstances:—for, on the <lb/>
            supposition that the definition of body amounts <lb/>
            to that which is bounded by surfaces, body would <lb/>
            not be infinite, either that which is cognisable <lb/>
            by sense or by the understanding; nor will it be number as <lb/>
            actually separated and infinite, for number is that which is <lb/>
            numerable, or which involves number. That the Infinite, <lb/>
            however, cannot subsist in things cognisant to the senses- <lb/>
            regarded in a physical point of view-is evident from these <lb/>
            following reasons :-for neither is it possible that it should be <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristotle, therefore, whatever positive notion he had formed of the <lb/>
            Infinite, cannot be said to have identified it with the Deity, for the <lb/>
            essence of the Divine Nature he laid in energy, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνέργεια</foreign>. This will be <lb/>
            seen iu what follows. </note> <pb n="307"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH X.] </note> <lb/>
            a composite nature, nor one which is simple. For if you <lb/>
            admit that it is a composite nature it will not be a body, if <lb/>
            the elements are limited in multitude; for it is requisite <lb/>
            that we should equalise the contraries, and that one of them <lb/>
            should not be infinite: for if in any degree whatsoever the <lb/>
            potentiality ofthe other body fails, the finite will be cor­ <lb/>
            rupted by the infinite body. But it is impossible that each <lb/>
            of the elements should be infinite, for body is that which in <lb/>
            every direction involves an interval; but that which is in­ <lb/>
            finite is that which involves an interval without end. Where­ <lb/>
            fore, if there is in existence an infinite body, it will be infinite <lb/>
            in every direction.</p>
          <p>Neither, however, can there be in existence <lb/>
            one infinite simple body, nor-as certain philo­ <lb/>
            sophers1 would lay down—can it subsist as <lb/>
            5. Nor a body <lb/>
            which is <lb/>
            simple. <lb/>
            different from, or independent of, the elements from whence <lb/>
            they generate these things; for there is not in existence a <lb/>
            body of this description beside the elements, for all those <lb/>
            things of which they are compounded are resolved into these. <lb/>
            This, however, does not appear to subsist beside the simple <lb/>
            bodies-either fire or any other of the elements; for without <lb/>
            some one of them being infinite it is impossible that the Uni­ <lb/>
            verse, if it may be finite, should either be or be generated <lb/>
            from some one of the elements : 2 as Heraclitus says that all <lb/>
            things were originally fire. And there is the same mode of <lb/>
            reasoning, also, in the case of unity, the existence of which <lb/>
            Natural Philosophers introduce besides the elements; for <lb/>
            everything undergoes a change from its contrary, as from heat <lb/>
            into cold.</p>
          <p>Further, a body cognisant by the senses is <lb/>
            situated in a certain place, and there is the same <lb/>
            place of the whole as of part-of the earth, for <lb/>
            instance, as of one of its clods. Wherefore, if <lb/>

            to upwards, or in any direction whatsoever? for instance, <lb/>
            if it were a clod of earth, in what direction will this be <lb/>
            moved, or in what place will it remain at rest? for the <lb/>
            place of the body naturally adapted to this will be infinite. <lb/>
            Will it, then, comprise the entire place ?2 and how will this <lb/>
            be so ? What, therefore, will be its place of rest and its <lb/>
            motion ? or shall we say that it will remain at rest every­ <lb/>
            where? it will not then be moved; or, shall we say that it <lb/>
            will be moved in every direction? it will not then stand still. <lb/>
            If the Universe, however, be of dissimilar parts, places, like­ <lb/>
            wise, would be dissimilar; and in the first instance, no doubt, <lb/>
            the body of the Universe would not be one, save in respect of <lb/>
            contact: in the next place, these things will be either finite <lb/>
            or infinite in species. That they should be finite is not <lb/>
            certainly, then, possible; for some, indeed, will be infinite, and <lb/>
            some not so, on the supposition3 that the Universe is in­ <lb/>
            finite-for instance, fire or water: and a thing of this kind <lb/>
            will be corruption to contraries. If, however, they are in­ <lb/>
            finite and simple, both the places will be infinite, and infinite <lb/>
            will be the elements; but if this is impossible, and the <lb/>
            places be finite in number, the Universe, also, must needs be <lb/>
            finite.</p>
          <p>7. Body cannot <lb/>
            be infinite <lb/>
            proved from <lb/>
            its affections;</p>
          <p>And, in general, it is impossible that there can <lb/>
            be an infinite body, and a place for bodies, if <lb/>
            every body that is cognisant by the senses in­ <lb/>
            volves gravity or lightness. For it will have <lb/>
            an impulse either towards the centre or upwards; it is <lb/>
            impossible, however, that the Infinite—either the whole or <lb/>
            the half, or any part whatsoever-should undergo a passive <lb/>
            state; for in what way would you make a division of it?4 or <lb/>

            direction downwards, and the other in a direction upwards ? <lb/>
            or how will this constitute the extremity, and that the centre ? <lb/>
            Further, every body that falls under the notice <lb/>
            of the senses subsists in place;1 and there are <lb/>
            six species of place: but it is impossible that <lb/>
            these should subsist in a body that is infinite. <lb/>
            and from its <lb/>
            necessary sub­ <lb/>
            sistence in <lb/>
            place. <lb/>
            And, upon the whole, if it is impossible that place should be <lb/>
            infinite, it is likewise impossible that body should be so; for <lb/>
            that which subsists in place is somewhere, and this signifies <lb/>
            a direction either upwards or downwards, or some one of <lb/>
            the rest of the categories; and each of these constitutes a <lb/>
            certain limit.</p>
          <p>But the Infinite is not the same in magnitude, <lb/>
            and motion, and duration, as if it were a certain <lb/>
            single nature; but that which is subsequent is <lb/>

            tion. <lb/>
            cedent: as, for instance, motion is denominated according to, <lb/>
            or conformably with, the magnitude in regard of which the <lb/>
            motion, or the alteration, or the increase, is brought about; <lb/>
            time, however, is reckoned or computed in consideration <lb/>

          <p>Now, that which undergoes a change is <lb/>
            changed partly, indeed, according to accident, <lb/>

            imparted. <lb/>
            going a change ; for example, whatsoever things are changed, <lb/>
            are changed according to parts : for the body is reduced to a <lb/>
            sound state of health because the eye is restored to a healthy <lb/>
            condition.2 Now, there is something which primarily is <note type="footnote"> 1 Propositions of this sort require the condition of experience to <lb/>

            moved in itself or essentially, and this is that which may <lb/>
            have motion impressed upon it from itself. And there is <lb/>
            also something of the same sort in the case of that which <lb/>
            imparts motion likewise; for one thing imparts motion ac­ <lb/>
            cording to accident, and another according to a portion, but <lb/>
            a third essentially or of itself: and there is something that is <lb/>
            the primary source of motion, and there is something that <lb/>
            has motion impressed upon it; further is there the time in <lb/>
            which, and there is the place from which, and the direction to­ <lb/>
            wards which, a thing is moved. But the forms, and passive <lb/>
            states, and place into which are moved the things that are being <lb/>
            moved, themselves are immovable, as science and heat; but <lb/>
            the heat does not constitute motion, yet the process of beating <lb/>
            does. The change, however, that does not ensue according to <lb/>
            accident does not reside in all things, but in contraries and <lb/>
            media, and in contradiction. But a reliance upon this state­ <lb/>
            ment may be drawn from induction.</p>
          <p>2. Three ge­ <lb/>
            nera of changes.</p>
          <p>Now, that which undergoes a change is changed <lb/>
            either from a subject into a subject, or from that <lb/>
            which is not a subject into a subject, or from <lb/>
            a subject into a non-subject, or from a non-subject into a <lb/>
            subject: 1 but I mean by a subject that which is made ma­ <lb/>
            nifest by affirmation. Wherefore, changes must needs be <lb/>
            three in number; for that which is from a non-subject into <lb/>
            a non-subject is not properly a change, for it subsists 2 neither <lb/>
            between contraries nor between contradiction, because there <lb/>
            is not opposition in the case of a transition from a non-subject <lb/>
            into a non-subject. The change, indeed, therefore, from that <lb/>
            which is a non-subject into a subject, according to contradic­ <lb/>
            tion, amounts to generation; and such a change, of course, <lb/>
            when simply considered, is simple generation, and when it is <lb/>
            partial, it is partial generation : but the change from subject <lb/>
            into that which is non-subject amounts to corruption, which, <lb/>
            when it is simply so, is simple corruption; but when it is <lb/>
            partial, it is partial corruption. <note type="footnote"> body is the eye : if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall <lb/>

            fariously,l and that according to composition or <lb/>
            division does not admit of being put in motion, <lb/>
            so neither can it be so with that according to <lb/>
            3. The relation <lb/>
            between motion <lb/>
            and these three <lb/>
            changes ex­ <lb/>
            plained. <lb/>
            capacity, which is opposed to that which subsists simply; for <lb/>
            a thing that is not white, or not good, nevertheless admits of <lb/>
            being moved according to accident: for that which is not <lb/>
            white may be a man ; but this cannot by any means be the <lb/>
            case with this particular thing which subsists simply: for it <lb/>
            is impossible that nonentity should be moved ; and, if this be <lb/>
            admitted, it is impossible, also, that generation amounts to <lb/>
            motion; for nonentity would be produced if it did, for in <lb/>
            such a case most especially would it be produced according to <lb/>
            accident; yet, nevertheless, it is true to assert of that which <lb/>
            is generated simply that a nonentity has a subsistence. In <lb/>
            like manner, also, stands the case with the being in a state of <lb/>
            rest And, doubtless, such are the difficulties that attend on <lb/>
            this hypothesis, even on the supposition that everything that <lb/>
            is being moved is in place; but what is a nonentity is not in <lb/>
            place, for it would be somewhere. Hence neither does cor­ <lb/>
            ruption constitute motion, for motion or rest is a thing that <lb/>
            is contrary to motion, but corruption is contrary to genera­ <lb/>
            tion. Since, however, every motion amounts to a certain <lb/>
            change, and there are three changes, as just now enumerated, <lb/>
            and of these the changes that ensue according to generation <lb/>
            and corruption are not motions-and these are those that sub­ <lb/>
            sist according to contradiction-it is necessary that the change <lb/>
            from subject into subject should alone constitute motion. <lb/>
            Subjects, however, are either contraries or media; and let <lb/>
            privation be considered as a thing that is contrary : and it is <lb/>
            made manifest by affirmation ; for instance, that which is <lb/>
            naked and toothless, and that which is black. <note type="footnote"> 1 Probably by the multifarious predication of the "non-ens" Aristotle <lb/>

          <p>I. No motion <lb/>
            according to <lb/>
            substance or <lb/>
            relation.</p>
          <p>IF, therefore, the categories are divided by <lb/>
            substance,1 quality, place, action or passion, rela­ <lb/>
            tion, quantity, there must needs subsist three <lb/>
            motions of quality, quantity, and of place; but <lb/>
            according to substance there does not subsist any motion on <lb/>
            account of there being nothing contrary to substance; nor is <lb/>
            there a motion of relation : for it is possible, when either of <lb/>
            the relatives has not undergone a change, that a verification <lb/>
            should take place in regard of the other, as having undergone <lb/>
            no change. Wherefore, the motion of these will subsist <lb/>
            according to accident.</p>
          <p>2. Why there is <lb/>
            not motion in <lb/>
            the case of ac­ <lb/>
            tion or of pas­ <lb/>
            sion.</p>
          <p>Neither is there a motion of that which is <lb/>
            active and passive, or of that which is the effi­ <lb/>
            cient cause of motion, and has motion impressed <lb/>
            upon it, because there is not a motion of motion, <lb/>
            nor a generation of generation, nor, in general, a change of <lb/>
            a change. For in two ways is it possible that there be a <lb/>
            motion of a motion; first, either as of a subject-for instance, <lb/>
            as man is moved because from white he is changed into <lb/>
            black; wherefore, thus also is it with motion, either a thing <lb/>
            is made warm or cold, or undergoes alteration in place or <lb/>
            increase : this, however, is impossible ; for the change does <lb/>
            not amount to any of the subjects ;-or, secondly, there may <lb/>
            subsist a motion of motion, in respect of some different <lb/>
            subject from change being altered into a different form, as <lb/>
            man is changed from sickness into health. Neither, however, <lb/>
            is this possible, except according to accident; for every motion <lb/>
            constitutes a change from one thing into another: and, in <lb/>
            like manner, the case stands with generation and corruption, <lb/>
            except that those changes, I admit, that are wrought from <lb/>
            things that are opposed in this or that way are not motions.</p>
          <p>3. This point <lb/>
            illustrated.</p>
          <p>At the same time, then, is man changed from <lb/>
            health into disease, and from this very change <lb/>
            into a different one. It is, therefore, evident that when a <lb/>
            man shall have become indisposed he shall undergo a change <lb/>
            into a disease of some sort or other; for it is admissible for <lb/>
            such to remain in a state of rest: and, further, it is evident <note type="footnote"> 1 Vide Categories, chap. iv. </note> <pb n="313"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. XII.] <lb/>
            </note>that he will not be changed into that state which is irvari' <lb/>
            ably casual, and that will amount to a change from some­ <lb/>
            thing into something else, so that health will be an opposite <lb/>
            motion, but from accident; as, for instance, one undergoes <lb/>
            an alteration from memory into oblivion, because that wherein <lb/>
            oblivion is inherent undergoes a change, sometimes into <lb/>
            scientific knowledge, and sometimes into health.</p>
          <p>Further will the progression advance on to <lb/>
            infinity, if there will subsist a change of a changer <lb/>
            and a generation of a generation. Therefore, <lb/>
            also, must there be the former on the supposi­ <lb/>
            tion that there is the latter ; for instance, if the <lb/>
            simple act of generation take place at any time, <lb/>
            4. Motion, in <lb/>
            case of action <lb/>
            or passion, <lb/>
            would presup­ <lb/>
            pose an infinite <lb/>
            progression of <lb/>
            Changes; <lb/>
            that also which is being generated simply has been produced. <lb/>
            Wherefore, not as yet in existence would be that which is <lb/>
            being produced simply; but something does exist that is being <lb/>
            generated or produced, or which already has been generated. <lb/>
            If, therefore, also, this thing once was generated, for what <lb/>
            reason was that not yet in existence which is being then gene­ <lb/>
            rated ? Since, however, as regards things that are infinite there <lb/>
            does not subsist anything that is primary, there will not be <lb/>
            that which is first generated, and for this cause neither that <lb/>
            which is in order consequential. Therefore, that any of these <lb/>
            either should be generated, or be moved, or undergo any <lb/>
            change, is not possible. further, contrary <lb/>
            motion, and rest, and generation, and corruption, <lb/>
            will belong to the same subject. Wherefore, a <lb/>
            thing that is being generated, when it may <lb/>
            as well as con­ <lb/>
            trary motion, <lb/>
            &amp;c., in the <lb/>
            same subject; <lb/>
            become that which is being generated, is then undergoing a <lb/>
            process of corruption ; for neither is it immediately corrupted <lb/>
            as soon as it is generated, nor subsequently to this; for that <lb/>
            must necessarily exist which is undergoing a process of cor­ <lb/>
            ruption. Further, it is the case that matter <lb/>
            ought to subsist under that which is being gene­ <lb/>
            rated and undergoing a change.2 Therefore, <lb/>
            and matter as <lb/>
            the subject of <lb/>
            the change. <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristotle had already exposed the absurdity of such a system as <lb/>

            what matter will there subsist in like manner as an alterable <lb/>
            body or soul? in this way, also, anything that subsists on <lb/>
            being produced constitutes either motion or generation. <lb/>
            And, further, what is that into which the thing is moved <lb/>
            for it is necessary that something amount to the motion ot <lb/>
            this particular thing from this particular thing into that, and <lb/>
            yet that it should not be motion at all. How, let me ask, <lb/>
            then, is this to take place ? for the generation of discipline <lb/>
            does not amount to discipline; so neither is it true to say <lb/>
            that there will subsist a generation of generation.</p>
          <p>5. It is accord­ <lb/>
            ing to quality, <lb/>
            quantity, and <lb/>
            place that mo­ <lb/>

          <p>Since, however, there is not in existence motion <lb/>
            either of substance, or of relation, or of action <lb/>
            and passion, it remains that there should subsist <lb/>
            motion according to quality, and quantity, and <lb/>
            ptace, for to each of these cloth there belong contrariety. Now, <lb/>
            I mean by motion according to quality not that which is <lb/>
            found in substance—for difference also constitutes quality:.­ <lb/>
            but that which is passive, in accordance with which a thing <lb/>
            is said to be passive or to be devoid of passion.</p>

            movable, and that which, upon the whole, it is <lb/>
            impossible should have motion impressed upon <lb/>
            it, and that which with difficulty, in a long <lb/>
            portion of duration, or slowly, commences its motion, and that <lb/>
            which having been by nature, no doubt, adapted for having <lb/>
            motion imparted to it, yet does not possess the capacity or <lb/>
            ability of being moved when it is naturally fitted for motion­ <lb/>
            both as to the place where and the manner how—this is <lb/>
            what I term merely a condition of rest amongst those things <lb/>
            that are immovable; for rest is a thing that is contrary to <lb/>
            motion.</p>

          <p>Wherefore, it would amount to a privation of <lb/>
            that which is receptive or capable of motion ; and <lb/>
            things are said to be moved according to place at <lb/>
            the same time as many as are to be found in one <lb/>

            first to proceed which is undergoing a change, before it <lb/>
            arrives at that into which it is ultimately changed—I mean, <lb/>
            what is uninterruptedly undergoing a change according to the <lb/>
            constitution of nature.</p>
          <p>A thing is contrary1 in regard of place which <lb/>
            in a straight line is at the greatest distance pos­ <lb/>
            sible : and a thing is successive between which <lb/>

            and that to which it is consequent there subsists no interven­ <lb/>
            ing medium of things in the same genus; for instance, lines <lb/>
            are successive to a line, or monads are successive to a monad, <lb/>
            or a house to a house. There is no hindrance, however, to <lb/>
            there subsisting any other medium between them; for that <lb/>
            which is successive belongs to something in succession, and <lb/>
            is something that is subsequent: for one is not successive tc <lb/>
            two, nor are the Kalends to the Nones.2 And a thing is <lb/>
            coherent which, being successive, is in contact. Since, how­ <lb/>
            ever, every change takes place in those things that are <lb/>
            opposed, and these are contraries and contradiction, and <lb/>
            since of contraction there is nothing that is a medium, it is <lb/>
            evident that, <unclear>in</unclear> contraries there subsists a medium. And <lb/>
            that which is continuous is that which has <lb/>
            something of the nature of the coherent, or of <lb/>
            as well as of <lb/>
            continuity. <lb/>
            that which is in a state of contact. And a thing is called <lb/>
            continuous when the extremity of either of the parts by <lb/>
            which they are in contact, and in continuity, may be one <lb/>
            and the same. Wherefore, it is evident that what is con­ <lb/>
            tinuous is to be found amongst those things from which, <lb/>
            as compounds, there subsists any one thing naturally adapted <lb/>
            for being generated according to contact.</p>
          <p>And that what is successive ranks as what is <lb/>
            primary is evident likewise; for everything that <lb/>

            or substance.</p>
          <p>THE present speculation is concerned about <lb/>
            substance; for the first principles and causes of <lb/>
            substances are under investigation. For both <lb/>
            if the Universe be as one whole, substance con­ <lb/>
            stitutes the earliest portion; and if things subsist in a conse­ <lb/>
            quent order, in this way, likewise, would substance be first, <lb/>
            and next quality, then2 quantity. But at the same time <lb/>
            neither, so to say, are these, simply considered, entities, but <lb/>
            qualities and motions, in the same manner even as that <lb/>
            which is not whole and that which is not straight. There­ <lb/>
            fore, we say that these also are in existence; for instance, <lb/>
            that such a thing is not white. Further, still no one of the <lb/>
            others possesses a separable subsistence. <note type="footnote"> 1 This is a remarkable book-book XI., or, according to others, book <lb/>
            XII. Some of the principles laid down in it have already been enunciated. <lb/>
            The chief aim of Aristotle, however, is to endeavour to ascertain the <lb/>
            number of the primary substances, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρω̑ται οὐσίαι</foreign> : and this inquiry is <lb/>
            based on the assumption that over these presides a certain substance, <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin"> CH. II.] </note> And to the truth of this statement bear wit­ <lb/>
            ness also, in reality, the Philosophers of Anti­ <lb/>
            quity; for they from time to time have inves­ <lb/>
            tigated into the first principles, and elements, <lb/>
            2. This con­ <lb/>
            firmed from <lb/>
            ancient and <lb/>
            modern philo­ <lb/>
            sophy. <lb/>
            and causes of substance. Those, to be sure, that are Philoso­ <lb/>
            phers, now-a-days, have in preference sought to establish <lb/>
            universals as substances; for the genera are universals-which <lb/>
            they say are first principles and substances-rather on account <lb/>
            of their examining them logically. The Philosophers, how­ <lb/>
            ever, of old regarded singulars as substances-for example, <lb/>
            fire and earth-but not a common body.</p>
          <p>Now, substances are three in number; one, <lb/>
            indeed, is cognisant by sense, the existence of <lb/>
            which all acknowledge; and one part of this is <lb/>
            eternal,1 and the other subject to decay, as plants <lb/>
            and animals: but of the eternal portion of it, it is <lb/>
            necessary that we should admit as elements either <lb/>
            3. The differ­ <lb/>
            ent classes of <lb/>
            substances <lb/>
            prove the ne­ <lb/>
            cessity of such <lb/>
            a science as <lb/>
            metaphysics. <lb/>
            one or many. But another substance is immovable: and this, <lb/>
            some say, involves a separable subsistence; amongst whom <lb/>
            some make a division of it into two; others, however, rank <lb/>
            into one nature forms and mathematical entities: whereas <lb/>
            others of these admit mathematical entities only as subsist­ <lb/>
            ing. The substances that are cognisant by sense belong, then, <lb/>
            of course, to the department of physical science, for they in­ <lb/>
            volve a connexion with motion; but the immovable substance <lb/>
            belongs to a different science, on the supposition that this <lb/>
            possesses no first principle in common with the others.</p>

          <p>SUBSTANCE cognisant by the senses, however, <lb/>
            is susceptible of change. Now, on the suppo­ <lb/>
            sition that change takes place from things that <lb/>
            are opposed, or such as are media, and not from <lb/>
            1. Change pre­ <lb/>
            supposes a . <lb/>
            something as <lb/>
            the subject of <lb/>
            that change. <lb/>
            all things that are opposites—for the voice is not a thing <lb/>
            that is white-but from that which is contrary, it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary that something, also, subsist capable of undergoing an <lb/>
            alteration into contrariety ; for contraries do not undergo <unclear>a</unclear> <note type="footnote"> 1 Vide book VII. chap. L </note> <pb n="318"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK XI </note> <lb/>
            change. Further,1 does this, no doubt, continue permanent; <lb/>
            that which is contrary, however, does not continue perma­ <lb/>
            neat ; and hence doth there subsist a something third beside <lb/>
            contraries—namely, matter. If, therefore,2 changes are foul <lb/>
            in number, either according to quiddity, or according to <lb/>
            quality, or quantity, or the place where ; and if simple gene­ <lb/>
            ration, indeed, and corruption be what subsist according to <lb/>
            quiddity, and increase and diminution be what subsist ac­ <lb/>
            cording to quantity, and alteration be that according to <lb/>
            passion, and motion be that according to place-allowing all <lb/>
            this to be the case, the several changes would take place into <lb/>
            contrarieties : I mean, such as are involved in singulars. <lb/>
            Therefore, it is necessary that matter should undergo a change <lb/>
            which can pass into both.</p>
          <p>2. Change is a <lb/>
            transition from <lb/>
            a state of capa­ <lb/>
            city into that <lb/>
            of energy.</p>
          <p>Since entity, however, is twofold, everything <lb/>
            which undergoes a change is changed from that <lb/>
            which is an entity in capacity into that which <lb/>
            is an entity in energy; as, for example, from <lb/>
            what is white in capacity, or potentiality, into that which is <lb/>
            white in energy: and in like manner, also, does the case stand <lb/>
            with increase and diminution. Wherefore, not only accord­ <lb/>
            ing to accident is it possible that all things be generated <lb/>
            from nonentity, but likewise from entity do all things <lb/>
            derive their generation—I speak of what is an entity in <lb/>
            capacity deriving its generation from a nonentity in energy <lb/>
            or activity.</p>
          <p>3. Illustrated <lb/>
            by the tenets of <lb/>
            Anaxagoras, <lb/>
            Anaximander, <lb/>
            and others.</p>
          <p>And this is the unit of Anaxagoras;3 (for it is <lb/>
            better to maintain this than the tenet of certain <lb/>
            speculators who are of opinion that all things <lb/>
            subsist simultaneously;) and it is tantamount to <lb/>
            the philosophic dogma of mixture adopted by Empedocles <note type="footnote"> 1 Bekker begins chap. ii. with these words. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Aristotle's doctrine is this : there are four changes; these changes <lb/>
            are all changes into contraries—contraries themselves undergo no <lb/>
            change, but they presuppose something as the subject of the changes, <lb/>
            that is, the matter, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕλη</foreign>. Thus, there are four changes, but three first <lb/>
            principles, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀυχαί</foreign>-namely, form, privation, and contrariety. Vide <lb/>
            Physics, book V. chap. i. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Anaxagoras, according to Aristotle, held this very tenet that he <lb/>
            now mentions parenthetically—namely, that <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάντα ὁμοῦ ἦν</foreign>, or that “all <lb/>
            things were one potentially." Some dogma akin to this, I conceive, is <lb/>
            what he means by the unit of Anaxagoras. </note> <pb n="319"/>

            and Anaximander ;1 and resembles the theory of Democritus <lb/>
            viz. that all things subsisted in capacity simultaneously, and <lb/>
            not in energy. Wherefore, in this case they would touch upon <lb/>
            matter, that is, the material cause. All things, <lb/>
            however, involve matter as many as undergo <lb/>
            a change; but entities involve different matter <lb/>
            4. Confirmation <lb/>
            of the fore­ <lb/>
            going. <lb/>
            from oue another:2 and of the things that are eternal as <lb/>
            many as are not generable, but movable by an orbital mo­ <lb/>
            tion, possess matter, yet such matter as is not generable, but <lb/>
            is merely moved from this place towards that.</p>
          <p>Now, one might raise the question, from what <lb/>
            sort of nonentity generation could arise ? for <lb/>
            nonentity subsists in a threefold way. If, there­ <lb/>
            fore, there subsists aught in capacity, from this <lb/>
            5. From what <lb/>
            kind of non­ <lb/>
            entity does <lb/>
            generation <lb/>
            arise? <lb/>
            will generation subsist; yet, nevertheless, not from anything <lb/>
            whatsoever without distinction, but one thing will be gene­ <lb/>
            rated from another. Neither is it sufficient to say that all <lb/>
            things subsist simultaneously ; for entities differ in matter : <lb/>
            since why would things infinite in number be generated, but <lb/>
            not one thing ? for the faculty 3 of the human understanding <lb/>
            is one. Wherefore, if likewise matter be one, that would <lb/>
            have been generated also in energy the matter even of which <lb/>
            would subsist in capacity.</p>
          <p>Therefore are there three causes, and three <lb/>
            first principles,-two, indeed, amounting to con- <lb/>
            6. Recapitula­ <lb/>
            tion. <lb/>
            trariety,—of which one sort constitutes the formal principle <lb/>
            and the species, and the second privation; but the third <lb/>
            cause is matter.</p>

          <p>AFTER these inquiries there remains for us <lb/>
            to make our readers aware that neither matter <lb/>
            nor form is generated.4 Now, I speak thus of <lb/>

          <p>After these inquiries we must show how that <lb/>
            each substance is generated from one synony­ <lb/>
            mous with itself; for those things that are being <lb/>
            generated by Nature, as well as other things, are <lb/>
            substances. For things are produced either by Art, or Nature, <lb/>
            or Chance, or Spontaneity.1 Art, indeed, therefore, con­ <lb/>
            stitutes a first principle which subsists in another subject, <lb/>
            whereas Nature constitutes a first principle which subsists in <lb/>
            the thing itself; for man begets man : and the remaining <lb/>
            causes are the privations of these. Substances likewise are <lb/>
            three in number, and one of these is matter; which is this <lb/>
            certain particular thing in consequence of its appearance as <lb/>
            such; for as many things as are one by contact, and not by <lb/>
            cohesion, constitute matter and a. subject: but another of <lb/>
            these substances is Nature, which likewise is this certain par­ <lb/>
            ticular thing, and into Nature is there the transition of a <lb/>
            certain habit. Further, the third substance is that which <lb/>
            subsists from these, and is ranked as a singular; for example, <lb/>
            Socrates or Callias.</p>
          <p>3. Forms,if they <lb/>
            subsist, must <lb/>
            be found in <lb/>
            composite sub­ <lb/>
            stances ;</p>
          <p>As regards.2 some things, therefore, this <lb/>
            certain particular thing involves no subsistence <lb/>
            independent of a composite substance, as the <lb/>
            form of a house, unless art constitutes this form. <lb/>
            Neither is- there any generation and corruption of these, but <lb/>
            after a different manner they are, and are not, both the house <lb/>
            itself, which is unconnected with matter, and health, and <lb/>
            everything that is produced according to art; but if forms <lb/>
            subsist, they subsist in the case of those things that are <note type="footnote"> in the following sentence, Aristotle means what we may trace pheno­ <lb/>
            mena ultimately to-as, for example, all things are resolvable into <unclear>2</unclear> <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. IV.] </note> <lb/>
            generated by Nature. Wherefore, doubtless, not <lb/>
            injudiciously affirmed Plato that forms belong to <lb/>
            those things as many as involve a natural sub­ <lb/>
            sistence, on the supposition of the existence of <lb/>
            forms different from, or independent of, these ; <lb/>
            or, as Plato has <lb/>
            it, in things <lb/>
            that derive <lb/>
            their sub­ <lb/>
            sistences from <lb/>
            Nature. <lb/>
            as, for example, fire, flesh, the head, and so forth. For all <lb/>
            these things are matter, and belong to substance especially <lb/>
            — I mean, such a description of matter as is ultimate.</p>
          <p>Some causes,1 therefore, that are those that <lb/>
            impart motion subsist as entities that have been <lb/>
            previously generated, whereas other causes which <lb/>
            subsist as the formal principle are simultane- <lb/>
            4. Causes <lb/>
            either prior to <lb/>
            their effects or <lb/>
            coincident with <lb/>
            them. <lb/>
            ously generated with their results; for when a man is in <lb/>
            sound health then also is there present with him sound <lb/>
            health, and the form of the brazen sphere subsists simul­ <lb/>
            taneously with the brazen sphere.</p>
          <p>And whether, also, there remains anything <lb/>
            subsequently to the separation of form from the <lb/>
            subject of form, we must examine ; for in the case <lb/>
            of some forms there is no hindrance to this <lb/>
            taking place ; as if soul were a thing of this de­ <lb/>
            scription : not, to be sure, every soul, but the un- <lb/>
            5. The separa­ <lb/>
            bility of form <lb/>
            from its subject <lb/>
            in some cases is <lb/>
            no argument in <lb/>
            favour of the <lb/>
            ideal hypothe­ <lb/>
            sis. <lb/>
            derstanding; for that this should be so with every soul is not, <lb/>
            perhaps, a thing that is possible. It is evident, therefore, <lb/>
            that there is no necessity that on account of these, at least, <lb/>
            ideas should have an existence; for man begets man, the <lb/>
            singular begets a certain individual. And in like manner <lb/>
            does the case stand with the arts; for the medicinal art is the <lb/>
            formal principle of health.</p>

          <p>AND as regards causes and first principles,2 <lb/>
            in a manner are they different according as they <lb/>
            belong to different things, and in a manner this <lb/>

            different prin­ <lb/>
            ciples ? <lb/>
            is not the case. Supposing one to express himself universally, <lb/>
            end according to analogy the causes and first principles of <note type="footnote">1 This is an erroneous principle in causation. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Vide book II. chap. iv. </note><note type="footnote">T </note> <pb n="322"/>

            2. Are the ele­ <lb/>
            menta of sub­ <lb/>
            stances and <lb/>
            relatives the <lb/>
            same ? <lb/>
            all things will be the same. For one might raise <lb/>
            the question as to whether the first principles <lb/>
            and elements of substances, and of things which <lb/>
            subsist as relatives, are different or the same? <lb/>
            and, therefore, in like manner is it the case with each of the <lb/>
            categories. But it would be absurd if there were the same <lb/>
            principles and elements of all things, for from the same <lb/>
            things will relatives derive their subsistence as well as sub­ <lb/>
            stance. What, therefore, will this be? for besides substance <lb/>
            and the rest of the things that are predicated there is <lb/>
            nothing that is in common. Prior, however, is the element <lb/>
            to those things of which it is an element; but, assuredly, <lb/>
            neither is substance an element of relatives, nor is any of <lb/>
            or is it the case <lb/>
            with all things ? <lb/>
            these an element of substance. Further, how is <lb/>
            it admissible that there should be the same <lb/>
            elements of all things? for none of the elements can be the <lb/>
            same with that which is a composite nature of the elements; <lb/>
            as, for instance, neither B nor A can be the same with BA. <lb/>
            Neither, therefore, is it possible that any one element of <lb/>
            those natures that are intelligible-as, for example, unity or <lb/>
            entity-can be the element of all things; for these are pre­ <lb/>
            sent with each of the compound natures likewise. No one of <lb/>
            them, therefore, will have a subsistence either as substance or <lb/>
            relation; but it will be a thing expedient,1 however, that they <lb/>
            should subsist in some form or other. The elements, then, of <lb/>
            all things are not the same.</p>
          <p>3. Analogically <lb/>
            are the princi­ <lb/>
            ples and ele­ <lb/>
            ments of all <lb/>
            things the <lb/>
            same.</p>
          <p>Or, shall we say—just as we have already <lb/>
            affirmed—that in one way this is the case, and <lb/>
            in another that it is not ? as, perhaps, in regard of <lb/>
            sensible bodies that which is hot subsists in one <lb/>
            way as form, and after another mode that which <lb/>
            is cold subsists as the privation thereof: but matter subsists <lb/>
            as that which primarily and essentially constitutes both of <lb/>
            these in capacity; substances, however, are both these and <lb/>
            such as consist of those things of which these are the first prin­ <lb/>
            ciples. Or, if any one thing is generated from what is hot <lb/>
            and from what is cold, as flesh or bone, still that which <lb/>
            is produced from thence must needs be different from these. <lb/>
            The first principles and elements of these, I admit, then, are <lb/>
            the same, yet there are different elements of different things, <note type="footnote"> 1 I have added these words to complete the sense. </note> <pb n="323"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. IV.] </note> <lb/>
            and, without doubt, we cannot say that the case stands in <lb/>
            this way with all things; but analogically are the elements <lb/>
            and first principles of all things the same : just as if one <lb/>
            should say that there are three first principles in existence- <lb/>
            namely, form, and privation, and matter; each of these, how­ <lb/>
            ever, is different according as it is conversant about every <lb/>
            genus, as in colour, white, black, surface, light, darkness, air ; <lb/>
            and from these emerge forth day and night.</p>
          <p>Since, however, not only things, that are inhe­ <lb/>
            rent are causes, but also causes of things that <lb/>
            are external-as, for example, in the case of what <lb/>
            4. Causes and <lb/>
            elements com­ <lb/>
            pared together. <lb/>
            imparts motion-it is evident that a first principle is a dif­ <lb/>
            ferent thing from an element; yet both are causes, and into <lb/>
            these is a first principle divided : but what subsists as that <lb/>
            which imparts motion or rest constitutes a certain first prin­ <lb/>
            ciple and substance.</p>
          <p>Wherefore, there are in existence three elements, <lb/>
            indeed, according to analogy, but four causes and <lb/>
            5. Elements <lb/>
            threefold. <lb/>
            first principles; and a different cause subsists where the subject <lb/>
            is different, and the first cause constitutes, as it were, that <lb/>
            which imparts motion, and is different according as the sub­ <lb/>
            ject is different. Thus, health is as form, disease as priva­ <lb/>
            tion, body as matter: that which imparts motion is the <lb/>
            medicinal art. Again, a house is as form, this certain sort of <lb/>
            confusion1 as privation ; the bricks are as matter, and that <lb/>
            which imparts motion, or the efficient cause, is the builder's <lb/>
            art. And into these, therefore, is a first principle divided.</p>
          <p>But since that which imparts motion in phy­ <lb/>
            sical or natural things is a man, and in things <lb/>
            springing from the understanding form, or the <lb/>
            6. Causes <lb/>
            threefold or <lb/>
            fourfold. <lb/>
            contrary, in one respect would there be three causes, and in <lb/>
            another four ; for the medicinal art constitutes in a manner <lb/>
            health, and the building art the form of the house, and mail <lb/>
            begets man ; further, beside these-as that which is the first <lb/>
            of all things-is that which imparts motion, or is the efficient <lb/>
            cause, to all things. <note type="footnote"> 1 That is, the materials of the house before they are reduced by th&lt; <lb/>

          <p>1. Substances <lb/>
            the principles <lb/>
            of all things.</p>
          <p>AND since some things involve a separable1 <lb/>
            subsistence, and some do not involve a sepa­ <lb/>
            rable subsistence, the former are substances; <lb/>
            and on this account these are the causes of all things, because <lb/>
            the passive states and motions of things do not involve a <lb/>
            subsistence independent of substances. In the next place, <lb/>
            perhaps, will these constitute soul and body, or understanding, <lb/>
            and appetite, and body.</p>
          <p>2. The same­ <lb/>
            ness of the <lb/>
            principles of <lb/>
            all things illus­ <lb/>
            trated in the <lb/>
            case of energy <lb/>
            and capacity.</p>
          <p>Moreover, in another manner analogically are <lb/>
            first principles the same; for example, take the <lb/>
            instances of energy and capacity. These, how­ <lb/>
            ever, are both different according as the subjects <lb/>
            of them are different, and they subsist in diffe­ <lb/>
            rent ways; for in certain bodies the same thing <lb/>
            subsists sometimes in energy and sometimes in capacity-as <lb/>
            wine, or flesh, or a man. But also do these fall under the <lb/>
            category of the causes above enumerated; for form consti­ <lb/>
            tutes an energy, no doubt, if it be that which has a separable <lb/>
            subsistence, and which is compounded from both: and this is <lb/>
            the case with privation,-for instance, darkness, or a creature <lb/>
            that is sick; but matter subsists in capacity, for this is that <lb/>
            which is endued with the capability of becoming both. But <lb/>
            after another mode do those things differ in energy and <lb/>
            capacity of which the matter is not the same, and of which <lb/>
            the form is not the same, but different,—as a cause of man <lb/>
            are both the elements fire and earth, as matter; and his <lb/>
            proper form, and if there is anything else extrinsic—I mean, <lb/>
            such as his father; and beside these the sun and the oblique <lb/>
            circle, which constitute neither matter, nor'form, nor priva­ <lb/>
            tion, nor are of the same species, but are motive natures.</p>
          <p>3. Universal <lb/>
            causes practi­ <lb/>
            cally have no <lb/>
            existence.</p>
          <p>And, further, it is expedient for us to perceive <lb/>
            that as regards causes it is possible to enumerate <lb/>
            some that are universal and some that are not; <lb/>
            therefore, the original first principles of all things <lb/>
            are that which subsists in energy as this first thing, and <lb/>
            something else which subsists in potentiality. Those, indeed. <note type="footnote"> 1Aristotle in this chapter is preparing the way for establishing the <lb/>
            existence of the First Substance </note> <pb n="325"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. V.] </note> <lb/>
            therefore, that are universals have not any subsistence; for <lb/>
            the singular constitutes a first principle of singulars: for <lb/>
            man, to be sure, is the principle1 of universal man, yet there <lb/>
            is no universal man; but Peleus is the cause of Achilles, and <lb/>
            your father of you, and this particular letter B is the cause <lb/>
            of this syllable BA, and, in short, B of BA absolutely.</p>
          <p>In the next place, the forms of substances are <lb/>
            first principles; but there are different causes and <lb/>
            elements of different things, as has been declared: <lb/>
            thus, of the things that are not contained in the <lb/>
            4. The univer­ <lb/>
            sal causes of <lb/>
            different things <lb/>
            may be the <lb/>
            same. <lb/>
            same genus, such as colours, sounds, substances, quantity, the <lb/>
            elements are not the same, except analogically: the causes, <lb/>
            likewise, of those things that are contained in the same <lb/>
            species are different, but they are not different in species; <lb/>
            but because the matter of singulars is a thing that is dif­ <lb/>
            ferent, both your matter and form, and that which imparts <lb/>
            motion and the species, differ in number from mine, though, <lb/>
            according to the formal principle of the universal, they are <lb/>
            the same.</p>
          <p>Therefore, as to the inquiry, what are first <lb/>
            principles or elements of substances, and rela­ <lb/>
            tions, and qualities, as to whether they are the <lb/>
            same or different?2 it is evident that, if they <lb/>
            are predicated multifariously, there are the same <lb/>
            principles and elements belonging to everything; <lb/>
            5. How to de­ <lb/>
            cide the ques­ <lb/>
            tion as to the <lb/>
            sameness or <lb/>
            diversity of the <lb/>
            principles of <lb/>
            things. <lb/>
            but, if they are divided, there are not the same, but different <lb/>
            first principles of everything, unless that, also, in a certain <lb/>
            respect there are the same principles of all things. Thus, they <lb/>
            are the same analogically, I admit, because there is matter, <lb/>
            form, privation, that which imparts motion: and in that way <lb/>
            the causes of substances are as the causes of all things, be­ <lb/>
            cause, on the supposition of substances being destroyed, all <lb/>
            things are destroyed. Further, that which is first subsists in <lb/>
            actuality, and in this way are these primaries different,-as <lb/>
            many as are contraries,—seeing that they neither are predi­ <lb/>
            cated as genera, nor denominated multifariously; further. <lb/>
            likewise, are there different kinds of matter that are styled <lb/>
            causes. What, therefore, the first principles of sensibles are, <note type="footnote"> 1 This is a favourite principle with Aristotle, and one which he puts <lb/>

            substance ne­ <lb/>
            cessarily an <lb/>
            - energy, proved <lb/>
            from the nature <lb/>
            of time and <lb/>
            motion.</p>
          <p>BUT since there have appeared three sub­ <lb/>
            stances-two, indeed, that are natural or physical, <lb/>
            and one which is immovable-regarding this im­ <lb/>
            movable substance we must endeavour to esta­ <lb/>
            blish that it is necessary that it should constitute <lb/>
            a certain eternal substance, one which is im­ <lb/>
            movable; for the first of entities are substances; and if we <lb/>
            suppose all of them to be corruptible, all things are corrup­ <lb/>
            tible. It is impossible, however, that in such a case motion <lb/>
            should be either generated, or that it should be corrupted, <lb/>
            for it was always in existence; nor is this possible with dura­ <lb/>
            tion ; for it is not possible that there can be that which is <lb/>
            prior and subsequent, on the supposition that time or dura­ <lb/>
            tion has no existence: and motion, then, in this way is con­ <lb/>
            tinuous, as also duration; for duration either is the same as <lb/>
            motion,2 or it is a certain passive condition of motion. But <lb/>
            there is not any motion that is continuous save that which is <lb/>
            local or topical, and to this belongs the motion that is <lb/>
            circular; but, doubtless, if there is anything that is fit for <lb/>
            being moved, or that is productive, but not anything that <lb/>
            energizes, in this case motion has no existence; for it is <lb/>
            admissible that what involves capacity should not energize.</p>
          <p>2. The eternity <lb/>
            of substances <lb/>
            of no value, un­ <lb/>
            less in con­ <lb/>
            nexion with <lb/>
            the preexist­ <lb/>
            ence of energy.</p>
          <p>There would, then, be no advantage gained,3 <lb/>
            not even if we could make substances eternal, <lb/>
            as those do who constitute as such the forms or <lb/>
            ideas, unless there will be inherent some first <lb/>
            principle capable of working a change. There­ <lb/>
            fore, neither would this be competent for such, <note type="footnote"> <unclear>1The</unclear> reasoning contained in this chapter is well worthy of attention. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 We are reminded by this passage of Locke on Succession. Vide <lb/>

            the priority of energy, as a principle, to all things; for instance, he <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. VI.] </note> <lb/>
            nor would there be any other substance different from, or in­ <lb/>
            dependent of, the forms; for, on the supposition that it will <lb/>
            not energize, there will be no motion in existence. Further, <lb/>
            neither will this be the case if the substance will energize, <lb/>
            but if the substance thereof constitutes capacity; for there <lb/>
            will not be in existence a perpetual motion, for it is possible <lb/>
            that that which subsists in capacity should not exist. It is, <lb/>
            therefore, necessary, that there should be a first principle of <lb/>
            this kind whereof the substance constitutes an energy.</p>
          <p>Further, therefore, it is necessary that these <lb/>
            substances do not involve a connexion with <lb/>
            matter.1 For it is requisite that they should be <lb/>
            eternal, if, in sooth, there is also at least, any­ <lb/>
            a. Why such <lb/>
            first substance <lb/>
            must be imma­ <lb/>
            terial. <lb/>
            thing else that is everlasting. It is, then, in energy that they <lb/>
            subsist. Although this involves a matter of doubt; for it <lb/>
            appears to be the case that what energizes should subsist <lb/>
            entirely in a state of potentiality: but that everything that <lb/>
            is endued with capacity should not altogether energize. <lb/>
            Wherefore, we may assume that potentiality is a thing that <lb/>
            is antecedent to energy. But, surely, if this be the case, no <lb/>
            one of the entities will be in existence; for it is possible <lb/>
            that a thing possess a capacity of existence, but that yet it <lb/>
            should not be in existence.</p>
          <p>If the case, however, stands as the Theologians <lb/>
            affirm—I mean, those who are for generating all <lb/>
            things from Night2—or as the Natural Philo­ <lb/>
            sophers, who say that all things subsisted simul­ <lb/>
            taneously, the same impossibility will ensue. <lb/>
            For how, let me ask, will matter be put in <lb/>
            4. The neces­ <lb/>
            sity of this <lb/>
            efficient first <lb/>
            cause involved <lb/>
            in the theories <lb/>
            of the physi­ <lb/>
            cists and theo­ <lb/>
            logians. <lb/>
            motion if nothing that subsists in energy will be a cause ? for <lb/>
            the matter of a house, at least, will not itself move itself, but <lb/>
            the builders art will; nor does the menstrual blood move <lb/>
            itself, nor earth, but seeds, and human seed.</p>
          <p>Wherefore, some have recourse to an energy <lb/>
            that is always in action, as Leucippus and Plato; <lb/>
            for they maintain that motion is always in exist­ <lb/>
            ence : but why, and in what way, they do not <lb/>
            5. Hence the <lb/>
            Platonic dogma <lb/>
            of perpetual <lb/>
            motion. <lb/>
            state, nor how this is the case; nor do they assign the cause <lb/>
            of this perpetuity of motion. For nothing is put in motion <note type="footnote"> 1 This is most important as coming from Aristotle. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Vide Hesiod, Theog. lid. </note> <pb n="328"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK XI. </note> <lb/>
            at random; but it is necessary that there be something always <lb/>
            in subsistence: as now, indeed, one thing is by nature moved <lb/>
            in this way, and again is moved by force, either by Mind, or <lb/>
            something else, after a different manner.</p>
          <p>6. This dogma <lb/>
            really assumes <lb/>
            the priority of <lb/>
            energy.</p>
          <p>Then, what sort is the first motion ? tor this <lb/>
            inevitably differs as much as possible. But, <lb/>
            certainly, neither is it possible for Plato, at least, <lb/>
            to call that a first principle which imparts motion <lb/>
            to itself, and which he sometimes considers to be a first <lb/>
            principle; for subsequent to, and yet coincident with, the <lb/>
            heaven is the soul, as he says.1 Therefore, the supposition <lb/>
            of the priority of potentiality to energy is in a manner a <lb/>
            correct one, but in a manner is not so. And how this is <lb/>
            correct has been declared.</p>
          <p>7. The fore­ <lb/>
            going reason. <lb/>
            ing confirmed <lb/>
            by Anaxagoras, <lb/>
            Empedocles, <lb/>
            and the Theog­ <lb/>
            nists.</p>
          <p>But that energy may be a thing that is ante­ <lb/>
            cedent to potentiality Anaxagoras testifies, (for <lb/>
            the understanding subsists in energy,) and Empe <lb/>
            docles, in his theory about Harmony and Discord; <lb/>
            and this is confirmed in the assertion of certain <lb/>
            philosophers, as to the existence of perpetual <lb/>
            motion, as Leucippus. Wherefore, not in an infinite time <lb/>
            did Chaos or Night subsist; but the same things continually <lb/>
            were in existence as are in existence at present, either in a <lb/>
            revolutionary system, or otherwise, on the supposition that <lb/>
            energy is a thing that is antecedent to potentiality. Supposing <lb/>
            a thing, therefore, to be the same continually in a revolu­ <lb/>
            tionary system, it is necessary that something always should <lb/>
            remain energizing in like manner. But if there is likely to <lb/>
            ensue generation and corruption, it is necessary that there be <lb/>
            something else which continually energizes at one time in one <lb/>
            way, and at another in another. It is necessary, then, that <lb/>
            it energizes in this way, no doubt, essentially, or from itself <lb/>
            but in a different way according to something else. It must <lb/>
            in this case energize either according to something that is <lb/>
            different, or according to what is primary or original. It is, <lb/>
            therefore, necessary that it energize according to this; for again <note type="footnote"> 1 The inconsistency which Aristotle taxes Plato with is this,-that <lb/>
            whereas sometimes he maintains the priority of motion to the orderly <lb/>
            system of the world, he, at other times, makes the soul, that with him is <lb/>
            the source of motion, to be coincident with it. Cicero comments upon <lb/>
            this Platonic view of the nature of soul in the first book of the <lb/>
            Tusculan Disputations </note> <pb n="329"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VII.] </note> <lb/>
            is that a cause of energy both to this and to that other. <lb/>
            Wherefore, that which is primary is superior as a cause; for <lb/>
            that, likewise, was a cause of a things subsisting continually <lb/>
            after a similar manner, and something else would be the cause <lb/>
            of the subsistence of energy in a different manner; but of <lb/>
            its subsistence always in a different manner manifestly would <lb/>
            both be a cause. Therefore are motions, also, in this manner <lb/>
            disposed. Why, therefore, must we go in search of other <lb/>
            first principles?</p>

          <p>BUT since, also, the case stands thus-and, if <lb/>
            it be not so, things will spring from Night, <lb/>
            and from all things simultaneously, and from <lb/>
            nonentity-these aforesaid questions may be de- <lb/>
            1. Perpetual <lb/>
            motion presup­ <lb/>
            poses an eternal <lb/>
            cause of that <lb/>
            motion. <lb/>
            cided, and something always would there be that is being <lb/>
            moved with a motion that is incessant, but this is that which <lb/>
            is circular; and this is evident not merely from reason, but <lb/>
            from the fact itself. Wherefore, the first heaven would be <lb/>
            eternal. There is, therefore, also something that imparts <lb/>
            motion. Since, however, that which has motion impressed <lb/>
            upon it, and which imparts motion, subsists as a medium, <lb/>
            there is, therefore, something which, not having motion im­ <lb/>
            pressed upon it, yet imparts motion, which is a thing that is <lb/>
            eternal, being both substance and energy. But in this way <lb/>
            it imparts motion—I mean, that which is desirable and <lb/>
            that which is intelligible2 impart motion, whereas they are <lb/>
            not moved themselves.</p>
          <p>But the originals of these are the same; for a <lb/>
            thing that is the object of a propension is that <lb/>
            which appears fair; but a thing which is originally <lb/>
            selected from volition actually is fair. Now, we <lb/>
            desire a thing because it appears fair, rather than <lb/>
            2. Its mode of <lb/>
            operation an­ <lb/>
            alogous to the <lb/>
            operations of <lb/>
            mind or pro­ <lb/>
            pension. <lb/>
            that a thing appears fair because we desire it; for the perception <lb/>
             <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristotle having discussed the principles of substances cognisant <lb/>
            by the senses, now passes on, in accordance with his transcendental <lb/>
            method, to examine into the nature and principles of the supra-sensual, <lb/>
            or, as he terms them, "immobile," substances. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This is a most important principle. Themistius, in his commentary <lb/>
            on this passage, remarks that, in the case of <unclear>immaterielexistences</unclear>, <lb/>
            “idem est desiderabile atque intelligibile." </note> <pb n="330"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK XI. </note> <lb/>
            constitutes a first principle: but mind is moved by that which is <lb/>
            intelligible, and the other co-ordination constitutes essentially <lb/>
            that which is intelligible; and belonging to this is the first <lb/>
            substance; and of this is that substance which subsists abso­ <lb/>
            lutely and according to energy. Unity, however, is not the <lb/>
            same with vhat is simple or absolute, for unity signifies <lb/>
            measure; but what is absolute signifies the mode in which <lb/>
            a thing itself subsists. But, certainly, both that which is <lb/>
            fair, and that which is desirable for its own sake, belong to <lb/>
            the same co-ordinate series, and that which is first is the <lb/>
            most excellent invariably, or amounts to that which is ana­ <lb/>
            logous to it.</p>
          <p>3. The final <lb/>
            cause of the <lb/>
            motion impart­ <lb/>
            ed by the im­ <lb/>
            movable first <lb/>
            cause.</p>
          <p>But that the final cause subsists in things <lb/>
            that are immovable the division makes manifest. <lb/>
            For the final cause of anything resides in those <lb/>
            things of which the one is in existence and the <lb/>
            other is not. Now, that which first imparts <lb/>
            motion does so as a thing that is loved;1 and that which has <lb/>
            motion impressed upon it imparts motion to other things. <lb/>
            If, indeed, therefore, anything is being moved, it is admis­ <lb/>
            sible, also, that it should subsist in a different manner. <lb/>
            Wherefore, if the primary motion constitute energy also, so <lb/>
            far forth as the thing is moved, in this way is it likewise <lb/>
            possible that it should subsist after a different mode in <lb/>
            place though not in substance. Since, however, there is <lb/>
            something that imparts motion, itself being immovable, and <lb/>
            subsisting in energy, this does not by any means admit of <lb/>
            subsisting in a different manner; for the primary motion <lb/>
            belongs to the changes, and of this that which is circular; <lb/>
            but this First Mover imparts motion to that.</p>
          <p>4. The exist­ <lb/>
            ence of the <lb/>
            first cause a <lb/>
            necessary one.</p>
          <p>Of necessity, in this case, must this Immovable <lb/>
            First Mover constitute an entity; and so far forth <lb/>
            as it subsists necessarily, so far forth does it <lb/>
            subsist after an excellent manner;2 and in this <lb/>
            way constitutes a first principle. For what is necessary sub- <note type="footnote"> 1 This remarkable passage the commentators say would be illustrated <lb/>
            by the principles laid down in regard of the final cause in a treatise <lb/>

            attributes of the Deity with what we would call God'a natural <lb/>
            attributes, </note><note type="footnote">2 Vide book IV. chap v. </note> <pb n="331"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VII.] </note> <lb/>
            sists in thus many ways: in the first place, by what is accom­ <lb/>
            plished by violence, because it is contrary to free-will; and, <lb/>
            secondly, as that without which a thing does not subsist in. <lb/>
            an excellent manner; and, thirdly, as that which could not <lb/>
            be otherwise from what it is, but involves an absolute sub­ <lb/>
            sistence. From a first principle, then, of this kind—I mean, <lb/>
            one that is involved in the assumption of a First Mover­ <lb/>
            hath depended the Heaven and Nature.</p>
          <p>Now, the course of life of this First Mover­ <lb/>
            in like manner with our own, for a limited period <lb/>
            of time-is such, also, as is the most excellent; <lb/>
            for, in the present instance, doth that First Mover <lb/>
            5. Eternal <lb/>
            happiness es­ <lb/>
            sential to the <lb/>
            Divine Nature <lb/>
            continue in the enjoyment of the principle of life for ever : for <lb/>
            with us, certainly, such a thing as this would be impossible ; <lb/>
            but not so with the First Mover, since even cloth the energy <lb/>
            or activity of this First Mover give rise unto pleasure or <lb/>
            satisfaction on the part of such; and on this account vigi­ <lb/>
            lance, exercise of the senses, and perception in general, are <lb/>
            what is most productive of pleasure or satisfaction; and <lb/>
            with hopes and recollections1 is the case the same for these <lb/>
            reasons. Now, essential perception is the per­ <lb/>
            ception of that which is essentially the most <lb/>
            excellent; and that which is most essential per­ <lb/>
            ception is the perception of that which is most <lb/>
            as well as per­ <lb/>
            fection, proved <lb/>
            from the ana. <lb/>
            logy of the <lb/>
            human mind. <lb/>
            essential. The mind, however, is cognisant of itself by par­ <lb/>
            ticipation in that which falls within the province of the <lb/>
            mind as its object; for it becomes an object of perception by <lb/>
            contact, and by an act of intellectual apprehension. So that <lb/>
            the mind and that which is an object of perception for the <lb/>
            mind are the same; for that which is receptive of impres­ <lb/>
            sions from what is an object of perception, and is substance, <lb/>
            constitutes mind: and when in possession of these impres­ <lb/>
            sions it energizes, or subsists in a condition of activity. <lb/>
            Wherefore, that2 seems to belong to the First Mover rather <lb/>

            alarm, yet they are the offspring of a certain psychological energy or <lb/>
            activity, and, as such, are the objects of affection. </note><note type="footnote"> a This principle of mounting up to the Absolute through the sub­ <lb/>

            which the mind appears to possess: and contemplation con­ <lb/>
            stitutes what is most agreeable and excellent. If, therefore, <lb/>
            God in this way possesses such an excellent mode of sub­ <lb/>
            sistence for ever, as we do for a limited period of duration, <lb/>
            the Divine Nature is admirable; and if he possesses it in a <lb/>
            more eminent degree, still more admirable will be the Divine <lb/>

          <p>6. Summary of <lb/>
            the essential <lb/>
            qualities of <lb/>
            the Divine <lb/>
            Nature.</p>
          <p>In this way, however, is the Deity disposed as <lb/>
            to existence, and the principle of life is, at any <lb/>
            rate, inherent in the Deity; for the energy or <lb/>
            active exercise of Mind constitues life, and God <lb/>
            -as above delineated-constitutes this energy; and essential <lb/>
            energy belongs to God as his best and everlasting life. Now, <lb/>
            our statement is this,-that the Deity is an animal that is <lb/>
            everlasting and most excellent in nature; so that with the <lb/>
            Deity life and duration are uninterrupted and eternal: for <lb/>
            this constitutes the very essence of God.</p>

            goric solution <lb/>
            of the pheno­ <lb/>
            menon of per­ <lb/>
            fection.</p>
          <p>As many philosophers, however, as adopt the <lb/>
            supposition-such as the Pythagoreans and <lb/>
            Speusippus—that what is best and most fair is <lb/>
            not to be found in the principle 2 of things, from <lb/>
            the fact that though the first principles both of plants and <lb/>
            animals are causes, yet that what is fair and perfect resides <lb/>
            in created things as results from these-persons, I say, who <lb/>
            entertain these sentiments do not form their opinions cor­ <lb/>
            rectly. For seed arises from other natures that are ante­ <lb/>
            cedent and perfect, and seed is not the first thing, whereas <lb/>
            that which is perfect is ; as, for example, just as if one were <lb/>
            to say that a man is antecedent to seed; not the man <lb/>
            that is being generated from seed, but another from whom <lb/>
            the seed flows.</p>
          <p>8. The Deity <lb/>
            devoid of parts <lb/>
            and passions.</p>
          <p>That, indeed, there exists a certain Eternal <lb/>
            Substance, and a Substance that is Immovable, <lb/>
            and possesses actually a subsistence separable <lb/>
            from sensibles, is evident trom the statements that have been <lb/>
            made above. But it also has been demonstrated that it is <note type="footnote"> 1 The commentary of Themistius is worthy of quotation: “Ille, i. e. <lb/>
            Deus, vero qui a sapientiâ. ne punctum quidem temporis vacat, non <lb/>
            ha bet delectationem acqui8itam, sed ipsa delectatio est." This view of <lb/>
            Aristotle's of the Deity is, as far as Revelation informs us, a correct <lb/>
            one. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This false principle has reappeared in modern philosophy. </note> <pb n="333"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            not possible for this substance to involve any magnitude, but <lb/>
            it is devoid of parts and indivisible.1 For it imparts motion <lb/>
            throughout infinite duration; and nothing that is finite in­ <lb/>
            volves infinite potentiality. Since, however, every magnitude <lb/>
            is either infinite or finite, for this reason such a Substance as <lb/>
            the above would not involve a finite magnitude, and therefore it <lb/>
            cannot involve an infinite magnitude, because, in short, there <lb/>
            is no infinite magnitude in existence. But, unquestionably, <lb/>
            also, it has been demonstrated that such is impassive and <lb/>
            unalterable, for all other motions are subsequent to that <lb/>
            motion which is local or topical. These statements, there <lb/>
            fore, make it evident why it is that the Deity is disposed at <lb/>
            to existence after this manner.</p>

          <p>Now, whether are we to admit that there <lb/>
            exists one Substance of this description or many ?2 <lb/>
            and if so, how many such there are ought not to <lb/>
            escape our notice ; but we should call to re­ <lb/>
            membrance also the assertions of other Philoso- <lb/>

            unity or plura­ <lb/>

            phers, because, regarding the multitude of these substances, <lb/>
            they have not spoken aught which amounts to even anything <lb/>
            that is clear in the expression. For, indeed, the opinion 8 in <lb/>
            regard of ideas does not involve any peculiar investigation, <lb/>
            for the persons who affirm the existence of ideas affirm that <lb/>
            these ideas are numbers; and, as regards numbers, at one <lb/>
            time they speak of them as of things that are infinite, and <lb/>
            at other times as of things that are limited as far as to <lb/>
            the decade. As to the cause, however, why it is that there <lb/>
            subsists a multitude of numbers4 of this kind, nothing it <lb/>
            expressed by them with demonstrative certainty. <note type="footnote"> 1 It has ever been overlooked in all systems of religion, except that of <lb/>
            Jesus Christ, and that of the Jews, that “God is a Spirit, without body, <lb/>

            to be this: he gives first a sort of A priori demonstration of God's <lb/>

            motions of the <lb/>
            stars.</p>
          <p>This, however, must we declare from principles <lb/>
            that are taken for granted, and that have been <lb/>
            determined. For the first principle, and the <lb/>
            original existence of entities, is a thing that is <lb/>
            immovable both essentially and according to <lb/>
            accident, and it imparts motion with an original and eternal <lb/>
            and single motion. But since that which is being moved <lb/>
            must needs derive its motion from something, and that which <lb/>
            first imparts motion is essentially immovable, and an eternal <lb/>
            motion derives that motion from what is eternal as a moving <lb/>
            cause, and a single motion its motion from what is single, <lb/>
            and since we see that beside the simple revolutionary motion <lb/>
            of the Universe-which we say derives its motion from the <lb/>
            first substance and that which is immovable-there are other <lb/>
            motions that are everlasting-namely, those of the planets, <lb/>
            (for eternal and unstable1in its movement is a body that is <lb/>
            circular; but we have furnished demonstrations in regard of <lb/>
            these in our Physics ;)—now, I say, since the foregoing is the <lb/>
            case, each of these motions must needs derive its motion from <lb/>
            that which is both immovable essentially and is an Eternal <lb/>
            Substance. For the nature of the stars consists in being a <lb/>
            certain eternal substance, and that which imparts motion is <lb/>
            eternal, and is antecedent to that which has motion impressed <lb/>
            upon it; and that which involves priority of subsistence to a <lb/>
            substance must needs also be a substance. It is evident, there­ <lb/>
            fore, that it is expedient that there should be in existence sub­ <lb/>
            stances of this kind, such as are both naturally eternal, as well <lb/>
            as essentially immovable and devoid of magnitude, and that, <lb/>
            too, on account of the cause that has been stated previously.</p>

            devoted to this purpose—I mean, from astronomy;1 for this <lb/>
            science institutes an investigation respecting a substance that <lb/>
            is cognisant by sense, no doubt, but such as is eternal: the <lb/>
            rest of the mathematical sciences, however, are not concerned <lb/>
            about any substance whatever;2 for example, take the case <lb/>
            of the science respecting numbers and geometry. That, <lb/>
            therefore, there are numerous orbital motions belonging to <lb/>
            the stars 3 that are being moved across the arch of heaven is <lb/>
            evident to those who have even moderately busied them­ <lb/>
            selves in such inquiries. For more motions than one do <lb/>
            each of the planetary stars assume. But as to how many <lb/>
            these happen to be let us, likewise, now declare the state­ <lb/>
            ments which some of the mathematicians make on this <lb/>
            subject, for the purpose of understanding the point under <lb/>
            investigation, in order that it may be possible to apprehend <lb/>
            a certain multitude of these when mentally defined. But as <lb/>
            to what remains we must ourselves investigate into some <lb/>
            points, but we must make inquiries into others from persons <lb/>
            engaged in investigations into these subjects; if, haply, <lb/>
            anything beside the statements that already have been made <lb/>
            may appear to those who are busied in these speculations: <lb/>
            and if so, we should bestow affection upon both,4 yet yield <lb/>
            our assent only to those who are more accurate. <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristotle now enters upon what may be termed his experimental. <lb/>

          <p>Eudoxus,1 in his system, therefore, laid down <lb/>
            the orbital motion of the sun and moon to be <lb/>
            severally in three spheres; the first of which he <lb/>
            maintained was that of the fixed stars; and the second was <lb/>
            that which accords with the circle which passes through <lb/>
            the central signs of the Zodiac; and the third, with that <lb/>
            circle which is situated obliquely in the latitude of the <lb/>
            Zodiacal signs. Now, that oblique circle through which <lb/>
            the moon is carried is situated in a wider latitude than <lb/>
            that through which the sun is carried. But of the devious, <lb/>
            or erratic, stars he makes a disposition of each in four <lb/>
            spheres; and of these, likewise, he considers the first and <lb/>
            second to be the same with those of the sun and moon. <lb/>
            For the sphere of the fixed stars, according to him; is the <lb/>
            same with that first sphere which carries along all the orbs; <lb/>
            and that which has been arranged under this, and possesses <lb/>
            a motion corresponding with the circle that passes through <lb/>
            the central signs of the Zodiac, he considers a sphere common <lb/>
            to all these heavenly bodies. He is of opinion, however, <lb/>
            that the poles of the third sphere, which is common to all, <lb/>
            are situated in that circle which passes through the central <lb/>
            signs of the Zodiac, and that the motion of the fourth <lb/>
            sphere is in an orbit declining towards the centre of the <lb/>
            third, and that the poles of the third sphere are the proper <lb/>
            poles of the other spheres, but that Venus and Mercury <lb/>
            have the same poles.</p>
          <p>5. The system <lb/>

          <p>Calippus,2 however, sets down the same is­ <lb/>
            position of the spheres with Eudoxus, that is, the <lb/>
            same arrangement of their mutual distances; but, <lb/>
            with respect to their multitude, he ascribed to the star of <lb/>
            Jupiter, as well as to that of Saturn, the same number with <note type="footnote"> 1 Eudoxus was a famous astronomer, who flourished about the year <lb/>

            Eudoxus; yet still he thinks that to the luminary of the <lb/>
            sun, and to that of the moon, there should further be an­ <lb/>
            nexed two spheres-that is, supposing one likely to furnish <lb/>
            a solution of the phenomena. And in regard of the other <lb/>
            spheres of the planets, he adds one sphere to each.</p>
          <p>It is necessary, however,1 on the supposition <lb/>
            that all, when collected together, are likely to <lb/>
            furnish a solution of the phenomena, that ac- <lb/>

            comment upon <lb/>
            these systems. <lb/>
            cording to each of the erratic stars there should be different <lb/>
            spheres revolving, less by one than those which carry along <lb/>
            the planets, and, in regard of position, restore into the same <lb/>
            place the first sphere invariably of the star which is rankec <lb/>
            in an inferior order; for in this way only is it possible <lb/>
            that by the orbital motion2 of the planets should be produced <lb/>
            all the phenomena that may be observed. Since, therefore, <lb/>
            as regards the spheres in which the planets are carried along, <lb/>
            some of them are made to amount to eight, but others to five­ <lb/>
            and-twenty, and of these it is not necessary that those <lb/>
            merely should have revolving spheres in which a star arranged <lb/>
            lowest down is carried, those, accordingly, that impart a <lb/>
            revolutionary motion to the spheres of the two first will be <lb/>
            six in number, while those to the spheres of the four sub­ <lb/>
            sequent stars will be eleven : the total amount of all the <lb/>
            spheres, however, as well those that carry along the stars, <lb/>
            as also those that make them revolve, will be fifty and <lb/>
            five. But if one were not to add the motions of the moon <lb/>
            which we have mentioned to the sun also, all the spheres <lb/>
            will be forty and seven.</p>
          <p>Let the number, then, of the spheres amount to <lb/>
            so many; wherefore, it is reasonable to suppose <lb/>
            that both the substances and the first principles <lb/>
            which are immovable, and are cognisant by the <lb/>
            senses, should be so many in number as we have <lb/>
            enumerated; for that there must necessarily be <lb/>

            requisite to suppose that every nature and every substance <lb/>
            ought to be regarded-provided it be devoid of passion, and <lb/>

            this case there would not be in. existence any other nature <lb/>

            constitute the total amount of substances; for whether there <lb/>

          <p>But, at any rate, it is impossible that there <lb/>
            should be other orbital motions beside those that <lb/>

            would be reasonable to arrive at from observing <lb/>
            the bodies that are being moved along the surface <lb/>
            of the heavens. 2 For on the supposition that everything <lb/>
            that is borne along the firmament subsists by the constitution <lb/>
            of Nature, on account of that body which is borne along, and <lb/>
            that every motion belongs to something that is carried forward, <lb/>
            there would not exist any orbital motion on account of itself <lb/>
            or of another motion; but on account of the stars would it <lb/>
            exist. For if we admit that orbital motion will subsist on <lb/>

            this latter, likewise, should subsist on account of other orbital <lb/>

            progression to infinity, an end of every orbital motion will <lb/>

          <p>1. Certain ques­ <lb/>
            tions as regards <lb/>
            Mind.</p>
          <p>THERE are points, however, respecting Mind <lb/>
            which involve certain subjects of doubt; for it <lb/>
            seems, certainly, to constitute the most divine <lb/>
            existence amongst phenomena: but after what manner it is <lb/>
            disposed, so as that it should be a thing of this sort, is attended <lb/>
            with certain difficulties. For whether it be void of the faculty <lb/>
            of understanding anything, but is like one who is sleeping, <lb/>
            what, may I ask, would there be reverential in such a con­ <lb/>
            dition of being ? Or, supposing that it possesses the faculty <lb/>
            of understanding, and yet that there be something which is <lb/>
            dominant over this faculty-for in this case that which is its <lb/>
            substance is not intelligence, but capacity-should the fore­ <lb/>
            going be true, we could not say that Mind would be the most <lb/>
            excellent substance ; for it is through the faculty of the under­ <lb/>
            standing that that which is entitled to reverence is inherent <lb/>
            in the mind. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">λείψαντα</foreign>. I have followed the rendering of the Latin version, " quasi <lb/>
            quasdam reliquias." This is a common meaning for <foreign xml:lang="grc">λείπω</foreign>: e. g. we are <lb/>
            told in the Iliad, II. 106, that Atreus, on his deathbed, left (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔλιπεν</foreign>) <lb/>
            his sceptre to Thyestes. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Aristotle's remarks in this chapter may be compared with what he <lb/>

            </p>
          <p><note type="margin"> CH. IX.] </note> But, further, whether understanding consti­ <lb/>
            tute its substance, or whether perception does, <lb/>
            what, may I ask, does it understand ? for either <lb/>
            it is itself that it understands, or something <lb/>
            2 What is the <lb/>
            essence of <lb/>
            Mind ? is it <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ <lb/>
            νόειν</foreign> f <lb/>
            else. And supposing that it understands something else, <lb/>
            either it will invariably be the same, or something different; <lb/>
            whether, then, is there any difference, or no difference at all, <lb/>
            between its understanding what is fair, and understanding <lb/>
            what is casual; or, also, would it be an absurd idea to imagine <lb/>
            that it exercises the faculty of cogitation in regard of certain <lb/>
            things? It is evident, therefore, that that which under­ <lb/>
            stands is most divine, and most entitled to reverence, and <lb/>
            that it undergoes no change; for change would presuppose a <lb/>
            transition into something that is worse: and a thing of this <lb/>
            sort would, in the present instance, amount to a certain <lb/>
            motion. In the first place, then, of course, sup­ <lb/>
            posing that the mind1 were not perception or <lb/>
            or is it <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡ νόη­ <lb/>
            ϭις</foreign> f <lb/>
            intelligence, but capacity, it is reasonable to infer that con­ <lb/>
            tinuity of perception would be a laborious operation for the <lb/>
            mind; and, in the next place, it is evident that there would be <lb/>
            in existence something else that is more entitled to reverence <lb/>
            than Mind,2—namely, that which is an object of perception to <lb/>
            the mind: for both the faculty of understanding and actual <lb/>
            perception will be present to the mind even in its under­ <lb/>
            standing that which is most inferior.</p>
          <p>So that we must avoid this consequence; for <lb/>
            also would it be better not to see some things than <lb/>
            to see them: hence, perception would not consti­ <lb/>
            lute that which is most excellent. Accordingly, <lb/>
            3. The dignity <lb/>
            of Mind de­ <lb/>
            pends upon a <lb/>
            true view of its <lb/>
            nature. <lb/>
            may we assume that Mind is cognisant of its own operations, <lb/>
            if it really is that which is most superior, and if perception <lb/>
            amounts to the perception of a perception.</p>
          <p>Now, scientific knowledge invariably appears, <lb/>
            as well as perception by sense and opinion and <lb/>
            the faculty of thought, to be conversant about <lb/>
            something different from itself and to be <lb/>
            4. This view of <lb/>
            the nature of <lb/>
            Mind objected <lb/>
            against. <note type="footnote"> 1 The difficulties even of approximating towards anything like <lb/>

            conversant about itself only in a secondary or subordi­ <lb/>
            nate sense. Further, if we suppose that understanding is <lb/>
            different from being an object of perception to the under­ <lb/>
            standing, according to which of these will subsistence in an <lb/>
            excellent way be inherent in Mind? for neither is it the same <lb/>
            thing the being inherent in an act of perception by the un­ <lb/>
            derstanding, and in an object of perception to the understand­ <lb/>
            ing : or, shall we say that in the case of some things the <lb/>
            science constitutes itself that which is the object of the science?</p>
          <p>5. Aristotle's <lb/>
            reply.</p>
          <p>In the case, I admit, of the productive sciences, <lb/>
            the substance and the essence do not involve a <lb/>
            connexion with matter; whereas in the case of the spe­ <lb/>
            culative sciences the definition or formal principle is the <lb/>
            object of the science, as well as is the perception exer­ <lb/>
            cised by the mind. Inasmuch, then, as the object of the <lb/>
            understanding is not a different thing from the understand­ <lb/>
            ing itself, in the case of as many things as do not involve a <lb/>
            connexion with matter they will be the same thing ; and <lb/>
            the act of perception by the mind will be identical with the <lb/>
            object of perception.1</p>
          <p>6. Is the object <lb/>
            of perception a <lb/>
            composite na­ <lb/>
            ture—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭύνθετον</foreign>?</p>
          <p>Moreover, therefore, a doubt remains whether <lb/>
            an object of perception is a composite nature or <lb/>
            not; for, if this be the case, the object of percep­ <lb/>
            tion, as a compound, would undergo a change2 <lb/>
            in the parts of the entire; or, shall we say that everything is <lb/>
            indivisible which does not involve a connexion with matter, <lb/>
            -as the human mind ? Or, are we to take for granted that <lb/>
            the perception of compound objects involves a connexion <lb/>
            with matter during a certain portion of duration ? for an ex­ <lb/>
            cellent condition of subsistence does not always reside in <lb/>
            this particular thing or in that; but that which is most ex­ <lb/>
            cellent subsists in a thing, viewed as a certain entirety, being <lb/>
            something different from itself. And, therefore, the first and <lb/>
            actual perception by mind of Mind itself dotl subsist in this <lb/>
            way throughout all eternity. <note type="footnote"> 1 The writings of modern Metaphysicians are full of discussions of <lb/>

          <p>BUT we must also consider in what manner the <lb/>
            nature of the entire creation involves what is good <lb/>
            and what is most excellent; whether there exists <lb/>
            something that has been separated in point of <lb/>
            fact, and which actually subsists essentially, or <lb/>
            1. How are we <lb/>

            the existence <lb/>
            of good- the <lb/>

            both of these assumptions together, just as we might illus­ <lb/>
            trate our meaning by the case of an army.</p>
          <p>For the good or excellent condition of an army <lb/>
            depends upon the order that is enforced; and <lb/>
            the commander who aims to promote this sub- <lb/>
            2. This ques­ <lb/>
            tion illustrated <lb/>
            by the cases of <lb/>
            an army, <lb/>
            ordination, even this person in a more eminent degree may <lb/>
            be regarded as a cause of such an excellent condition : for <lb/>
            this officer is not set over the army on account of the order <lb/>
            that is found to prevail there, but that order is found to exist <lb/>
            on account of the command exercised by this officer. All <lb/>
            things, however, are co-ordinated after a certain <lb/>
            mode, but not after a similar mode,-take the <lb/>
            and of animals, <lb/>
            classification, for example, of aquatic and winged animals, <lb/>
            and of plants. And they are not disposed after such a way <lb/>
            as that there should not subsist anything in common to <lb/>
            either in relation to the other, although in respect of soma <lb/>
            point do they involve some resemblance. For, indeed, in <lb/>
            regard of one characteristic are all things ranked <lb/>
            under co-ordinate series; but as in a house it is <lb/>
            and of a house. <lb/>
            hold. <lb/>
            allowable, least of all, for the free to do anything whatsoever <lb/>
            they please, but all things, or most things, have been reduced <lb/>
            into a state of orderly arrangement, so to slaves, likewise, <lb/>
            and wild beasts, only in a small degree belongs a desire to do <lb/>
            what may contribute to the general advantage; but for the <lb/>
            most part their operations are confined to whatsoever chances <lb/>
            to fall in their way, for the nature of. each of them consti­ <lb/>

            in this instance, that it is requisite for all to attain unto a <lb/>
            condition where distinctions will be drawn; and other things <note type="footnote"> I The reasoning contained in this chapter is moat remarkable indeed. </note> <pb n="344"/>

            ries about the <lb/>
            existence of <lb/>
            what is good.</p>
          <p>But whatever impossibilities or absurdities <lb/>
            ensue to those who make assertions in a different <lb/>
            way, and what sort of theories those put forward <lb/>
            on the subject who express themselves in a more <lb/>
            elegant or accomplished manner, and in the case of which of <lb/>
            these there prevail the least number of doubts, we must not <lb/>
            allow such inquiries to escape our observation. For all <lb/>
            philosophers are for producing all things from contraries ; <lb/>
            neither, however, is the expression " all things," nor the ex­ <lb/>
            pression " from contraries," correctly employed by these <lb/>
            speculators; nor do they declare, as regards those things in <lb/>
            which the contraries are inherent, in what manner they will <lb/>
            consist of contraries, for contraries are mutually impassive.</p>
          <p>4. How Aris­ <lb/>
            totle settles the <lb/>
            question.</p>
          <p>.iut by us is this controversy decided ratio­ <lb/>
            nally by the introduction of a certain third <lb/>
            nature.1 Some, however, constitute some one of <lb/>
            the contraries as matter, just as those do who make the odd <lb/>
            subject for the even, or plurality for unity.2 And this, like­ <lb/>
            wise, is decided in the same manner; for the matter which <lb/>
            is one is not what is contrary to anything. Further, all <lb/>
            things except unity will participate in what is worthless; for <lb/>
            the evil itself constitutes one or other of the elements.</p>
          <p>5. After what <lb/>
            mode is "the <lb/>
            good " a first <lb/>
            principle ?</p>
          <p>The other speculators assert, however, that <lb/>
            neither what is good and what is evil are first <lb/>
            principles at all, notwithstanding that what is <lb/>
            good is in a most eminent degree a first prin­ <lb/>
            ciple3 in all things. And some, I admit, correctly make this <lb/>
            assertion of what is good—I mean, that we must consider it <lb/>
            a first principle; after what mode, however, it is that what is <lb/>
            good constitutes a first principle they do not state: whether <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristotle's solution of the existence of Evil consists in tracing it to <lb/>
            matter as its prime source; thus coinciding with what was the funda­ <lb/>
            mental principle of the Gnostic philosophy in after ages. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Vide book I. chap. iv. </note><note type="footnote"> a The plain prevalence of Good in our system is, in a speculative <lb/>
            point of view, as difficult to account for as that of Evil. The bearing <lb/>
            of this fact on the controversy " De Origine Mali" is well explained by <lb/>
            the Archbishop of Dublin in his Lectures on Political Economy. Vide <lb/>
            Lect. IV., as well as his Grace's notes and appendix to Archbishop <lb/>

            it is to be regarded as an end, or as a moving cause, or as a <lb/>
            formal principle.</p>
          <p>Now, Empedocles also forms his opinions <lb/>
            absurdly upon this point, for he makes Harmony <lb/>
            to constitute what is good; and this Harmony, <lb/>
            in his system, subsists even as a first principle <lb/>
            6. Absurd so­ <lb/>
            lution on this <lb/>
            point by Eo <lb/>
            pedocles. <lb/>
            that imparts motion, for it has the power of congregating <lb/>
            entities; and it subsists as matter, for it is a portion of the <lb/>
            mixture. Now, even on the supposition that to Harmony <lb/>
            has it happened in this same system that it should subsist <lb/>
            as matter and a first principle, and as a power that imparts <lb/>
            motion, yet the essence of this is not the same with the <lb/>
            essence of these; according to which of them, therefore, will <lb/>
            Harmony subsist? And that Discord should be a thing that <lb/>
            is incorruptible would be absurd likewise; and yet this very <lb/>
            thing constitutes the nature of what is evil.</p>
          <p>But Anaxagoras regarded what is good as a <lb/>
            first principle, so far as it is a power that imparts <lb/>
            motion, for Mind, in his system, imparts motion; <lb/>
            it imparts motion, however, for the sake of some- <lb/>
            7. How Anaxa­ <lb/>
            goras made <lb/>
            " good" a first <lb/>
            principle. <lb/>
            thing else. Wherefore, that is different from that for the sake <lb/>
            of which it subsists, except it subsists as we say it actually <lb/>
            does; for the medicinal art in a manner constitutes health. <lb/>
            But it was also an absurdity contained in the Anaxagorean <lb/>
            philosophy, the not having produced a contrary to what is <lb/>
            good as well as to Mind. But all who assert contraries to be <lb/>
            first principles do not employ contraries as such, unless one <lb/>
            is disposed to handle the subject in a careless vein.</p>
          <p>And why it is that some things1 are corruptible, <lb/>
            and some things incorruptible, no one declares; <lb/>
            for they produce all entities from the same first <lb/>
            principles. Further, some of these speculators <lb/>
            8. Any system <lb/>
            that ignores <lb/>
            this "first prin­ <lb/>
            ciple " must be <lb/>
            false. <lb/>
            produce entities from what is nonentity;2 but some, that <lb/>
            they may not be forced to this, make all things to be one.3 <lb/>
            Further, no one lays down a reason why generation will <lb/>
            always exist; and what the cause of generation is nobody <lb/>
            declares. And for those who create two first principles will <note type="footnote"> 1 Vide book II. chap. iv. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 For instance, the Hesiodic school. </note><note type="footnote">3 That is, Parmenides, whose system has been already examined, in <lb/>

            it be necessary to have a different first principle which <lb/>
            would be more dominant, as well as for those Philosophers <lb/>
            who introduce forms, because there really exists another <lb/>
            principle more dominant than these; for why has matter <lb/>
            participated, or why does it participate, in these ideas ?</p>
          <p>9. Aristotle's <lb/>
            ontology free <lb/>
            from this ab­ <lb/>
            surdity.</p>
          <p>And for others it is necessary that there should <lb/>
            be something that is contrary to Wisdom, and to <lb/>
            that which is the science most entitled to rever­ <lb/>
            ence ; but to us this is not necessary, for there <lb/>
            is nothing contrary to what is primary. For all the con­ <lb/>
            traries involve matter, and these subsist in capacity: but <lb/>
            contrary ignorance is opposed to what is contrary, yet nothing <lb/>
            is contrary to what is primary.</p>
          <p>tO. Even theo­ <lb/>
            logy and phy­ <lb/>
            sics are free <lb/>
            from it.</p>
          <p>Further, on the supposition that there do not <lb/>
            exist other things beside those that are cognisant <lb/>
            by the senses, there will not subsist a first prin­ <lb/>
            ciple, and order, and generation and the celestial <lb/>
            bodies will have no existence: but there is always a first <lb/>
            principle of the principle, just as we find in the systems of <lb/>
            Theologians and all Natural Philosophers.</p>
          <p>11. Where,then, <lb/>
            are we to look <lb/>
            for this first <lb/>
            principle in the <lb/>
            Ideal Hypo­ <lb/>
            thesis ?</p>
          <p>Now, admitting that there will be forms or <lb/>
            numbers, they will not constitute a cause of any­ <lb/>
            thing ;2 and, if they are not a cause of anything, <lb/>
            neither will they be a cause of motion at any <lb/>
            rate. Further, how, let me ask, will mag­ <lb/>
            nitude and continuity arise from things that are devoid3 of <lb/>
            magnitude ? for number will not produce a continuous quan­ <lb/>
            tity, either as that which imparts motion or as form. But, <lb/>
            certainly, there will not be anything, at least, belonging to the <lb/>
            contraries which is both productive and motive, for it would <lb/>
            admit of non-existence; but, surely, the energy or producing <lb/>
            cause is subsequent to the capacity, and in such a case eternal <lb/>
            entities do not exist-but yet they do exist. Accordingly, <lb/>
            some one of these hypotheses must be rejected; and this has <lb/>
            been declared in the above statement that capacity antecedes <lb/>
            energy4-as to how it must be accomplished. Further, in <note type="footnote"> 1 This point is lucidly explained by Cudworth in the Intellectual <lb/>

            what way numbers may be one, or soul and body, and, in <lb/>
            general, form, and the thing itself, no one says anything on <lb/>
            this point; nor is it possible that one should declare his sen­ <lb/>
            timents thereupon, unless he express himself as we do-namely, <lb/>
            to the effect that it is the cause which imparts motion that <lb/>
            is the agent of production.</p>
          <p>But they who say that mathematical number is <lb/>
            the first, and in this way continually suppose the <lb/>
            existence of another substance adhering thereto in <lb/>
            succession, and of different first principles belong- <lb/>
            12. Or is it to <lb/>
            be found in the <lb/>
            Pythagorean <lb/>
            theory ? <lb/>
            ing unto each, these make the substance of the Universe to be <lb/>
            adventitious;1 for in no wise does one substance contribute <lb/>
            anything towards another, as to whether it exists or does not <lb/>
            exist-and besides this they introduce many first principles.</p>
          <p>The entities, however, do not choose to submit <lb/>
            to injudicious government. " The government of <lb/>
            many is not a good thing-let there be one ruler." <lb/>

            indignant with it, as a thing peculiarly in opposition to our <lb/>

            the opinions <lb/>
            recited;</p>
          <p>Now, there are two opinions respecting these <lb/>
            subjects; for certain Philosophers affirm that <lb/>
            mathematical entities a are substances : such, for <lb/>
            example, as numbers, and lines, and those things <lb/>
            that are kindred to these: and, again, that ideas4 <lb/>
            are existences of this description. Since, however, some <lb/>
            speculators constitute these as two distinct genera-I mean, <lb/>
            both the ideas and the mathematical numbers-and others <lb/>
            maintain, in opposition, that there is one nature of both, <lb/>
            and certain other Philosophers say that mathematical entities <lb/>

            mathematical <lb/>
            entities; <lb/>
            are alone substances, in the first place we must <lb/>
            institute an investigation respecting mathe­ <lb/>
            matical 5 entities, without annexing to them <lb/>
            any other nature—as, for instance, might or might not be <lb/>
            the case, according to whether they happen to be ideas or <lb/>
            not ? and whether these arc first principles and substances of <lb/>

            cerning the ideas themselves,1 simply considered, and as much <lb/>
            for the sake of usage as anything else; for most of the tenets <lb/>
            of what relates to these inquiries have been divulged even by <lb/>
            exoteric discourses 2 respecting them. Further, also, in regard <lb/>
            of that particular form of investigation, it is necessary that <lb/>
            we encounter a more enlarged philosophic discussion, when <lb/>
            we come to be engaged in our inquiries as to whether the <lb/>
            substances and first principles of entities are numbers and <lb/>
            ideas? for after the investigation relating to ideas this one <lb/>
            remains as a third subject for inquiry.</p>
          <p>But it is requisite, on the supposition of the <lb/>
            existence of mathematical entities, that these <lb/>
            should reside either in objects that fall under <lb/>

            they should involve a subsistence separable from sensibles; <lb/>
            and some make a statement in this way: or, if they are not <lb/>

            existence at all, or exist in some different manner. Where­ <lb/>

            these mathematical entities should reside in <lb/>
            objects that are cognisant by the senses, and that <lb/>
            at the same time the reason assigned for this <lb/>
            I. Mathema­ <lb/>
            tical entities do <lb/>
            not reside in <lb/>
            sensibles. <lb/>
            position is a fictitious one, has been declared also in the <lb/>
            doubts, where we have proved that it is impossible that <lb/>
            there should be two solids in the same place at the same <lb/>
            time. And, further, also, it depends on the same course of <lb/>
            reasoning, both that other potentialities and natures should <note type="footnote"> 1 This inquiry is pursued in chaps, iv. and v. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This is one of the passages in the Aristotelian writings where the <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [BOOK XII. </note> <lb/>
            reside in sensibles, and that no one of them should possess <lb/>
            a separable subsistence. These things, then, have been already <lb/>
            declared.1</p>
          <p>2. Further <lb/>
            proofs of this <lb/>
            from the non­ <lb/>
            divisibility of <lb/>
            mathematical <lb/>
            body;</p>
          <p>But, in addition to these statements, it is <lb/>
            evident that it is impossible that any body what­ <lb/>
            soever should be divided; for it will be divided <lb/>
            according to a superficies, and this according to <lb/>
            a line, and a line according to a point. Where­ <lb/>
            fore, supposing that it is impossible to divide a point, it is <lb/>
            also impossible to divide a line; and if it is impossible to <lb/>
            divide a line, the case is the same with the other mathema­ <lb/>
            tical quantities likewise. What, therefore, is the difference <lb/>
            in allowing either that natures of this description should <lb/>
            exist, or that these do not exist at all, but that such natures <lb/>
            should be found in sensibles? For the same consequence will <lb/>
            ensue; for, on the supposition of a division of the sensibles, <lb/>
            they also will be divided, or they will not be of the nature of <lb/>
            as well as its <lb/>
            non-separa­ <lb/>
            bility from <lb/>
            sensibles. <lb/>
            sensibles. But the fact is, neither is it possible <lb/>
            that such natures should be actually, at least, <lb/>
            separated; for if independent of such as are <lb/>
            cognisant by the senses, there should exist other <lb/>
            solids that are actually in a condition of separation there­ <lb/>
            from, and which are antecedent to those that are cognisant <lb/>
            by sense, it is evident that it is also necessary that beside sur­ <lb/>
            faces there should exist other surfaces that involve a separable <lb/>
            subsistence; and in like manner other points and lines, for <lb/>
            this deduction rests upon the same reasoning.</p>
          <p>3. It would also <lb/>
            presuppose <lb/>
            separate sur­ <lb/>
            faces, &amp;c. beside <lb/>
            those inherent <lb/>
            in a mathema­ <lb/>
            tical solid.</p>
          <p>And if these points be admitted, again, in ad­ <lb/>
            dition to the surfaces, and lines, and points of <lb/>
            a mathematical solid, there will be different ones <lb/>
            subsisting in a separate condition. For incom­ <lb/>
            posite natures are antecedent to those that <lb/>
            are composite. And if antecedent to sensibles <lb/>
            there exist bodies which do not fall under the notice of <lb/>
            the senses, by the same reasoning those very surfaces which <lb/>
            subsist essentially will likewise be antecedent to those sur­ <lb/>
            faces that are to be found in immovable solids. Wherefore, <lb/>
            those surfaces and lines are different from those which at <lb/>
            the same time are inherent in separated solids; for the latter, <lb/>
            indeed, are capable of consubsistence with mathematical <note type="footnote"> 1 For instance, in book VIII. </note> <pb n="351"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. II.] </note> <lb/>
            solids, but the former are antecedent to mathematical solids. <lb/>
            Again, therefore, there will be lines belonging to these sur­ <lb/>
            faces prior to which there will needs be different lines and <lb/>
            points for the same reason. And of those points con­ <lb/>
            tained in the lines that have an antecedent subsistence to <lb/>
            those cognisant by sense there will be ether prior points to <lb/>
            which there will no longer belong different ones that have <lb/>
            this prior subsistence.</p>
          <p>Wherefore, also, such an accumulation1 as the <lb/>
            foregoing would be absurd; for it happens that <lb/>
            independent of such as fall under the notice of <lb/>
            the senses there subsist single solids, no doubt, <lb/>
            yet that there are three ranks of surfaces beside <lb/>
            those that are cognisant by the senses, and that <lb/>
            4. This multi­ <lb/>
            plication of <lb/>
            surfaces, &amp;c. <lb/>
            is a hindrance <lb/>
            towards a deci­ <lb/>
            sion of the <lb/>
            question. <lb/>
            one of these subsists beside those that are sensible, and that <lb/>
            the second resides in mathematical solids, and that the third <lb/>
            subsists beside those sensibles that are inherent in these, and <lb/>
            that there exists a fourfold classification of lines, and that <lb/>
            there are five ranks of points. Wherefore, let me ask, <lb/>
            respecting which of these will the mathematical sciences be <lb/>
            conversant ? for, undoubtedly, they are not conversant re­ <lb/>
            specting the surfaces, and lines, and points that are resident <lb/>
            in an immovable solid; for a science is always conversant <lb/>
            about subjects that involve a priority of subsistence.</p>
          <p>And the same reasoning holds good respecting <lb/>
            numbers also; for beside each of the points <lb/>
            will there exist other monads, and beside each of <lb/>
            the entities that fall under the notice of sense; <lb/>
            5. The same <lb/>
            reasoning holds <lb/>
            good in the case <lb/>
            of numbers. <lb/>
            next in order will subsist those that are objects of perception <lb/>
            for the mind: wherefore, there will exist infinite genera of <lb/>
            mathematical numbers.</p>
          <p>Further, how is. it possible that we should <lb/>
            decide the questions of controversy which we <lb/>
            have taken a review of in the doubts enumerated <lb/>
            above ? For the objects about which Astronomy <lb/>
            is conversant will in like manner be different2 <lb/>
            6. Practical <lb/>
            refutation <lb/>
            drawn from the <lb/>
            nature of astro­ <lb/>
            nomy as a <lb/>
            science. <lb/>
            from those that are cognisant by sense; and this will be the <lb/>
            case, too, with those particulars about which Geometry is <lb/>
            concerned. But let me ask the question how it is possible <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭωρεύϭις</foreign> is the word I have translated " accumulation." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Some copies read <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρά</foreign>, others, <foreign xml:lang="grc">περί</foreign>. </note> <pb n="352"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK XII. </note> <lb/>
            that Heaven, and the parts thereof, subsist, or any other <lb/>
            thing whatsoever that involves motion ? And the case stands <lb/>
            the same in regard of those objects that pertain unto Optics <lb/>
            and Harmonics; for there will exist both voice and a power <lb/>
            of vision in addition to the things that fall beneath the <lb/>
            notice of our senses, and to singulars. Wherefore, it is <lb/>
            evident that there will be in existence both other senses and <lb/>
            other objects of the senses; for why, may I ask, should these <lb/>
            exist rather than those ? If, however, these do exist, there <lb/>
            will also be in existence other animals, if the truth be that <lb/>
            also there are other senses.</p>
          <p>7. Another re­ <lb/>
            futation in the <lb/>
            universals of <lb/>
            the mathema­ <lb/>
            ticians.</p>
          <p>Further, are some things described by the <lb/>
            mathematicians as universal in addition to these <lb/>
            substances. Therefore will this also constitute a <lb/>
            certain other separated substance intermediate <lb/>
            between both ideas and media, and which will be neither <lb/>
            number, nor points, nor magnitude, nor duration. But if <lb/>
            this is impossible, it is evident that it is impossible that those <lb/>
            natures, also, should be separated from sensibles.</p>
          <p>8. This dogma <lb/>
            concerning <lb/>
            mathematical <lb/>
            entities is quite <lb/>
            . contrary to <lb/>
            what really <lb/>
            takes place.</p>
          <p>Now, the short of the matter is this, that the <lb/>
            very contrary takes place, both to what is in fact <lb/>
            true and habitually supposed to be true, if one <lb/>
            will in this way seek to establish the existence of <lb/>
            mathematical entities as certain natures pos­ <lb/>
            sessed of a separated subsistence. For it is <lb/>
            necessary, from the fact of the subsistence of these in this <lb/>
            manner, that they should be antecedent to magnitudes that <lb/>
            are cognisant by the senses, when yet in reality they are sub­ <lb/>
            sequent to them. For an imperfect magnitude is prior in <lb/>
            generation, but subsequent in substance, in the same way as <lb/>
            what is inanimate is prior to that which is animated.</p>
          <p>9. How will <lb/>
            these mathe­ <lb/>
            matical magni­ <lb/>
            tudes be one ?</p>
          <p>Further, in what way also at all will these ma­ <lb/>
            thematical magnitudes be one,1 and when will this <lb/>
            be the case ? for the things, of course, that are here <lb/>
            reside in the soul, or a portion of the soul, or <lb/>
            in something else that is endowed with reason. And if <lb/>
            this be not the case, many things are exposed to dissolution. <lb/>
            But now, what is the cause of those things which are divisible <note type="footnote"> ' How this applies to the present question will be better understood <lb/>
            by consulting, in book IV. chap. vi, what Aristotle considers as the <lb/>
            characteristics of unity. </note> <pb n="353"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. II.] </note> <lb/>
            and pertaining to quantity being one, and remaining in con­ <lb/>
            junction with one another as such ?</p>
          <p>Further, do generations make this evident; for <lb/>
            in the first place, no doubt, such make a transition <lb/>
            into what pertains unto length, in the next place, <lb/>
            10. This diffi­ <lb/>
            culty exposed <lb/>
            by " genera­ <lb/>
            tion. ' <lb/>
            into what pertains unto breadth, and lastly, into what relates. <lb/>
            to depth, and has reached an end. If, therefore, that which is <lb/>
            subsequent in generation may be antecedent in substance, cor­ <lb/>
            poreity would be antecedent to a surface and a length, and <lb/>
            will be both perfect and an entirety in this way in preference, <lb/>
            because it is rendered a thing that is animated; but how, <lb/>
            one may ask, would a line or a surface become animated? for <lb/>
            such an axiom as this would be above the grasp of our senses.</p>
          <p>Further, it is true, corporeity constitutes a cer­ <lb/>
            tain substance, for already doth it in a manner in­ <lb/>
            volve that which is perfect; but how are lines said <lb/>
            to be substances?1 for neither are they substances <lb/>
            in the same manner as species, and a certain <lb/>
            11. Now, though <lb/>
            corporeity can, <lb/>
            yet mathema­ <lb/>
            tical lines can­ <lb/>
            not, be sub­ <lb/>
            stances. <lb/>
            form-for example, if in such a case we should admit that <lb/>
            soul were a thing of this sort,-nor are they substances in the <lb/>
            same way as matter-for instance, take the case of body as <lb/>
            a thing of this description,-for nothing appears as endued <lb/>
            with a capacity of consisting either from lines, or surfaces, <lb/>
            or points. But supposing that it were a certain material <lb/>
            substance, this would appear as one that is endued with a <lb/>
            capacity of assuming passive states.</p>
          <p>In definition, then, granting that mathema­ <lb/>
            tical natures will be antecedent to sense, yet it <lb/>
            does not follow that all things whatsoever that <lb/>
            are prior in definition should be prior also in <lb/>
            substance. For those things that are prior in <lb/>
            substance, indeed, are whatsoever things which, <lb/>
            12. The pri­ <lb/>
            ority of mathe <lb/>
            matical entities <lb/>
            in definition <lb/>
            does not prove <lb/>
            their priority <lb/>
            in substance. <lb/>
            involving a separate subsistence, are transcendent in their <lb/>
            essence; but all those things are prior in definition of which <lb/>
            there are definitions compounded of definitions. These, <lb/>
            however, are not inherent at the same time. For if there <lb/>
            are not in existence passive conditions, independent of the <lb/>
            substances to which they belong-as, for example, a some­ <lb/>
            thing that has motion imparted to it, or which is white <lb/>
            whiteness will be prior to a white man, and will be prior in <note type="footnote"> 1 Vide book II. chaps. i. and ii. </note> <note type="footnote"> A A. </note> <pb n="354"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK XII. </note> <lb/>
            accordance with the definition, but not in accordance with <lb/>
            the substance; for it does not admit of a separate subsistence, <lb/>
            but it always subsists in conjunction with a thing in its <lb/>
            entirety-now, I mean by entirety a man, for instance, who is <lb/>
            white. Wherefore, it is evident that neither is that prior <lb/>
            which subsists by abstraction, nor is that subsequent which <lb/>
            subsists by addition, for by addition is a man styled white <lb/>
            by reason of whiteness.</p>
          <p>13. Recapitula­ <lb/>
            tion as regards <lb/>
            these mathe­ <lb/>
            matical enti­ <lb/>
            ties.</p>
          <p>That, indeed, therefore, neither are mate­ <lb/>
            matical entities in a greater degree existences <lb/>
            than bodies, and that they are not antecedent <lb/>
            in their essence to those objects that fall under <lb/>
            the notice of the senses, but are so merely in point of <lb/>
            definition, and that it is not possible that they should be <lb/>
            made to involve a separate subsistence in any place, has <lb/>
            been declared with sufficient clearness. Since, however,1 <lb/>
            neither in sensibles is it possible for these to subsist, it <lb/>
            is evident that either, in short, they have no existence at <lb/>
            all, or they subsist after some mode or other; and on this <lb/>
            account not simply do they exist, for existence we predicate <lb/>
            multifariously.</p>

            since there is no necessity, on account of these things, either <lb/>
            that there should exist anything that is being moved in a <lb/>
            condition of actual separation from sensibles, or that there <lb/>
            should be in things that are such as these any separated <lb/>

            are in motion, but so far forth as they are bodies merely: and, <lb/>

            as they are lengths merely, and so far as they are divisible, <lb/>
            and so far as they are indivisible and things which involve <lb/>
            position,1 and so far forth as they are indivisible merely.</p>
          <p>Wherefore, since it is absolutely true to affirm, <lb/>
            not only that things capable of a separate sub­ <lb/>
            sistence exist, but also things that are not <lb/>
            capable of this separable subsistence-as, for <lb/>
            instance, that things in motion exist-so, as re­ <lb/>
            gards mathematical entities, it is absolutely true <lb/>
            to affirm that such mathematical entities exist, <lb/>
            and that, at any rate, they are such as they are <lb/>
            3. Even ad­ <lb/>
            mitting mathe­ <lb/>
            matical natures <lb/>
            to be such as <lb/>
            they are said <lb/>
            to be, this <lb/>
            will not prove <lb/>
            their in­ <lb/>
            herence in <lb/>
            sensibles. <lb/>
            asserted to be. And, likewise, as it is absolutely true to <lb/>
            affirm, in respect of the rest of the sciences, that there are <lb/>
            sciences conversant with this particular thing, and not with <lb/>
            that which is accidental to it-for instance, that there is one <lb/>
            of what is white, if that which is salubrious should be what <lb/>
            is white, but so far forth as it is salubrious-yet they are not <lb/>
            conversant with that, I say, which is salubrious, but with that <lb/>
            to which each science of it belongs, if it is salubrious, that is, <lb/>
            in this case, with the salubrious,2 and if so far forth as such <lb/>
            is a man it is conversant with man, so also that this is the <lb/>
            case with Geometry. It does not, however, follow, even <lb/>
            though sensibles happen to belong to those objects about <lb/>
            which Geometry is conversant, and though it may not be <note type="footnote"> 1 I have followed the Paris edition, Bekker reads, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔχοντα φύϭιν</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 There is a discordance in the MSS. as to the reading of this passage. <lb/>

            conversant with them so far forth as they are sensibles, that <lb/>
            the mathematical sciences will be concerned with objects <lb/>
            that fall under the notice of the senses. And they will <lb/>
            not, certainly, be conversant with these1 while there are in <lb/>
            existence other separate natures.</p>
          <p>4. May not <lb/>
            surfaces, &amp;c. <lb/>
            be mere acci­ <lb/>
            dents, and not <lb/>
            things separ­ <lb/>
            able ? and may <lb/>
            not mathema­ <lb/>
            tics be conver­ <lb/>
            sant with them <lb/>
            as such?</p>
          <p>But many things are essentially accidental in <lb/>
            things, as far forth as each peculiar quality of <lb/>
            such is inherent in each. Since both as far as <lb/>
            an animal is female, and so far forth as it is <lb/>
            male, these are its peculiar affections, although <lb/>
            there is not anything that is female, or anything <lb/>
            that is male, which involves a subsistence separ­ <lb/>
            able from animals: wherefore, also, the case is <lb/>
            the same so far forth as there are lengths merely, and so far <lb/>
            as there are surfaces.</p>
          <p>5. The nature <lb/>
            of geometry <lb/>
            makes this <lb/>
            likely.</p>
          <p>And by so much the more as Geometry is <lb/>
            employed about those things that are prior in <lb/>
            definition, and which are more simple, by so <lb/>
            much the more does it involve the considera­ <lb/>
            tion of what is accurate; but the accurate is what is <lb/>
            simple. Wherefore, Geometry speculates into things that are <lb/>
            without magnitude, rather than into those that are connected <lb/>
            with magnitude, and especially are without motion. But if <lb/>
            it contemplates motion, especially will it contemplate that <lb/>
            motion which is primary or original, for this is most simple, <lb/>
            and of this is that motion which is equable.</p>
          <p>6. This sur­ <lb/>
            mise confirmed <lb/>
            by analogy <lb/>
            from the objects <lb/>
            of optics and <lb/>
            mechanics.</p>
          <p>And there is the same mode of reasoning both <lb/>
            in the case of the sciences of Harmonics and <lb/>
            Optics; for neither are the speculations of either <lb/>
            carried on as far forth as the power of vision, or <lb/>
            as far forth as voice is concerned, but as far forth <lb/>
            as lines and numbers are the objects of inquiry; for <lb/>
            these, of course, are the appropriate affections of those : and <lb/>
            this is the case with mechanical science in like manner.</p>
          <p>7. May not the <lb/>
            separability in <lb/>
            mathematical <lb/>
            natures be <lb/>
            purely mental ?</p>
          <p>Wherefore, if any one, admitting the existence <lb/>
            of those things which involve a separate subsist­ <lb/>
            ence from accidents, makes any inquiry respecting <lb/>
            these so far forth as they are such, he will not <lb/>
            for this reason utter any falsehood; just as neither does he do <note type="footnote"> 1 Thia is a better reading which Didot gives, than the one adopted <lb/>

            so when he describes anything on the earth, and says that <lb/>
            that is the measure of a foot which is not the measure of a <lb/>
            foot; for not in the propositions1 doth the falsehood lurk. <lb/>
            But thus would each particular be investigated in the most <lb/>
            excellent manner, if any one, having effected, as he thought, <lb/>
            a separation, should regard as such that which does not in <lb/>
            reality possess a separate subsistence, as is done by the arith­ <lb/>
            metician and geometrician.</p>
          <p>For one, indeed, and indivisible is man, so <lb/>
            far forth as he is man; but the arithmetician <lb/>
            has established an indivisible one; and next <lb/>
            he considers whether there is anything that is <lb/>
            8. Arithmetic <lb/>
            and geometry <lb/>
            would seem to <lb/>
            prove that it is. <lb/>
            an accident in man so far forth as he is indivisible. <lb/>
            The geometrician, on the other hand, carries on specu­ <lb/>
            lations relative to man neither as far forth as he is man, <lb/>
            nor as far forth as he is indivisible, but as far forth as <lb/>
            he is a solid. For what things, even though he were not <lb/>
            indivisible anywhere, would be inherent in him is evident, <lb/>
            because, even without these, that which is endued with capa­ <lb/>
            city admits of being inherent in this very man. Wherefore, <lb/>
            on this account, geometricians, with correctness, make asser­ <lb/>
            tions, and discourse concerning entities, and entities have an <lb/>
            existence, (for twofold is entity,) the one subsisting in actu­ <lb/>
            ality and the other materially.</p>
          <p>Since, however, that which is good is different <lb/>
            from that which is fair-for the one is always in <lb/>
            conjunction with the method of doing a thing,2 <lb/>
            but that which is fair also resides in things that <lb/>
            are immovable-those who assert that the ma- <lb/>

            about what is <lb/>
            good or fair. <lb/>
            thematical sciences make no affirmation about what is fair or <lb/>

            names, they do not exhibit even the results and the reasons <lb/>
            of these, and therefore they can hardly be said to make <lb/>
            any assertion about them. Of what is fair, however, the <lb/>
            most important species are order and symmetry, and that <lb/>
            which is definite, which the mathematical sciences make <lb/>
            manifest in a most eminent degree. And since, at least, these <lb/>

            continual flux. Wherefore, if there are systems of science <lb/>
            and of practical wisdom, conversant about anything, we affirm <lb/>
            that some different natures, in a condition of permanence, <lb/>
            must necessarily exist beside those that are cognisant by the <lb/>
            senses, for it is plain that a science of those things that are in <lb/>
            a state of flux has no existence.</p>
          <p>Now, seeing that Socrates was engaged in <lb/>
            forming systems in regard of the ethical or moral <lb/>
            virtues, and was the first to institute an investi­ <lb/>
            gation in regard of the universal definition of <lb/>
            these-for, to be sure, Democritus to a small ex­ <lb/>
            tent merely busied himself in physical inquiries, <lb/>

            Socrates, and <lb/>
            what led to <lb/>
            such. <lb/>
            and defined after what mode that which is hot, and that <lb/>
            which is cold, subsisted, but the Pythagoreans, previously to <lb/>
            his time, brought forward2 definitions in respect of some few <lb/>
            things, the formal principles of which these philosophers con­ <lb/>
            nected with numbers, as, for example, take the instance what <lb/>
            opportunity constitutes, or justice, or marriage—Socrates, <lb/>
            not withstanding, I say, from time to time investigated into <lb/>
            quiddity or what a thing is, and this, too, on rational grounds. <lb/>
            For his aim was to form syllogisms, and we know that quid­ <lb/>
            dity is a first principle of syllogisms. For dialectical strength <lb/>
            not as yet had at that time any existence; so that they were <lb/>
            able, even without the possession of quiddity or the substance <lb/>
            of a thing, to institute inquiries into those things that are <lb/>
            contraries, even though we should suppose that there would <lb/>
            be the same science of contraries. For there are two im­ <lb/>
            provements in science which one might justly ascribe to <lb/>
            Socrates; now, I allude to his employment of inductive argu­ <lb/>
            ments, and his definition of the universal: for both of these <lb/>
            belong to a science that is conversant about a first principle.</p>
          <p>Socrates,3 however, did not, it is true, consti­ <lb/>
            tute universals as things involving a separable <lb/>
            subsistence, nor did he regard the definitions as <lb/>
            such ;the other philosophers, however, invested <lb/>
            4. Yet not <lb/>
            Socrates, but <lb/>
            others were the <lb/>
            authors of the <lb/>
            Ideal Theory. <lb/>
            them with a separate subsistence, and, in addition, they <lb/>
            denominated things of this sort as the ideas of entities. <note type="footnote"> 1 A repetition of this and other parts of these two chapters may be <lb/>

            argues against <lb/>
            the Ideal <lb/>
            Theory that it <lb/>
            proves too <lb/>
            much. for <lb/>
            there are more <lb/>
            forms than <lb/>
            things.</p>
          <p>Wherefore, it occurred to them, almost for the <lb/>
            same reason, that there exist ideas of all things <lb/>
            which are predicated universally; and this <lb/>
            assumption is just as if one desirous of reckoning <lb/>
            a particular sum, when, in fact, the component <lb/>
            parts were fewer in number, should consider it <lb/>
            an impossibility to do so, but when he had made <lb/>
            them more numerous should succeed in counting them. For <lb/>
            more numerous, so to say, are forms than singulars that fall <lb/>
            under the notice of sense: from an investigation into the <lb/>
            causes of which did these speculators advance from sensibles <lb/>
            to ideas; for a form is a thing that is of the same import <lb/>
            with a sensible singular, and it subsists independent of sub­ <lb/>
            stances; 1 and forms are there in the case of many other <lb/>
            things -namely, both in these particular things and in those <lb/>
            that are eternal.</p>
          <p>6. The hypo­ <lb/>
            thesis fails in <lb/>
            its proof of the <lb/>
            existence of <lb/>
            these forms.</p>
          <p>Further, in the modes in which it is demon­ <lb/>
            strated that forms exist, according to none of <lb/>
            these is it apparent that they really do exist; fbr <lb/>
            from some of them it is not necessary that a <lb/>
            syllogism should arise, but from certain others: and in the <lb/>
            case of things where they do not suppose that there are <lb/>
            forms in existence, of these are there generated forms. For, <lb/>
            according to the rational principles that may be adduced <lb/>
            from the other sciences, there will subsist forms of all things <lb/>
            of whatsoever there are sciences; and according to the notion <lb/>
            of the unity that is involved in plurality will there subsist <lb/>
            forms also of negations, and according to the perception of <lb/>
            something belonging to what has been corrupted will there <lb/>
            be forms of things subject to corruption, for of these is there <lb/>
            a certain impression on the mind.</p>

            of their own <lb/>
            hypothesis.</p>
          <p>But, further, with respect to the most accurate <lb/>
            of the arguments that have been brought forward <lb/>
            in favour of the Ideal Theory, certain speculators, <lb/>
            no doubt, make ideas to belong to relatives, of <lb/>
            which they do not affirm that there is an essential <lb/>
            genus, whereas others assert the existence of a third man. And, <lb/>
            in general, the arguments concerning forms overturn the very <lb/>
            things which those persons who maintain the existence of them <note type="footnote"> 1 I have followed Didct's text, which differs in this passage some­ <lb/>
            what from Bekker. Instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">δμώνυον</foreign>, some MSS. read, <foreign xml:lang="grc">συνώνμον</foreign> </note> <pb n="361"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. IV.] </note> <lb/>
            forms would desire to exist, in preference to the existence of <lb/>
            the forms themselves. For it happens that the dual is not <lb/>
            first, but that the number is; and prior to this is that which <lb/>
            is relative, and that which involves an essential subsistence is <lb/>
            prior too; and this will be the case with all those things <lb/>
            whatsoever which certain philosophers, in their adherence to <lb/>
            these opinions respecting forms, have put forward in oppo­ <lb/>
            sition to first principles.</p>
          <p>Further, according, indeed, to that supposition <lb/>
            by which these speculators affirm the existence <lb/>
            of ideas, not only will there be forms of sub­ <lb/>
            stances, but of many other things besides; for <lb/>
            there is not only the one concept1 about substances <lb/>
            8. Inconsis. <lb/>
            tency in this <lb/>
            hypothesis in <lb/>
            supposing the <lb/>
            forms to be <lb/>
            participants. <lb/>
            but also concerning those things that are not substances, and <lb/>
            there will be systems of scientific knowledge conversant not <lb/>
            about substance merely. But there are innumerable other <lb/>
            consequences that ensue unto this hypothesis. In accord­ <lb/>
            ance, however, with what is necessary, and with the opinions <lb/>
            that are prevalent concerning the Ideal Theory, on the suppo­ <lb/>
            sition that the forms are participants, it is expedient that <lb/>
            there should be ideas of substances merely; for these do <lb/>
            not participate according to what is accidental, but it is <lb/>
            requisite that they should participate of each thing so far <lb/>
            forth as there doth not exist a predication of it of a subject. <lb/>
            Now I say, for example, if anything participates of the two­ <lb/>
            fold itself, this also participates of what is everlasting, but <lb/>
            according to accident, for it is an accident for the twofold to <lb/>
            be everlasting. Wherefore, forms will constitute substance, <lb/>
            and these here and there 2 are in their signification equivalent <lb/>
            to substance; or, can we say that there is any existence of <lb/>
            anything independent of these? take the case, for instance, <lb/>
            of the notion of unity involved in that of plurality.</p>
          <p>And, surely, if one establish that there is the <lb/>
            same form of the ideas as of those things that <lb/>
            are participants of them, there will subsist some­ <lb/>
            thing that is in common to both; for why, may I <lb/>
            9. There is, or <lb/>
            is not, the same <lb/>
            form of the <lb/>
            idea and of the <lb/>
            participants. <lb/>
            ask, in the case of corruptible duads, and of duads that. are <lb/>
            many, I admit, in number, yet everlasting—why, I say, in the <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">νόημα</foreign> is the word I have translated " concept." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Didot reads, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταὐτά</foreign> and the Leipsic edition, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ταῦτα</foreign>; the formes <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> [BOOK XII </note> <lb/>
            case of these is the duad one and the same thing, rather than <lb/>
            in the case both of this and a certain particular duad ? If, <lb/>
            however, there is not the same form of these, the result would <lb/>
            be that entities would be homonymous, and the case would <lb/>
            be just as if one should call both Callias and a piece of wood <lb/>
            a man, though at the same time unable to discern any point <lb/>
            of communion between them.</p>

            from mathe­ <lb/>
            matics.</p>
          <p>If, however, we shall establish that other things <lb/>
            -now, I mean common reasons 1-are capable of <lb/>
            adaptation to the forms, as, for instance, a plain <lb/>
            figure to the circle itself, as well as the other portions or <lb/>
            the definition of the circle, and if that, also, to which it <lb/>
            oelongs will be annexed in addition-if all this be done, we <lb/>
            ought to institute an inquiry as to whether or not this may <lb/>
            be entirely an ineffectual proceeding ? For, also, to what, it <lb/>
            may be asked, will the addition be made-whether to the <lb/>
            centre, or to the surface, or to all the parts? for all things <lb/>
            that are involved in substance constitute ideas; for instance, <lb/>
            animal and biped. Further, it is evident that it is necessary <lb/>
            that a thing itself should be something-in the same way as a <lb/>
            surface must be some nature or other which will be inherent <lb/>
            in all the forms-as is the case with the genus.</p>

          <p>1. The insuffi­ <lb/>
            ciency of the <lb/>
            Ideal Theory in <lb/>
            accounting for <lb/>
            actual pheno­ <lb/>
            mena.</p>
          <p>BUT most especially2 might one raise the <lb/>
            question as to what at all it is that forms con­ <lb/>
            tribute either to the things that are eternal <lb/>
            amongst those that fall under the notice of our <lb/>
            senses, or to things that are being generated and <lb/>
            corrupted? for neither are these a cause to them of any <lb/>
            motion, or of any change whatever. But, certainly, neither <lb/>
            do these forms render any assistance towards the advance- <note type="footnote"> The Latin version, by rendering this " communes rationes," does <lb/>
            not throw much light on the meaning of these words. The com­ <lb/>
            mentators, as well as I can understand them, consider them equivalent <lb/>
            with " ordinary predications." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The student will remember how the same objections are urged in <lb/>
            book L chap. ix. </note> <pb n="363"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. V.] </note> <lb/>
            ment of the science of other things. For neither are those <lb/>
            the substance of these-for, in such a case, they would be <lb/>
            inherent in them-nor do they contribute to the exist­ <lb/>
            ence of anything at all, inasmuch as they are not, at least, <lb/>
            inherent in those things that are participants; for if they <lb/>
            were so they might perhaps seem to be equivalent with <lb/>
            causes, as in the case of what is white when it has been <lb/>
            mixed with what is white.</p>
          <p>But, undoubtedly, may this reason be very <lb/>
            easily overturned-a tenet, to be sure, which Anax­ <lb/>
            agoras, in the first instance, and, subsequently to <lb/>
            his age, Eudoxus,1 and certain other speculators, <lb/>
            from time to time, maintained whilst labour­ <lb/>
            ing under doubts : the theory itself, however, I <lb/>
            2. The idealists <lb/>
            cannot establish <lb/>
            their theory by <lb/>
            any of the <lb/>
            arguments <lb/>
            they have put <lb/>
            forward in its <lb/>
            support. <lb/>
            say, is capable of refutation; for it would be easy to collect <lb/>
            together many antagonistic arguments as well as many <lb/>
            impossible consequences in reference to such an opinion. But <lb/>
            the fact is, that neither do other things subsist from the <lb/>
            forms according to any of the modes which are accustomed <lb/>
            to be put forward by the advocates of the Ideal Hypothesis.</p>
          <p>And the assertion that ideas are models or <lb/>
            exemplars, and that other things participate in <lb/>
            these, is to speak quite at random, and to assert <lb/>
            3. Ideas are <lb/>
            not the models <lb/>
            of things. <lb/>
            what is tantamount with mere poetic metaphors. For what, <lb/>
            allow me to ask, is that which operates having an eye, so to <lb/>
            say, or looking towards the ideas ? for anything whatsoever <lb/>
            admits of coming into existence, and of being generated; and <lb/>
            yet there is no consequent necessity that it should be a thing <lb/>
            that is modelled after some form or image. So that, even <lb/>
            though we should suppose Socrates to exist, and not to exist, <lb/>
            there yet would be generated some such thing as Socrates <lb/>
            actually is. And in like manner is it evident that this would <lb/>
            be the case even though Socrates were eternal.2 Also will <lb/>
            there subsist many paradigms or models of the same thing; <lb/>
            so that this will hold good of the forms, likewise: as, in the <lb/>
            instance of man, animal and biped will subsist as forms in <note type="footnote"> 1 This tenet of Eudoxus has been examined into, in the earlier por­ <lb/>
            tions of the Metaphysics, as one professed by Anaxagoras, as is stated <lb/>
            in the text. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 I have followed Didot's rending and punctuation of this sentence, <lb/>

            conjunction also with ideal man. Further, not only will the <lb/>
            forms constitute the paradigms of sensibles, but also those <lb/>
            of themselves; as genus might be regarded a paradigm of <lb/>
            species that are generic. Wherefore, the exemplar and the <lb/>
            image will be the same thing.</p>
          <p>4. How will <lb/>
            the idealists <lb/>
            prove the sepa­ <lb/>
            rability of <lb/>
            forms?</p>
          <p>Further, it would appear an impossibility that <lb/>
            substance and that to which the substance belongs <lb/>
            should be separate. Wherefore, how would ideas <lb/>
            which are said to constitute the substances of <lb/>
            things involve a separable subsistence ? In the Phædo, how­ <lb/>
            ever, is an assertion made to this effect- I mean, to the effect <lb/>
            that forms are the causes both of existence and of generation. <lb/>
            Nevertheless, on the supposition of the existence of these <lb/>
            forms, entities, notwithstanding, are not being produced, if <lb/>
            also there should not subsist something that is likely to be <lb/>
            an efficient cause; and to this we may add that different <lb/>
            other things are generated, as a house and a ring, of which <lb/>
            they do not say that there are forms at all.</p>
          <p>5. Aristotle'a <lb/>
            general objec­ <lb/>
            tion against the <lb/>
            Ideal Hypo­ <lb/>
            thesis.</p>
          <p>Wherefore, it is evident that those things, <lb/>
            also, of which these advocates of the Ideal Theory <lb/>
            say that there are ideas, may both exist and be <lb/>
            generated on account of such causes as we may <lb/>
            consider the things, also, to be that have been just now men­ <lb/>
            tioned, 1 but not on account of forms. But, certainly, as far as <lb/>
            regards the subject of the Ideal Hypothesis, it is possible, both <lb/>
            in the manner now adopted, as well as by means of argu­ <lb/>
            menta that are more logical and accurate, to collect together <lb/>
            many similar points with those that already have been made <lb/>
            subjects of inquiry.</p>

          <p>1. The Pytha­ <lb/>
            foric system of <lb/>
            numbers.</p>
          <p>Now, since we have thus far arrived at some <lb/>
            settlement of the controversy concerning these <lb/>
            upholders of the Ideal Theory, it is well once <lb/>
            more to examine into the consequences in respect of num- <note type="footnote"> 1 This I conceive to be the literal meaning of these words; the <lb/>
            Latin version is as follows: " Propter tales causas quales eorum sunt <lb/>
            quæ nune dicta sunt." </note> <pb n="365"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VI.] </note> <lb/>
            bers,l that happen in the systems of those who assert that <lb/>
            they are substances that involve a separable subsistence, and <lb/>
            the primary causes of entities.</p>
          <p>It is necessary, however, on the supposition that <lb/>
            number constitutes a certain nature, and that <lb/>
            there is not any other substance of it, but this <lb/>
            very thing, as certain affirm-it is, I say, un- <lb/>
            2. Number has <lb/>
            something <lb/>
            primary and <lb/>
            secondary. <lb/>
            doubtedly necessary in this case that something belong. <lb/>
            ing to it should be classed as what is primary, whereas that <lb/>
            something as consequential to this be in every instance <lb/>
            different in form. And this directly resides either in monads, <lb/>
            and then every monad whatsoever is incapable of comparison <lb/>
            with any monad whatsoever, or all of these are directly in <lb/>
            order consequent, and any whatsoever are comparable with <lb/>
            any monads whatsoever, as scientific men affirm to be the <lb/>
            case with mathematical number.</p>
          <p>For in mathematical number there is no differ­ <lb/>
            ence as regards any monad one from another: or, <lb/>
            shall we say that, as far as the monads are con­ <lb/>
            cerned, that some of them are capable of compari­ <lb/>
            son with one another, whereas some are not ? just <lb/>
            3. Effect of <lb/>
            this on its com­ <lb/>
            ponent monads, <lb/>
            e. g. in mathe­ <lb/>
            matical num­ <lb/>
            her. <lb/>
            as it the first duad were to subsist after unity, and next in <lb/>
            order the triad; and so, therefore, another number. But <lb/>
            the monads in each number are capable of being compared <lb/>
            one with another, as the monads contained in the first duad <lb/>
            are with themselves, and those in the first triad with them­ <lb/>
            selves 2 and so, therefore, is it in the case of the rest of the <lb/>
            numbers. Those monads, however, that are contained in the <lb/>
            duad itself are incapable of comparison with those that are <lb/>
            contained in the triad itself; and the case is the same with <lb/>
            the other consecutive numbers.</p>
          <p>Wherefore, also, the mathematician reckons <lb/>
            two after the one, along with the one before, <lb/>
            another one; and after the numeration of the <lb/>
            4. Different <lb/>
            modes of nu­ <lb/>
            meration. <lb/>
            three, in addition to these two, he subjoins another one, <lb/>
            and the rest in like manner. But this philosopher-I <lb/>
            mean Plato3—after the one reckons two others without <lb/>
            the first one, and the triad without the duad; and the <note type="footnote"> 1 This inquiry he pursues in chaps, vi., vii., vili. and ix. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Bekker reads, <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτῆς</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 Aristotle plainly is alluding to Plato </note> <pb n="366"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK XII. </note> <lb/>
            case stands the same with the other number: or shall <lb/>
            we say that one sort of numbers should subsist as that <lb/>
            which has been mentioned first, but another, such as the <lb/>
            mathematicians put forward, and a third which has been <lb/>
            spoken of as last ?</p>
          <p>Numbers <lb/>
            5. either separ­ <lb/>
            able or insepa­ <lb/>
            rable from <lb/>
            things.</p>
          <p>Further, it is evident that these numbers are <lb/>
            either separable from things or are not separable, <lb/>
            but are resident in objects that fall under the <lb/>
            notice of our senses; yet not in these in such a <lb/>
            manner as we have considered at the first, but as subsisting <lb/>
            in sensibles1 through inherent numbers; or, at any rate, one <lb/>
            kind of these must have a subsistence thus, and another not <lb/>
            so, or all of them must exist thus.</p>
          <p>6. Confirmation <lb/>
            in favour of <lb/>
            these assump­ <lb/>
            tions in regard <lb/>
            of numbers.</p>
          <p>The modes, indeed, therefore, according to <lb/>
            which it is possible that these should exist are <lb/>
            necessarily only these. In general, however, <lb/>
            those philosophers who affirm unity to be a first <lb/>
            principle, and a substance and element of all things, and that <lb/>
            number derives its existence from this and from a certain <lb/>
            other one, almost each of them has declared his adherence <lb/>
            to some one of these modes, with the exception of that one <lb/>
            where all the monads are assumed as being incapable of <lb/>
            comparison one with another. And this has happened con­ <lb/>
            sistently with rational principles, for it is not admissible that <lb/>
            there should be further another mode of the subsistence of <lb/>
            number beside those that have been enumerated.</p>
          <p>r. Some assi­ <lb/>
            milate number <lb/>
            with what is <lb/>
            prior and sub­ <lb/>

            is, with ideas­ <lb/>
            and some with <lb/>
            merely mathe­ <lb/>
            matical num­ <lb/>

          <p>Some, therefore, assert that both are num­ <lb/>

            volves what is antecedent and what is subsequent <lb/>
            accords with ideas, but that mathematical num. <lb/>
            ber is different from ideas and sensibles, and <lb/>
            that both ideas and mathematical number possess <lb/>
            a separable subsistence from sensibles; whereas <lb/>
            others assert that mathematical number only it <lb/>
            is that is the original of entities, and that it has been actually <lb/>
            separated from sensibles.</p>

            been separated; but they affirm that sensible <lb/>
            substances consist from this. For the entire <lb/>
            heaven they construct out of numbers-with the <lb/>
            thematical, and <lb/>
            others for an <lb/>
            ideal, unit. <lb/>
            exception of those that are not monadic numbers-but <lb/>
            they suppose that the monads involve magnitude; yet as to <lb/>
            how the first unit consists, possessed of magnitude, they <lb/>
            seem to be involved in perplexity. A certain other philo­ <lb/>
            sopher,1 however, affirms that the first number is that one <lb/>
            which ranks amongst forms; and others say that mathe­ <lb/>
            matical number is this first number.</p>
          <p>And in like manner, also, is it the case in <lb/>
            regard both of lengths and surfaces, and in <lb/>
            regard of solids; for some say that those which <lb/>
            are mathematical are different from those that <lb/>
            subsist after ideas. But, in the case of those who <lb/>

            say otherwise, some, it is true, speak of mathematical natures <lb/>
            even mathematically-as many, I mean, as do not constitute <lb/>
            the ideas as numbers, or say that the ideas exist; but others <lb/>
            speak of the mathematical number, yet not mathematically, <lb/>
            however; for what they maintain is this, that neither is <lb/>
            every magnitude divided into magnitudes, nor that any <lb/>
            monads whatsoever can compose a duad.</p>
          <p>All speculators, however-with the exception <lb/>
            of such of the Pythagorics as assert that unity <lb/>
            constitutes, as it may be said, an element and <lb/>
            first principle of entities-seek to establish the <lb/>
            dogma that numbers partake of the nature of <lb/>
            10. The general <lb/>
            opinion in <lb/>
            regard of <lb/>
            numbers is <lb/>
            that they are <lb/>
            monadic. <lb/>
            monads; yet those, undoubtedly, speak of monads as involving <lb/>
            magnitude,2 as has been stated previously. In what number <lb/>
            of ways it is admissible, therefore, that statements should <lb/>
            have been made respecting numbers, and that all such me­ <lb/>
            thods have been enumerated, is evident from these foregoing <lb/>
            assertions : all these assertions, however, are, to be sure, <lb/>
            impossible, but perhaps one more than another. <note type="footnote"> I A certain philosopher belonging to the Pythagorean sect. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This was the tenet of the Pythagoreans. </note> <pb n="368"/>

          <p>1. Questions <lb/>
            touching the <lb/>
            comparability <lb/>
            of monads</p>
          <p>IN the first place, then, we must examine <lb/>
            whether monads are capable of mutual com­ <lb/>
            parison, or are incapable of such comparison ; <lb/>
            and, on the supposition of their being incapable <lb/>
            of comparison, whether1 they are to be viewed in the manner <lb/>
            that we have divided. For, indeed, it is possible that any <lb/>
            monad whatsoever should not admit of being compared 2 with <lb/>
            any whatsoever; and it is possible that those monads that <lb/>
            are resident in the actual duad should not be capable of a <lb/>
            comparison with those that are in the actual triad; and so, <lb/>
            therefore, that those be incapable of comparison with one <lb/>
            another which are contained in each primary number.</p>
          <p>2. If the mo­ <lb/>
            nads are <lb/>
            " comparable," <lb/>
            ideas will not <lb/>
            be numbers.</p>
          <p>If, therefore, all the monads are capable of <lb/>
            comparison, and devoid of any mutual difference, <lb/>
            mathematical number, and one number alone, <lb/>
            come into being, and it is not admissible that <lb/>
            ideas should constitute number. For what sort of a number <lb/>
            will an ideal man be, or an ideal animal, or any other species <lb/>
            whatsoever ? for there is one idea of each, as one idea of man <lb/>
            himself, and of animal itself there is another one. Numbers, <lb/>
            however, that are similar and devoid of difference are <lb/>
            infinite. Wherefore, in no respect will this triad constitute <lb/>
            ideal man more than any other one whatever.</p>
          <p>3. If the ideas <lb/>
            are not num­ <lb/>
            bers, they will <lb/>
            not exist at all.</p>
          <p>On the supposition, however, that the ideas <lb/>
            are not numbers, neither is it possible that these <lb/>
            exist at all ;3 for from what first principles, may <lb/>
            I ask. will the ideas be derived ? For number <lb/>
            is derivable from unity and the duad, which is indefinite; <lb/>
            and these are said to be the first principles and the elements <lb/>
            of number, and it is not admissible to arrange them in classes <lb/>
            either as prior or subsequent to numbers. <figure type="illustration">

            are incompar <lb/>

            ignore mathe­ <lb/>
            matical <lb/>
            number. <lb/>
            number—for, in fact, mathematical number is derived from <lb/>
            monads which are devoid of difference, and things that are <lb/>
            demonstrated thereby are found to harmonize with monads <lb/>
            of this description-nor yet can this number belong to forms, <lb/>
            for the first duad will not be derived from unity and the <lb/>
            indefinite duad. In the next place, the consecutive numbers, <lb/>
            as it is affirmed, are duad, triad, tetrad; for at the same <lb/>
            time are the monads produced which are contained in the <lb/>
            first duad, whether after the same manner as the Philoso­ <lb/>
            pher was for maintaining who first made the assertion of their <lb/>
            subsistence from unequal monads—for from things reduced <lb/>
            to a state of equality they have been actually produced­ <lb/>
            or whether they have a subsistence in another way.</p>
          <p>In the next place, on the supposition that <lb/>
            there will be one monad that is prior to another, <lb/>
            it will also be prior to the duad that is derived <lb/>
            from these. For in case of the subsistence of any- <lb/>

            ments against <lb/>
            the incompara­ <lb/>
            bility of mo­ <lb/>
            nads. <lb/>
            thing, there is something prior, and something subsequent; <lb/>
            likewise will that which subsists from these be a thing that <lb/>
            is antecedent to the one, but subsequent to the other. Fur­ <lb/>
            ther, whereas this actual unity is first, then doth there belong <lb/>
            a certain first unit to the others, and a second after that, and <lb/>
            again a third; there will be a second, of course, after the second, <lb/>
            and a third after the first one : wherefore, the monads would <lb/>
            be antecedent to the numbers of which they are composed; <lb/>
            as, to give an instance, in the duad there will reside a third <lb/>
            monad antecedent to the existence of the number three, and <lb/>
            in the triad a fourth, and in the tetrad a fifth, before the <lb/>
            existence of these numbers.</p>
          <p>No one, indeed, therefore, cf these aforesaid <lb/>
            philosophers hath asserted that the monads are <lb/>
            incapable of comparison after this mode. But, in <lb/>
            accordance, to be sure, with the principles of those <lb/>
            speculators, it is reasonable that the case should <lb/>
            6. Inconsis­ <lb/>
            tency, therefore, <lb/>
            of the current <lb/>
            systems in <lb/>
            regard of <lb/>
            number. <lb/>
            be even so; though, according to reality, such is impossible <lb/>
            For also that monads should be prior and subsequent is <note type="footnote"> a B </note> <pb n="370"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK XII </note> <lb/>
            reasonable enough, provided there may be in existence <lb/>
            both a certain first monad and first unit; and that in like <lb/>
            manner, also, this should be the case in regard of duads, on <lb/>
            the supposition that there is a first duad likewise. For after <lb/>
            that which is first it is rational and necessary that there <lb/>
            should be a something that is second, and if a something that <lb/>
            is second, a third, and so, therefore, of the rest in order. At <lb/>
            the same time, however, to assert the existence of both-even <lb/>
            the existence of a first monad, and of a second after unity, <lb/>
            and of a first duad—this is impossible. But they introduce a <lb/>
            monad, I admit, and a first one, but no longer do they bring <lb/>
            forward a second and a third ; and they introduce a first <lb/>
            duad, but no longer do they bring forward a second and a <lb/>
            third. But it is evident, also, that such is not admissible on <lb/>
            the supposition that all the monads are incapable of com­ <lb/>
            parison-I mean, that an actual duad, and a triad, and so <lb/>
            the other numbers, should have a subsistence. For whether <lb/>
            the monads be devoid of difference, and whether they are <lb/>
            severally different one from another, it is necessary that <lb/>
            number be reckoned according to addition; as, for instance, <lb/>
            the duad by the addition of one to another one, and the <lb/>
            triad by the addition of another one to the two, and the <lb/>
            tetrad in like manner.</p>
          <p>7. Therefore, <lb/>
            the generation <lb/>
            of numbers <lb/>
            does not take <lb/>
            place after a <lb/>
            similar mode <lb/>
            with their <lb/>
            generation <lb/>
            from the duad <lb/>
            and from unity.</p>
          <p>Inasmuch as these things, however, are so, it in <lb/>
            impossible that there should be a generation 0 : <lb/>
            numbers after this mode, that is, in the same man­ <lb/>
            ner as certain speculators generate them from the <lb/>
            duad and from unity. For the duad becomes a <lb/>
            portion of the triad, and the triad of the tetrad; <lb/>
            and in the same manner does it happen in the case <lb/>
            of those numbers, also, that follow next in order. <lb/>
            But from the first duad, and from the duad that is indefinite, <lb/>
            is formed the tetrad, being two duads in addition to the <lb/>
            actual duad ; but, on the supposition that the actual duad is <lb/>
            not a portion, there will exist still another single duad, and the <lb/>
            duad will be derived from unity itself, and another one. And, <lb/>
            if this be the case, it is not possible that also an indefinite <lb/>
            duad should constitute the other element, for it produces one <lb/>
            monad, but not a definite duad. Further, beside the actual <lb/>
            triad, and the actual duad, how, may I ask, will there exist <lb/>
            ether triads and duads, and in what manner are they com- <pb n="371"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VII.] </note> <lb/>
            pounded of prior and subsequent monads? for all these <lb/>
            assumptions are even fictitious, and it is impossible that there <lb/>
            be a first duad, then an actual triad; and it would be necessary <lb/>
            that this should be the case on the supposition that unity <lb/>
            and the indefinite duad will constitute elements of numbers. <lb/>
            If, however, consequences that are impossibilities ensue, it is <lb/>
            likewise impossible that these should be first principles.</p>
          <p>If, indeed, therefore, the monads are dif­ <lb/>
            ferent, any one whatsoever from any one what­ <lb/>
            soever, these and such other results necessarily <lb/>
            ensue. <lb/>
            8. These, then, <lb/>
            are the results <lb/>
            of supposing <lb/>
            the monads <lb/>
            incomparable.</p>
          <p>But if the monads1 that are resident in another <lb/>
            number are different, and others that are inherent <lb/>
            in the same number are alone devoid of any such <lb/>
            mutual difference, even in this case not a whit the <lb/>
            9. Another <lb/>
            theory on this <lb/>
            point, attended <lb/>
            with equal <lb/>
            difficulties, <lb/>
            less do consequences ensue that are attended with difficulty. <lb/>
            As. for instance, in the decade itself are involved ten monads, <lb/>
            and the decade is composed both of these and of two pentads. <lb/>
            Since, however, the decade itself is not an <lb/>
            ordinary number, and since 2 it is not compounded <lb/>
            of ordinary pentads, as neither of ordinary <lb/>
            illustrated by <lb/>
            the case of the <lb/>
            decade: <lb/>
            monads, it is necessary that the monads should involve a <lb/>
            mutual difference—I mean, those that are contained in this <lb/>
            decade. For, if they do not involve this difference, neither <lb/>
            will the pentads be different of which the decade is composed; <lb/>
            yet, since they do involve this difference, the monads, likewise, <lb/>
            will differ. And, on the supposition that they differ, whether <lb/>
            does it follow that there will not be inherent different other <lb/>
            pentads, but merely those two, or that there will be inherent <lb/>
            such? and if we do not suppose this to be the case, namely, <lb/>
            that they will be inherent, it is absurd; or, if they will be <lb/>
            inherent, what sort will be the decade that is composed of <lb/>
            those ? for there is not another decade resident in the decade <lb/>
            beside itself. But, assuredly, also it is necessary <lb/>
            that the tetrad, at any rate, be not compounded <lb/>
            and of the <lb/>
            tetrad. <lb/>
            of the ordinary or casual duads; for the indefinite duad, as <lb/>
            they say, receiving the definite duad, has produced two duads, <lb/>
            for it causes the duad it has received to become two. <note type="footnote"> 1 Some commentators make chapter viii. to commence with these <lb/>

          <p>Further, the existence beside the two monads <lb/>
            of the duad as a certain nature, and of the triad <lb/>
            beside the three monads, how, may I ask, is such <lb/>

            these-or will do so when the one amounts to a certain differ­ <lb/>
            ence of the other, as man beside animal and biped.. Further, <lb/>
            some things are one in contact, and others by mixture, and <lb/>
            others by position; not one of which is it admissible should <lb/>
            be inherent in the monads from which the duad and the <lb/>
            triad are compounded; but just as two men are not one <lb/>

            should stand with the monads. And they will not be said to <lb/>
            differ because they are indivisible, for on this account, also, <lb/>
            are points indivisible; but, nevertheless, the duad of them <lb/>
            will not be anything different from the two. But, undoubtedly, <lb/>
            neither should this escape our notice, that it happens that <lb/>
            there will exist prior and subsequent duads; and in like <lb/>
            manner doth the case stand with the rest of the numbers. <lb/>
            For, indeed, even allowing the duads to rank in the tetrad <lb/>
            one along with another, yet these are antecedent to those in <lb/>
            the octade: and they themselves have produced-as the <lb/>
            duad has these-the tetrads that are contained in the octade <lb/>
            itself; so that if, also, the first duad be an idea, these likewise <lb/>
            will constitute certain ideas.</p>
          <p>11. Confirmed <lb/>
            from the case of <lb/>
            monads.</p>
          <p>And there is the same reasoning applicable to <lb/>
            the case of the monads also, for the monads in <lb/>
            the first duad produce the four monads that are <lb/>
            in the tetrad. Wherefore, all the monads become ideas, and <lb/>
            an idea will be compounded of ideas. Wherefore, it is evident <lb/>
            that those things of which the ideas themselves happen to <lb/>
            be compounded will be composite natures, just as if one were <lb/>
            to say that animals are compounded of animals; if there are <lb/>
            ideas of these, ideas will be compounded of animals.1</p>
          <p>12. To make <lb/>
            monads to in­ <lb/>
            volve a mutual <lb/>
            difference is <lb/>
            absurd.</p>
          <p>And, in general, to make monads to involve a <lb/>
            mutual difference of any kind whatsoever would <lb/>
            be an absurd and fictitious supposition-now, I <lb/>
            mean by fictitious a thing that is forcibly con­ <lb/>
            trived so as to suit a particular hypothesis. For neither <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκ ζώων ἰδέαι ἔσονται</foreign>. Bekker has these words, and I have followed <lb/>
            Mm. The French edition omits them. </note> <pb n="373"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VII.] </note> <lb/>
            according to quantity, nor according to quality, do we see a <lb/>
            monad differing from a monad; and it is requisite that <lb/>
            every number should be either equal or unequal: but parti­ <lb/>
            cularly that which is monadic. Wherefore, if it be neither <lb/>
            greater nor less it will be equal. But things that are equal, <lb/>
            and, in short, devoid of mutual difference, we consider to be <lb/>
            the same in numbers.</p>
          <p>And, if this be not admitted, neither will there <lb/>
            be in this decade duads that are without a dif­ <lb/>
            ference, seeing that they are equal; for what <lb/>
            13. Shown in the <lb/>
            cases of a de­ <lb/>
            cade, <lb/>
            cause will one be able to bring forward who makes the <lb/>
            assertion that they are devoid of this mutual difference? <lb/>
            Moreover, if every monad and another monad make two, <lb/>
            a monad which is taken from the duad itself, <lb/>
            and the duad which is taken from the triad <lb/>
            and of a duad <lb/>
            and triad. <lb/>
            itself, will be derived from monads that are different; and the <lb/>
            question may be put as to whether this duad will be antece­ <lb/>
            dent to the triad, or subsequent to it? But there appears to <lb/>
            exist a greater necessity for its being antecedent; for the one <lb/>
            subsists along with a triad, and the other along with a duad <lb/>
            of monads.</p>
          <p>And we, indeed, in general, are inclined to <lb/>
            adopt the supposition that one and one are two, <lb/>
            even whether they may be equal or unequal; <lb/>
            14. Practical <lb/>
            contradiction <lb/>
            in this dogma. <lb/>
            as, for instance, what is good and what is evil, and man and <lb/>
            horse. They who make assertions in this way do not make <lb/>
            these assertions of the monads however.</p>
          <p>But, if the number belonging to the triad itself <lb/>
            be not a greater number than that belonging to <lb/>
            the duad, it is astonishing: or, on the supposition <lb/>
            of its being greater, it is evident that there is an <lb/>
            equal number, also, in the duad. Wherefore, <lb/>
            15. If, how­ <lb/>
            ever, monada <lb/>
            involve mutual <lb/>
            differences, the <lb/>
            ideas will be <lb/>
            numbers. <lb/>
            this will be without a difference from the duad itself. This, <lb/>
            however, does not admit of taking place if there is a certain <lb/>
            first number and a second number; neither will the ideas be <lb/>
            numbers. For this very assertion do they correctly make <lb/>
            who think that the monads should involve mutual differences, <lb/>
            since they will constitute ideas, as has been previously <lb/>
            stated;1 for the subject of both will be one form. <note type="footnote"> I Compare the beginning of chapter vii. </note> <pb n="374"/>

          <p>But, if the monads do not involve this difference, <lb/>
            both the duads and the triads will be indifferent <lb/>
            likewise. Wherefore, to the authors of this <lb/>

            one, two, in this way, we must not, beside what <lb/>
            is previously existing, make any additional assumption of <lb/>
            anything. For neither will there subsist generation from <lb/>
            the indefinite duad, nor is it possible that an idea can exist, <lb/>
            for there will be one idea inherent in another, and all forms <lb/>
            will be parts of one. Wherefore, consistently, I admit, with <lb/>
            their hypothesis do they make their assertions; yet, upon <lb/>
            the whole, they do not make their assertions even consistently <lb/>
            with their hypothesis. For they overturn many things; since <lb/>
            they are likely to say that this itself, at least, involves a <lb/>
            certain doubt- namely, whether when we count and say one, <lb/>
            two, three, we additionally assume anything in counting, or <lb/>
            whether we carry on our reckoning according to parts ? We <lb/>
            do so, however, in both cases. Wherefore, it would be ridi­ <lb/>
            culous to reduce this into so great a difference of substance.</p>

          <p>1. If a number <lb/>
            differs from a <lb/>
            monad, it must <lb/>
            be according <lb/>
            to quality or <lb/>
            quantity.</p>
          <p>IN the first place, however, above all, it is well <lb/>
            that we should come to some final distinctions <lb/>
            as to what the difference is between a number <lb/>
            and a monad, if there is any difference at alL <lb/>
            Now, it is necessary that this difference exist <lb/>
            either according to quantity or according to quality; yet <lb/>
            neither of these appears to be admissible. But, so far forth <lb/>
            as number is concerned, the difference subsists according to <lb/>
            quantity.</p>
          <p>2. Can monads <lb/>
            differ in quan­ <lb/>
            tity I</p>
          <p>And, therefore, if monads likewise differ in <lb/>
            quantity, one number also would differ from <lb/>
            another number, though it may be equal in the <lb/>
            multitude of the monads. Further may we ask whether the <lb/>
            first monads are greater or less, and whether they may subse- <note type="footnote"> 1 Some make this chapter ix. </note> <pb n="375"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VIII.] </note> <lb/>
            fluently increase,l or the contrary? for all these statements are <lb/>
            irrational But, undoubtedly, neither is it ad­ <lb/>
            missible that they should differ according to <lb/>
            or in quality. <lb/>
            quality, for it is not possible that there should reside subse­ <lb/>
            quently in them any passive condition; for also they say that <lb/>
            there inheres in numbers quality subsequently to quantity. <lb/>
            Further, neither would it happen unto them that this should <lb/>
            be derived from unity, nor from the duad; for the one is not <lb/>
            quality, whereas the other partakes of the nature of a con­ <lb/>
            stituent of quantity, for of the existence of many entities is <lb/>
            the actual nature of them a cause.</p>
          <p>But if, then, this subsists after a certain man­ <lb/>
            ner differently, we must declare that this is the <lb/>
            case likewise, in the most eminent degree, with <lb/>
            a first principle; and we must come to some <lb/>
            final distinction respecting the difference of the <lb/>
            monad—namely, that it is especially a necessary <lb/>
            3. If, then, <lb/>
            monads differ <lb/>
            neither in <lb/>
            quantity nor <lb/>
            quality, what <lb/>
            difference can <lb/>
            they involve? <lb/>
            one, and why there exists a necessity that this should be the <lb/>
            case. If monads, however, do not differ in quantity, nor yet <lb/>
            in quality, what difference can speculators assume as existing <lb/>
            in them ?2That, indeed, therefore, on the supposition that <lb/>
            ideas are numbers, it is admissible that all the monads <lb/>
            neither should be capable of comparison, nor should be <lb/>
            incapable of comparison one with another in either of these <lb/>
            ways, this point is evident.</p>
          <p>But, assuredly,3 after the manner in which <lb/>
            certain other philosophers make statements re­ <lb/>
            specting numbers neither are such assertions <lb/>
            made correctly. And these are such as do not <lb/>
            consider that there are ideas in existence, neither <lb/>
            simply considered, nor as being certain numbers, <lb/>
            4. Attack on <lb/>

            but lay down the existence of mathematical entities, and con­ <lb/>
            tend that numbers are most original amongst entities, and <lb/>
            that actual unity constitutes a first principle of them. For it <lb/>
            would be absurd to go on the supposition that unity should <lb/>
            be something primary amongst the units, as those persons <lb/>
            assert it is; but that a duad should not be something primary <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιδιδόασιν</foreign> I have followed the Latin version, " crescant;" and <lb/>

            amongst duads, nor the triad amongst triads j for all such <lb/>
            points rest on the same reasoning.</p>
          <p>5. If mathe­ <lb/>
            matical number <lb/>
            exist merely, <lb/>
            unity is not a <lb/>
            first principle <lb/>
            of numbers.</p>
          <p>If, indeed, therefore, the assertions in regard <lb/>
            of number may be viewed after this manner, and <lb/>
            if one will seek to establish that mathematical <lb/>
            number exists solely, unity, in such a case, does <lb/>
            not constitute a first principle of numbers. For <lb/>
            it is requisite that unity-such as this is- should differ from <lb/>
            the rest of the monads; and, if this be admitted, there will <lb/>
            necessarily exist a certain first duad that is different from <lb/>
            the other duads, and in like manner, also, will it be so with <lb/>
            the rest of the numbers-I mean, such as are consecutive. <lb/>
            If, however, unity constitute a first principle, there subsists <lb/>
            the greater necessity that the case should stand just as Plato <lb/>
            used to say the points regarding number were disposed, <lb/>
            and that there should exist a certain first duad and triad, <lb/>
            and that numbers should be not capable of comparison with <lb/>
            one another. But, on the other hand, if any one, again, should <lb/>
            maintain these assertions, it has been declared that many <lb/>
            impossibilities ensue.</p>
          <p>6. Thus is the <lb/>
            error exposed <lb/>
            of confound­ <lb/>
            ing together <lb/>
            ideal and ma­ <lb/>
            thematical <lb/>
            number.</p>
          <p>But, certainly, it is, at any rate, necessary <lb/>
            that the case be either in that way or this <lb/>
            way. Wherefore, on the supposition that it <lb/>
            be in neither way, it would not be admissible <lb/>
            that number should involve a separate subsist­ <lb/>
            ence. It is evident, however, from these state­ <lb/>
            ments, that the third mode 1 is expressed even in the worst <lb/>
            manner-I mean, that one which makes out that the number <lb/>
            which belongs to forms, as well as mathematical number, <lb/>
            are the same; for it is necessary that two errors at the same <lb/>
            time should concur with one opinion. For neither is it <lb/>
            possible that mathematical number should subsist in this <lb/>
            manner; but, as regards a person indulging in peculiar hypo­ <lb/>
            theses, it is necessary that he should be prolix; and that he <lb/>
            should enumerate the consequences also, whatsoever they <lb/>
            are, which ensue unto those who denominate numbers as <lb/>
            forms, this is requisite likewise.</p>
          <p>7. The Pytha­ <lb/>
            gorean system</p>
          <p>But the plan of the Pythagorica partly, no <lb/>
            doubt, involves fewer difficulties than the state- <note type="footnote"> 1 The three modes, I take it, are those severally adopted by Plato, <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. VIII. ] </note> <lb/>
            ments that have been previously made; but partly <lb/>
            It involves certain different difficulties peculiar <lb/>
            to itself. For the constituting number as that <lb/>
            which possesses a subsistence not separable from <lb/>
            about numbers <lb/>
            is attended <lb/>
            with difficulties <lb/>
            that are pecu­ <lb/>
            liarly its own. <lb/>
            sensibles removes many of the impossibilities; but the asser­ <lb/>
            tion that bodies are compounded out of numbers, and that <lb/>
            this number is mathematical, is impossible. For neither is it <lb/>
            correct to say that it constitutes individual magnitudes; and, <lb/>
            in the next place, because in the most eminent degree they <lb/>
            are disposed after this mode, ;he monads, at any rate, do not <lb/>
            involve magnitude : and how is it possible that magnitudes <lb/>
            should be composed of things indivisible ? But, assuredly, <lb/>
            mathematical 1 number, at least, in its nature is monadic; yet <lb/>
            those persons say that entities constitute number: at any rate, <lb/>
            their speculations do they try and harmonize with bodies, <lb/>
            as if numbers were derived from those. If, therefore, it is <lb/>
            requisite, on the supposition of number being something <lb/>
            essentially belonging to entities, that some one of those <lb/>
            modes that have been mentioned should exist, but it is not <lb/>
            admissible that any one of these should exist, it is evident, <lb/>
            then, that there doth not subsist any such nature of numbers <lb/>
            as those furnish who constitute number as that which pos­ <lb/>
            sesses a separate subsistence.</p>
          <p>Further, might the question be asked whether <lb/>
            does each monad consist from the great and the <lb/>
            small equalised ; or whether is the one monad <lb/>
            8. What does <lb/>
            each monad <lb/>
            consist of? <lb/>
            from the little and another from the great ? If, indeed, there­ <lb/>
            fore, the case stands thus, neither will each number consist <lb/>
            from all the elements, nor will the monads be devoid of <lb/>
            mutual difference ;2 for in this monad will be inherent the <lb/>
            great, and in that the small-being what is in its own nature <lb/>
            contrary. Further, how are those resident in the triad <lb/>
            itself? for one of them is uneven. But, perhaps, on this <lb/>
            account they make actual unity in what is uneven a mean. <lb/>
            But if each of the monads arises from both the elements <lb/>
            equalised, how will the duad constitute one certain nature <lb/>
            compounded from the great and small ? or what difference <lb/>
            will there be in this from the monad ? Further, the monad <note type="footnote">1 Perhaps the better reading is that found in Bekker and Dido, <lb/>
            namely, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀριθμητικός</foreign> </note><note type="footnote">2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀδιφοροι</foreign> is the word used by Aristotle. </note> <pb n="378"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK XII. </note> <lb/>
            is antecedent to the duad; for when it is taken away the <lb/>
            duad is taken away. Therefore, it is necessary that this be <lb/>
            an idea of an idea, being, at any rate, antecedent to an idea, <lb/>
            and that it has been produced prior to such. Of what,1 then, <lb/>
            will it be? for the indefinite duad would be formative of <lb/>
            duality.</p>
          <p>9. Number <lb/>
            must be either <lb/>
            finite or in­ <lb/>
            finite.</p>
          <p>Further, it is necessary that, certainly, number <lb/>
            be infinite or finite; for speculators make <lb/>
            number to be that which involves a separate <lb/>
            subsistence, so that it is not possible that the <lb/>
            other of these should not subsist.</p>
          <p>10. It cannot be <lb/>
            infinite.</p>
          <p>That, therefore, it is not possible that it should <lb/>
            be infinite is evident, for neither is infinite <lb/>
            number odd, nor is it even ; but the generation of numbers is <lb/>
            invariably either of an odd number or of an even: when <lb/>
            unity, in one instance, falls upon an even number, an odd <lb/>
            number is produced; and when the duad, in another case, <lb/>
            falls upon the even, that which is from unity is rendered two­ <lb/>
            fold ; and when it falls, in a third way, upon the odd numbers, <lb/>
            another even number is produced. Further, if every idea <lb/>
            belongs to some particular thing-but numbers are ideas- <lb/>
            infinite number, also, will be the idea of something, either of <lb/>
            sensibles or of something else; although neither does this <lb/>
            admit of taking place according to position, nor according to <lb/>
            reason; but philosophers arrange the ideas after this manner.</p>
          <p>II.I fitis finite, <lb/>
            how far does <lb/>
            it extend f</p>
          <p>On the supposition, however, that number <lb/>
            is finite, how far, in point of quantity, does it <lb/>
            extend? for it is requisite that this should be <lb/>
            declared-not only that the fact is so, but also why it is so. <lb/>
            Undoubtedly, however, if number extends up to the decade, <lb/>
            as certain say, in the first place, of course, will forms fail <lb/>
            quickly; as, for instance, if the triad constitute ideal man, <lb/>
            what number will ideal horse be? for every ideal number <lb/>
            reaches up to the decade.2 Therefore, it is necessary that <lb/>
            certain numbers exist of those residing in these, for these are <lb/>
            substances and ideas; notwithstanding, however, they will fail, <lb/>
            for the species of animal already will be superabundant.3At <note type="footnote"> 1 I have followed Didot. Bekker reads the sentence thus: <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρότεραν</foreign> </note> <figure type="illustration">

              the same time it is, however, evident that, if the triad in <lb/>
              this way be ideal man, the rest of the triads likewise will be <lb/>
              so, for similar are those that are inherent in the same <lb/>
              numbers. Wherefore, will there exist infinite men ; if, indeed, <lb/>
              every triad constitutes an idea, each man will be an ideal <lb/>
              man; but if not, yet, at any rate, men will be so.</p>
          <p>And if the smaller 1 belong, as a portion, to the <lb/>
            greater-namely, that which is of the monads <lb/>
            that are capable of comparison as a portion of <lb/>
            12. The diffi­ <lb/>
            culty of fixing <lb/>
            on any limit. <lb/>
            those that are in the same number-and if the tetrad itself be <lb/>
            an idea of anything, as of a horse or of what is white, man will <lb/>
            be a part of horse, if man constitutes a duad. But absurd, <lb/>
            also, is the supposition of there being an idea of the decade, <lb/>
            but not of the endecade, nor of the numbers consecutive <lb/>
            to this. Further, however, there both exist and are gene­ <lb/>
            rated certain things of which there are not forms. Wherefore, <lb/>
            the question comes to this, on what account are there not <lb/>
            forms of those also ? In such a case the forms do not consti­ <lb/>
            tute causes. Moreover, it would be absurd to imagine that <lb/>
            number, as far as the decade, should be a certain entity in a <lb/>
            greater degree, and a form of the decade itself, although there <lb/>
            is no generation of this, as of an unit, but of that there is.</p>
          <p>Philosophers attempt, however, to alter their <lb/>
            opinions, as if the supposition were true that <lb/>
            number up to the decade were a perfect one. <lb/>
            They generate, at any rate, the things thereon fol- <lb/>
            13. The at­ <lb/>
            tempted re­ <lb/>
            moval of this <lb/>
            difficulty. <lb/>
            lowing : as, take the case of vacuity, proportion, the odd, and <lb/>
            other things of this kind, within the decade; for some things <lb/>
            they ascribe to first principles,-for example, motion, rest, <lb/>
            good, evil,-but other things to numbers. Wherefore, unity <lb/>
            amounts to what is odd; for if it is resident in the triad, how <lb/>
            will the pentad constitute what is odd ?</p>
          <p>Further, how far do magnitudes, and as many <lb/>
            such bodies as there are, partake of quantity; <lb/>
            for instance, the first indivisible line, next a <lb/>
            duad, and next those numbers up to a decade ? <lb/>
            Further, on the supposition that number in­ <lb/>
            volves a separate subsistence, one might feel <lb/>
            14. Can the <lb/>
            Pythagoreans <lb/>
            solve certain <lb/>
            difficulties in <lb/>
            regard of mag­ <lb/>
            nitude or the <lb/>
            priority of <lb/>
            unity ? <lb/>
            a doubt as to whether unity were antecedent, or the triad <lb/>
            and the duad. As far forth, therefore, as number is corn <note type="footnote">1 I have followed the punctuation of this passage adopted by Didot. </note> <pb n="380"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK XXI. </note> <lb/>
            pounded unity is antecedent, but, as far forth as what in <lb/>
            universal and is form are prior, number involves an ante­ <lb/>
            cedent subsistence; for each of the monads constitutes a <lb/>
            portion of number as matter, but the other as form.</p>
          <p>15. Illustrated <lb/>
            in the case of <lb/>
            an acute and <lb/>
            a right angle.</p>
          <p>And, no doubt, in one way is the right prior to <lb/>
            the acute angle, because it has been limited by <lb/>
            its definition, and in another way is the acute <lb/>
            prior to the right, because it is a part of it, and <lb/>
            the right angle is divided into the acute. Undoubtedly, indeed, <lb/>
            as matter, the acute angle and the element and the monad <lb/>
            are prior; and, again, as in reference to form and substance­ <lb/>
            such as subsists according to definition-is the right angle <lb/>
            prior, and so with the entire, which is compounded of matter <lb/>
            and form; for both are more proximate to form and to that <lb/>
            which definition belongs unto, but in generation are they <lb/>
            subsequent.</p>
          <p>16. How, then, <lb/>
            is unity a first <lb/>
            principle ?</p>
          <p>How, then, may I ask, is unity a first prin­ <lb/>
            ciple ?1 because it is not, they say, divisible, but <lb/>
            is indivisible, both that which is universal, and <lb/>
            that which is particular, and that which is an element; but <lb/>
            in another manner is unity partly that which subsists accord. <lb/>
            ing to definition, and partly that according to duration. In <lb/>
            what way, then, does unity constitute a first principle ? for, <lb/>
            as has been declared, both the right angle seems to be ante­ <lb/>
            cedent to the acute, and the acute to the right, and each is <lb/>
            one. Therefore, in both ways do speculators constitute unity <lb/>
            as a first principle.</p>
          <p>17. The advo­ <lb/>
            cates of this <lb/>
            dogma fail to <lb/>
            establish it.</p>
          <p>But, further, is this impossible; for the one <lb/>
            subsists as form and substance, and the other as <lb/>
            a part and as matter. For in a manner each <lb/>
            one in reality subsists in capacity, if, at least, <lb/>
            number is one certain thing and not as an aggregate heap ; <lb/>
            but different number subsists from different monads, as they <lb/>
            say, and each monad does not subsist in actuality.</p>
          <p>18. This failure <lb/>
            accounted for <lb/>
            in the mode of <lb/>
            inquiry pur­ <lb/>
            sued by the <lb/>
            Pythagoreans.</p>
          <p>A cause, however, of the error which ensues is <lb/>
            this, that they are accustomed at the same time <lb/>
            to pursue their investigations from the mathe­ <lb/>
            matical sciences and from universal definitions. <lb/>
            Wherefore, from those, no doubt, as a point, have <note type="footnote">1 The student will remember how this question has been asked in <lb/>
            book II., and how Aristotle notices the theory itself in book L </note> <pb n="381"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. IX.] </note> <lb/>
            they established unity, and the first principle; for the monad <lb/>
            is a point without position. As, therefore, certain others, also, <lb/>
            have compounded entities out of what is least, so do these <lb/>
            persons likewise. Wherefore, the monad becomes the matter <lb/>
            of numbers, and at the same time is prior to the duad ; and, <lb/>
            again, is it subsequent to the duad existing as a certain whole, <lb/>
            and as an unit, and as species. On account, however, of their <lb/>
            being engaged in investigating that which has been predicated <lb/>
            universally as an unit, they in this way, also, have spoken <lb/>
            of it as a part. But it is impossible that these should reside <lb/>
            in the same subject at the same time. But, on the supposi­ <lb/>
            tion of its being necessary that unity itself should subsist. <lb/>
            merely without position-for in no respect is there a differ­ <lb/>
            ence, save that it constitutes a first principle, and that the <lb/>
            duad is divisible, whereas that the monad is not so-if this be <lb/>
            the case, the monad would be more similar to unity itself; <lb/>
            but, if the monad alone be without position, unity will be <lb/>
            more similar to the monad than to the duad: so that, in either <lb/>
            case, each monad would be prior to the duad. These specu­ <lb/>
            lators do not say so, however, at least they generate the duad1 <lb/>
            first. Further, on the supposition that the duad itself is a <lb/>
            certain unit, and the triad itself, both constitute a duad, <lb/>
            from what, then, may I ask, does the duad itself consist ?</p>

          <p>BUT one might also feel perplexed-since con­ <lb/>

            tions. <lb/>

            itself or not; and whether the duad be antecedent to those <lb/>
            things that are consecutive, or anything whatsoever to the <lb/>
            monads? <note type="footnote"> 1 Some copies read <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν δεάδα</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 These curious questions that follow in this chapter are quite <lb/>

            themselves to <lb/>

          <p>And in like manner, also, concerning the sub <lb/>
            sequent genera of number do these difficulties <lb/>
            ensue, both in the case of a line, and surface <lb/>
            and body. For some inquirers make lengths <lb/>
            from the species of the great and the small-for <lb/>
            instant the lengths, as it were, from the long as well as from <lb/>
            the shirt-but surfaces from wide and narrow, and bulks <lb/>
            from what is profound and low; and these are species of the <lb/>
            great and the small. In respect, however, of the principle <lb/>
            that subsists according to unity have different persons in <lb/>
            different ways sought to establish their opinions upon points <lb/>
            of this description: and in these, also, appear innumerable <lb/>
            statements that are both impossible and fictitious, and which <lb/>
            are contrary to all suppositions that are rational. For also it <lb/>
            happens that they are severed in their connexion one with <lb/>
            another, unless likewise the first principles are concomitant, <lb/>
            so that there should exist what is broad and narrow, and <lb/>
            long and short. And if this be admitted, the surface will <lb/>
            constitute a line, and that which is solid a surface. Further, <lb/>
            however, angles, and figures, and such like, how will they be <lb/>
            assigned ? and the same consequence ensues unto the points <lb/>
            respecting numbers; for these are passive states belonging <lb/>
            to magnitude : but magnitude is not a passive condition <lb/>
            belonging unto these; as neither is length of straightness and <lb/>
            what is curved, nor solids of what is smooth and rough.</p>
          <p>3. Common <lb/>
            subject of <lb/>
            doubt herein.</p>
          <p>Common, however, to all these assumptions is <lb/>
            that which is allowable as a subject of perplexity <lb/>
            in the case of species viewed in reference to <lb/>
            genus, when one may admit the subsistence of universals— <lb/>
            namely, whether animal itself may reside in animal, or there <lb/>
            be something therein that is different from animal itself? <lb/>
            For, on the supposition that this is not separable, it will not <lb/>
            create any doubt; but, on the supposition of its being separ­ <lb/>
            able, as the persons who make these statements affirm, it <lb/>
            would not be easy to decide the question of doubt respecting <lb/>
            unity and respecting numbers; and if such be not easy, it <lb/>
            is necessary to say what is impossible. For when any one <lb/>
            understands unity as involved in the notion of the duad, <lb/>
            and, in general, in that of number, the question arises whe­ <lb/>
            ther does he perceive a certain actual thing or something <lb/>
            alse ?</p><pb n="383"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> CH. IX.] </note> Some, therefore, generate magnitudes from <lb/>
            matter of this description, but others from a <lb/>
            point; but a point seems to them not to be an <lb/>
            unit, but to involve some similar quality with <lb/>
            4. Different <lb/>

            generation cf <lb/>

            unity, and to belong to a different matter-such as multitude <lb/>
            belongs to, but which does not belong to multitude-respect­ <lb/>
            ing which not a whit the less it happens that one feels <lb/>
            the same doubts. For if, in fact, the matter is one, the <lb/>
            same thing will be a line, and a surface, and a solid, for from <lb/>
            the same things will be derived that which is one and the <lb/>
            same thing: but if the matters are many in number, and <lb/>
            there will exist one matter of a line, and another of a surface, <lb/>
            and another of a solid, assuredly, they will follow one another, <lb/>
            or they will not; so that the same consequences will ensue <lb/>
            likewise in this view of the case. For either the surface <lb/>
            will not involve a line, or it will constitute a line.</p>
          <p>Further, how it is admissible that number <lb/>
            should subsist from unity and plurality, there is <lb/>
            no attempt made to show; yet, howsoever, there­ <lb/>
            fore, they happen to frame their statements, they <lb/>
            5. Does num­ <lb/>
            ber consist of <lb/>
            unity and plu­ <lb/>
            rality, or unity <lb/>
            and duality! <lb/>
            encounter the same difficulties as those who make number <lb/>
            to consist from unity, and from the duad, which is indefinite. <lb/>
            For one, indeed, generates number out of that which is pre­ <lb/>
            dicated universally, and not out of a certain multitude; but <lb/>
            the other from a certain multitude-yet from that which is <lb/>
            primary: for they say that the duad is a certain primary <lb/>
            multitude. Wherefore, there is no difference, so to speak, dis­ <lb/>
            coverable in all this; but the same doubts will follow whether <lb/>
            we assume it to be mixture, or position, or temperament, or <lb/>
            generation, and whatever things of this kind there are.</p>
          <p>But one might especially inquire-supposing <lb/>
            that each monad is one-from what does it <lb/>
            subsist? for, undoubtedly, each will not constitute <lb/>
            6. And what <lb/>
            does each mo­ <lb/>
            nad consist off <lb/>
            unity itself at least: but it is necessary that it be derived <lb/>
            from unity itself, and from plurality, or from a portion of <lb/>
            plurality. The assertion, therefore, that the monad consti­ <lb/>
            tutes a certain multitude is impossible, since, at least, it is <lb/>
            indivisible ; but the assertion that a monad is from a portion <lb/>
            of multitude involves many other difficulties : for it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary, also, that each of the portions be indivisible, or that it <lb/>
            constitute multitude, and that the monad should be divisible, <pb n="384"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK XII </note> <lb/>
            and that unity and the multitude should not be an element, <lb/>
            for each monad is not from multitude and an unit. Further, <lb/>
            the person who puts forward this assertion does nothing else <lb/>
            than make another number, for multitude is a number of <lb/>
            indivisible things.</p>
          <p>7. This con­ <lb/>
            nected with the <lb/>
            question as to <lb/>
            number being <lb/>
            finite or inti­ <lb/>
            mite;</p>
          <p>Moreover, also, it is worthy of inquiry, in <lb/>
            respect of those who make assertions in this way, <lb/>
            whether number may be infinite or finite for, as <lb/>
            it appears, the multitude was also finite out of <lb/>
            which and unity finite monads were produced, <lb/>
            and multitude itself is different from infinite multitude. <lb/>
            What sort of multitude, then, and what sort of an element, <lb/>
            is unity ? And in like manner might one inquire, also, <lb/>
            and as to a <lb/>
            point, &amp;c., what <lb/>
            does it subsist <lb/>
            from? <lb/>
            respecting a point and the element, from which <lb/>
            they make magnitudes; for there is not merely, <lb/>
            at least, one actual point. Therefore, at any rate, <lb/>
            one might ask the question from what each of the rest of <lb/>
            the points will ensue ? for, undoubtedly, it is not from a <lb/>
            certain interval, at least, and an actual point. But, assuredly, <lb/>
            neither is it admissible that indivisible portions constitute <lb/>
            the portions of an interval, as they do of the multitude <lb/>
            from which the monads consist, for number is composed of <lb/>
            things that are indivisible; but this is not the case with <lb/>
            magnitudes.</p>
          <p>8. Conclusion <lb/>
            drawn.</p>
          <p>Now, all these statements, as well as others of <lb/>
            this kind, render it evident that it is an impos­ <lb/>
            sibility for number and for magnitudes to possess a separable <lb/>
            subsistence.</p>
          <p>9. In the dis­ <lb/>
            cordancy of <lb/>
            their opinions <lb/>
            these specula­ <lb/>
            tors tacitly <lb/>
            allow the false­ <lb/>
            h ood of their <lb/>
            theories.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the discordancy of the original <lb/>
            framers of this Theory respecting numbers is an <lb/>
            indication that these things, not being true, are <lb/>
            fraught with sources of confusion unto them. <lb/>
            For some of this school constituting mathema­ <lb/>
            tical natures merely in addition to those that <lb/>
            are cognisant by the senses, when they came to perceive the <lb/>
            difficulty and fiction attendant upon forms, have withdrawn <lb/>
            their assent from the ideal or formal number,2 and have <lb/>
            introduced mathematical number in its stead; but others <lb/>
            wishing to make forms to exist at the same time with the <note type="footnote"> 1 This point has been discussed in chapter viii. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Aristotle means the Pythagoreans. </note> <pb n="385"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. IX.] </note> <lb/>
            numbers,l but not discerning in what manner-on the sup­ <lb/>
            position of one's admitting these as first principles—mathe­ <lb/>
            matical number will subsist independent of that which is <lb/>
            ideal, have constituted ideal and mathematical number as the <lb/>
            same in definition; since, in point of fact, at least, mathe­ <lb/>
            matical number has been done away with in this hypothesis: <lb/>
            for they introduce peculiar theories of their own, and such as <lb/>
            are not consistent with mathematical science.</p>
          <p>The philosopher, however,2 who first sought to <lb/>
            establish the existence of both forms and num­ <lb/>
            bers, in obedience to the dictates of reason assigns <lb/>
            a separate subsistence to forms and mathematical <lb/>
            10. Plato alone <lb/>
            took a true <lb/>
            view of the <lb/>
            subject <lb/>
            entities. Wherefore, it happens that all of this sect express <lb/>
            themselves correctly in a certain respect, no doubt, yet not <lb/>
            entirely with correctness. And themselves, likewise, acknow­ <lb/>
            ledge so much, as being persons who do not make the same <lb/>
            statements at all times, but such as are contrary with one <lb/>
            another.</p>
          <p>And a cause of this is the following, that their <lb/>
            suppositions and first principles are false. But <lb/>
            it would be difficult from things that are not <lb/>
            properly disposed in regard of truth and false­ <lb/>
            hood to frame an hypothesis with correctness, <lb/>
            11. The incon­ <lb/>
            sistency of the <lb/>
            Pythagorics a <lb/>
            result of the <lb/>
            falsehood of <lb/>
            their principles. <lb/>
            according to Epicharmus; for in this case, as soon as the <lb/>
            assertion is made, immediately also is apparent that which is <lb/>
            not properly disposed in the before-mentioned respect.</p>
          <p>Regarding numbers, however, let thus much <lb/>
            suffice of the questions that have been started, <lb/>
            and of the definitions and distinctions that have <lb/>

            a state of acquiescence in a theory would still the more be <lb/>
            induced to yield assent from the force of more numerous <lb/>
            arguments; but nothing further will prevail towards inducing <lb/>
            persuasion in the case of one who has not been prevailed <lb/>
            upon to yield his assent already.</p>
          <p>With respect, however,s to first principles, and <lb/>
            first causes, and elements, whatever assertions <lb/>

            those persons put forward, who are engaged in <lb/>

            merely cognisant by the senses, some of these, <lb/>
            indeed, have been declared in our Treatise on <lb/>
            Physics; but the remainder of them are omitted, seeing that <lb/>
            they do not belong unto the plan of inquiry proposed to be <lb/>
            pursued in our present Work. But whatever assertions are <lb/>
            made by those who affirm that there exist different substances <lb/>
            independent of those that fall under the notice of our senses, <lb/>
            this is a subject for investigation consecutive to those state­ <lb/>
            ments that have been already made upon this point</p>
          <p>14. Amongst <lb/>
            the Supra­ <lb/>
            naturalists <lb/>
            some put for­ <lb/>
            ward numbers, <lb/>
            and some ideas, <lb/>
            as the original <lb/>
            of things.</p>
          <p>Since, therefore, certain persons affirm that <lb/>
            there are such like ideas and numbers, and that <lb/>
            the elements of these are elements and first <lb/>
            principles of entities, with respect to these we <lb/>
            must inquire what it is they say, and how they <lb/>
            say it. Those philosophers, then, who are for <lb/>
            constituting as such existences numbers2 only, and such as <lb/>
            are mathematical numbers, are to form subjects for examina­ <lb/>
            tion afterwards.</p>
          <p>15. Two funda­ <lb/>
            mental mis­ <lb/>
            takes of the <lb/>
            Idealists, and <lb/>
            the source of <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>Of those, however, who affirm the existence of <lb/>
            the ideas, one should at the same time be able to <lb/>
            perceive both the manner of their existence, and <lb/>
            the matter of doubt that is prevalent regarding <lb/>
            them; for also do they constitute ideas as exist­ <lb/>
            ing simultaneously with universal substances, and, again, they <lb/>
            view them as involving a separate subsistence even from <lb/>
            singulars. But that these statements are not possible has been <lb/>
            previously made a matter of doubt. A cause, however, of <lb/>
            their connecting these substances into one and the same <lb/>
            species—I mean, with those persons who call ideas universals <lb/>
            -is because they are not accustomed to constitute them as <lb/>
            the same substances with sensibles.</p>
          <p>16. The Ideal­ <lb/>
            ists cannot <lb/>
            claim Socrates <lb/>
            as a patron of <lb/>
            their system.</p>
          <p>Some singulars, indeed, therefore, that are <lb/>
            involved in objects that fall under the notice of <lb/>
            our senses they considered to be in a state of <lb/>
            flux, and not one of them to remain in a condition <lb/>
            of permanence; but that the universal subsists both beside <lb/>
            these and is something that is different from them. But, as <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristotle has likewise examined these points in book I., and in <lb/>
            Physics, book L </note><note type="footnote">2 Vide book XIII. </note> <pb n="387"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. X.] </note> <lb/>
            we have declared in the foregoing statements, Socrates com­ <lb/>
            municated an impulse, it is true, to this inquiry, by reason <lb/>
            of definitions, yet he did not really abstract them, at least, <lb/>
            from singulars; and, in thus not assigning them a separate <lb/>
            subsistence, he formed his conceptions correctly.</p>
          <p>And one could make this assertion evident <lb/>
            from the actual occurrence of facts; for without <lb/>
            universals, of course, it is not possible to attain <lb/>
            unto scientific knowledge: but the abstraction of <lb/>
            17. Socrates in <lb/>
            this theory is <lb/>
            supported by <lb/>
            matters of fact. <lb/>
            them from singulars is a cause of the difficulties that ensue <lb/>
            in regard of ideas.</p>
          <p>But some, as if it were necessary that if there <lb/>
            are certain substances beside those that are cog­ <lb/>
            nisant by sense and are in a state of flux, they <lb/>
            should involve a separate subsistence-some, I <lb/>
            18. The origin <lb/>
            of this theory <lb/>
            about univer­ <lb/>
            sals. <lb/>
            say, were not in possession of other natures, but brought <lb/>
            forward those that are denominated universals; so that it <lb/>
            happens that both universals and singulars are nearly the <lb/>
            same natures. This, to be sure, then, would itself amount to <lb/>
            a certain essential difficulty in those statements that have <lb/>
            been put forward above.</p>

          <p>WHAT it is, however, that is attended with <lb/>
            doubt, both unto those who affirm the existence <lb/>
            of ideas, and those who deny their existence, has, <lb/>
            likewise, been observed previously,1 in the doubts <lb/>
            1. Repetition <lb/>
            of statements <lb/>
            in regard of <lb/>
            ideas. <lb/>
            enumerated at the beginning of this Treatise; let us, however <lb/>
            at present, make a repetition of the statements made there. <lb/>
            For if, indeed, one will not admit that substances involve a <lb/>
            separate subsistence, and that the singulars of entities subsist <lb/>
            in that manner as they are declared to do, such a view of <lb/>
            things will overturn substance, as we are disposed to allow; <lb/>
            yet, should one assume that there are substances possessing a <lb/>
            separate subsistence, how will he establish the elements and <lb/>
            the first principles of them?</p>
          <p>For, supposing them to subsist as a singular, and <lb/>
            not as an universal, entities of this kind will be <lb/>
            2. Results of <lb/>
            supposing the <lb/>
            elements of <note type="footnote"> 1 Vide book II. chap. it </note> <note type="footnote"> a c2 </note> <pb n="388"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK XII. </note> <lb/>
            separable sub­ <lb/>
            stances to sub­ <lb/>
            list as a sin­ <lb/>
            gular and not <lb/>
            as universals; <lb/>
            -illustrated <lb/>
            by the syllables <lb/>
            in a word. <lb/>
            as numerous as elements, and the elements will <lb/>
            not be things capable of being made objects of <lb/>
            scientific knowledge. For let the syllables in a <lb/>
            word be granted to be as substances, and let the <lb/>
            elements of them be the elements of substances, <lb/>
            in such a case as this it is, therefore, necessary <lb/>
            that BA be one, and that each of the syllables should be <lb/>
            one, if not, in fact, universally and the same in species, yet <lb/>
            each must be one in number, and this certain particular <lb/>
            thing, and not equivocal; and, further, they regard each one <lb/>
            as the very thing itself. If syllables, however, be thus, so <lb/>
            also will those things be of which syllables are composed. <lb/>
            There will not, accordingly, be more than one letter A, nor <lb/>
            will any of the rest of the elements be more than one according <lb/>
            to the very same mode of reasoning, in accordance with which <lb/>
            neither is there any of the other syllables that is the same; <lb/>
            but there is one in one word, and another in another. But, <lb/>
            certainly, if this be the case, there will not exist any different <lb/>
            entities beside the elements; but entities will constitute <lb/>
            elements merely. And, further, neither will the elements be <lb/>
            objects of scientific knowledge, for they are not universals; <lb/>
            but scientific knowledge is conversant about universals as <lb/>
            objects of investigation.</p>
          <p>3 Confirmed <lb/>
            from the nature <lb/>
            of demonstra­ <lb/>
            tion and deft. <lb/>
            nition.</p>
          <p>Now this is evident both from demonstrations1 <lb/>
            and definitions;2 for a syllogism is not completed <lb/>
            because this particular triangle has angles equal <lb/>
            to two right angles, unless every triangle has <lb/>
            angles equal to two right angles; nor because this man is an <lb/>
            animal, unless every man is an animal.</p>
          <p>4. If, then, first <lb/>
            principles be <lb/>
            universal, <lb/>
            would not non- <lb/>
            substance be <lb/>
            prior to sub­ <lb/>
            stance ?</p>
          <p>But, undoubtedly, if first principles are uni­ <lb/>
            versal, or, also, if substances that are compounds <lb/>
            of these are universal, non-substance in such a <lb/>
            case will be a thing that is antecedent to sub­ <lb/>
            stance; for, what is universal does not consti­ <lb/>
            tute substance: whereas the element and the <lb/>
            first principle are universal. The element, however, and the <lb/>
            first principle are things that are antecedent to those to <lb/>
            which a first principle and an element belong. And, there- <note type="footnote"> 1 As might be seen in the course of argument which Aristotle pur <unclear/> <lb/>
            sues in the Posterior Analytic!. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 As is done in book VI. of this Treatise. </note> <pb n="389"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. X.] </note> <lb/>
            fore, do all these consequences ensue reasonably, when both <lb/>
            certain philosophers constitute ideas as out of elements, and <lb/>
            when, beside ideas and substances involving the same form, <lb/>
            they may be of opinion that there is some one thing that has <lb/>
            actually a separate subsistence. If, however, there is no <lb/>
            hindrance, but that, as in the case of the elements of speech, <lb/>
            there should be a multitude of the letters A and the letters <lb/>
            B, and that A itself and B itself should be nothing beside <lb/>
            the multitude of these, on this account, at least, there will <lb/>
            be infinite similar syllables.</p>
          <p>But the fact that all scientific knowledge is <lb/>
            conversant about what is universal, so that it is <lb/>
            necessary that both the first principles of entities <lb/>
            should be universal,and not separable substances­ <lb/>
            this fact, I say, most especially is attended with <lb/>
            5. Still, if we <lb/>
            deny their uni­ <lb/>
            versality, how <lb/>
            can they be <lb/>
            objects of <lb/>
            science I <lb/>
            doubtfulness above any of the assertions already made. The <lb/>
            assertion that is made is, notwithstanding, in a manner true, <lb/>
            and in a manner it is not true; for scientific knowledge, as <lb/>
            also the act of scientific cognition, is twofold, of which one <lb/>
            subsists in capacity, but the other in energy.</p>
          <p>Capacity, then, I mean that which subsists as <lb/>
            the matter of that which is universal and is in­ <lb/>
            definite, belongs to what is universal and indefinite. <lb/>
            The energy, however, being definite, is likewise <lb/>
            this certain particular thing belonging to this <lb/>
            certain definite particular thing. But according <lb/>
            6. How it is <lb/>
            that science is <lb/>
            conversant <lb/>
            about the uni­ <lb/>
            versal, and yet <lb/>
            in a certain <lb/>
            sense it is not <lb/>
            so. <lb/>
            to accident it is that the power of vision beholds universal <lb/>
            colour, because this particular colour which it beholds is a <lb/>
            colour; and what the grammarian speculates into as this par­ <lb/>
            ticular letter A is a letter A; since, if it be necessary that the <lb/>
            first principles should be universal, it is also necessary that <lb/>
            those things which subsist from these should be universal: <lb/>
            as is shown in the instance of demonstrations. And, if this <lb/>
            be the case, there will be nothing that involves a separate <lb/>
            subsistence, nor wil there be in existence actual substance. <lb/>
            It is evident, however, that in a manner scientific knowledge <lb/>
            is conversant about what is universal as an object of its in­ <lb/>
            vestigations, but that in a manner this is not the case. <pb n="390"/>

          <p>RESPECTING, indeed, then, this substance2 let <lb/>
            thus much suffice to have been spoken ; but that <lb/>
            all constitute first principles as contraries—as we <lb/>
            have observed in our Physics3—this is also the case in like <lb/>
            manner respecting immovable substances. If it is not admis­ <lb/>
            sible, however, that there should be anything prior to the first <lb/>
            principle of all things, it would be impossible that the prin­ <lb/>
            ciple being anything else should be the first principle of all <lb/>
            things; as if one should say that a thing that is white was a <lb/>
            first principle, not so far forth as it is something else, but so <lb/>
            far forth as it is white, and that this, notwithstanding, belong­ <lb/>
            ing to its subject is white, and is something different at the <lb/>
            same time, for that will be antecedent. But, certainly, all <lb/>
            things are generated from contraries as from a certain sub­ <lb/>
            ject ; it is requisite, then, that especially this should take place <lb/>
            in contraries. Always, therefore, will all contraries belong <lb/>
            to a subject, and none of them will be separable. But, as <lb/>
            also it appears, nothing is contrary to substance, and reason <lb/>
            certifies to the truth of this statement. Not one, therefore, <lb/>
            of contraries is strictly a first principle of all things, but <lb/>
            a principle that is different from these.</p>
          <p>2. Different <lb/>
            theories on this <lb/>
            point.</p>
          <p>Some, however, make one of the contraries as <lb/>
            matter; certain of them, on the one hand, consti­ <lb/>
            tuting the unequal as contrary to unity, that is, to <note type="footnote">1 This book, which some reckon as book XIV., is somewhat obscure. <lb/>
            It is not at all times easy to understand what particular set of opinions <lb/>
            Aristotle is here setting forth: even Taylor, who is seldom baffled on <lb/>
            such occasions, is doubtful too, and seems to think that Aristotle is not <lb/>

            equality, as if this were the nature of multitude ; but some, <lb/>
            on the other hand, making multitude or plurality contrary <lb/>
            to unity. For numbers are generated by some, no doubt, <lb/>
            from the unequal duad—I mean, the great and small; yet <lb/>
            a certain philosopher generates them from plurality: by both, <lb/>
            however, this is done from the substance of unity. For the <lb/>
            person who says that the unequal and the one constitute <lb/>
            elements, but that the unequal, as a compound from great <lb/>
            and small, constitutes the duad, speaks of inequality, and <lb/>
            greatness, and smallness, as if they were one ; and he does <lb/>
            not clearly determine that they are so in definition, but not <lb/>
            in number. Yet, certainly, even the first principles, which they <lb/>
            call elements, they have not correctly furnished an explanation <lb/>
            of: some speculators amongst them, introducing along with <lb/>
            unity the great and the small, affirm that these three are <lb/>
            elements of numbers, the two first, as matter, but unity as <lb/>
            form; yet, according to others, the much and the few are <lb/>
            elements, because the great and the small are naturally more <lb/>
            peculiar properties of magnitude; but, according to the <lb/>
            systems of others, elements are things that are more uni­ <lb/>
            versal in the case of these—I mean, the exceeding and the <lb/>
            exceeded.</p>
          <p>There is not, after all, any difference, however, <lb/>
            between them, so to say, in regard of certain con­ <lb/>
            sequences that ensue, unless in respect of logical <lb/>
            difficulties merely, which they try to guard against, <lb/>
            3. The differ­ <lb/>
            ence between <lb/>
            these not <lb/>
            material. <lb/>
            by themselves introducing logical demonstrations. Never­ <lb/>
            theless, it rests on the same mode of reasoning, at any rate­ <lb/>
            namely, the assertion of the exceeding and the exceeded <lb/>
            being first principles, but not the great and the small, and <lb/>
            that from the elements number is prior to the duad, for both <lb/>
            are more universal. But now do they make an assertion <lb/>
            of the one, but do not make an assertion of the other.</p>
          <p>Others, however, have opposed diversity and <lb/>
            difference to unity; but some introduce, as prin­ <lb/>
            ciples, plurality and unity. But if entities-as <lb/>

            generated from contraries, but to unity either nothing is con­ <lb/>
            trary, or if, then, there is likely to be anything, it is plurality; <lb/>
            and if the unequal is contrary to the equal, and the diverse to <lb/>
            the same, and the different to the same-if all this be the case, <pb n="392"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK XIII. </note> <lb/>
            most especially are those persons who oppose unity to plu­ <lb/>
            rality in possession of a certain opinion that may be urged <lb/>
            in their defence ; nor, however, have even these speculators <lb/>
            adequately proved their hypothesis. For unity will constitute <lb/>
            what is fewness ; for plurality is oppos 3d to paucity, but the <lb/>
            much to the few.</p>
          <p>5. Unity signi­ <lb/>
            ficant of mea­ <lb/>
            sure.</p>
          <p>Now, as regards unity, that it signifies a measure1 <lb/>
            is evident: and in everything is there some­ <lb/>
            thing different that may be classed as a subject— <lb/>
            as in harmony the diesis, and in magnitude a finger or foot, <lb/>
            or something else of this description, but in rhythm the basis <lb/>
            or syllable. And in like manner, also, in weight there is a <lb/>
            certain definite standard of measure, and according to the <lb/>
            same manner, also, it is with all things: in qualities there <lb/>
            is found a certain definite quality, but in quantities a certain <lb/>
            definite quantity, and that which is indivisible constitutes <lb/>
            the measure; for one sort of measure subsists according to <lb/>
            the form, and another according to sense: so that there does <lb/>
            not exist any substance that is essentially one.</p>
          <p>6. The fore­ <lb/>
            going rests on <lb/>
            rational <lb/>
            grounds.</p>
          <p>And this assumption rests on what is in ac­ <lb/>
            cordance with reason; for unity signifies that it <lb/>
            constitutes a measure of a certain plurality or <lb/>
            multitude, and number that it is plurality mea­ <lb/>
            sure, and a multitude of measures. Wherefore, also, it may <lb/>
            be concluded, reasonably enough, that unity is not number; <lb/>
            for neither is the measure a standard of measure,3 but a first <lb/>
            principle, and the measure, and unity. It is necessary, how­ <lb/>
            ever, always that measure should subsist as something that is <lb/>
            the same in all things: as, for instance, if a horse is the <lb/>
            measure, that such should be horses, and if a man, men; but <lb/>
            if man, and horse, and a god, are measures, they will perhaps <lb/>
            be animal, and the number of them will be animals: but if <lb/>
            man, and white, and walking be such, by no means of these <lb/>
            will there be number, from the fact of all subsisting in one <lb/>
            and the same subject according to number; yet, neverthe­ <lb/>
            less, there will exist a number of the genera of these, or of <lb/>
            some other such category. <note type="footnote"> 1 This Aristotle shows to be the case in book IX., where he treats of <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin"> CH. I.] </note> But those who make the unequal as a cer­ <lb/>
            tain unity, but the indefinite duad from great <lb/>
            and small, put forward an assertion very far <lb/>
            7. Those who <lb/>
            make inequa­ <lb/>
            lity unity. <lb/>
            from the truth of things that are apparent and possible; for <lb/>
            these are both passions and accidents rather than subjects of <lb/>
            numbers and magnitudes.1 For the much and few consti­ <lb/>
            tute passive states of number, and great and small of mag­ <lb/>
            nitude, just as even and odd, and smooth and rough, and <lb/>
            straight and curved. Moreover, also, in addition to this <lb/>
            error, it is necessary, likewise, that the great and the small, <lb/>
            and all things of this kind, should be relatives; but relation, <lb/>
            least of all the categories, constitutes a certain nature or sub­ <lb/>
            stance, and is subsequent both to quality and quantity; and <lb/>
            is a certain passive condition of quantity which subsists in <lb/>
            relation to something, as has been declared, but does not con­ <lb/>
            stitute matter or anything else, and, in general, subsists in <lb/>
            regard of what is common in relation to something, and in <lb/>
            the parts and species of this. For there is nothing that is <lb/>
            either great or small, or much or few, and, in short, which <lb/>
            subsists as a relative, which is not much or few, or great or <lb/>
            small, or a relative, at the same time that it is something <lb/>
            else.2</p>
          <p>That relation, however, in the smallest degree <lb/>
            constitutes a certain substance, and a certain <lb/>
            entity, is indicated by the fact of there belonging <lb/>
            to it alone neither generation, nor corruption,3 <lb/>
            8. Confirmation <lb/>
            of these prin­ <lb/>
            ciples from the <lb/>
            nature of rela­ <lb/>
            tion. <lb/>
            nor motion; just as with respect to quantity there is increase <lb/>
            and diminution, with respect to quality, alteration, with <lb/>
            respect to place, motion, with respect to substance, gene­ <lb/>
            ration simply, and corruption. But this is not the case <lb/>
            with respect to relation; for, without being put in motion, at <lb/>
            one time it will be greater, and at another time less or equal, <lb/>
            so far forth as the other is put in motion according to <lb/>
            quantity. And it is necessary that the matter of everything <lb/>
            should be such as the thing itself in capacity: wherefore, also, <lb/>
            will this be the case with the matter of substance; but rela- <note type="footnote"> 1 In making a full stop at "magnitudes," and inserting the word <lb/>

          <p>But, further, elements are not predicated as <lb/>
            elements of each of the things of which they are <lb/>
            elements; but the much and few, both sepa­ <lb/>
            rately and simultaneously, are predicated of <lb/>
            number, and the long and the short of a line, and a surface <lb/>
            is both broad and narrow. But if. doubtless, also, there <lb/>
            exists a certain multitude of things to which always there <lb/>
            belongs something, indeed, that is few-as, for example, the <lb/>
            duad; for, if this were much, unity would constitute fewness, <lb/>
            and, if it were much absolutely, it would be much, after the <lb/>
            same manner as the decade, and, if this be not the case, it <lb/>
            will be more than this, nay even than ten thousand—how, <lb/>
            then, will number, on supposition of the foregoing, in this <lb/>
            way consist of few and much, for either both ought to be <lb/>
            predicated, or neither? but in the present instance only one <lb/>
            of these is predicated.</p>

            posite natures f</p>
          <p>BUT it is necessary absolutely to examine aa <lb/>
            to whether, then, it is admissible that things <lb/>
            which are eternal should be composed from <lb/>
            elements, for they will, in such a case, involve matter; for <lb/>
            everything that is compounded of elements constitutes a <lb/>
            composite nature. If, therefore, it is necessary that a thing <lb/>
            be generated from that of which it consists, (both if it exists <lb/>
            invariably, and if it were invariably generated,) but every­ <lb/>
            thing is generated from that which subsists in capacity1—I <lb/>
            mean, the thing which is being generated, (for it could not <lb/>
            have been produced from that which is impossible, nor had it <lb/>
            any existence before it was generated,) but that which is <lb/>
            possible admits of subsisting in energy, and not of subsisting <lb/>
            in this way;-now, if this be the case, that number also, most <lb/>
            eminently above all things, always subsists, or anything <note type="footnote"> I This is established in book VIII. </note> <pb n="395"/>

            else that involves matter, it would admit of non-existence, <lb/>
            just as that also which involves the space of one day, and <lb/>
            that which possesses any amount of years whatsoever. Now, <lb/>
            if this be so, thus much will be true of time also, when it is <lb/>
            extended so as to be without limit.</p>
          <p>There would not then exist things eternal, <lb/>
            since that is not a thing eternal which admits of <lb/>
            non-existence-as it has come in our way to treat <lb/>
            of this subject in other portions of our philo- <lb/>
            2. This would <lb/>
            ignore the ex­ <lb/>
            istence of <lb/>
            things eternal. <lb/>
            sophic Discourses.1 If that, however, which is now asserted <lb/>
            be true universally, that no one substance is eternal unless it <lb/>
            subsist in energy,2 and that the elements are the matter of sub­ <lb/>
            stance, there will not exist elements of any eternal substance <lb/>
            from which, as inherent, this substance is composed.</p>
          <p>But there are some persons who make an <lb/>
            indefinite duad the element, together with unity; <lb/>
            but as to the unequal, they reasonably enough <lb/>
            3. Different <lb/>
            theories on this <lb/>
            point. <lb/>
            encounter difficulties, on account of coincident impossibilities, <lb/>
            from whom so many merely of the difficulties are removed as <lb/>
            necessarily arise-on account of the making inequality and <lb/>
            relation an element-to those who make assertions in this <lb/>
            way. As many difficulties, however, as ensue independent of <lb/>
            this opinion, these it is necessary should exist for those also <lb/>
            both whether they constitute out of them ideal number, and <lb/>
            whether they do so with mathematical number likewise.</p>
          <p>Many, indeed, therefore, are the sources of the <lb/>
            error with respect to these causes; but parti­ <lb/>
            cularly does this remark apply to the doubt pre­ <lb/>
            valent downwards from Antiquity. For it appeared <lb/>
            4. Existence of <lb/>
            the non-ens;". <lb/>
            this dogma <lb/>
            examined. <lb/>
            to the Philosophers of ancient days that all entities will be, <lb/>
            one—I mean, entity itself-unless one should adduce a solu­ <lb/>
            tion of the doubt, and at the same time would advance in the <lb/>
            investigation in a line parallel with the theory of Parmenides <lb/>
            " For this would you never know tc be ‘ non-ens;'” 3 <note type="footnote"> 1 For instance, in the “De Cœlo.” </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This principle Aristotle establishes in book XI., the way having <lb/>
            been prepared for it in book VIII. and the end of book X. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 The Leipsic edition takes these words as uttered by Aristotle him­ <lb/>
            self ; I have followed Didot in making them a quotation from <lb/>
            Parmenidea. </note> <pb n="396"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK XIII </note> <lb/>
            but there is a necessity for showing, in regard of its existence, <lb/>
            that "non-ens" has an existence; for in this way out of entity <lb/>
            and something else will entities arise, supposing they are <lb/>
            many. Although, in the first place, indeed, will this be true <lb/>
            if entity is denominated multifariously; for one entity sig­ <lb/>
            nifies that a thing constitutes substance, and another that it <lb/>
            is quality, and another that it is quantity, and so of the rest <lb/>
            of the categories, therefore. What sort of one will all the <lb/>
            entities in such a case be, if non-entity will not have an <lb/>
            existence-whether will they be substances, or passive con­ <lb/>
            ditions, and other things, truly, in like manner; or will they <lb/>
            constitute all things, and the one will be this particular thing, <lb/>
            and such like, and so much, and such other particulars as <lb/>
            signify one certain entity? But absurd—nay, rather, impossible <lb/>
            -would be the assertion that one certain nature produced <lb/>
            should be a cause, and that of this entity, and of the same <lb/>
            entity, something should be this particular thing, and some­ <lb/>
            thing else should be endued with quality, and that this <lb/>
            should belong to quantity, and that to the place where. In <lb/>
            such a case, may I ask, from what sort of nonentity and entity <lb/>
            will entities subsist? for also multifariously is denominated <lb/>
            nonentity, since, likewise, this is the case with entity; and <lb/>
            non-man signifies that which is not this, and the non-straight <lb/>
            the not being a thing of this description, and the being not­ <lb/>
            three cubits that which does not possess this particular <lb/>
            quality of measure. Of what sort, therefore, of entity and <lb/>
            nonentity are many classes of entities ?</p>
          <p>5. The utter <lb/>
            impossibility <lb/>
            of this scheme.</p>
          <p>Now an advocate of this opinion is desirous of <lb/>
            asserting what is false, and of calling this nature <lb/>
            nonentity out of which and entity arise the <lb/>
            many classes of entities that are generated. Wherefore, also, <lb/>
            it was said that it is requisite that something that is false be <lb/>
            supposed in the same manner as also geometricians allow, <lb/>
            hypothetically, that a thing is pedal1 which is not pedal <lb/>
            And it is impossible that these things be so; for neither dc <lb/>
            geometricians suppose anything that is false-for that is not <lb/>
            what is the object of the proposition in the syllogism-nor <lb/>
            are things generated nor corrupted from that which consti­ <lb/>
            tutes nonentity after this mode. Since, however, nonentity, <note type="footnote"> 1 This is Taylor's translation; the word means, "what is of the <lb/>
            measure of a foot." </note> <pb n="397"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. II.] </note> <lb/>
            according to its declensions,1 is styled in an equal number 01 <lb/>
            ways with the categories, and besides this that is denominated <lb/>
            nonentity which subsists as what is fa'se, and that which <lb/>
            subsists according to potentiality, from this generation takes <lb/>
            place-from that which is not-man but man in capacity is <lb/>
            generated a man, and a thing that is white from that which <lb/>
            is not-white in energy but white in capacity; and, in like <lb/>
            manner, is it the case whether both one certain thing is <lb/>
            generated, and whether many are.</p>
          <p>The inquiry, however, appears to be as to how <lb/>
            "ens," which is predicated according to substances, <lb/>
            should constitute what is plural; for numbers, <lb/>
            6. How does <lb/>
            "ens" consti­ <lb/>
            tute plurality ? <lb/>
            and lengths, and bodies, are things that are being produced. <lb/>
            Now, absurd is the inquiry as to how, indeed, entity which <lb/>
            constitutes the nature of some particular thing is plural, and <lb/>
            not also to inquire how it possesses either qualities or quan­ <lb/>
            tities. For, beyond all doubt, the indefinite duad is not a <lb/>
            cause, nor yet the great and the small, that two things are <lb/>
            white, or that there are many colours, or tastes, or figures, <lb/>
            for these would be numbers and monads. But, really sup­ <lb/>
            posing that they attended to these inquiries, at least, they <lb/>
            would have perceived also in them the cause; for the same <lb/>
            thing, and that which is analogous or proportional, would <lb/>
            constitute a cause. For the actual deviation is a cause also <lb/>
            of the opposition that is under investigation by them, as <lb/>
            subsisting between entity and unity, from which and from <lb/>
            these such persons seek to generate entities, and have adopted <lb/>
            their hypothesis in regard of relation and inequality, because <lb/>
            there neither exists a contrary nor negation of these, but <lb/>
            one nature of entities as both this particular thing and that <lb/>
            particular quality.</p>
          <p>And one ought, also, to institute this inquiry, <lb/>
            namely, as to how relatives are plural, but not <lb/>
            single. In the present case, however, the inquiry <lb/>
            7. The inquiry <lb/>
            how relatives <lb/>
            are plural. <lb/>
            is as to how there are numerous monads beside the first <lb/>
            one; but they do not also further inquire how there are many <lb/>
            unequals beside the unequal. Although they employ and <lb/>
            affirm the existence of the great, the small, the much, the <lb/>
            few, of which numbers consist-the long, the short, o f which <note type="footnote"> 1 The Latin is “casus.” Aristotle, in the <unclear>Orgaron</unclear>, uses this word <lb/>
            to mean " the mood of a syllogism." </note> <pb n="398"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK XIII </note> <lb/>
            length consists-the broad, the narrow, of which the surface ii <lb/>
            composed—the deep, the low, of which the bulks1 consist,­ <lb/>
            and in this way, further, they without doubt affirm the <lb/>
            existense of as many species of relatives as they may intro­ <lb/>
            duce. What, therefore, let me ask, is the cause with these of <lb/>
            their being plural ? It is requisite, therefore, indeed, as we <lb/>
            have affirmed, that entity in capacity should be supposed as <lb/>
            subsisting in each of these; but by one who makes these <lb/>
            assertions is this also evinced-namely, that this particular <lb/>
            thing constitutes an entity in capacity, and a substance, but <lb/>
            nonentity in itself, because it constitutes a relative: just as if <lb/>
            he should speak of something of such a quality, which is <lb/>
            neither unity nor entity in capacity, nor a negation of unity <lb/>
            nor of entity, but one certain thing which is something belong­ <lb/>
            ing to entities; and much more will this be the case, as has <lb/>
            been declared, if he prosecuted the inquiry as to the manner <lb/>
            how entities are plural, not through the investigation as to the <lb/>
            mode those things that belong to the same predicamental <lb/>
            line constitute many substances, or many things endued <lb/>
            with qualities, but how they are many entities; for some <lb/>
            things are substances, but some, passive states, and some, <lb/>
            relations.</p>
          <p><unclear>3</unclear>. The inquiry <lb/>
            about plurality <lb/>
            extends itself <lb/>
            to the other <lb/>
            categories.</p>
          <p>In the case, therefore, of the rest of the cate­ <lb/>
            gories, the subsistence of plurality involves the <lb/>
            matter also of some other investigation; for, on <lb/>
            account of their not being separable, as the subject <lb/>
            becomes, and is plural, and those things that are endued with <lb/>
            qualities and quantities are plural likewise : although, at <lb/>
            least, it be necessary that there should subsist a certain <lb/>
            matter for every genus, save that it is impossible that it <lb/>
            should involve an existence separable from substances. In <lb/>
            the case, however, of those things subsisting as a certain <lb/>
            particular thing, there is involved some reason in the <lb/>
            inquiry how this particular thing is plural, if it will not <lb/>
            be something particular, and this very particular thing, and <lb/>
            a certain nature of this description. But rather does this <lb/>
            doubt originate from hence, how quantities are many sub­ <lb/>
            stances in energy, but not one. However, without doubt, even <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅγκους</foreign>. The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅγκος</foreign> means either " a curve," and is akin to <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγκύλος</foreign> and the Latin “ uncus, ” or "a bulk;" and it is then, according <lb/>
            to Buttman, to be referred to the root <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕγκω, ἐνεγκεῖν</foreign>. </note> <pb n="399"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. III.] </note> <lb/>
            though this particular thing is not the same with thaat which <lb/>
            is a certain quantity, it is not expressed how and why <lb/>
            entities are plural, but how and why quantities are plural. <lb/>
            For every number signifies a certain quantity, and the <lb/>
            monad constitutes nothing else than a measure, because it is, <lb/>
            according to quantity, what is indivisible. If, therefore, a <lb/>
            quantity be different from that which subsists as a definite <lb/>
            particular, from what it is that such definite particular results <lb/>
            is not declared, nor how plurality subsists; but, if it is <lb/>
            the same, the person who makes the assertion supports many <lb/>
            contrarieties.</p>
          <p>And one may also prosecute the inquiry, as <lb/>
            regards number, whence are we to obtain our con­ <lb/>
            fidence as to their existence ? For in the doctrine <lb/>
            of ideas the Idealists furnish a certain cause for <lb/>
            entities, since each one of the numbers con- <lb/>
            9. What <lb/>
            ground is there <lb/>
            for the exist­ <lb/>
            ence of number, <lb/>
            whether ideal <lb/>
            or mathema­ <lb/>
            tical ? <lb/>
            stitutes a certain idea; but the idea is the cause of exist­ <lb/>
            ence to other things, in some way or other, to be sure: for <lb/>
            let this be assumed as a supposition of theirs. To one, how­ <lb/>
            ever, who does not think in this way, on account of discern­ <lb/>
            ing inherent difficulties independent of the doctrine of ideas, <lb/>
            the case is different; so that on this account, at least, he does <lb/>
            not constitute them as numbers : but to one who introduces <lb/>
            mathematical number, whence, may I ask, is it necessary <lb/>
            even to have confidence in the existence of number of such a <lb/>
            description, and in what respect will such be serviceable to <lb/>
            other things? For neither does such a one say that it is the <lb/>
            cause of anything who affirms its existence; but such a one <lb/>
            asserts it as being a certain nature which involves an essen­ <lb/>
            tial subsistence: nor does it appear that it is a cause, for all <lb/>
            the speculations of arithmeticians, as has been stated, will <lb/>
            likewise have an existence as conversant with objects cogni­ <lb/>
            sant to our senses.</p>

          <p>THOSE, therefore, that posite the existence of <lb/>
            ideas, and say that these are numbers, should <lb/>
            make an attempt to inform us how and why they <lb/>
            1. Those who <lb/>
            identify ideas <lb/>
            with numbers; <note type="footnote">1 Aristotle has already taken notice of these various subdivisions of <lb/>
            the theories about numbers, in book XII. </note> <pb n="400"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK XIII. </note> <lb/>
            subsist; since, according to the exposition1 of each, every idea <lb/>
            constitutes one certain thing that is different from what <lb/>
            we regard the many as being. Doubtless, however, since <lb/>
            these things are neither necessary nor possible, neither is it <lb/>
            to be affirmed that mathematical number exists separably, <lb/>
            or numbers <lb/>
            with things; <lb/>
            on account of these at least. But the Pytha­ <lb/>
            goreans, on account of their perceiving many <lb/>
            passive qualities of numbers as subsisting in bodies cog­ <lb/>
            nisant to the senses, made entities to be numbers, I admit, not <lb/>
            involving, however, a separable existence; but they regarded <lb/>
            entities as compounded from numbers. And why so ? be­ <lb/>
            cause the passive qualities of numbers subsist in Harmony, <lb/>
            or mathema­ <lb/>
            tical entities <lb/>
            with numbers. <lb/>
            and in the Heaven, and in many other things. <lb/>
            To those, however, who maintain that ma­ <lb/>
            thematical number exists merely, nothing of <lb/>
            this kind is it admissible for them to affirm—that is, if they <lb/>
            follow their own hypothesis; but it was asserted by them, <lb/>
            because of these will there not exist systems of scientific <lb/>
            knowledge. We assert, however, that the case stands2 as <lb/>
            we affirmed formerly. And it is evident that mathematical <lb/>
            numbers do not possess a separated subsistence; for, if they <lb/>
            did, the passive qualities of those that have actually been <lb/>
            separated would not have been resident in bodies.</p>
          <p>2. Aristotle's <lb/>
            criticism on the <lb/>
            Pythagorics.</p>
          <p>The Pythagoreans, indeed, therefore, as regards <lb/>
            a point of this description, are not deserving of <lb/>
            reprehension in any way; but so far, however, as <lb/>
            they constitute physical or natural bodies out of numbers, <lb/>
            or, in other words, from things not possessing gravity nor <lb/>
            having lightness, things involving lightness and heaviness,— <lb/>
            so far, I say, they seem to speak respecting another heaven, <lb/>
            and other bodies, but not of those that fall under the notice <lb/>
            of our senses.</p>
          <p>8. Those <lb/>
            who assert the <lb/>
            separate sub­ <lb/>
            sistence of <lb/>
            numbers.</p>
          <p>Those, however, who constitute number as <lb/>
            involving a separable subsistence because ax­ <lb/>
            ioms will not exist as inherent in objects cog­ <lb/>
            nisant to the senses; the assertions, likewise, <note type="footnote"> 1 This is the way Taylor renders this passage. The Latin version, <lb/>
            however, would construe it as follows:—“ Those who lay down that ideas <lb/>
            exist, in their making an abstraction of every general, independent of <lb/>
            many singulars, in this way make an attempt to declare why, and from <lb/>
            what cause, each is one.” Some copies read <foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ</foreign> instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ</foreign> ri <unclear/> <lb/>

            <note type="margin"> CH. III.] </note> <lb/>
            of the existence of the other, that is, of the mathematical <lb/>
            entities, will be true; and these serve to cause a soothing <lb/>
            sensation1 in the soul: and they suppose that numbers exist <lb/>
            and involve a separable subsistence ; and in like manner is it <lb/>
            the case with the magnitudes of the mathematicians. It is <lb/>
            evident, therefore, that also the adverse argument will enun­ <lb/>
            ciate things that are contrary, and the point which just now <lb/>
            has been declared a matter of doubt must be decided by <lb/>
            those who speak in this way-namely, as to why, on the sup­ <lb/>
            position of these things not by any means being inherent in <lb/>
            objects cognisant to our senses, the passive qualities of them <lb/>
            should be in sensibles.</p>
          <p>But there are some who, from the fact of the <lb/>
            existence of boundaries, and extremities-via., <lb/>
            from a point being the boundary of a line, <lb/>
            and again, a line of a surface, and a surface of a <lb/>
            4. What has <lb/>
            led to this <lb/>
            theory with <lb/>
            some. <lb/>
            solid—imagine that natures of this description exist necessarily. <lb/>
            Therefore one ought also to discover, as regards this reason, <lb/>
            whether it may not in reality be very weak; for neither are <lb/>
            extremities substances, but rather do all these constitute <lb/>
            limits or boundaries, since both of walking, and, in general, of <lb/>
            motion, there exists a certain limit. Is, therefore, this limit <lb/>
            some particular thing, and a certain substance? but to indulge <lb/>
            in such a supposition is absurd. Certainly, however, ad­ <lb/>
            mitting that they have even an existence, all of them would <lb/>
            be found amongst those objects that fall under the notice of <lb/>
            our senses, for the argument itself proclaims their existence <lb/>
            in these. Why, then, will they involve a separable sub­ <lb/>
            sistence ?</p>
          <p>But, further, would one who was not very <lb/>
            credulous investigate respecting, therefore, of <lb/>

            nothing to those that are subsequent; for, according to those <lb/>
            who say that mathematical natures merely exist, though <lb/>
            number should not have any existence, yet magnitudes <lb/>

            are cognisant to our senses.</p>
          <p>6. This ques­ <lb/>
            tion applies <lb/>
            equally to <lb/>
            ideas.</p>
          <p>It does not, however, appear from the pheno­ <lb/>
            mena that Nature is devoid of a connexion with <lb/>
            herself, just in the way that a vicious tragedy <lb/>
            might be. With those, however, who are for <lb/>
            establishing the subsistence of ideas, this, no doubt, escapes <lb/>
            them ; for they constitute magnitudes out of matter and <lb/>
            number-from the duad, indeed, lengths, and from the triad, <lb/>
            surfaces, perhaps, and from the tetrad, solids, or also from <lb/>
            other numbers, for there is no difference. But whether, one <lb/>
            may ask, will these exist, at any rate, as ideas, or what, pray, <lb/>
            will be the manner of their subsistence, and in what way are <lb/>
            they contributors to entities, as to their being ? for, as with <lb/>
            mathematical entities, so do these neither contribute anything <lb/>
            in that way. But, assuredly, neither of these doth there exist, <lb/>
            at least, any theorem, unless one should choose to put in <lb/>
            motion mathematical entities, and to create certain peculiar <lb/>
            opinions of his own : but it is not difficult for those who put <lb/>
            forward any description of hypotheses whatsoever to be able <lb/>
            to be prolix, and to speak without ceasing.</p>
          <p>7. Those who <lb/>
            identify mathe­ <lb/>
            matical entities <lb/>
            with ideas.</p>
          <p>Those, therefore, who cement together mate­ <lb/>
            matical entities with ideas are in this way guilty <lb/>
            of error; but the earliest amongst these specula­ <lb/>
            tors having constituted two numbers, the one of <lb/>
            form, and the other of a mathematical nature, by no means <lb/>
            either have declared, or would they be able to say, the manner <lb/>
            how this is effected, and from what mathematical number will <lb/>
            be compounded. For they make it intermediate between <lb/>
            formal and sensible number. For, if we suppose that it is <lb/>
            composed of the great and small, the same will it be with <lb/>
            that which is belonging to the ideas; but if from some other <lb/>
            thing that is small and great, this will not be the case, for <lb/>
            number produces magnitudes. But if he will speak of any­ <lb/>
            thing different, he will affirm the existence of many elements; <lb/>
            and if the first principle of each thing constitutes a certain <lb/>
            original unity, there will be in the case of these a something <lb/>
            that is common-namely, unity. We must likewise investigate <lb/>
            how, also, these many are one, and, at the same time, in <note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">Προσγλσχόμενοι</foreign>• this word is akin to <foreign xml:lang="grc">γλίσχρκς</foreign>, which means <lb/>

            should be produced otherwise than from either unity and an <lb/>
            indefinite duad.</p>
          <p>Therefore are all these consequences irrational; <lb/>
            and they are at variance both themselves with <lb/>

            and there appears to be inherent in them the " long discourse " <lb/>
            of Simonides. For a long discourse1 is like that of the <lb/>
            slaves, when no wholesome assertion is made. But also they <lb/>
            appear with respect to those elements, the great and the <lb/>
            small, to bawl out as if they were being dragged away with <lb/>
            violence, for by no means are they able to generate number <lb/>
            without doubling that which proceeds from unity.</p>
          <p>But it is absurd—nay, rather, a certain one of <lb/>
            the impossibilities of this system-to introduce <lb/>
            generation in the case of entities that are eternal. <lb/>

            these systems <lb/>
            account for <lb/>
            generation ?</p>
          <p>As to the Pythagoreans, indeed, therefore, they <lb/>
            have no need to labour under doubt whether <lb/>
            they do not introduce or do introduce genera- <lb/>
            10. Why the <lb/>
            Pythagoreans <lb/>
            are Physicists. <lb/>
            tion; for they manifestly affirm that unity has been esta­ <lb/>
            blished, and that, accordingly, what is immediately nearest <lb/>
            to the Infinite, whether from surfaces, or from colour, <lb/>
            or from seed, or from such things as they are at a loss to <lb/>
            declare, is so, because it has been dragged forward, and bounded <lb/>
            by a limit or termination. Since, however, they frame Cos­ <lb/>
            mogonies, and wish to express themselves physically, it is <lb/>
            just that they should institute some inquiry concerning <lb/>
            Nature, but as a departure from the present method of in­ <lb/>
            vestigation ;2 for we are engaged in the investigation of the <lb/>
            first principles belonging to things that are immovable: <lb/>
            wherefore, also, we must examine into the generation of <lb/>
            numbers of this kind. <note type="footnote"> 1 d <foreign xml:lang="grc">μακρὸς λόγος</foreign>. As we learn from the commentators, the allusion <lb/>

            masters to give an account of themselves as to certain derelictions of <lb/>

          <p>1. Generation <lb/>
            In the system <lb/>
            of Pythagoras.</p>
          <p>THEY do not speak of the generation of the <lb/>
            odd number, therefore, as if it were a thing <lb/>
            evident that of the even there is in existence a <lb/>
            generation; but the even, in the first instance, certain specu­ <lb/>
            lators constitute from unequals—I mean, the great and <lb/>
            small equalised. It is, then, with them necessary that in­ <lb/>
            equality should be prior to the equalisation of these. If, <lb/>
            however, there always existed things in a state of equalisa­ <lb/>
            tion, they would not have been unequal at a prior period; <lb/>
            for of that always existing there is not anything prior. <lb/>
            Wherefore, it is evident that it is not for the purpose of <lb/>
            speculation that they make the generation of numbers.</p>
          <p>2. The relation <lb/>
            between ele­ <lb/>
            ments and the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἀγαθόν</foreign>.</p>
          <p>It involves, however, a doubt,1 and a subject- <lb/>
            matter for reprehension, to one who acquires <lb/>
            knowledge judiciously, how disposed in respect <lb/>
            of the good and the fair are elements and first <lb/>
            principles. The doubt I mean is as follows : namely, whether <lb/>
            any of those is such as we are disposed to denominate the <lb/>
            good itself and the best, or whether they are not of this sort, <lb/>
            but are of subsequent growth ? for the difficulty appears to <lb/>
            be acknowledged by Theologians-by certain amongst those <lb/>
            of the present day-who do not actually make an assertion of <lb/>
            this description, but who maintain that from the principle of <lb/>
            progression found in the nature of entities, the good and <lb/>
            the fair make their appearance on the stage of Creation. <lb/>
            This, however, they do, cautious about falling into a real <lb/>
            difficulty which ensues unto the systems of those who affirm, <lb/>
            as some do, that unity constitutes a first principle of things.</p>
          <p>3. Where the <lb/>
            difficulty lies in <lb/>
            this contro­ <lb/>
            versy.</p>
          <p>But the difficulty to which I allude is not <lb/>
            started on account of this-namely, their ascribing <lb/>
            “ the well ” to a first principle as a thing that is <lb/>
            implanted in it-but from the fact of their making <lb/>
            unity a first principle, and a first principle as an element, <note type="footnote"> 1 Some make chapter iv. to commence with these words, but I have <lb/>
            followed Bekker and Didot. </note> <pb n="405"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. IV.] </note> <lb/>
            and number as consisting from unity. But the poets-those <lb/>
            of the early ages1—acted in a way similar to this, so far as <lb/>
            they assert the dominion and the rule not of these first <lb/>
            principles, such as Night, and Heaven, or Chaos, or even <lb/>
            Oceanus, but of Jupiter.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding, to these persons does it <lb/>
            happen that they assert things of this description <lb/>
            on account of their changing the dominative <lb/>
            principles of the Universe; because those of <lb/>
            4. Antiquity, <lb/>
            e.g. the Magi, <lb/>
            in favour of the <lb/>
            antecedence of <lb/>
            the <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἀγαθόν</foreign>. <lb/>
            these speculators that, at any rate, were for adopting prin­ <lb/>
            ciples of a mingled description,2 and in respect of their not <lb/>
            broaching their theories in a fabulous garb--for example, as <lb/>
            Pherecydes 3 and certain others-have, in point of fact, esta­ <lb/>
            blished “ the best ” as the earliest principle of generation. And <lb/>
            this is the case also with the Magi,4 and with the Sopkoi or <lb/>
            sages of a subsequent period, such as both Empedocles and <lb/>
            Anaxagoras; one of whom constituted Harmony as an <lb/>
            element, and the other made Mind a first principle of things. <lb/>
            Of those Philosophers, however, who asserted the existence <lb/>
            of immovable substances, some, I admit, affirm unity to con­ <lb/>
            stitute the actual good; they, however, in the most eminent <lb/>
            degree regarded unity to constitute the substance of the good. <lb/>
            The matter of doubt, of course, therefore, comes to this- as <lb/>
            to what way scientific men ought to express themselves on <lb/>
            this subject.</p>
          <p>It would, however, be surprising if in that <lb/>

            the conservation of itself-should not be discovered as that <lb/>
            which constitutes what is good. But, undoubtedly, not on <lb/>
            account of anything else is it incorruptible or sufficient to <lb/>
            itself, than on account of its existence or condition of sub­ <lb/>
            sistence after an excellent mode. Wherefore, indeed, the <lb/>
            assertion of the existence of a first principle of this descrip­ <lb/>
            tion appears reasonable, as far as its reality is concerned.</p>
          <p>6. Does the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἀγαθὸν</foreign> con­ <lb/>
            stitute unity ?</p>
          <p>F or this, however, to be unity, or, if not unity, <lb/>
            both an element and an element of numbers, is <lb/>
            impossible; for much difficulty is coincident with <lb/>
            an hypothesis of this kind, and certain speculators, in their <lb/>
            attempts to avoid this, have lost sight of the point in ques­ <lb/>
            tion, when they acknowledged unity to constitute an original <lb/>
            first principle and an element of things, but a principle and <lb/>
            an element of number, however—I mean, mathematical <lb/>
            number. For, supposing this to be the case, all the monads <lb/>
            would become a something that is good, and there would <lb/>
            exist a certain fair supply of things which are good.</p>
          <p>7. How this is <lb/>
            solved by the <lb/>
            Idealist.</p>
          <p>Further, if forms constitute numbers, all the <lb/>
            forms will be such as some certain thing or other <lb/>
            that is good. Notwithstanding, let any one <lb/>
            suppose the existence of ideas of any description whatsoever <lb/>
            he feels disposed to admit; for, allowing that they are to be <lb/>
            classed amongst things that are good1 merely, ideas will not <lb/>
            constitute substances : but if, also, they are to rank amongst <lb/>
            substances, all animals and plants are good, and the parti­ <lb/>
            cipants of these likewise.</p>
          <p>8. Danger of <lb/>
            identifying the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἕν</foreign> and the <lb/>
            to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθὸν</foreign> toge­ <lb/>
            ther.</p>
          <p>Now, both do these absurdities concur with <lb/>
            this hypothesis, and what is contrary constitutes <lb/>
            an element, whether we assume it to be plurality <lb/>
            or inequality; and great and small will amount <lb/>
            to what is an actual evil. Wherefore, no doubt, a certain <lb/>
            philosopher avoided the connexion of the gcod with unity, <lb/>
            as if, on this hypothesis, it would be what is contrary, since <lb/>
            generation arose from contraries, that the nature of plurality <lb/>
            should necessarily be evil. Some, however, affirm the unequal <lb/>
            to be of the nature of evil. <note type="footnote"> 1 This reminds one of the doctrines of Plato, in his yearnings after <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin"> CH. V.] </note> Therefore do all these entities happen to have <lb/>
            a share in what is evil, except unity-which con­ <lb/>
            stitutes actual unity-and we find that numbers <lb/>
            9. Evil in this <lb/>
            way is the gocd <lb/>

            participate in a more unmixed state than magnitudes; it <lb/>
            also follows that evil is a place of the good, and that it <lb/>
            shares in and desires after that which is subject to decay of <lb/>
            itself; for one contrary is corruptive of another contrary. <lb/>
            And if it is the case, as we have affirmed, that matter <lb/>
            constitutes everything that subsists in capacity-as fire in <lb/>
            capacity is the matter of fire in energy-evil will constitute <lb/>
            the good itself in potentiality.</p>
          <p>Now, all these results concur partly in con­ <lb/>
            sequence of their constituting every first prin­ <lb/>
            ciple as an element, and partly in consequence <lb/>

            sible, it is evident that first principles are not <lb/>
            correctly assigned, nor the primary substances. <lb/>
            1. What fol­ <lb/>
            lows on the non- <lb/>
            classification of <lb/>
            the TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὰγαθὸν</foreign> <lb/>
            amongst first <lb/>
            principles. <lb/>
            Yet one does not form his opinions correctly, either if he <lb/>
            should assimilate the first principles of the Universe to the <lb/>
            principle belonging to animals and plants ; because from <lb/>
            things that are indefinite and unfinished there arise always <lb/>
            things that are more perfect. Wherefore, also, in the case of <lb/>
            the Primary Substances, they affirm that it happens in this <lb/>
            way, that neither does any particular entity constitute actual <lb/>
            unity. For in objects that are here-that is, that fall under <lb/>
            the notice of our senses-are the first principles perfect from <lb/>
            which these objects derive their original; for man begets <lb/>
            man, and the seed is not that which is first. But it would be <lb/>
            absurd, also, the making a place along with mathematical <pb n="408"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK XIII. </note> <lb/>
            solids—for the place of singulars is peculiar to them ; where­ <lb/>
            fore are they topically or locally separable, mathematical <lb/>
            solids, however, are not situated in any certain locality; and <lb/>
            the assertion that they will be situated, indeed, somewhere, <lb/>
            and at the same time not to say what the place is, is absurd.</p>
          <p>2. How does <lb/>
            number ori­ <lb/>
            ginate from <lb/>
            first principles f</p>
          <p>But it would become those who say that <lb/>
            entities are compounded of elements, and that <lb/>
            numbers are the first of entities, that they should, <lb/>
            by thus making a division as to how one thing <lb/>
            derives an existence from another, express themselves in such <lb/>
            a way as to make us acquainted after what manner number <lb/>
            originates from certain first principles, whether this takes <lb/>
            place by means of mixture.</p>
          <p>3. Is it by mix­ <lb/>
            ture?</p>
          <p>Neither, however, is everything that has <lb/>
            undergone mxiture different from that which <lb/>
            is being produced; and unity will not be a thing that <lb/>
            involves a separable subsistence, nor a different nature: <lb/>
            but they wish that it should be after this manner. Does <lb/>
            or by syn­ <lb/>
            thesis f <lb/>
            number, however, we may as, subsist through <lb/>
            composition as a syllable ? But in this case it <lb/>
            is requisite that there should be position; and he who <lb/>
            employs his understanding thereupon will comprehend unity <lb/>
            apart from plurality. Number, then, will constitute this, <lb/>
            that is, a monad and plurality, or unity and inequality. <lb/>
            And since that body which subsists from certain entities <lb/>
            subsists partly as from things that are inherent, and partly <lb/>
            that this is not the case, in which, may I ask, will number be <lb/>
            found ? for those things which do not subsist in this way, as <lb/>
            from those that are inherent, are no other than those of <lb/>
            or in the way <lb/>
            a thing is from <unclear/> <lb/>
            seed ? <lb/>
            which there is generation. Does it, however, <lb/>
            then, subsist as from seed ? But it is not pos­ <lb/>
            sible for anything to proceed forth from what is <lb/>
            indivisible. Shall we say, however, that it arises from a con­ <lb/>
            trary that does not involve a permanent subsistence? But <lb/>
            whatever things subsist in this manner, are also from some­ <lb/>
            thing else that does possess a permanent subsistence.</p>
          <p>4. Different <lb/>
            theories of <lb/>
            unity have pro­ <lb/>
            duced different <lb/>
            results.</p>
          <p>Since, therefore, as regards unity, one Philo­ <lb/>
            sopher, in fact, posites it as &amp; thing that is con­ <lb/>
            trary to plurality, and another as what is con­ <lb/>
            trary to inequality, employing unity as if it were <lb/>
            equality, number should, therefore, subsist as if it were from <pb n="409"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. V.] </note> <lb/>
            contraries. There will then be something else from which, as <lb/>
            involving a permanent subsistence, a generation of the other <lb/>
            is brought about. Further, why then, at all, are the other <lb/>
            things of this sort subject to decay, as many as have their <lb/>
            existence from contraries, or wherein contraries are to be <lb/>
            found ?-why, I say, are they subject to decay, even though <lb/>
            they may arise from everything ? and yet that this be not <lb/>
            the case with number. For respecting this nothing is do­ <lb/>
            clared, although a contrary, which is both inherent and not <lb/>
            inherent, destroys that which is contrary to itself; as. for <lb/>
            instance, discord, mixture: and yet, at any rate, such ought <lb/>
            not necessarily to be the case ; for the former is not contrary <lb/>
            to the latter, at least.</p>
          <p>There has been, however, no determination <lb/>
            arrived at either, as to the mode in which num­ <lb/>
            bers are causative of substances, and of existence, <lb/>
            whether as limits, for example, points of magni- <lb/>
            5. Vagueness <lb/>
            as to the mode <lb/>
            of the causality <lb/>
            of numbers. <lb/>
            ; and according to the arrangements adopted by Eurytus, <lb/>
            that a certain number belongs to a certain thing, as this <lb/>
            number belongs to man, and that to horse, just as they who <lb/>
            refer numbers to figures, the triangle and the square, thus <lb/>
            assimilating the forms of plants to pebbles of calculation ? 1 <lb/>
            Or, shall we say that this is the case with the ratio or the <lb/>
            symphony of numbers? And, in like manner, it is so as <lb/>
            regards man, and everything else: but, as regards thou the <lb/>
            passive states, how, may I ask, are they numbers, such as <lb/>
            the white, and sweet, and hot?</p>
          <p>That numbers, however, do not constitute sub­ <lb/>
            stances, and that they are not causes of form, is <lb/>
            plain; for reason, that is, the formal principle, <lb/>
            6. Numbers do <lb/>
            not constitute <lb/>
            substances. <lb/>
            constitutes substance, but number constitutes matter, as the <lb/>
            number or substance of flesh or bone. In this way are there <lb/>
            three of fire, and two of earth: and number, whatsoever it <lb/>
            may be, is invariably of certain things, and constitutes either <lb/>
            what is fiery or earthy, or of the nature of a monad. Sub­ <lb/>
            stance, however, is that which consists in being so much with <lb/>
            relation to so much, according to mixture; but this no longer <lb/>
            constitutes number, but a proportion or ratio of the mixture <lb/>
            of corporeal numbers, or certain other things. Neither, <lb/>
            therefore, does number constitute a cause in respect of pro- <note type="footnote"> 1 For the allusion contained in these words, vide note p. 41&amp; </note> <pb n="410"/>
            <note type="margin"> [BOOK XIII. </note> <lb/>
            duction, nor does it as number exist at all, nor as such num­ <lb/>
            ber as is of the nature of a monad, nor as matter, nor as <lb/>
            the formal principle, and the form itself of things. But, <lb/>
            undoubtedly, neither does it constitute that on account of <lb/>
            which a thing subsists-I mean, of course, the final cause of <lb/>
            things.</p>

          <p>1. What is the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ εὖ</foreign> that ori­ <lb/>
            ginates from <lb/>
            number?</p>
          <p>ONE, however, might also doubt what " the <lb/>
            well" is which originates from numbers, if mix­ <lb/>
            ture is to be found in number, either in that <lb/>
            which is rational, or in that which is odd. For <lb/>
            now would nothing more conducive to health arise from water <lb/>
            and honey being thrice three times mingled; but it would <lb/>
            be of more service in that way supposing that there were <lb/>
            to subsist no proportion in the condiments, but that it be <lb/>
            watery, or, in number that which is an unmixed entity. <lb/>
            Further, the ratios—I mean those belonging to the mixtures <lb/>
            --consequent upon the addition of numbers are not found <lb/>
            in numbers themselves, as the ratio between 3 and 2 is that <lb/>
            of 3: 2, not thrice two, however, for there ought to be the <lb/>
            same genus in the multiplications. Wherefore, it is necessary <lb/>
            that both by the A should be measured the order in which <lb/>
            the ABG is to be found, and by the D, that which DEZ <lb/>
            will assume. Wherefore, there must be the same measure <lb/>
            in all things. Therefore, there will be of fire BEGZ, and <lb/>
            of water the number twice three.</p>
          <p>2. Conse­ <lb/>
            quences of <lb/>
            making all <lb/>
            things share in <lb/>
            numbers.</p>
          <p>But if it be necessary that all things should <lb/>
            participate of number, it is requisite, likewise, <lb/>
            that there should be a concurrence of many things <lb/>
            that are the same, and that there should be the <lb/>
            same number for this and for another. Is this thing, there­ <lb/>
            fore, a cause, and on account of this is there anything <unclear>thaf</unclear> <lb/>
            is done,1 or is it obscure, such, for instance, as is a certain <lb/>
            number of the revolutionary movements of the sun; and, <lb/>
            again, of those of the moon ; and the life and age of each of <lb/>
            the animal creation, at least? What obstruction, then, I may <lb/>
            ask, is there to some of these being square, but others of them <note type="footnote"> I <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρᾶγμα</foreign> is the thing done, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρἇξις</foreign> the method of doing it. </note> <pb n="411"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. VI.] </note> <lb/>
            cubical and equal to each other, and others twofold. For there <lb/>
            is no hindrance to this: but it is necessary that they be <lb/>
            intimately connected with these, if all things are wont to <lb/>
            participate in common of number; and if it should be admis­ <lb/>
            sible that things which differ from each other should fall <lb/>
            under the same number. Wherefore, if the same number <lb/>
            happens to be found in certain things, those will be the same <lb/>
            with one another, having the same form of number; as sun <lb/>
            and moon will be the same, having the same numerical form.</p>
          <p>But why are these causes of things? There <lb/>
            are seven vowels, no doubt, and seven chords or <lb/>
            harmonies, and seven Pleiades,1 and within seven <lb/>
            years some animals cast their teeth-some, at <lb/>
            S. The causa­ <lb/>
            lity of numbers <lb/>
            tested by in­ <lb/>
            stances. <lb/>
            any rate, do so, and some do not-and seven in number were <lb/>
            those warriors that undertook the famous expedition against <lb/>
            Thebes.2 Is it, then, the case, because such a particular <lb/>
            number is naturally suited for such purposes, that on this <lb/>
            account either those chieftains amounted to seven, or that the <lb/>
            Pleiades consist of seven stars; or were the " Septem contra <lb/>
            Thebas" so on account of the gates of Thebes, or through <lb/>
            some other different cause ? If, however, we reckon in this <lb/>
            manner, and assign twelve stars to Arcturus, at least, yet <lb/>
            others agree in assigning a greater number; since XYZ <lb/>
            they affirm to constitute symphonies, and that because those <lb/>
            are three, these also are three. But that there may be ten <lb/>
            thousand things of this sort no one in the least feels any <lb/>
            concern; for G and R would be one sign. But if because <lb/>
            each of the others is twofold, but another is not so-now the <lb/>
            cause is, inasmuch as there being three places, one in each is <lb/>
            added to S—on this account there subsist three only, but not <lb/>
            because there are three symphonies, since there are, at least, <lb/>
            more symphonies than three; yet in the present instance there <lb/>
            cannot any longer be more than three. Now, these philoso­ <lb/>
            phers, also, are not unlike the ancient interpreters of Homer, <lb/>
            who discover minute, but fail to observe important, similitudes. <note type="footnote"> 1 Aristotle himself wrote a work upon astronomy, which has not come <lb/>
            down to us. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This alludes to the well-known defence of Thebes against the <lb/>
            Argives, led on by Polynices against his brother Eteocles, who chose <lb/>
            six chieftains beside himself-just as Aristotle states-that there <lb/>
            might be one commander posted at each of the gates. </note><note type="footnote">a Possibly this sneer may have been levelled against those phi. </note> <pb n="412"/>

            of others on <lb/>
            this subject.</p>
          <p>Certain speculators, however, assert that there <lb/>
            are many such like particulars; as, for instance, <lb/>
            even as regards media, one medium is nine, <lb/>
            whereas another is eight, and a verse of seventeen feet is <lb/>
            equal in number to these. Now they say that the verse ascends <lb/>
            on the right in nine syllables, but in eight on the left, and that <lb/>
            the distance is equal, both in letters from A to Z, and in <lb/>
            musical instruments from the most grave sound to the most <lb/>
            acute, the number of which constitutes an equality in the <lb/>
            all-various melody of the Heaven. One ought not, however, <lb/>
            to observe things of this kind (for no one would entertain <lb/>
            a shadow of doubt as regards them); nor ought we to make <lb/>
            any assertions concerning them, nor to attempt to discover <lb/>
            them in things that are eternal; since, also, they are to be <lb/>
            discovered in things that are subject to corruption.</p>
          <p>5. The causa­ <lb/>
            lity of numbers <lb/>
            cannot be <lb/>
            proved;</p>
          <p>Those natures, however, in numbers that are <lb/>
            the subjects of applause, and the things contrary <lb/>
            to these, and in general those that fall under our <lb/>
            notice in the mathematical sciences-as some, <note type="footnote"> losophers of the very early ages who sought to win assent to their <lb/>
            theories by enlisting in their favour the sanction of the popular <lb/>
            Religion. Now, this many of them endeavoured to accomplish by <lb/>
            attempting to prove their doctrines to be in harmony with certain <lb/>
            systems of science capable of being extracted, as they alleged, from an <lb/>
            allegorical interpretation of Homer's poetry. Supposing, however, that <lb/>
            Aristotle here directs his attack against the " Critics," technically so <lb/>
            termed, such censure must be received with some latitude, for we have <lb/>
            the names of, at least, four of these Critics, free from the imputation of <lb/>
            such extravagances in interpretation, and which, as such, have been <lb/>
            indissolubly united with the Iliad and Odyssey, namely, Zenodotus, <lb/>
            Aristophanes of Byzantium, Aristarchus, and Crates. At the same <lb/>
            time, we must allow that the complaint uttered in the text has been <lb/>
            reiterated by those who have had occasion to examine into the critical <lb/>
            labours of Antiquity upon the Homeric writings. Indeed, in a matter <lb/>
            of the kind, Aristotle himself was no contemptible authority, for he <lb/>
            produced poems from his own pen, one of which has been preserved by <lb/>
            Diogenes Laertius (p. 183, Bohn's Trans.). In the " Poetics," too, we <lb/>
            can see how completely he has mastered the difficulties of his subject, <lb/>
            and we have reason to think that he wrote more at large upon it in <lb/>
            other works—e.g. his <foreign xml:lang="grc">Περὶ Ποιητῶν</foreign>—that have unfortunately perished. <lb/>
            In fact, there was no quarter of the regions of knowledge — the <lb/>
            " globus iutellectualis," as Bacon would say-so far as they had been <lb/>
            explored by mankind at that primitive period of the world's history, <lb/>
            but had been fully penetrated by the sagacity of this extraordinary <lb/>

            in fact, affirm them to be, and constitute them as causes of <lb/>
            Nature-appear to persons, at least, who view the matter III <lb/>
            this light, to escape their notice; for according to no one of <lb/>
            the modes of those that are defined respecting first principles <lb/>
            is any of them causative. And yet they do make manifest that <lb/>
            point, namely, that " the well" has a subsistence, and that to <lb/>
            the co-ordination in the case of the fair belong the odd, the <lb/>
            straight, the equal, the powers of certain numbers. For at the <lb/>
            same time subsist seasons, and such a particular number, and <lb/>
            other things, therefore, of this sort-such as they gather from <lb/>
            mathematical theorems-these all involve this power or <lb/>
            capacity. Wherefore, also, they seem like unto casual coinci­ <lb/>
            dences ; for they are accidents, no doubt, yet all are appro­ <lb/>
            priate to one another, the analogical, however, is one. For in <lb/>
            each category of entity is there the analogical; as the straight <lb/>
            in length is analogous to the even in superficies, to, perhaps, <lb/>
            the odd in number, and in colour to the white.</p>
          <p>Further, numbers which are in the species do <lb/>
            not constitute causes1 of things harmonic, and the <lb/>
            like j for those that are equals in the species <lb/>
            differ from each other, for likewise do the monads <lb/>
            6. As may be <lb/>
            shown in the <lb/>
            case of formal <lb/>
            number. <lb/>
            differ. Wherefore, on account of these things, at least, we <lb/>
            must not constitute them species. As regards the conse­ <lb/>
            quences, indeed, then, that ensue, both these, and even <unclear>stih</unclear> <lb/>
            more than these, can be collected. They appear, however, to <lb/>
            furnish a proof of the fact that the supporters of the Ideal <lb/>
            Hypothesis fall into many errors respecting the generation of <lb/>
            them, and that in no way can a connexion be traced in their <lb/>
            systems; inasmuch as mathematical species do not involve <lb/>
            a subsistence separable from sensibles, as some affirm; nor do <lb/>
            these constitute the first principles of things. <note type="footnote"> 1 The causality of numbers Eurytus-its great patron-was in the <lb/>
            habit of proving to its opponents by the following curious illustration: <lb/>
            -Smearing a wall with a substance capable of being impressed with a <lb/>
            sketch of the human figure, he would then take numerous small pebbles <lb/>
            of various colours, and fix them within the outlines of the face, hands, <lb/>
            and so on, till all of them were exhausted. At other times he would <lb/>
            do the same in the case of the picture of a plant. The amount of <lb/>
            pebbles thus employed he would assign as the causative number of <lb/>
            man or plant in the reality of things. This plainly is the allusion in <lb/>
            the words (cbap. v), <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφομοιοῦνται ψῆφοις τὰς ἀφορμὰς τῶν φυτῶμ</foreign>, " por­ <lb/>

          <p>THERE has prevailed some diversity of opinion as to the import <lb/>
            of the word Metaphysics, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ μετὰ τὰ φυσικά</foreign>.</p>
          <p>Man's natural thirst for knowledge is indicated by what fact, <lb/>
            according to Aristotle ?</p>
          <p>State the Stagyrite's object in reminding us of our natural desire <lb/>
            of knowledge.</p>
          <p>A graduated scale of intelligence is observable in the animal <lb/>
            creation.</p>
          <p>Why is this fact in Natural History brought under notice P <lb/>
            Amongst the senses, we award the superiority to the sense OI <lb/>
            sight. Why P</p>
          <p>What distinguishes man from the other animals, in respect of his <lb/>
            means of acquiring knowledge ?</p>
          <p>Point out the difference between Art and Experience.</p>
          <p>Show that you understand Aristotle's object in noticing this <lb/>
            difference.</p>
          <p>Why does Aristotle award the superiority to Art compared with <lb/>
            Experience, and how does this bear on the science of Ontology P</p>
          <p>What, in fact, is the distinguishing trait in the scientific man ?</p>
          <p>How does Aristotle account for the admiration that is bestowed <lb/>
            upon the inventor of any art whatsoever P</p>
          <p>Signify the difference between animate and inanimate things, in <lb/>
            regard of the fulfilment of their proper functions.</p>
          <p>The wonder evoked by clever discoveries is entirely independent <lb/>
            of their utility. Show this to be the fact.</p>
          <p>Historical proof of this.</p>
          <p>In what part of Aristotle's works are we to look for his distinction <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin"> CH. III.] </note> As regards the experienced, why do we find them compassing their <lb/>
            objects more successfully than the mere theorist?</p>
          <p>Aristotle illustrates this from the science of Medicine.</p>
          <p>When do we award the superiority to Experience over Art ? And <lb/>
            when do we the same to Art over Experience ?</p>
          <p>State Aristotle's object, that he has in view, in undertaking his <lb/>

          <p>ALLOWING Metaphysics to be conversant with causes, as such, <lb/>
            what inquiry presents itself next in order ?</p>
          <p>What determines this precise order ?</p>
          <p>Give an analysis of Aristotle's Sophos, or " Wise Man," as well <lb/>
            as of his Sophia, or Wisdom ?</p>
          <p>Mr. Maurice well points out in what respect Aristotle in these <lb/>
            Analyses departed from his predecessors.</p>
          <p>Could you show how these Analyses bear on the subject of meta­ <lb/>
            physical science P</p>
          <p>What do we term Science " par excellence?"</p>
          <p>Knowledge after all is eligible for its own sake. Could you prove <lb/>
            this ?</p>
          <p>The purely speculative character of the higher sciences is mani­ <lb/>
            fested in the earliest systems of Philosophy.</p>
          <p>Now, this fact bears immensely on the question of the dignity of <lb/>
            Metaphysical Science.</p>
          <p>What object has Aristotle in his mention of Simonides, in this <lb/>
            second chapter P</p>
          <p>Why is it not correct to ascribe Philosophy to an origin merely <lb/>
            human ?</p>
          <p>Aristotle mentions the general sense of mankind on the nature of <lb/>
            a cause.</p>
          <p>Would not this determine the origin of Metaphysical Science ?</p>
          <p>Aristotle censures a certain view of the Divine nature prevalent <lb/>
            amongst the poets.</p>
          <p>This view, however, seems supported by what is often observed <lb/>
            actually to take place.</p>
          <p>Regarding Metaphysics as a science of causes, determine the order <lb/>
            of its development ?</p>
          <p>Now, does this order correspond with that assumed by the rest of <lb/>
            the sciences P</p>

          <p>WHY has Aristotle occasion to examine into how many genera <lb/>
            causes may be reduced ?</p>
          <p>Has he made a similar reduction in any other part of his writings <unclear/>&lt;</p><pb n="416"/>
            
          <p><note type="margin"> [BOOK I.<unclear>J</unclear>. </note> Point out from the History of Philosophy any fact that testifies <lb/>
            to the permanence of this fourfold division of causes.</p>
          <p>It is the nature of Metaphysics as a science that forces on Aristotle <lb/>
            his review of the Greek Philosophy. Why ?</p>
          <p>This review, however, will be serviceable to the Metaphysician. <lb/>
            Why?</p>
          <p>Now, what is the Stagyrite's genera! objection—stated almost from <lb/>
            the start-against the entire Greek Philosophy P</p>
          <p>He proceeds to make good this objection from the mention of <lb/>
            particular systems.</p>
          <p>Could you state-as given by Aristotle-the notion of the ancient <lb/>
            Philosophers about the nature of " an element"?</p>
          <p>Whom does the Stagy rite specify as the author of the Materialistic <lb/>
            Philosophy ?</p>
          <p>Do Cicero and Aristotle agree in their view of the system of <lb/>
            Thales P</p>
          <p>We can find traces according to Aristotle of the Thaletian Philo­ <lb/>
            sophy, amongst the very ancient Theologians in their Theogonies.</p>
          <p>The Philosophy, however, of Thales does not entirely contradict <lb/>
            experience.</p>
          <p>Aristotle states what he considers to be the origin in Nature of <lb/>
            the principles put forward by Thales.</p>
          <p>Aristotle mentions water as an object of adjuration amongst the <lb/>
            gods. What object has he in this ?</p>
          <p>What Philosophers does the Stagyrite bring under review next ?</p>
          <p>These ancient Philosophers unconsciously adopted correct prin­ <lb/>
            ciples.</p>
          <p>This exemplified, in the most eminent degree, in the philosophy <lb/>
            of Parmenides.</p>
          <p>But, after all, what was the real difficulty that obviously presented <lb/>
            itself to the mind of these speculators P</p>
          <p>How, for example, did Anaxagoras endeavour to get over this <lb/>
            difficulty P</p>
          <p>Does Aristotle consider Anaxagoras as the discoverer of the <lb/>
            " efficient cause" P</p>
          <p>The efficient cause, put forward by the early Philosophers, uncon­ <lb/>
            sciously to themselves, really involved the solution of two sets of <lb/>
            phenomena.</p>
          <p>Do Cicero and Aristotle agree in their view of the Anaxagorean <lb/>
            Philosophy ?</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CHAPTER IV.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>How comes Aristotle to mention the system of Hesiod P</p>
          <p>The same difficulty presented itself in the way of Hesiod, as of <lb/>
            the rest of the early speculators.</p>
          <p>Now, Aristotle states, that if you really compare the system of <pb n="417"/>
            <note type="margin"> CH. V.] </note> <lb/>
            Empedocles with the actual phenomena, this same difficulty will pre­ <lb/>
            sent itself here also.</p>
          <p>Even granting, however, that the efficient cause was recognised <lb/>
            by Empedocles, show that his treatment of it is incomplete.</p>
          <p>What other Philosophers does Aristotle mention in this chapter ?</p>
          <p>Does not the same objection lie against these, likewise, as those <lb/>
            already mentioned ?</p>
          <p>Aristotle gives us a sketch of part of the Democritic Philosophy.</p>
          <p>Cicero, for example, amongst others, notices a fundamental pnn­ <lb/>
            ciple in the philosophy of Democritus, quite overlooked by Aristotle.</p>
          <p>Who is the best exponent in modern times of the Democritic <lb/>
            Philosophy?</p>
          <p>Do all philosophers agree with Aristotle and Cicero in the ascrip­ <lb/>
            tion of the Atomic hypothesis to Leucippus and Democritus P</p>

          <p>How does Aristotle account for the rise of such a School as that <lb/>
            of the Pythagoreans P</p>
          <p>Could you state the grounds upon which the Pythagoreans them­ <lb/>
            selves rested their theory of Numbers?</p>
          <p>What was the precise object which the Pythagoric Philosophers <lb/>
            had in view in their introduction of a Co-ordinate Series—<foreign xml:lang="grc">συστοιχία</foreign> ?</p>
          <p>What are probably the best sources for obtaining information upon <lb/>
            the Philosophy of Pythagoras ?</p>
          <p>What Philosopher does Aristotle mention as adopting a system <lb/>
            similar to that of the Pythagoreans ?</p>
          <p>In what respect does Aristotle consider Pythagoras as contributing <lb/>
            most to Metaphysical Science ?</p>
          <p>Is there no other Philosopher that can contend with Pythagoras <lb/>
            for the credit of inventing the Philosophy of the Italic Schools ?</p>
          <p>Was Parmenides really the originator of the Philosophy of Unity <lb/>
            -the TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕν</foreign> ?</p>
          <p>Could you state the difference between the systems of Parmenides <lb/>
            and Melissus ?</p>
          <p>In the enunciation of his theories, Parmenides was more circum­ <lb/>
            spect than others of his school.</p>
          <p>At the end of this chapter Aristotle furnishes his readers with the <lb/>
            conclusion suggested by the review of thus much of the Greek <lb/>
            Philosophy.</p>
          <p>Even in the Pythagorean treatment of the TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί ἐστι</foreign>, there was <lb/>
            imperfection inherent. How so P</p>

          <p>To what extent are we to admit the influence of the Socratic on <lb/>

          <p>According to Mr. Maurice, in his Analysis of the Metaphysics, <lb/>
            Aristotle is ungenerous towards the fame of Socrates on this very <lb/>
            point.</p>
          <p>In some respects the difference between the systems of Plato and <lb/>
            Pythagoras was merely nominal.</p>

          <p>Mr. Maurice, in his Analysis, explains this difficulty most lucidly.</p>

          <p>Aristotle notices some false opinions of the Megaric School on <lb/>

          <p>WHAT is Aristotle's object in Chapter IV. P</p>
          <p>A subject is treated of in Chapter V. that already has been under <lb/>
            discussion.</p>
          <p>What tenet of Protagoras' is brought under notice in Chapter VI.? <lb/>

          <p>Show the inconsistency of a follower of Heraclitus putting forward <lb/>
            any system as true.</p>
          <p>One class of Sceptics, according to Aristotle, are more easily refuted <lb/>
            than others.</p>
          <p>Aristotle here also furnishes us with a practical refutation of <lb/>
            Scepticism.</p>
          <p>Point out the particular position assumed by the system of <lb/>
            Heraclitus compared with that of Anaxagoras.</p>
          <p>In classing Theology as one of the speculative sciences, Aristotle <lb/>
            has furnished his opponents with an argument in favour of his Atheism.</p>
          <p>How does Aristotle define chance ?</p>
          <p>The nature and cause of the Accident exclude the possibility of <lb/>

          <p>God's existence is a necessary existence.</p>
