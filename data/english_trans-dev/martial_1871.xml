          </head>
          <p>IT is a singular fact that Martial is the only Latin poet of <lb/>
            mark who has not hitherto been completely translated into <lb/>
            the English language. If not so interesting as Poets of the <lb/>
            Augustan Age for his latinity, he is more so for his pictures <lb/>
            of the manners and customs of Rome at that very interesting <lb/>
            period the commencement of the Christian era. It must be <lb/>
            premised that his constant and severe castigation of the two <lb/>
            great vices which prevailed in his time, and the unflinching <lb/>
            boldness with which he proclaims them, has given him the <lb/>
            reputation of an obscene poet; but his lashings were well di­ <lb/>
            rected, and, no doubt, had a beneficial effect. Horace, Virgil, <lb/>
            Juvenal, Catullus, and several other of the great poets of <lb/>
            antiquity, have indulged in similar freedoms, although not <lb/>
            to the same extent, and the character of the age permitted <lb/>
            and almost seemed to demand them. In our own modern <lb/>
            times, that is, in the brilliant literary epoch which includes <lb/>
            Shakespeare, Beaumont and Fletcher, Swift, Prior, Fielding, <lb/>
            Pope, and Byron, we have a similar tendency, but he must <lb/>
            be very squeamish who would entirely banish these valuable <lb/>
            authors on account of it. I am not, however, intending to <lb/>
            enter the lists in defence of Martial, and have merely said <lb/>
            thus much in excuse for giving him a place in the present <lb/>
            Library, which, sooner or later, is intended to include all the <lb/>
            leading Greek and Roman classics.</p>
          <p>Elphinston, in his preface, ventures to assert that Martial <lb/>
            laboured in the detection of error, the vindication of inno­ <lb/>
            cence, the diffusion of knowledge, and the display of truth; <lb/>
             <pb n="IV"/>
            and that he communicates more life, and more literature, <lb/>
            more wisdom, and more wit, than any other of the ancient <lb/>
            poets, or perhaps than all of them put together. This is <lb/>
            stronger language in his favour than other writers have <lb/>
            used, and perhaps more than is borne out by the evidence, <lb/>
            but the reader will judge for himself.</p>
          <p>The plan of the present edition has been to give every <lb/>
            Epigram hitherto ascribed to Martial, in English prose, <lb/>
            accompanied, as far as they could be found, by metrical ver­ <lb/>
            sions. In those instances where an English translation <lb/>
            given faithfully would be too gross for our present notions <lb/>
            of propriety, the Latin has been retained, accompanied by <lb/>
            the Italian version of Graglia, who has been rather dextrous <lb/>
            in refining impurities. He was an Italian teacher in Lon­ <lb/>
            don, where his book was printed in 1782 and 1791, and it <lb/>
            then had, and still has, a very general and unrestricted sale. <lb/>
            There have been seven complete French versions of Martial,1 <lb/>
            some very recent, and it would have been equally, if not <lb/>
            more convenient to select from these, but that none of them <lb/>
            have used the least refinement, indeed, have sometimes <lb/>
            rather exceeded their author in his worst properties.</p>
          <p>It now remains to speak of the present translation. This <lb/>
            was first undertaken, and to some extent performed, by a <lb/>
            Cam bridge graduate of accredited powers, but proved too <lb/>
            syntactically literal for perspicuity; it then passed into the <lb/>
            hands of a literary veteran of the sister University, and has <lb/>
            finally been read through the press with great diligence by <lb/>
            my eldest son and myself. No book in my Classical Library <lb/>
            has been found so difficult, or has had such a thorough comb- <note type="footnote"> I Trad. en prose par Michel de Marolles, Paris, 1655. En vers par M. <lb/>

            mg, and if any imperfections still remain, I am willing, as the <lb/>
            last reader, to be responsible for them. The book will at least <lb/>
            be found to possess one singular advantage, which is in re­ <lb/>
            spect to the metrical versions. Having for more than ten <lb/>
            years past intended to give Martial to the English reader on <lb/>
            the present plan, I collected every poetical scrap likely to <lb/>
            forward my object, and, besides several rare volumes, for­ <lb/>
            tunately fell in with a very interesting MS. of the age of <lb/>
            Elizabeth, which versifies with considerable ability a great <lb/>
            proportion of the Epigrams. The only metrical versions in­ <lb/>
            troduced, which may be deemed unworthy of a place in the <lb/>
            volume, are those of Elphinston, which, it must be confessed, <lb/>
            are very indifferent, to say no worse of them. But he has <lb/>
            always stood to the public as the accepted English versifier <lb/>
            of Martial, and his pompous Quarto, dignified by a long <lb/>
            array of subscribers' names, still occupies a prominent place <lb/>
            in many libraries; we may therefore stand excused for using <lb/>
            him in places where no better could be found.</p>
          <p>This volume has been at press for nearly three years, and <lb/>
            a large proportion of it was printed when we were unexpect­ <lb/>
            edly greeted by Mr. Amos with his " Martial and the <lb/>
            Moderns." His plan is much the same as our own, excepting <lb/>
            that he generally adds a commentary; but he confines him­ <lb/>
            self to a selection of about 260 Epigrams (out of more than <lb/>
            1500), and his metrical adjuncts are comparatively few. <lb/>
            Instead, therefore, of entertaining any jealousy of the book, <lb/>
            we rather welcome its appearance as an indication of the <lb/>
            interest English scholars are again taking in a poet so long <lb/>
            left in repose.</p>

            <title type="main">INTRODUCTION.</title>
          </head>
          <p>THE literature of imperial Rome has powerfully influenced the <lb/>
            civilization of the Western world; and, amid the vast changes of <lb/>
            our social system, still continues to maintain its high place in the <lb/>
            republic of letters. This is due partly to the grandeur of the <lb/>
            people by whom the language was spoken, but more so to the <lb/>
            illustrious writers who wedded it to intellectual creations that <lb/>
            must ever be models for study and admiration.</p>
          <p>Among these writers, Martial stands as the first Epigrammatist, <lb/>
            not only of his own, but of every succeeding age. The bent of his <lb/>
            genius seems to have lain entirely in this direction. Everything <lb/>
            he penned, whether begging a favour, satirizing a fault, writing an <lb/>
            inscription, or paying a compliment, was an epigram.</p>
          <p>The word epigram originally signified, as its etymology implies, <lb/>
            nothing more than an inscription. But in the development which <lb/>
            it received in the progress of literature, and especially at the hands <lb/>
            of Martial, it assumed an entirely new character, and may be de­ <lb/>
            fined as the concentration of satire and pointed invective in a short <lb/>
            poem. One idea is selected, and to this all the powers of the <lb/>
            poet's mind are directed, and made to converge as to a point.</p>
          <p>To the gracefulness of the Greek epigram the Romans super- <lb/>
            added shrewdness and an acute observation of human nature: the <lb/>
            shafts of Martial are pointed by the same sarcastic feeling which <lb/>
            inspired the Epodes of Horace, and the Satires of Juvenal.</p>
          <p>In the essentials of brevity and smartness our author seldom or <lb/>
            never failed. Some of his epigrams are, it is true, very obscure to <lb/>
            us now, owing to our imperfect acquaintance with the subject of <lb/>
            his satire. And in such a mass it is to be expected that many <lb/>
            would be of indifferent merit. Of this the poet himself was well <lb/>
            aware, as we learn from his own words, Book i. Ep. 16: <lb/>
            Sunt bona, sunt quædam mediocria, sunt mala plura <lb/>
            Quæ legis hie : aliter non fit, Avite, liber.</p>
          <p>Of the epigrams which you read here, some are good, some middling, <lb/>
            many bad: a book, Avitus, cannot be made in any other way.</p><pb n="VII"/>
            
          <p>But the greater part are unquestionably full of profound wit and <lb/>
            humour, and it is only to be regretted that they should be asso­ <lb/>
            ciated with so many that must be intolerable to any but an impure <lb/>
            taste.</p>
          <p>The age of Martial, which just preceded the decline of Ro­ <lb/>
            man literature, allowed full scope for epigrammatic satire. The <lb/>
            city of Rome appears, as we learn from Juvenal, and other con­ <lb/>
            temporary writers, to have presented one universal scene of villany. <lb/>
            The despotism of the Emperors, the luxury of the patricians, the <lb/>
            dissipation of the citizens, and the corruption of public men, had <lb/>
            then arrived at a climax. Every feature of depravity started from <lb/>
            the canvass. The laws of nature were everywhere violated, and <lb/>
            iniquity itself acquired a kind of legal acknowledgment. <lb/>
            " In every street were found <lb/>
            Voluptuous Sybarites with roses crown* d; <lb/>
            The rank Miletan and the Tarentine, <lb/>
            Lewd, petulant, and reeling ripe with wino."</p>
          <p>The biography of MARCUS VALERIUS MARTIALIS is involved <lb/>
            in some obscurity; and the little we know of him is chiefly derived <lb/>
            from his own writings. With the exception of Ælius Verus, who <lb/>
            designated him as " his Virgil," and the younger Pliny, he does <lb/>
            not appear to have been especially noticed by any contemporary <lb/>
            writers. Pliny describes him as a man of acute and lively genius, <lb/>
            whose writings abound with an agreeable spirit of wit and satire, <lb/>
            conducted at the same time with great candour and good nature. <lb/>
            He also informs us that when Martial left Rome, he made him <lb/>
            a present to defray the expenses of his journey, "not only as <lb/>
            a testimony of his friendship, but in return for the verses with <lb/>
            which he had complimented him."</p>
          <p>From the above, and occasional allusions made by Spartianus, <lb/>
            Lampridius, and the grammarians of the later period, we are <lb/>
            enabled to glean so much of Martial's personal history, as <lb/>
            that he was born at Bilbilis, in Spain, on the 1st of March, in <lb/>
            the third year of Claudius, A. D. 43. This Bilbilis (the modern <lb/>
            Bubiera) was a town of ancient Celtiberia, now known as Arragon, <lb/>
            and situated on the river Salo, or Halo, which falls into the Ebro, <lb/>
            above Saragossa. The name of our poet's father (as we learn from <lb/>
            the 34th Epigram of his 5th Book) was Pronto, and of his mother <lb/>
            Flaccilla.1 At the age of twenty-one or twenty-two he came to <note type="footnote"> 1 Prof. Ramsay (Smith's Diet., art. Martial) treats this as a misconcep­ <lb/>
            tion. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="VIII"/>
            Rome, in the reign of Nero, A. D. 66; and there he continued to <lb/>
            reside during a period of thirty-five years, under the Emperors <lb/>
            Galba, Otho, Vitellius, Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian. His first <lb/>
            intention was to qualify himself for the bar: but on discovering that <lb/>
            he had no genius or inclination for this profession, he applied <lb/>
            himself to the study of literature and poesy. In this pursuit he <lb/>
            happily succeeded, and acquired an elegant and versatile style of <lb/>
            writing, which introduced him to Silius Italicus, Juvenal, Pliny, <lb/>
            and many of the first wits of the age. It appears that a noble­ <lb/>
            man, named Stertinius, conceived so great an esteem for Martial's <lb/>
            compositions, that he placed a statue of him, while living, in his <lb/>
            library—at that time an unusual honour.</p>
          <p>Domitian, the last of the twelve Cæsars, whose name has ob­ <lb/>
            tained an infamous notoriety in the annals of imperial Rome, con­ <lb/>
            ferred many especial favours on Martial, which may be attributed <lb/>
            to the adulations bestowed upon him by the poet. Among <lb/>
            other honours Martial was advanced to the tribunate and eques­ <lb/>
            trian dignity, and, at the same time, invested with the jus trium <lb/>
            liberorum, which conferred on him all the important privileges <lb/>
            of a citizen who had three children. The poet's humiliating pe­ <lb/>
            tition for this honour is recorded in Epigram 91 of Book ii.</p>
          <p>Martial's continued flattery of the brutal despot of Rome is <lb/>
            a drawback on his fame. His praises of the imperial monster <lb/>
            were boundless and unqualified. Thus in one of his epigrams <lb/>
            he invokes Jupiter not to confer favours on himself, but upon <lb/>
            the representative of the gods (Cæsar), who, in his munificence, <lb/>
            was certain to transfer them to his favoured bard. And sure <lb/>
            enough Domitian rewarded the poet not only with wealth, but <lb/>
            with the highest honours; and this at the very time, as Juvenal, <lb/>
            the friend of Martial, expresses it, when the tyrant <lb/>
            " daily drain'd, by none withstood, <lb/>
            The city of its best and noblest blood."</p>
          <p>On the assassination of Domitian, to whom the senate refused <lb/>
            funereal honours, the true character of Martial developed itself. <lb/>
            After having portrayed the emperor, while living, as the pattern <lb/>
            of every virtue, he undertook, after death, to expose his fiendlike <lb/>
            abominations, and represented him as <lb/>
            " the monster of the times, <lb/>
            Without one virtue to redeem his crimes."</p>
          <p>Martial afterwards attempted to pay his court to Trajan; but <lb/>
            that virtuous monarch turned a deaf ear to him. Being forsaken <lb/>
             <pb n="IX"/>
            by his friends, he directed his thoughts towards his native country, <lb/>
            which he was enabled to revisit through the liberality of his friend <lb/>
            Pliny; for it appears, according to his own showing, that he was <lb/>
            then reduced to great distress. See Ep. 13, Book v <lb/>
            " Sum, fateor, semperque fui—pauper."</p>
          <p>He there succeeded in gaining the affections of a woman of <lb/>
            fortune, named Marcella, whom he eventually married. He speaks <lb/>
            very highly of this lady, who, it appears, was in possession of <lb/>
            a magnificent house and gardens, which she settled upon her <lb/>
            husband. After his marriage he completed his 12th Book of <lb/>
            Epigrams, at the desire of his friend Priscus, a man of consular <lb/>
            dignity, to whom the book is inscribed as his patron. The other <lb/>
            two books, which constitute the 13th and 14th of the series, are <lb/>
            entitled "Xenia" and " Apophoreta," and so called from their <lb/>
            containing mottoes or devices to be affixed to presents offered to <lb/>
            friends, or distributed at the Saturnalia and other festivals. These <lb/>
            fourteen books are preceded by " Spectacula," which are a series <lb/>
            of epigrams on the shows exhibited by Titus and Domitian; <lb/>
            though, as it appears, not all written by Martial himself.</p>
          <p>Martial lived in comparative affluence and ease to. an advanced <lb/>
            period of life; and died about the 75th year of his age, the 104th <lb/>
            of the Christian era.</p>
          <p>Many difficulties exist in the chronology of Martial's Epi­ <lb/>
            grams; but the researches of Lloyd, Dodwell, and Clinton have <lb/>
            done much towards their satisfactory elucidation. It appears that <lb/>
            the different books were collected and published by Martial, <lb/>
            sometimes singly, and at other times several together. Their <lb/>
            chronology and order of publication are thus stated in Dr. <lb/>
            Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography:</p>
          <p>"The 'Liber de Spectaculis,' and the first nine books of the re­ <lb/>
            gular series, involve a great number of historical allusions, ex­ <lb/>
            tending from the games of Titus, A. D. 80, to the return of Do­ <lb/>
            mitian from the Sarmatian expedition, in January, A. D. 94. The <lb/>
            second book could not have been written until after the commence­ <lb/>
            ment of the Dacian war (ii. 2), that is, not before A. D. 86, nor the <lb/>
            sixth until after the triumph over the Dacians and Germans (A. D. <lb/>
            91) ; the seventh was written while the Sarmatian war, which be­ <lb/>
            gan in A. D. 93, was still in progress, and reaches to the end of <lb/>
            that year. The eighth book opens in January, A. D. 94; the ninth <lb/>
            also refers to the same epoch, but may, as Clinton supposes, have <lb/>
             <pb n="X"/>
            been written in A. D. 95. The whole of these were composed at <lb/>
            Rome, except the third, which was written during a tour in Gallia <lb/>
            Togata. The tenth book was published twice: the first edition was <lb/>
            given hastily to the world; the second edition, that which we now <lb/>
            read (x. 2), celebrates the arrival of Trajan at Rome, after his ac­ <lb/>
            cession to the throne (x. 6, 7, 34, 72). Now since this event took <lb/>
            place A. D. 99, and since the twenty-fourth epigram of this book <lb/>
            was written in honour of the author's fifty-seventh birth-day, we <lb/>
            are thus supplied with the data requisite for fixing the epoch of <lb/>
            his birth; and since at the close of the book (x. 104) he had been <lb/>
            thirty-four years at Rome, we can thence calculate the time when <lb/>
            he left Spain. The eleventh book seems to have been published <lb/>
            at Rome early in A. D. 1*00, and at the close of the year he re­ <lb/>
            turned to Bilbilis. After keeping silence for three years (xii. pro­ <lb/>
            em.), the twelfth book was despatched from Bilbilis to Rome (xii. <lb/>
            3, 18), and in this he refers (xii. 5) to the two preceding books, <lb/>
            published, as we have seen, in A. D. 99 and 100."</p>
          <p>Martial, though he often offends by gross indelicacies of expres­ <lb/>
            sion, or pruriency of thought, stands preëminent, not only as an <lb/>
            epigrammatist, but as one of the purest Latin writers of his <lb/>
            age; and his style and manner have been generally copied by <lb/>
            the wits of all succeeding periods. Yet there are few authors <lb/>
            who have been more exposed to criticism. Some have bestowed <lb/>
            upon him the most unqualified praise, while others have treated <lb/>
            'him with the grossest scurrility. The learned Scaliger declares <lb/>
            that many of his epigrams " are divine, and his style pure and ex­ <lb/>
            act," and Morhofius, in his "Polyhistor," speaks of his elegant <lb/>
            knowledge of the Latin tongue." Vossius, on the contrary, con­ <lb/>
            tends that Martial was one of those authors who taught vice while <lb/>
            reproving it; and that, though he deserves commendation for <lb/>
            many of his epigrams, yet by those which are obscene he did more <lb/>
            harm than by others he had done good.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding the conflicting opinions of his numerous critics, <lb/>
            it is perhaps not too much to say, that the writings of Martial <lb/>
            will be read and admired so long as the Latin language shall <lb/>
            continue to be understood. They are pervaded by a vein of wit <lb/>
            and fund of information concerning the manners and customs of <lb/>
            the important age in which he lived, that will always render him <lb/>
            valuable and interesting both to the archeologist and the student <lb/>
            of human nature.</p><pb n="-"/>

          <p>While Verus and Priscus were prolonging the combat, <lb/>
            and the valour of each had been for a long time equal, <lb/>
            quarter for the combatants was demanded with great clam­ <lb/>
            our. But Cæsar obeyed his own law. The law was to fight <lb/>
            with a stated reward in view, till by his thumb one of the <lb/>
            pair proclaimed himself vanquished :1 but, as was allowed, he <lb/>
            frequently gave them dishes and gifts.2 An end, however, <lb/>
            was found for the well-matched contest: equal they fought, <lb/>
            equal they resigned. Caesar sent wands to each,3 to each the <lb/>
            meed of victory. Such was the reward that adroit valour <lb/>
            received. Under no other prince save thee, Cæsar, has this <lb/>
            ever happened, that, when two fought with each other, both <lb/>
            were victors.</p>
          <p>When Priscus, Verus, did prolong their fight, <lb/>
            Characterized by Mars with equal spite, <lb/>
            For their discharge a joint consent applied <lb/>
            Itself to Cæsar; by whom 't was denied. <lb/>
            It was the fashion so long to contend <lb/>
            Till the vanquish'd made signs the fight should end: <lb/>
            And to detain the people to the last, <lb/>
            Gifts were provided, and a slight repast. <lb/>
            Even wounds the sword-players did engrave ; <lb/>
            They fought alike ; or equal scores did leave. <lb/>
            Cæsaracquitted both, gave both the palm : <lb/>
            Thus prowess for her cure acquired a balm. <note type="footnote"> I Ad digitum concurrere. There has been much doubt about the <lb/>

          <p>I TRUST that, in these little books of mine, I have observed <lb/>
            such self-control, that whoever forms a fair judgment from <lb/>
            his own mind can make no complaint of them, since they <lb/>
            indulge their sportive fancies without violating the respect <lb/>
            due even to persons of the humblest station; a respect which <lb/>
            was so far disregarded by the authors of antiquity, that they <lb/>
            made free use, not only of real, but of great names. For <lb/>
            me, let fame be held in less estimation, and let such talent be <lb/>
            the last thing commended in me.</p>
          <p>Let the ill-natured interpreter, too, keep himself from <lb/>
            meddling with the simple meaning of my jests, and not write <lb/>
            my epigrams for me.1 He acts dishonourably who exercises per­ <lb/>
            verse ingenuity on another man's book. For the free plain­ <lb/>
            ness of expression, that is, for the language of epigram, I <lb/>
            would apologize, if I were introducing the practice ; but it is <lb/>
            thus that Catullus writes, and Marsus, and Pedo, and Getu­ <lb/>
            licus, and every one whose writings are read through. If <lb/>
            any assumes to be so scrupulously nice, however, that it is not <lb/>
            allowable to address him, in a single page, in plain language, <lb/>
            he may confine himself to this address, or rather to the title <lb/>
            of the book. Epigrams are written for those who are accus­ <lb/>
            tomed to be spectators at the games of Flora. Let not Cato <lb/>
            enter my theatre; or, if he do enter, let him look on. It <lb/>
            appears to me that I shall do only what I have a right to do, <lb/>
            if I close my address with the following verses:- <note type="footnote"> 1 Let him not make them his own, by the false interpretation which he <lb/>

          <p>If I remember right, .Elia, you had four teeth; a cough <lb/>

          <p>Ælia just four teeth had, if I told right; <lb/>

          <p>When the hand that aimed at the king mistook for him <lb/>
            his secretary, it thrust itself to perish into the sacred fire; <lb/>
            but the generous foe could not endure so cruel a sight, and <lb/>
            bade the hero, snatched from the flame, to be set free. <lb/>
            The hand which, despising the fire, Mucius dared to burn, <lb/>
            Porsena could not bear to look on. Greater was the fame <lb/>

            The pangs that fearless Scævola sustain'd, <lb/>

            and sacred Vadavero -with its broken cliffs, and the sweet <lb/>

            Thou wilt breast the gently-flowing water of the warm Con­ <lb/>

            relaxed by these, thou mayst brace up in the little Salo, <lb/>
            which hardens iron. There Voberca2 herself will supply for <lb/>

            The serene summer heat thou wilt disarm by bathing in <lb/>

            greedy thirst the fresh Dercenna will appease, and Nutha, <lb/>

            And very much a slave, and very proud: <lb/>
            Thus he perhaps powerful and rich may grow; <lb/>
            No matter, 0 ye gods! that I '11 allow; <lb/>

            Or crowd of clients at his gate, <lb/>
            That might, in his own fields and wood, <lb/>

            The bees for him their honey hoard; <lb/>
            A nut-brown lass, both kind and neat, <lb/>
            To make his bed, and dress his meat. <lb/>
            He that hates me, or likes not this, <lb/>
            May he ne'er taste so sweet a bliss, <lb/>

            ray-adorned mass of the Colossus detain you, a work which <lb/>
            is proud of surpassing that of Rhodes. But turn aside <lb/>
            by the way where the temple of the wine-bibbing Bacchus <lb/>
            rises, and where the couch of Cybele stands adorned with <lb/>
            pictures of the Corybantes. Immediately on the left is the <lb/>
            dwelling with its splendid façade, and the balls of the lofty <lb/>
            mansion which you are to approach. Enter it; and fear not <lb/>
            its haughty looks or proud gate; no entrance affords more <lb/>
            ready access; nor is there any house more inviting for Phœbus <lb/>
            and the learned sisters to love. If Proculus shall say, " But <lb/>

            Near hoary Vesta's fane and virgin-dome. <lb/>
            Thence by the awful hill ascends thy tour: <lb/>

            Nor thee too long the famed Coloss beguile, <lb/>

            Hence seek the soaking father of the feast, <lb/>

            Nay, I'm so happy, most men think, <lb/>

            That they are apt to envy me, <lb/>

            For when old Hunks I chance to meet, <lb/>
            Or one or both must quit the street. <lb/>

            my verses, so useful to his master, and so well known to the <lb/>
            Cæsars, has yielded up his brief life in its early prime. A <lb/>
            fourth harvest had been added to his years, which previously <lb/>
            numbered fifteen. That he might not, however, descend to <lb/>
            the Stygian shades as a slave, I, when the accursed disease <lb/>
            had seized and was withering him, took precaution, and re­ <lb/>

            That not to Styx a slave he should descend, <lb/>

            happily! The complaisant deities smiled and granted <lb/>
            your wish. Since that time your toga has become much <lb/>
            more dirty, your cloak worse; your shoe has been sewn up <lb/>
            three and four times; of ten olives the greater portion is <lb/>
            always put by, and one spread of the table serves for two <lb/>
            meals; the thick dregs of pink Vejentan wine are your <lb/>
            drink ; a plate of lukewarm peas costs you a penny ; your <lb/>

            the tribunal of the gods; and either live, Scævola, as befits <lb/>

            holding their teeth as with fear, for they are ashamed to crush <lb/>

          <p>Issa is more playful than the sparrow of Catullus. Issa <note type="footnote"> 1 The tenth hour from sunrise, corresponding to our four o'clock in <lb/>
            the afternoon. See B. iv. Ep. 8. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="80"/>
            is more pure than the kiss of a dove. Issa is more loving <lb/>
            than any maiden. Issa is dearer than Indian gems. The <lb/>
            little dog Issa is the pet of Publius. If she complains, you <lb/>
            will think she speaks. She feels both the sorrow and the <lb/>
            gladness of her master. She lies reclined upon his neck, and <lb/>
            sleeps, so that not a respiration is heard from her. And, <lb/>
            however pressed, she has never sullied the coverlet with a <lb/>
            single spot; but rouses her master with a gentle touch of <lb/>
            her foot, and begs to be set down from the bed and relieved. <lb/>
            Such modesty resides in this chaste little animal; she <lb/>
            knows not the pleasures of love; nor do we find a mate <lb/>
            worthy of so tender a damsel. That her last hour may not <lb/>
            carry her off wholly, Publius has her limned in a picture, <lb/>
            in which you will see an Issa so like, that not even herself is <lb/>
            so like herself. In a word, place Issa and the picture side <lb/>
            by side, and you will imagine either both real, or both painted.</p>
          <p>Issa 's more full of sport and wanton play <lb/>
            Than that pet sparrow by Catullus sung; <lb/>
            Issa 's more pure and cleanly in her way <lb/>
            Than kisses from the amorous turtle's tongue. <lb/>
            Issa more winsome is than any girl <lb/>
            That ever yet entranced a lover's sight; <lb/>
            Issa's more precious than the Indian pearl; <lb/>
            Issa's my Publius' favourite and delight. <lb/>
            Her plaintive voice falls sad as one that weeps; <lb/>
            Her master's cares and woes alike she shares ; <lb/>
            Softly reclined upon his neck she sleeps, <lb/>
            And scarce to sigh or draw her breath she dares. <lb/>
            When nature calls, she modestly obeys, <lb/>
            Nor on the counterpane one drop will shed ; <lb/>
            But warns her lord with gentle foot, and prays <lb/>
            That he will raise and lift her from the bed. <lb/>
            So chaste is she, of contact so afraid, <lb/>
            She knows not Venus' rites, nor do we find <lb/>
            A husband worthy of such dainty maid <lb/>
            'Mong all the clamorous suitors of her kind. <lb/>
            Her, lest the day of fate should nothing leave, <lb/>
            In pictured form my Publius hath portray'dj <lb/>
            Where you so lifelike Issa might perceive, <lb/>
            That not herself a better likeness made. <lb/>
            Issa together with her portrait lay, <lb/>

            his own name should rather have been read there. It had <lb/>

          <p>" WHAT do I want," say you, " with a letter ? Do I not <lb/>
            snow you sufficient indulgence by reading your epigrams ? <lb/>
            Besides, what have you to say in this letter, which you could <lb/>
            not say in your verses ? I see why tragic and comic writers <lb/>
            admit a prologue,-because they are not allowed to speak for <lb/>
            themselves. But epigrams have no need of a herald, and are <lb/>
            contented with their own liberty of speech. In whatever <lb/>
            page they please, they present an epistle. Do not, therefore, I <lb/>
            pray, do a ridiculous thing, and clap a long dress on a person <lb/>
            going to dance.1 Consider, too, whether you would choose <lb/>
            a wand as a weapon against a retiarius.2 For myself, I take <lb/>
            my seat amongst those who at once object to a contest so un­ <lb/>
            equal." Indeed, Decianus, methinks you say what is just. Is <lb/>
            it possible that you knew with what sort of an epistle, and <lb/>
            how long a one, you were in danger of being occupied ? Be <lb/>
            it, then, as you desire. Whatever readers light upon this <lb/>

            and-thirst fever. He is now craftily spreading nets for fat <lb/>

            wants strained Cæcuban wine, and wine ripened in the year <lb/>

          <p>" Laugh if thou art wise, girl, laugh," said, I believe, the <lb/>
            poet of the Peligni.3 But he did not say this to all girls. <note type="footnote"> 1 The stola was the dress of the Roman matron. Courtesans and adul­ <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="BOOK II.]"/> <lb/>
            Granting, however, that he did say it to all girls, he did <lb/>
            not say it to you: you are not a girl, Maximina, and you <lb/>
            have but three teeth, and those plainly the colour of pitch <lb/>
            and of boxwood. If, therefore, you believe your mirror and <lb/>
            me, you should shrink from laughing as much as Spanius <lb/>
            dreads the wind, Priscus a touchy Fabulla, with chalked face, <lb/>
            a rain-cloud, or Sabella, painted with white-lead, the sun. <lb/>
            Put on a countenance more severe than the consort of Priam, <lb/>
            and his eldest daughter-in-law. Avoid the pantomimes of <lb/>
            the amusing Philistion, and gay feasts, and whatever by its <lb/>
            wit and mirth distends the lips with broad laughter. It <lb/>
            befits you to sit by the side of an afflicted mother, of a wife <lb/>
            lamenting for her husband, or a sister for her affectionate <lb/>
            brother, and to seek your recreation only with the tragic <lb/>

          <p>" Laugh, my girle, laugh, if you bee wise;" <lb/>

            Your hours in what is sad and serious spend, <lb/>
            An ear to tragic stories only lend. <lb/>
            The counsel's good, if to it you can keep, <lb/>

            If thou the goodness of thy clothes do'st prize <lb/>

            On us, poor independent folks. <lb/>
            But would you then indeed be free ? <lb/>
            Come, I 'll prescribe-without a fee. <lb/>
            First, then, 't is plain you love to eat, <lb/>
            And haunt the tables of the great: <note type="footnote"> 1 Dasius was the proprietor or superintendent of baths for females. <lb/>

            Indeed, my friend, this must not be; <lb/>
            A parasite can ne'er be free. <lb/>
            Next, Doctor, you must drink no wine.- <lb/>
            Ch. Why so ? Saint Paul, that great divine, <lb/>
            Says, " Drink a little."—F. That's not the question; <lb/>
            You can't afford it—Ch. But for digestion- <lb/>
            F. A glass of cider, or old mead, <lb/>
            Or e'en mild ale, will do the deed. <lb/>
            Then, you 're a captain in your dress ; <lb/>

            Talk what you please, you 'll ne'er be free, <lb/>
            If you despise economy. <lb/>
            Perhaps, too, you may think a wife <lb/>
            Amongst the requisites of life: <lb/>
            Why, take some healthy farmer's daughter, <lb/>
            Some Blousalind—nay, spare your laughter: <lb/>

            Oh! Doctor, could you but despise <lb/>

            Discard all powder from your hair: <lb/>
            Walk undistinguished 'mid the group, <lb/>
            Nor scorn a door that makes you stoop. <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Would'st thou be free ? I fear thou art in jest <lb/>
            But if thou would'st, this is the only law; <lb/>
            Be no man's tavern nor domestic guest: <lb/>
            Drink wholesome wine which thy own servants draw.</p>
          <p>Of knavish Cario scorn the ill-got plate, <lb/>
            The numerous servants and the cringing throng : <lb/>
            With a few friends on fewer dishes eat, <lb/>
            And let thy clothes, like mine, be plain and strong.</p>
          <p>Such friendships make as thou may'st keep with ease; <lb/>
            Great men expect what good men hate to pay; <lb/>
            Be never thou thyself in pain to please, <lb/>
            But leave to fools and knaves th' uncertain prey.</p>
          <p>Let thy expense with thy estate keep pace ; <lb/>

            Contented pay for a plebeian face, <lb/>
            And leave vain fops the beauties of the town.</p>

          <p>XC. TO QUINTILIAN.</p>
          <p>Quintilian, supreme ruler over our unsteady youth,- <lb/>
            Quintilian, glory of the Roman toga, do not blame me, that <lb/>
            I, though poor yet not useless to my generation, hasten to <lb/>
            enjoy life: no one hastens enough to do so. Let him de­ <lb/>
            lay doing so, who desires to have a greater estate than his <lb/>
            father, and who crowds his lofty halls with countless busts. <lb/>
            A quiet hearth delights me, and a house which disdains not <lb/>
            the blackness of smoker a running spring, and a natural <lb/>
            piece of turf. May these be mine; a well-fed attendant, a <lb/>
            wife not over-learned, nights with sleep, days without strife.</p>
          <p>Quintilian, thou glory of the gowne, <lb/>
            And for instructing youth of high renowne, <lb/>
            If, poore, my life to mee content can give, <lb/>
            Allow me : none t' himselfe too much can live. <lb/>
            Lett who will strive their fathers' wealth t' enlarge, <lb/>
            And with vast statues their huge porches charge ; <lb/>
            Give mee good fires, though in a smoaky hall, <lb/>
            Unforced springs, and grass-plotts naturall ; <lb/>
            With full fedd clownes, and not too learned a wife, <lb/>
            Spending my nights in sleepe, dayes without strife. <lb/>
            Old MS. 16th Cent.</p>
          <p>Wonder not, sir (you who instruct the town <lb/>
            In the true wisdom of the sacred gown), <lb/>
            That I make haste to live, and cannot hold <lb/>
            Patiently out, till I grow rich and old. <lb/>
            Life for delays and doubts no time does give; <lb/>
            None ever yet made haste enough to live. <lb/>
            Let him defer it, whose preposterous care <lb/>
            Omits himself, and reaches to his heir. <lb/>
            Who does his father's bounded stores despise, <lb/>
            And whom his own, too, never can suffice. <lb/>
            My humble thoughts no glittering roofs require, <lb/>
            Or rooms that shine with aught but constant fire. <lb/>
            I will content the avarice of my sight <lb/>
            With the fair gildings of reflected light: <lb/>
            Pleasures abroad the sport of nature yields, <lb/>
            Her living fountains, and her smiling fields. <lb/>
            And then at home, what pleasure is't to see <lb/>
            A little cleanly cheerful family! <lb/>
            Which if a chaste wife crown, no less in her <lb/>
            Than fortune, I the golden mean prefer. <note type="footnote"> 1 A house not too fine or splendid ; such as will allow of the free use <lb/>
            of fires without receiving damage by the smoke. </note> <note type="footnote"> K </note> <pb n="130"/>
            </p>
          <p>Too noble, nor too wise, she should not be, <lb/>
            No, nor too rich, too fair, too fond of me. <lb/>
            Thus let my life slide silently away, <lb/>
            With sleep all night, and quiet all the day. Cowley.</p>

            embalmed, seems to me a veritable corpse.</p>
          <p>Faith! your essence was excelling; <lb/>
            But you gave us nought to eat: <lb/>
            Nothing tasting, sweetly smelling, <lb/>
            Is, Fabullus, scarce a treat. <lb/>

            Martial oil account of the eighth Epigram. As the name of his mistress was <lb/>
            Hermione, and she was not one-eyed, Martial asks him how he could have <lb/>
            supposed that the Epigram was directed against her and him. If there <lb/>
            had been, he adds, any similarity in the names,-if your mistress, for <lb/>
            instance, had been called Lais, you might have fancied that Lais was meant <lb/>
            by Thais; but what similarity is there between Thais and Hermione ? <lb/>
            But, you will say, I mentioned Quintus in those lines, and your name is <lb/>
            Quintus. Well then, to please you, I will change the name, and for <lb/>

          <p>A goat, guilty of having gnawed a vine, was standing <lb/>
            doomed before the altar of Bacchus, a grateful victim for his <lb/>
            sacred rites. When the Tuscan soothsayer was about to <lb/>
            sacrifice him to the god, he chanced to order a rustic and <lb/>
            unlettered countryman to castrate the animal quickly with a <lb/>
            sharp knife, so that the foul odour from the unclean flesh <lb/>
            might pass away.2 But while he himself, with his body bent <lb/>
            over the grassy altar, was cutting the neck of the struggling <lb/>
            animal with his knife, and pressing it down with his hand, an <lb/>
            immense hernia of his own showed itself at the outraged rites. <lb/>
            This the rustic seized and cut, thinking that the ancient rites <lb/>
            of sacrifice demanded it, and that the ancient deities were <lb/>
            honoured with such offerings. So you, who but a while <lb/>
            since were a Tuscan, are become a Gallus ; 3 and while you <lb/>

            Laid hold of the beast! <lb/>

            Lop off either sign, <lb/>
            That so no rank odour remain." <lb/>
            When now he would slay, <lb/>
            Both strugglingly lay; <lb/>
            Both doomed the green altar to stain.</p>
          <p>As thus they lay low, <lb/>

          <p>You ape youth, Lætinus, with your dyed hair; and you, <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>Do you wish to know the reason, Ligurinus, that no one <lb/>
            willingly meets you; that, wherever you come, everybody <lb/>
            takes flight, and a vast solitude is left around you ? You <lb/>
            are too much of a poet. This is an extremely dangerous <lb/>
            fault. The tigress aroused by the loss of her whelps, the <lb/>
            viper scorched by the midday sun, or the ruthless scorpion, <lb/>
            are less objects of terror than you. For who, I ask, could <lb/>
            undergo such calls upon his patience as you make ? You <lb/>
            read your verses to me, whether I am standing, or sitting, <lb/>
            or running, or about private business. I fly to the hot baths, <lb/>
            there you din my ears: I seek the cold bath, there I cannot <lb/>
            swim for your noise: I hasten to dinner, you stop me on <lb/>
            my way ; I Bit down to dinner, you drive me from my seat: <lb/>
            wearied, I fall asleep, you rouse me from my couch. Do you <lb/>
            wish to see how much evil you occasion ?—You, a man just, <lb/>
            upright, and innocent, are an object of fear.</p>
          <p>You come; away flies every mother's son: <lb/>
            On Bagshot Heath you can't be more alone. <lb/>
            If you ask, why,—you are bewitch'd with rhyme: <lb/>
            And this, believe me, is a dangerous crime. <lb/>
             <pb n="150"/>
            Robb'd of her whelps, a tigress thus we shun; <lb/>
            Or viper basking in the noon-day sun: <lb/>
            Not more the dreadful scorpion's sting we fear, <lb/>
            Than this incessant lugging by the ear. <lb/>
            Standing or sitting, you repeat your lays : <lb/>
            On my close-stool I hear them ; in my chaise: <lb/>
            Your trumpet on the water strikes my ear; <lb/>
            I at Vauxhall no other music hear. <lb/>
            When dinner waits, you seize me by the button ; <lb/>
            At table placed, you drive me from my mutton: <lb/>
            From a sweet nap you rouse me by your song. <lb/>
            How much, by this, yourself and me you wrong ! <lb/>
            The man of worth, the poet, makes us fly ; <lb/>
            And by your verse we lose your probity. Hay.</p>
          <p>You often wonder what the devil <lb/>
            Can make the town so damned uncivil. <lb/>
            With what indifference they treat you! <lb/>
            There 's not a soul that cares to meet you. <lb/>
            Wherever you come, what consternation! <lb/>
            What universal desolation! <lb/>
            But for the cause-why, must you know it ? <lb/>
            I 'll tell yo i; " you 're too great a poet; ;” <lb/>
            And that's a thing true Britons fear <lb/>
            More than a tiger or a bear ; <lb/>
            Your man of sense, of all God's curses, <lb/>
            Dreads nothing like repeating verses. <lb/>
            And really, Tom, you 're past all bearing; <lb/>
            You'd tire a Dutchman out with hearing. <lb/>
            One must submit:—there's no contending; <lb/>
            You keep one sitting; keep one standing <lb/>
            Got loose, with more than decent speed <lb/>
            I trudge away-yet you proceed. <lb/>
            Go where one will, there's no retreat; <lb/>
            You 're at it still, repeat, repeat. <lb/>
            I fly to " Nando's ”—you are there, <lb/>
            Still thundering distichs in one's ear: <lb/>
            Thence to the park-still you 're as bad; <lb/>
            The ladies think you drunk or mad: <lb/>
            " But come, 't is late, at three we dine; <lb/>
            You stop one with " a charming line; " <lb/>
            Now down we sit; but lo! repeating <lb/>
            Is greater joy to you than eating. <lb/>
            Quite tired, I nod, and try to dose ; <lb/>
            In vain—you've murdered all repose. <lb/>
            But prithee, Tom, repent in time; <lb/>
            You see the sad effect of rhyme <pb n="151"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="BOOK III.]"/> <lb/>
            (And check this humour, if you can); <lb/>
            That such an honest worthy man, <lb/>
            With so much sense, and such good nature, <lb/>
            Should be so terrible a creature ! Rev. It. Graves, <lb/>
            That cousins, friends, and strangers fly thee, <lb/>
            Nay, thy own sister can't sit nigh thee, <lb/>
            That all men thy acquaintance shun, <lb/>
            And into holes and corners run, <lb/>
            Like Irish beau from English dun, <lb/>
            The reason's plain ; and if thou 'dst know it, <lb/>
            Thou 'rt a most damn'd repeating poet. <lb/>
            Not bailiff sour'd with horrid beard <lb/>
            Is more in poor Alsatia feared, <lb/>
            Since the stern Parliament of late <lb/>
            Has stript of ancient rights their state; <lb/>
            Not tigers when their whelps are missing; <lb/>
            Not serpents in the sunshine hissing; <lb/>
            Not snake in tail that carries rattle; <lb/>
            Not fire, nor plague, nor blood, nor battle, <lb/>
            Is half so dreaded by the throng, <lb/>
            As thy vile persecuting tongue. <lb/>
            If e'er the restless clack that's in it <lb/>
            Gives thy head leave to think a minute, <lb/>
            Think what a penance we must bear, <lb/>
            Thy damn'd impertinence to hear. <lb/>
            Where'er I run, or stand, or sit, <lb/>
            Thou still art in th' repeating fit: <lb/>
            Wearied, I seek a nap to take ; <lb/>
            But thy cursed muse keeps me awake. <lb/>
            At church too, when the organ's blowing, <lb/>
            Thy louder pipe is still a-going. <lb/>
            Nor park nor bagnio's from thee free ; <lb/>
            All places are alike to thee. <lb/>
            Learn wisdom once, at a friend's instance, <lb/>

            I can scarcely follow your litter, he will carry it. If you <lb/>

          <p>That snowy neck I ne'er should miss, <lb/>
            However much I 've raved about it; <lb/>
            And sweetly as that lip can kiss, <lb/>
            I think I could exist without it.</p>
          <p>In short, so well I've learn'd to fast, <lb/>

          <p>Our friend Faustinus's Baian farm, Bassus, does not <lb/>
            occupy an ungrateful expanse of broad land, laid out with <lb/>
            useless myrtle groves, sterile plane-trees, and clipped box­ <lb/>
            rows, but rejoices in a real unsophisticated country scene. <lb/>
            Here close-pressed heaps of corn are crammed into every <lb/>
            corner, and many a cask is redolent with wine of old vint­ <lb/>
            ages. Here, after November, when winter is at hand, the <lb/>
            rough vine-dresser brings in the ripened grapes; the sa­ <unclear/> <lb/>
            age bulls bellow in the deep valley, and the steer, with <lb/>
            forehead still unarmed, yearns for the fight. The whole <lb/>
            muster of the farmyard roams at large, the screaming goose, <lb/>
            the spangled peacock, the bird which derives its name from <lb/>

            proud cocks caress their Rhodian mates, and the turrets <lb/>
            resound with the murmur of pigeons. On this side mourns <lb/>
            the ring dove, on that the wax-coloured turtle-dove; the greedy <lb/>
            swine follow the apron of the bailiffs wife, and the tender <lb/>
            lamb bleats after its well-filled mother. Young house-bred <lb/>
            slaves, sleek as milk, surround the cheerful fire, and piles <lb/>
            of wood blaze near the joyous Lares. The steward does not, <lb/>
            through inactivity, grow pale with enervating ease, nor <lb/>
            waste oil in anointing himself for wrestling,1 but sets crafty <lb/>

            tremulous line, or brings home deer caught in the bunter's <lb/>

            men,2 and long-haired children, freed from the rule of their <lb/>
            instructor, delight to obey the farm-bailiff, and even the <lb/>
            effeminate eunuch finds enjoyment in working. Nor does the <lb/>
            rustic come empty-handed to pay his respects ; be brings with <lb/>
            him white honey in its waxen cells, and the conical cheese <lb/>
            from the forest of Sassina. This one offers the sleepy dor­ <lb/>
            mouse, that the bleating young of the hairy she-goat; another, <lb/>
            the capon debarred from loving. Tall maidens, daughters of <lb/>
            honest husbandmen, bring their mothers' presents in baskets <lb/>
            of osiers. Work being over, the cheerful neighbourhood is <lb/>
            invited in ; nor does a stinted table reserve its dainties for the <lb/>
            morrow, but every one eats his fill, and the well-fed attendant <lb/>
            has no cause to envy the reeling guest. But you, Bassus, <lb/>

            your visitor is starved, and where, from lofty towers, you look <lb/>

            I contend, would be both easier and more decent. Clothed in <lb/>

            thrusts aside his guests with his elbows on this side and <lb/>
            that. At hand stands a minion, who hands to, his master, <lb/>
            ready to vomit, red feathers and toothpicks of lentisc <lb/>
            wood; while, if he is oppressed by the heat, a concubine, <lb/>

            a rod of myrtle. A softener,1 with nimble art, strokes his <lb/>
            whole body, and passes her skilled hand over all his limbs. <lb/>
            The signal of snapping his fingers is watched by an <lb/>
            eunuch, who presents him with the vessel which his copious <lb/>
            draughts render indispensable. Meanwhile Zoilus himself, <lb/>
            leaning backwards to the crowd at his feet, among the pup­ <lb/>
            pies who are licking up the giblets of geese, divides among <lb/>
            his athletes the neck of a wild-boar, or bestows upon his fa­ <lb/>
            vourite the thigh of a turtle-dove; and while to us is offered <lb/>
            wine from Ligurian rocks, or such as has been ripened in the <lb/>
            smoke of Marseilles, he hands to his creatures Opimian nectar <lb/>
            in crystalline and myrrhine vases; and, while he himself is <lb/>
            drenched with essences from the stores of Cosmus, he is <lb/>
            not ashamed to divide amongst us in a little gilt shell, un­ <lb/>
            guents such as only the lowest women use. Finally, over­ <lb/>
            come by many draughts from his large cups, he falls snoring <lb/>
            asleep. We sit at the table, and, ordered to keep silence <lb/>
            while he is grunting, drink each other's healths by signs. Such <lb/>
            is the insolence which we have to endure from this presum­ <lb/>
            ing Malchion; nor do we ask to be avenged, Rufus. He has <lb/>
            an evil tongue.2</p>
          <p>Whoe'er with a Zoilus' treat can put up, <lb/>

          <p>Behold him betrick'd on the couch he has seized, <lb/>
            On either side elbowing that he may be eased; . <lb/>
            Supported on purple, and pillows of silk; <lb/>
            The catamite standing, that nothing may bilk.</p>
          <p>To Zoilus squeamish his minister lends <lb/>

            And now in a swim while he's stewing, poor man <lb/>
            A lolloping concubine flaps the green fan.</p>
          <p>As thus she restores him to regions of light, <lb/>
            A minion with myrtle puts insects to flight. <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>When a dismissed veteran, a native of Ravenna, was return­ <lb/>
            ing home, he joined on the way a troop of the emasculated <lb/>
            priests of Cybele. There was in close attendance upon him <lb/>
            a runaway slave named Achillas, a youth remarkable for <lb/>
            his handsome looks and saucy manner. This was noticed by <lb/>
            the effete troop; and they inquired what part of the couch he <lb/>
            occupied. The youth understood their secret intentions, and <lb/>
            gave them false information; they believed him. After <lb/>
            drinking sufficiently, each retired to his couch; when forth­ <lb/>
            with the malicious crew seized their knives, and mutilated <lb/>
            the old man, as he lay on one side of the couch; while the <lb/>
            youth was safe in the protection of the inner recess. It is <lb/>
            said that a stag was once substituted for a virgin; but in <lb/>
            this case something of a different nature was substituted for <lb/>
            a stag.2</p>
          <p>When old Misitius sought his native land, <lb/>

            Achillas, from his lord a slippery stray, <lb/>
            Adhered the partner of Misitius' way. <lb/>
            Him eye the half-men; and their art employ, <lb/>
            To learn the lair that hopes the beauteous boy. <lb/>
            Suspecting well their aim to catch such elves, <lb/>
            And render them enervate as themselves, <lb/>
            Their industry industrious to deride, <lb/>
            The pricket points the bed ; but not the side. <lb/>
            They quaff their wine, and now the slumbers please. <lb/>

            Misitius they unman, who next them lay; <lb/>

            Once, for a virgin, bled a wondrous hind: <lb/>

          <p>You never say, "Good day !" first, Nævolus : but content <lb/>
            yourself with returning the salute, though even the crow is <lb/>
            often in the habit of saying it first. Why do you expect this <lb/>
            from me, Naevolus ? I pray you, tell me. For I consider, <lb/>
            Naevolus, you are neither better than I am, nor have pre­ <lb/>
            cedence of me in the eyes of the world. Both Caesars have <lb/>
            bestowed upon me praise and rewards, and have given me the <lb/>
            rights of a father of three children. I am read by many; <lb/>
            and fame has given me a name known throughout the cities <lb/>
            of the earth, without waiting for my death. There is some­ <lb/>
            thing, too, in this, that Rome has seen me a tribune, and that <lb/>
            I sit in those seats whence Oceanus 1 excludes you. I sus­ <lb/>
            pect that your servants are not even as numerous as the <lb/>
            Roman citizens that Caesar has made at my request. But <lb/>
            you are a debauchee, Nævolus, and play your part excel­ <lb/>
            lently in that capacity. Yes, now you take precedence of <lb/>
            me, Naevolus ; you have decidedly the advantage. Good day <lb/>
            to you.</p>
          <p>Nævolus ne'er salutes first, but replies, <lb/>
            Which the taught crow himself seldom denies. <lb/>
            Why dost expect this from me, Naevolus ? <lb/>
            Since thou art not more great nor good than us ? <lb/>
            Both Cæsars have rewarded my due praise, <lb/>
            And me to th' privilege of three sons did raise. <lb/>
            I 'm read by every mouth, known through the town, <lb/>
            And before death receive my quick renown. <lb/>
            And this is worth your note, I'm tribune too, <lb/>
            And sit where that Oceanus caps you; <lb/>
            How many by great Caesar's grant are made <lb/>
            Free denizens because by me 'twas prayed P <lb/>
            The number far exceeds thy family : <lb/>

            sovereign, and lick his hand, a band than which the world <lb/>
            contains nothing more powerful. They even have each its <lb/>
            name, and each comes up at the voice of its master when <lb/>
            called. Once, in this deep pool, as an impious Libyan was <lb/>
            drawing up his prey with quivering rod, he was suddenly struck <lb/>
            with blindness, and unable to see the captured fish ; and now, <lb/>
            abhorring his sacrilegious hooks, he sits a beggar on the banks <lb/>
            of the Baian lake.1 But do you withdraw while you may, and <lb/>
            while you are yet innocent, casting into the waters only harm­ <lb/>
            less morsels of food, and respecting the tender fish.</p>
          <p>From the Baian lake, with awe, <lb/>

            Lest, of hallow'd blood unspilt <lb/>
            Thou shouldst rash incur the guilt. <lb/>
            Sacred fishes, swimming bland, <lb/>
            Hail their lord, and lick his hand : <lb/>
            Hand whose greater cannot wave, <lb/>
            Or to sacrifice or save. <lb/>
            Name respective know they all, <lb/>
            And attend their master's call. <lb/>
            Once a Libyan rued the deed, <lb/>
            When he play'd the trembling reed. <lb/>
            Sudden light his eyes forsook, <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>On the long ridge of the Janiculan Hill lie the few acres <lb/>
            belonging to Julius Martialis; land more blessed than the <lb/>
            gardens of the Hesperides. Secluded retreats are spread <lb/>
            over the hills, and the smooth summit, with gentle un­ <lb/>
            dulations, enjoys a cloudless sky, and, while a mist covers <lb/>
            the hollow valleys, shines conspicuous in a light all its own. <lb/>
            The graceful turrets of a lofty villa rise gently towards the <lb/>
            stars. Hence you may see the seven hills, rulers of the world, <lb/>
            and contemplate the whole extent of Rome, as well as the <lb/>
            heights of Alba and Tusculum, and every cool retreat that <lb/>
            lies in the suburbs, with old Fidenæ and little Rubra, and the <lb/>
            fruit-bearing grove of Anna Perenna, which delights in vir­ <lb/>
            gins' bloody Thence may be seen the traveller on the Flami­ <lb/>
            nian and Salarian roads, while his carriage is unheard, so that <lb/>
            its wheels are no interruption to gentle sleep; neither is it <lb/>
            broken by the cry of the boatswain, or the noise of hawsers, <lb/>
            although the Mulvian bridge is near, and ships are seen glid­ <lb/>
            ing swiftly along the sacred Tiber. This country box, but <lb/>
            which ought rather to be called mansion, is rendered addition­ <lb/>
            ally agreeable by the welcome of its owner; you will imagine <lb/>
            it to be your own; so ungrudgingly, so liberally, is it thrown <lb/>
            open to you, and with such refined hospitality. You would <lb/>
            deem it the pious abode of Alcinous, or of Molorchus re­ <lb/>

          <p>Martiall’s few acres pleasanter <lb/>

            Perenna's apple-bearing grounds, <lb/>
            Which much in virgin blood delight. <lb/>
            There in the highways to our sight <lb/>

          <p>You have always led the life, Linus, of a country gentle­ <lb/>
            man ; an existence than which none can be more inexpen­ <lb/>
            sive. It was only on the ides, and occasionally on the kalends <lb/>
            of the month,1 that you put on your toga ; and one robe of <lb/>
            ceremony lasted you ten summers. The forest sent you wild <lb/>
            boars, and the field sent you hares, without cost; the well­ <lb/>
            searched wood gave you fat thrushes. The fish came easily <lb/>
            snatched from the watery pool; and the red cask poured forth <lb/>
            wines of native growth. No attendant of Grecian birth stood <lb/>
            at your orders, but a rustic assemblage from the farm. As <lb/>
            often as your amorous fancies were warmed and excited by <lb/>
            wine, the housekeeper, or the wife of your hardy labourer, <lb/>
            sufficed to appease them. Fire hurt not your house, nor Sirius <lb/>
            your lands : no ship of yours was ever sunk in the deep; nor <lb/>
            is any one now at sea. In your house dice never supplanted <lb/>
            the quiet tali ;2 but all your stake was a few nuts. Tell us, <lb/>
            then, where is the million sesterces which your parsimonious <lb/>
            mother left you. Nowhere. You have accomplished a. diffi­ <lb/>
            cult thing, Linus.</p>
          <p>Your life has ever in the country been <lb/>

            Scarce at a wedding a new bob did wear: <lb/>
            Your coat an old acquaintance of ten year. <lb/>
            From your estate your pork and venison came : <lb/>
            Your ponds supplied your fish, your woods your game. <lb/>
            And not a glass of wine throughout the year; <lb/>
            Your cellar stocke'd with only your own beer. <lb/>
            No French valet appeared in spruce attire: <lb/>
            Only John trots about your kitchen fire. <lb/>
            You ne'er had drunken frolic in your life, <lb/>

          <p>This is the fifth book, Augustus, of my sportive effusions, <lb/>
            and no one complains of having been injured by my verse. <lb/>
            But many a reader rejoices in an honoured name, to whom <lb/>
            lasting fame is secured by my gift. " And yet of what use are <lb/>
            these trifles, however much they respect personal character ? " <lb/>

          <p>That, although I could write on serious, I prefer to write <lb/>
            on amusing topics, is your fault, kind reader, who read and <lb/>
            repeat my verses all over Rome. But you do not know how <lb/>
            much your favour costs me. If I were to plead causes at the <lb/>
            temple of the scythe-bearing god,1 and to sell my words to <lb/>
            persons trembling under accusation, many a seaman whom I <lb/>
            had defended would send me jars of Spanish wine, and the <lb/>
            lap of my toga would be stained with all sorts of coin. But, as <lb/>
            it is, my book is merely a guest and sharer of revels, and <lb/>
            my page affords amusement for which I receive no pay. <lb/>
            Not even the poets of old were content with empty praise; <lb/>
            in those days the smallest present made to the immortal <lb/>
            bard (Virgil) was Alexis. " You write charmingly," you say, <lb/>
            “ and we will reward you with praises for ever.”— Do you <lb/>
            pretend not to understand my hints ? You will, I suspect, <lb/>
            make me a lawyer.</p>
          <p>That I, who could be serious, thus doe write, <lb/>
            Deare reader, 't is for your, not my delight, <lb/>
            Who my lines thro' the towne reade and repeate: <lb/>
            But what I lose by this you know not yet. <lb/>
            For would I plead for prisoners waiting death, <lb/>
            Or unto careful clients sell my breath, <lb/>
            That many a piece of Spanish wine would yield, <lb/>
            And with much gold my bosome would be fill'd. <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>If any reliance is to be placed on true report, no age, <lb/>
            Cæsar, can be preferred to yours. When have men had <lb/>
            the privilege of beholding triumphs better deserved ? When <lb/>
            have the Palatine gods done more to merit our gratitude ? <lb/>
            Under what ruler has Mars's Rome shown herself fairer or <lb/>
            greater ? Under what prince was there ever so much <lb/>
            liberty ? This vice, however, exists, and not a small one, <lb/>
            although it be but one, that the poor man cultivates friends <lb/>
            who simply treat him with ingratitude. Who bestows any <lb/>
            portion of his wealth upon his old and faithful friend, or <lb/>
            whose train is accompanied by a knight whom he has helped <lb/>
            to create ? To have sent at the time of the Saturnalia a <lb/>
            silver spoon of small weight, or a gaudy toga worth ten <lb/>
            scruples, is extravagant liberality; and our proud patrons <lb/>
            call such things presents. Perhaps there may be one, who <lb/>
            will chink out a few gold pieces. But since these men are <lb/>
            not our friends, be thou, Cæsar, a friend to us; no virtue in <lb/>
            a prince can be more pleasing than generosity. But be­ <lb/>
            fore you have read thus far, Germanicus, you will have <lb/>
            been laughing at me to yourself for giving you advice which <lb/>

          <p>If truth make e'er her mandates heard, <lb/>
            No times to thine can be preferred. <lb/>
            Great Cæsar, who could triumphs see <lb/>
            Equal to those display'd by thee? <lb/>
            Or can the period be assigned, <lb/>
            That boasted palace-gods more kind? <lb/>
            More great or glorious, under whom <lb/>
            Effulged, high air, imperial Rome? <lb/>
            And under what auspicious reign <lb/>

          <p>Calliodorus, friend Sextus, possesses (who does not know <lb/>
            it ?) the fortune of a knight; but Calliodorus has also a <lb/>
            brother. He who divides four hundred thousand sesterces <lb/>
            would halve a fig. Do you think that two men can sit on one <lb/>

            if you had not this Pollux, you would be a Castor.1 While you <lb/>
            are one, you require, Calliodorus, two peats. You are com­ <lb/>
            mitting a solecism, Calliodorus. Rise, or else imitate the sons <lb/>

            Calliodorus, occupy the seat by turns. <note type="footnote"> 1 You would have been a complete and acknowledged knight. Castor <lb/>

            remarked in the whole of that extensive area. This illusion was <lb/>
            of advantage to you in December, when the emperor distri­ <lb/>

            Which a boy's head will hardly well become ; <lb/>
            Upon thy crown lies a large vacant room, <lb/>

            that person, I say, Rufus, even should torture try to compel <lb/>

          <p>Your services to me I remember, and shall never forget. <lb/>
            Why then am I silent about them, Postumus ? Because you <lb/>
            yourself talk of them. Whenever I begin to speak to any one <lb/>
            of your favours, he immediately exclaims, " He has told me <lb/>
            of them himself." There are certain things which cannot <lb/>
            be well done by two people; one is enough in this case. <lb/>
            If you wish me to speak, keep silence yourself. Believe me, <lb/>
            Postumus, gifts, however great, are deprived of their value <lb/>
            by garrulity on the part of the donor.</p>
          <p>What thou conferr'st on me I do <lb/>
            Remember, and shall think on too. <lb/>
            Why therefore do I hold my tongue ? <lb/>
            Cause, Posthumus, thou ne'er hast done. <lb/>
            As often as I go to treat <lb/>
            Of these thy gifts to them I meet, <lb/>
            'T is presently replied, " Forbear, <lb/>
            He whispered it into my ear." <lb/>
            Two men some things cannot do well: <lb/>
            One person may suffice to tell, <lb/>
            And do this work: if it may please <lb/>
            That I shall speak, then hold thy peace. <lb/>
            For prithee, Postumus, believe, <lb/>
            Though that thy gifts are great to give <lb/>
            All thanks must perish, and are lost, <lb/>
            When authors their own actions boast. Fletcher.</p>
          <p>Your favours to me I remember well; <lb/>
            But do not mention them; because you tell. <lb/>
            Whenever I begin, I ’m answer*d straight, <lb/>
            " I heard from his own mouth what you relate." <lb/>
            Two ill become the business but of one; <lb/>
            Be you but silent, I will speak alone. <lb/>

          <p>To what master to intrust your son, Lupus, has been an <lb/>
            anxious object of consideration with you for some time. <lb/>
            Avoid, I advise you, all the grammarians and rhetoricians; let <lb/>
            him have nothing to do with the books of Cicero or Virgil; <lb/>
            let him leave Tutilius I to his fame. If he makes verses, give <lb/>
            him no encouragement to be a poet; if he wishes to study <lb/>
            lucrative arts, make him learn to play on the guitar or flute. <lb/>
            If he seems to be of a dull disposition, make him an <lb/>
            auctioneer or an architect.</p>
          <p>Whene'er I meet you, still you cry, <lb/>
            " What shall I do with Bob my boy P " <lb/>
            Since this affair you'd have me treat on, <lb/>
            Ne'er send the lad to Paul's or Eton. <lb/>
            The Muses let him not confide in, <lb/>
            But leave those jilts to fate or Dryden. <lb/>
            If with damn'd rhimes he racks his wits, <lb/>
            Send him to Mevis or St Kit's. <lb/>
            Would you with wealth his pockets store well? <lb/>
            Teach him to pimp or bolt a door well: <lb/>
            If he 'as a head not worth a stiver, <lb/>

          <p>You on one great concern your thoughts employ; <lb/>

            All Greek and Latin masters, I advise. <lb/>
            Let him both Cicero and Virgil shun, <lb/>
            Unless you wish him to be quite undone. <lb/>
            Then, of a lad you never can have hope, <lb/>
            Who verses makes, or reads a line in Pope. <lb/>
            If he in gainful business would engage, <lb/>
            Teach him to sing or play upon the stage. <lb/>
            Or if he is too dull to be a player, <lb/>

            sive languor, or painful maladies, were separated from the <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>No one is more pitiable, no one more gluttonous, than <lb/>
            Santra, when he is invited and hurries off to a regular supper, <lb/>
            to which he has fished for an invitation many days and <lb/>
            nights: he asks three times for boar's neck, four times for <lb/>
            the loin, and for the two hips and both shoulders of a hare <lb/>
            nor does he blush at lying for a thrush, or filching even the <lb/>
            livid beards of oysters. Sweet cheese-cakes stain his <lb/>
            dirty napkin; in which also potted grapes are wrapped, with <lb/>
            a few pomegranates, the unsightly skin of an excavated <lb/>
            sow's udder, moist figs, and shrivelled mushrooms. And <lb/>
            when the napkin is bursting with a thousand thefts, he <lb/>
            hides in the reeking fold of his dress gnawed fish-bones, and <lb/>
            a turtle-dove deprived of its head. He thinks it not disgrace­ <lb/>
            fill, too, to gather up with greedy hand whatever the waiter <lb/>
            and the dogs have left. Nor does solid booty alone satisfy <lb/>
            his gluttony; at his feet he fills a flagon with mingled <lb/>
            wines. These things he carries home with him, up some two <lb/>
            hundred steps; and locks himself carefully in his garret <lb/>
            and bars it; and the next day the rapacious fellow sells <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>When Sanctra long had rioted in dreams, <lb/>
            And fed his waking mind with future steams; <lb/>
            To the still panted, pray'd, pursued repast, <lb/>
            Him the dear invitation bless'd at last. <lb/>
            But oh ! poor Sanctra, wast thou blessed or cursed, <lb/>
            When on the gorgeous board thine eyeballs burst ? <lb/>
            The kernels of the boar he thrice demands: <lb/>
            The loin he four times hints he understands. <lb/>
            To the hare's either hip his spirit springs : <lb/>
            And flutters now to fly on both the wings. <lb/>
            His soul he perjures for a glorious thrush: <lb/>
            He beards the oysters, but he will not crush. <lb/>
            With comfits next behold his napkin graced: <lb/>
            In the same hoard the potted grapes are placed. <lb/>
            Here a few grains of Punic apples lie ; <lb/>
            And there a skin, just scoop'd from out a sty. <lb/>
             <pb n="314"/>
            Nor is the blear-eyed fig herself forgot; <lb/>
            Nor here forgets the mushroom mash'd to rot. <lb/>
            When the racked cloth, by many a hundred rents, <lb/>
            Bewrays a thousand thefts, a thousand scents; <lb/>
            The half-gnaw'd bones he fosters in his breast, <lb/>
            Where not the headless dove disdains to rest. <lb/>
            Nor does his dextrous hand abhor the theft <lb/>
            Of the last offals that the dogs have left. <lb/>
            But lo ! he fills, sufficed not thus to eat, <lb/>

            Is it to guard, lest many a nymph should rove ; <lb/>

          <p>If you are unwilling, Urbicus, to purchase my trifles, and <lb/>

            Pompeius Auctus. Perhaps you know him ; he sits in the <lb/>

            imbued with law, and versed in the various usages of civil <lb/>
            life, he is not only my reader, Urbicus, but my book <lb/>
            itself. He so faithfully remembers and repeats his absent <lb/>
            friend's compositions, that not a single letter of my pages <lb/>
            is lost. In a word, if he had chosen, he might have made <lb/>
            himself appear the author; but he prefers to assist in <lb/>
            spreading my reputation. You may apply to him after the <lb/>
            tenth hour 2 of the day, for before that time he will not be <lb/>
            sufficiently disengaged; his little dinner will accommodate <lb/>
            two. He will read; you may drink; he will recite whether <lb/>
            you like it or not: and after you have said " Hold, enough! <lb/>
            he will still continue to recite.</p>

            In Mars Revenger's temple him you '11 meet; <lb/>
            Skilled in all law and courts: on him I look, <lb/>
            Not as my reader, but my very book. <lb/>
            By heart he has so perfect ev'ry line, <lb/>
            That not a tittle can be lost that's mine. <lb/>
            So that the author he might claim to be, <lb/>

          <p>You have sent me as a present for the Saturnalia, Umber, <lb/>

            twelve note-books of three tablets each, seven tooth-picks ; <lb/>
            together with which came a sponge, a table-cloth, a wine­ <lb/>
            cup, a half-bushel of beans, a basket of Picenian olives, and <lb/>
            a black jar of Laletanian wine. There came also some small <lb/>
            Syrian figs, some candied plums, and a heavy pot of figs <lb/>
            from Libya. They were a present worth, I believe, scarcely <lb/>

            eight tall Syrian slaves. How much more convenient would <lb/>

          <p>This is that Theophila, Canius, who is betrothed to you, <lb/>

            nian garden of the great old man 1 might justly claim her for <lb/>

            her theirs. Every work will live that you submit to her <lb/>
            judgment before publication, so far is her taste above that <lb/>
            of her sex, and of the common herd. Your favourite Pan­ <lb/>
            tænis, however well known to the Pierian choir, should not <lb/>
            claim too much precedence of her. The amorous Sappho <lb/>
            would have praised her verses; Theophila is more chaste than <lb/>
            Sappho, and Sappho had not more genius than Theophila.</p>
          <p>This, Canius, is that spouse of thine, from whose <lb/>
            Wise breast Cecropian learning sweetely flowes: <lb/>
            Her Epicurus' gardens might have bredd, <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>ALL my books, Sire, to which you have given renown, that <lb/>
            is, life, are dedicated to you; and will for that reason, I doubt <lb/>
            not, be read. This, however, which is the eighth of my col­ <lb/>
            lection, has furnished more frequent opportunities of show­ <lb/>
            ing my devotion to you. I had consequently less occasion <lb/>
            to produce from my own invention, for the matter supplied <lb/>
            the place of thought; yet I have occasionally attempted to <lb/>
            produce variety by the admixture of a little pleasantry, that <lb/>
            every verse might not inflict on your divine modesty praises <lb/>
            more likely to fatigue you than to satisfy me. And though <lb/>
            epigrams, addressed even to the gravest persons and to those <lb/>
            of the highest rank, are usually written in such a manner <lb/>
            that they seem to assume a theatrical licence of speech, I <lb/>
            have nevertheless not permitted these to speak with any such <lb/>
            freedom. Since, too, the larger and better part of the book <lb/>
            is devoted to the majesty of your sacred name, it has to re­ <lb/>
            member that it ought not to approach the temples of gods <lb/>
            . without religious purification. That my readers also may <lb/>
            know that I consider myself bound by this obligation, I have <lb/>
            determined to make a declaration to that effect at the com­ <lb/>

            and in a reverent tone. Retire, unblushing Venus; this <lb/>

          <p>Janus, the author and parent of our annals, when he re­ <lb/>
            cently beheld the conqueror of the Danube, thought it not <lb/>
            enough to have several faces,1 and wished that he had more <lb/>

            promised the lord of earth and divinity of the empire an old <lb/>
            age four times as long as that of Nestor. We pray thee, father <lb/>
            Janus, that thou wouldst give the promised term in addition <lb/>
            to thine own immortality.</p>
          <p>When Janus, lord of times, beheld of late <lb/>

            Though faces he had two, he thought them few, <lb/>
            And wish'd that yet more eyes he had to view. <lb/>
            With both his tongues he said unto our lord, <lb/>

            many: why, Muse, do you delight still to sport on ? Be mod­ <lb/>

            my book is in every hand. And when the stone sepulchre <lb/>

            fumes, made this reply: Canst thou then, ungrateful, lay <lb/>

            I shall be read, strangers will make 't their care, <lb/>

            What better choice, ungrateful, canst thou make ? <lb/>
            Exchange thy mirthful for a tragic vein ; <lb/>
            Thunder harsh wars in an heroic strain; <lb/>

            Let the o'er-sour and dull that way delight, <lb/>
            Whose lamps at midnight see the wretches write. <lb/>

          <p>There is nothing more hateful than the antique vases of old <lb/>

            garrulous old man boasts the pedigrees of his smoky silver <lb/>
            vessels, he makes even the wine seem musty with his talk. <lb/>
            " These cups belonged to the table of Laomedon; to obtain <lb/>
            which Apollo raised the walls of Troy by the sound of <lb/>
            his lyre. With this goblet fierce Rhoecus rushed to battle <lb/>
            with the Lapithæ; you see that the work has suffered in <lb/>
            the struggle. This double vase is celebrated for having <lb/>
            belonged to the aged Nestor; the doves upon it have been <lb/>
            worn bright by the thumb of the hero of Pylos. This is <lb/>
            the tankard in which Achilles ordered wine to be pre­ <lb/>
            pared for his friends with more than ordinary copiousness <lb/>
            and strength. In this bowl the beauteous Dido drank the <lb/>
            health of Bitias, at the entertainment given to the Phrygian <lb/>
            hero." When you have done admiring all these trophies of <lb/>
            ancient art, you will have to drink Astyanax in the cups of <lb/>
            Priam.1</p>
          <p>In leathern jack to drink much less I hate, <lb/>
            Than in Sir William's antique set of plate. <lb/>
            He tells the gasconading pedigree, <lb/>
            Till the wine turns insipid too as he. <lb/>
            " This tumbler, in the world the oldest toy," <lb/>
            Says he, " was brought by Brute himself from Troy. <lb/>
            That handled cup, and which is larger far, <lb/>
            A present to my father from the Czar: <lb/>
            See how 't is bruis'd, and the work broken off; <lb/>
            *T was when he flung it at Prince Menzikoff. <lb/>
            The other with the cover, which is less, <lb/>
            Was once the property of good Queen Bess: <lb/>
            In it she pledg'd duke d'Alençon, then gave it <lb/>

            The bowl, the tankard, flagon, and the beaker, <lb/>

            What pity 't is, that plate so old and fine <lb/>

          <p>If, Cirinius, you were to publish your epigrams, you might <lb/>
            be my equal, or even my superior, in the estimation of the <lb/>
            reading public; but such is the respect you entertain for <lb/>
            your old friend, that his reputation is dearer to you than your <lb/>
            own. Just so did Virgil abstain from the style of the Cala­ <lb/>
            brian Horace, although he was well able to excel even the <lb/>
            odes of Pindar, and so too did he resign to Varius the praise <lb/>
            of the Roman buskin, although he could have declaimed with <lb/>
            more tragic power. Gold, and wealth, and estates, many a <lb/>
            friend will bestow; one who consents to yield the palm in <lb/>
            genius, is rare.</p>
          <p>So smooth your numbers, friend, your verse so sweet, <lb/>
            So sharp the jest, and yet the tone so neat, <lb/>
            That with her Martial Rome would place Cirine, <lb/>
            Rome would prefer your sense and thought to mine. <lb/>
            Yet modest you decline the public stage, <lb/>
            To fix your friend alone amid th' applauding age. <lb/>
            So Maro did ; the mighty Maro sings <lb/>
            In vast heroic notes of vast heroic things, <lb/>
            And leaves the ode to dance upon his Flaccus' strings. <lb/>
            He scorn'd to daunt the dear Horatian lyre, <lb/>
            Though his brave genius flashed Pindaric fire, <lb/>
            And at his will could silence all the lyric quire. <lb/>
            So to his Varius he resign'd the praise <lb/>
            Of the proud buskin and the tragic bays, <lb/>
            When he could thunder with a loftier vein, <lb/>
            And sing of gods and heroes in a bolder strain. <lb/>
            A handsome treat, a piece of gold, or so, <lb/>
            And compliments, will every friend bestow: <lb/>
            Rarely a Virgil, a Cirine we meet, <lb/>
            Who lays his laurels at inferior feet, <lb/>
            And yields the tenderest point of honour, wit. <lb/>
            Dr. Watts, Horæ Lyrica.</p>
          <p>In epigram so happy is your strain, <lb/>
            You might be read, and I might write in vain: <lb/>
            But your regard to friendship so sincere, <lb/>
            Your own applause, than mine, you hold less dear. <lb/>
            So Maro left to Flaccus Pindar's flight, <lb/>
            Able himself to soar a nobler height: <pb n="358"/>
            </p>
          <p>And, warmed with a superior tragic rage, <lb/>
            To Varius gave the honour of the stage. <lb/>
            Friends oft to friends in other points submit j <lb/>

            Or has thy wool counted the mouths of the divided Timavus,2 <lb/>
            of which the affectionate Cyllarus, now numbered with the <lb/>

            with Amyclæan dye, nor was Miletus worthy to receive thy <lb/>
            fleece. Thou surpassest in whiteness the lily, the budding <lb/>

            yield to thee; and even the pearl fished from the Indian seas. <lb/>

          <p>Say, grateful gift of mine ingenious friend, <lb/>
            What happy flock shall to thy fleece pretend ? <lb/>
            For thee did herb of fam'd Phalantus blow, <lb/>

            Or did Tartessian Bætis also lave <lb/>
            Thy matchless woof, in his Hesperian wave? <lb/>
            Did thy wool number streamlets more than seven, <lb/>
            Of him who slak'd the warrior-horse of heaven ? <lb/>
            Amyclæ's bane ne'er harrow'd up thy hair : <lb/>
            Miletus never boasted fleece so fair. <lb/>
            To thee the lily fades, the privet's pale ; <lb/>

          <p>The spectacle which is now presented to us on Cæsar's <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>You send me, Paulus, a leaf from a Prætor's crown, and <lb/>
            give it the name of a wine-cup. Some toy of the stage has <lb/>
            perhaps recently been covered with this thin substance, and <lb/>
            a dash of pale saffron-water washed it off. Or is it rather <lb/>
            a piece of gilding scraped off (as I think it may be) by the <lb/>
            nail of a cunning servant from the leg of your couch ? Why, <lb/>
            it is moved by a gnat flying at a distance, and is shaken by <lb/>
            the wing of the tiniest butterfly. The flame of the smallest <lb/>
            lamp makes it flit about, and it would be broken by the <lb/>
            least quantity of wine poured into it. With some such crust <lb/>
            as this the date is covered, which the ill-dressed client carries <lb/>
            to his patron, with a small piece of money, on the first of <lb/>
            January. The bean of Egypt produces filaments less flexible; <lb/>
            and lilies, which fall before an excessive sun, are more sub­ <lb/>
            stantial. The wandering spider does not disport upon a web <lb/>
            so fine, nor does the hanging silk-worm produce a work so <lb/>
            slight. The chalk lies thicker on the face of old Fabulla; <lb/>
            the bubble swells thicker on -the agitated wave. The net <lb/>
            which enfolds a girl's twisted hair is stronger, and the <lb/>
            Batavian foam which changes the colour of Roman locks is <lb/>
            thicker. With skin such as this the chick in the Ledæan <lb/>
            egg is clothed: such are the patches which repose upon <lb/>
            the senator's forehead. Why did you send me a wine-cup, <lb/>

            But I speak too grandly; when you might have sent me a <lb/>

            nothing at all, Paulus ?</p>
          <p>As thinn as March-payne flaggs you sent mee, Paul, <lb/>

            So thinn 'tis, that a gnatt's wing passing by, <lb/>
            Shakes it at distance, or least butterfly. <lb/>
            With candied smoak it takes a doubtful flight, <lb/>
            Least drop of wine infus'd dissolves it quite. <lb/>

            to the material; it surrounds the cup, as the moon surrounds <lb/>
            the earth, when she shines at the full with all her light. Em­ <lb/>
            bossed on it is a goat adorned with the Æolian fleece of the <lb/>
            Theban Phrixus ; 1 a goat on which his sister would have pre­ <lb/>

            not despoil of his hair, and which Bacchus himself would al­ <lb/>
            low to browse on his vine. On the back of tho animal sits a <lb/>

            of the lotus seems to resound from his delicate lips. Thus did <lb/>

            lions, and when the pale shepherd recalls his astonished <lb/>

            How apt for large hunting spears was his broad chest, and <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>As the age of our ancestors yields to our own, and as Rome <lb/>
            has grown greater with her ruler, you wonder that genius <lb/>
            like that of the divine Virgil is nowhere found among us, <lb/>
            and that no poet thunders of wars with so powerful a clarion. <lb/>
            Let there be Mæcenases, Flaccus, and there will be no want <lb/>
            of Virgils ; even your own farm may furnish you with a Maro. <lb/>
            Tityrus had lost several acres in the neighbourhood of poor <lb/>
            Cremona, and was sadly mourning over the loss of his sheep. <lb/>
            The Tuscan knight1 smiled on him, repelled harsh poverty <lb/>
            from his door, and bade it quickly take to flight. " Accept," <lb/>
            said he," a portion of my wealth, and be the greatest of bards; <lb/>
            nay, thou mayst even love my Alexis." That most beautiful <lb/>
            of youths used to stand at his master's feasts, pouring the <lb/>
            dark Falernian with hand white as marble, and to present him <lb/>
            the cup just sipped with his rosy lips; lips which might have <lb/>
            attracted the admiration of Jupiter himself. The plump Ga­ <lb/>
            latea, and Thestylis, with her ruddy cheeks burnt by the bar­ <lb/>
            vest sun, vanished from the memory of the inspired bard. <lb/>
            Forthwith be sang of Italy, and "Arms and the man,"-he, <lb/>
            whose inexperienced strain had scarcely sufficed to lament a <lb/>
            gnat.2 Why need I mention the Varii3 and Marsi,4 and other <lb/>
            poets who have been enriched, and to enumerate whom would <lb/>
            be a long task ? Shall I, then, be a Virgil, if you give me <lb/>
            such gifts as Mæcenas gave him ? I shall not be Virgil; but <lb/>
            I shall be a Marsus.5</p>
          <p>Since never was an age so happy yet; <lb/>
            So great the nation or the prince so great; <lb/>
            You wonder that no Addisons remain, <lb/>
            No bard to sing a fortunate campaign. <lb/>
            Let but Mæcenas, Virgil will, revive: <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>Here, where the temple dedicated to returning Fortune <lb/>
            glistens resplendent far and wide, was formerly a spot of <lb/>
            ground of great celebrity. Here Domitian, graced with the <lb/>
            dust of the Sarmatian 1 war, halted, his countenance radiating <lb/>
            with glory. Here, with locks wreathed with bays, and in white <lb/>
            garb, Rome saluted her general with voice and gesture. The <lb/>
            great merits of the spot are attested by the other monuments <lb/>
            with which it has been honoured; a sacred arch is there <lb/>
            erected in memory of our triumphs over subdued nations. Here <lb/>
            two chariots 2 number many an elephant yoked to them ; the <lb/>
            prince himself, cast in gold, guides alone the mighty team. <lb/>
            This gate, Germanicus, is worthy of thy triumphs; such an <lb/>
            entrance it is fit the city of Mars should possess.</p>
          <p>Where to returning Fortune now we build <lb/>
            Vast glittering temples, lately was that field <lb/>
            Where, lovely in the dust of warr, such grace, <lb/>
            Such lustre shin'd from Cæsar's ruddy face ; <note type="footnote"> I See B. vii. Ep. 5. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 On the triumphal arch, in memory of two victories over the Dacians. </note> <lb/>

            Where in white roabes, their heads with lawrel crown'd, <lb/>

            There, for that place's greater worth and glory, <lb/>
            On arch triumphant stands that conquest's story; <lb/>
            Where Cæsar, all in gold, on chariotts rides, <lb/>
            And the huge elephants that draw them guides. <lb/>
            Such conquests meritt such a noble roome, <lb/>

            I hoped for a larger present (for presents ought either to <lb/>
            stand at the same point or to grow larger), there came two <lb/>
            pounds, more or less. The third and fourth years brought <lb/>
            still less. The fifth year produced a pound, it is true, but <lb/>
            only a Septician pound.2 In the sixth year it fell off to a <lb/>
            small cup of eight unciæ; 3 next year came half a pound of <lb/>
            silver scrapings in a little cup. The eighth year brought <lb/>
            me a ladle of scarcely two ounces; the ninth presented me <lb/>
            a little spoon, weighing less than a needle. The tenth year <lb/>
            can have nothing less to send me; return, therefore, Postu­ <lb/>

          <p>Four pounds of fine silver you sent, <lb/>

            The boon ten years since gave content, <lb/>

            Just half the four pounds, I profess. <lb/>
            The third and the fourth lessen'd still, <lb/>
            The fifth brought a pitiful pound: <lb/>
            A dish of eight ounces to fill, <lb/>
            The sixth generosity crown'd. <lb/>
            And now half a pound in a cup ; <lb/>

            Phlegræan plains, such as thy Indian triumph, 0 Bacchus, <lb/>
            would have deserved, Stella has exhibited in celebration of <lb/>

            for him. Every day brings its own gifts; there is no cessation <lb/>
            to the rich series of largesses, and many a prize falls to the <lb/>
            Jot of the people. Sometimes playful coins come down in <lb/>
            sudden showers ; sometimes a liberal ticket bestows on them <lb/>
            the animals which they have beheld in the arena. Sometimes <lb/>
            a bird delights to fill your bosom unexpectedly, or, without <lb/>
            having been exhibited, obtains a master by lot, that it may <lb/>
            not be torn to pieces. Why should I enumerate the chariots, <lb/>
            and the thirty prizes of victory, which are more than even <lb/>
            both the Consuls generally give ? But all is surpassed, Cæ­ <lb/>

          <p>As if it were but a trifling crime for our sex to bargain <lb/>
            away our male children to public lust, the very cradle had <lb/>
            become the prey of the pander, so that the child, snatched <lb/>
            from its mother's bosom, seemed to demand, by its wailing, <lb/>
            the disgraceful pay. Infants born but yesterday suffered <lb/>
            scandalous outrage. The father of Italy, who but recently <lb/>

            lust from condemning it to a manhood of sterility, could <lb/>

            The cradle proved the pander's who could buy <lb/>
            The finest victim, from the feeblest cry. <lb/>
            Against poor innocents such arts conspire <lb/>
            As shock sweet nature, and th' Ausonian sire: <lb/>
            That sire, who to the aid of youth had flown, <lb/>
            Lest savage lust should blight the hero grown. <lb/>

            the northern climes, to brave the sluggish constellations ot <lb/>
            the Getic sky: there the Promethean rocks and the fabled <lb/>
            mountains, to which you must now go, will be close to your <lb/>
            eyes! When you have beheld the rocks, the confidants of the <lb/>
            mighty plaints of old Prometheus, you will say, “ He was <lb/>
            more enduring than they." And you may add, He who <lb/>
            was able to bear such sufferings, was well qualified to fashion. <lb/>
            the race of mortals."</p>
          <p>Now thou bear'st arms under the northern pole, <lb/>
            Near which the constellations slowly roll; <lb/>
            With thy approaching eyes thou may'st behold <lb/>
            Prometheus' rock, the fabulous scene of old, <lb/>
            Where th* aged hero fill'd both earth and skies <lb/>
            With hideous exclamations and loud cries, <lb/>
            The tortures proving, which he there sustained, <lb/>
            The rock less hard to which his limbs were chain'd. <lb/>

          <p>Mamurra, after having walked long and anxiously in the <lb/>
            squares, where golden Rome ostentatiously displays her riches, <lb/>
            viewed the tender young slaves, and devoured them with his <lb/>
            eyes; not those exposed in the open shops, but those which <lb/>
            are kept for the select in private apartments, and are not seen <lb/>
            by the people, or such as I am. Satiated with this inspection, <lb/>
            he uncovers the tables square and round; and asks to see <lb/>
            some rich ivory ornaments which were displayed on the upper <lb/>
            shelves. Then, having four times measured a dinner-couch <note type="footnote"> 1 See B. vii. Ep. 97. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="424"/>
            for six, wrought with tortoise-shell, he sorrowfully regretted <lb/>
            that it was not large enough for his citron table. He con­ <lb/>
            sulted his nose whether the bronzes had the true Corinthian <lb/>
            aroma, and criticised the statues of Polyclitus! Next, com­ <lb/>
            plaining that some crystal vases had been spoiled by an ad­ <lb/>
            mixture of glass, he marked and set aside ten myrrhine caps. <lb/>
            He weighed ancient bowls, and inquired for goblets that <lb/>
            had been ennobled by the hand of Mentor. He counted <lb/>
            emeralds set in chased gold, and examined the largest pearl <lb/>
            ear-pendants. He sought on every counter for real sardo­ <lb/>
            nyxes, and cheapened some large jaspers. At last, when <lb/>
            forced by fatigue to retire at the eleventh hour, he bought <lb/>
            two cups for one small coin, and carried them home himself.</p>
          <p>Mamurra many hours does vagrant tell <lb/>
            I* th' shops, where Rome her richest ware does sell. <lb/>
            Beholds fair boys, devours them with his eyes, <lb/>
            Not those of common note, one first espies; <lb/>
            But which in inner rooms they closely mew, <lb/>
            Remov'd from mine, and from the people's view. <lb/>
            Glutted with these, choice tables he uneases, <lb/>
            Others of ivory, set high, displaces. <lb/>
            Rich tortoise beds he measures four times o'er, <lb/>
            Sighs, they fit not, and leaves them on that score. <lb/>
            Consults the statues of Corinthian brass <lb/>
            By the scent; and not without blame lets pass <lb/>
            Thy pieces, Polyclet. He next complains <lb/>
            Of crystals mix'^ with glass, and them disdains. <lb/>
            Marks porcelain cups, sets ten of them apart: <lb/>
            Weighs antique plate (of Mentor's noble art <lb/>
            If any be); counts, i' th' enamell'd gold, <lb/>
            The gems that stand. Rich pendants does behold: <lb/>
            f For the sardonyx makes a search most nice, <lb/>
            And of the biggest jaspers beats the price. <lb/>
            Tir'd now at last, after eleven hours' stay, <lb/>
            Two farthing pots he bought, and himself bore away. <lb/>

            Baskets of filligrane he then takes up ; <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>In the regions about the Tartessus, where the rich lands <lb/>
            of Cordova are watered by placid Bætis, where the yellow <lb/>
            flocks shine with the gold of the river, and living metal decks <lb/>
            the fleece of Hesperian sheep, stands a well-known mansion, <lb/>
            and in the midst of its courts, overshadowing the whole of <lb/>
            the surrounding buildings, rises the plane-tree of Cæsar, with <lb/>
            its thick foliage, which was planted by the auspicious right hand <lb/>
            of that invincible guest, and tended by it while yet a sapling. <lb/>
            This tree seems to acknowledge by its vigour its parent and <lb/>
            lord; so richly does it flourish, and lift its branches towards <lb/>
            the stars. Often, under this tree, have the playful Fauns <lb/>
             <pb n="426"/>
            sported with their midnight music, and the pipe has startled <lb/>

            which by their libations have developed its luxuriance. The <lb/>
            turf has been strewed and vermilioned with the chaplets <lb/>

            wast not planted by Pompeian hands.</p>
          <p>A well-known house doth in that country stand <lb/>

            Planted by that victorious guest, from whose <lb/>

            There roses grow t' adorne the drinking crowne; <lb/>
            And none can say those roses are his owne. <lb/>
            Great Caesar's tree, to all the gods most deare, <lb/>
            No sacrilegious fire, nor hatchets feare; <lb/>
            Still mayst thou hope honoured with leaves to bee; <lb/>

          <p>What right have you to disturb me, abominable school­ <lb/>
            master, object abhorred alike by boys and girls ? Before the <lb/>
            crested cocks have broken silence, you begin to roar out your <lb/>
            savage scoldings and blows. Not with louder noise does the <lb/>
            metal resound on the struck anvil, when the workman is <lb/>
            fitting a lawyer on his horse; 1 nor is the noise so great in <lb/>
            the large amphitheatre, when the conquering gladiator is ap­ <lb/>
            plauded by his partisans. We, your neighbours, do not ask <lb/>
            you to allow us to sleep for the whole night, for it is but a <lb/>
            small matter to be occasionally awakened; but to be kept <lb/>
            awake all night is a heavy affliction. Dismiss your scholars, <lb/>
            brawler, and take as much for keeping quiet as you receive <lb/>
            for making a noise.</p>
          <p>Despiteful pedant, why dost me pursue, <lb/>
            Thou hated head by all the younger crew ? <lb/>
            Before the cock proclaims the day is near, <lb/>
            Thy direful threats and lashes stun mine ear; <lb/>
            The anvil rings not out a shriller sound, <lb/>
            When massy hammers the hot irons pound ; <lb/>
            Statues of brass with lesser din are made, <lb/>
            Than thou dost carry on the grammar trade; <lb/>
            Shouts in the race and theatre are less, <lb/>
            When factions for their parties zeal express. <note type="footnote"> 1 A sneer at the equestrian statues of lawyers. See Juv. vii. 128. </note> <lb/>

            Whole nights, I ask not, in repose to keep; <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>"O times! 0 manners!" was of old the cry of Cicero, when <lb/>
            Catiline was contriving his impious plot; when father-in-law <lb/>
            and son-in-law were engaging in fierce war, and the sad soil <lb/>
            of Italy was soaked with civil bloodshed. But why do you, <lb/>
            Cæcilianus, now exclaim " 0 times! 0 manners ? " What is <lb/>
            it that displeases you ? We have no cruel leaders, no mad­ <lb/>
            dening warfare, but may enjoy settled peace and happiness. <lb/>
            It is not our morals, Cæcilianus, that disgrace the age of which <lb/>
            you complain, but your own.</p>
          <p>Oh! the degenerate age! great Tully cried, <lb/>
            When Catiline designed his parricide: <lb/>
            When kindred chiefs join'd battle on the plain, <lb/>
            Which mourn'd in tears of blood the subject slain. <lb/>
            Oh! the degenerate age! you loudly chatter: <lb/>
            What is the matter, Sir, what is the matter ? <lb/>
            No civil discord now: no tyrant's power: <lb/>
            Peaceful and blissful passes every hour. <lb/>
            If you esteem the age so wicked grown, <lb/>
            Blame not our morals for it, but your own. Hay,</p>
          <p>" 0 times! 0 manners!" Tully cried of old, <lb/>
            When Catiline in impious plots grew bold; <lb/>
            When in full arms the son and father stood, <lb/>
            And the sad earth reek'd red with civil blood: <lb/>
            Why now, why now, " 0 times! 0 manners!" cry ? <lb/>
            What is it now that shocks thy purity ? <lb/>
            No sword now maddens, and no chiefs destroy, <lb/>
            But all is peace, security, and joy. <lb/>
            These times, these manners, that so vile are grown, <lb/>

          <p>The features you here see are those of my Camonus ; <lb/>
            such was his face and figure in early youth. That counten­ <lb/>
            ance had grown more manly in the course of twenty years; <lb/>
            a beard seemed delighted to shade his cheeks ; and, once clip­ <lb/>
            ped, had scattered its ruddy hair from the points of the scis­ <lb/>
            sors. One of the three sisters looked with malice on such <lb/>

            An urn conveyed his ashes to his father from a far distant <lb/>

          <p>This which you see is my Camonus' face ; <lb/>
            Such his young looks, such his first beauty was. <lb/>
            His countenance grew stronger twice ten years, <lb/>
            Till a beard cream'd his cheeks with downy hairs. <lb/>
            The offer'd purple once his shoulders spread, <lb/>
            But one of the three sisters wished him dead, <lb/>
            And thence his hasten'd thread of life did cut, <lb/>
            Which to his father, in a sad urn put, <lb/>
            Came from his absent pile : but lest alone <lb/>

          <p>O Appian way, which Cæsar consecrates under the form of <lb/>
            Hercules,2 and renders the most celebrated of Italian roads, if <lb/>
            thou desirest to learn the deeds of the ancient Hercules, listen <lb/>

            golden apples; he disarmed the Amazonian queen of her <lb/>
            shield, though secured by a Scythian girdle ; by feat of arms <lb/>
            he added the lion's skin to that of the Arcadian boar; be <lb/>
            delivered the forest from the brazen-footed stag and the lakes <lb/>
            of Arcadia from the Stymphalian birds; he brought from the <lb/>
            waters of Styx the infernal dog Cerberus; he prevented the <lb/>
            fruitful Hydra from renewing its heads after they had been <lb/>
            cut off; he plunged the horned bulls of Hesperia in the Tus­ <lb/>
            can Tiber. Such were the achievements of the ancient and <lb/>
            lesser Hercules. Listen now to the deeds of the greater <lb/>
            Hercules, whom the sixth milestone from the citadel of Alba <lb/>
            celebrates. He freed the palace from the thraldom of a bad <lb/>
            rule. His first wars, as a boy, were waged in defence of his <lb/>
            patron Jupiter.1 When already in sole possession of the <lb/>
            Cæsarean reins of government, he resigned them to his father, <lb/>
            contenting himself to become the third citizen in his own <lb/>
            world.2 Thrice be broke the perfidious horns of the Sarmatian <lb/>
            Danube: thrice be cooled his sweating steed in the Getic snows. <lb/>
            Foi bearing to accept the honours of a triumph, and often re­ <lb/>
            fusing them, he acquired a title, as a conqueror, from the <lb/>
            Northern climes. He gave temples to the gods, morals to <lb/>
            his people, rest to the sword, heaven to his family,3 constel­ <lb/>
            lations to the skies, garlands to Jupiter. The divinity of a <lb/>
            Hercules is not sufficient for acts so great; our deity should <lb/>
            be represented under the form of Tarpeian Jupiter.</p>
          <p>O Appian! who thine awful shall display ? <lb/>
            Thou peerless glory of th’ Ausonian way ! <lb/>
            To Cæsar sacred, in Herculean guise, <lb/>
            Thy feet on earth, thy fame is in the skies. <lb/>
            Would'st thou admire the first Alcides' deeds, <lb/>
            And then compare Alcides who succeeds ? <lb/>
            One tamed the Libyan, and the dragon tore: <lb/>
            The victor-god the golden apples bore. » <lb/>
            How hard was buckler*d Menalippe’s lot! <lb/>
            He bid the fair unloose the Scythian knot. <lb/>
            What need I sing the lion whom he slew; <lb/>
            Or scared Arcadia's boar he overthrew ? <lb/>
            From woods he drove the brazen-footed hind, <lb/>
            The birds Stymphalian from the waves and wind. <note type="footnote"> I In the Vitellian war he took refuge in the Capitol, and defended it. <lb/>

            When now he held the Julian reins alone, <lb/>
            He sat but third upon the human throne. <lb/>
            The treach'rous horns of Ister thrice he broke, <lb/>
            In Getic snow thrice quench'd his charger's smoke. <lb/>
            To conquer ardent, and to triumph shy, <lb/>
            Fair victory nam'd him from the polar sky. <lb/>

            telling of Caesar's approach, and the spectacle of all Rome <lb/>

            Haste, festal day, when ev'ry field and tree <lb/>
            Shall laugh with verdure, and shall sing with glee; <lb/>
            When every window shall effulge new flame, <lb/>
            Fed by the lustre of the Latian dame ; <lb/>
            When fond suspense anticipates parade, <lb/>
            And the long cloud ensures the cavalcade: <lb/>
            When hailing Rome herself shall full display <lb/>
            The wondrous object on Flaminius' Way. <lb/>
            Ye prancing Moors, in pictured vest of Nile, <lb/>
            When will ye shed on all the sudden smile ? <lb/>
            When shall we hear the voice that sweetly sums <lb/>

            book, which though not learned enough or very grave, is not <lb/>

            the Esquiline hill. There you will see a glittering statue of <lb/>
            Orpheus on the top of a perfume-sprinkled theatre, surrounded <lb/>
            by beasts wondering at his music; and among them the royal <lb/>
            bird which carried off Ganvmede for the Thunderer. Near <lb/>
            it is the humble house of your friend Pedo, surmounted by <lb/>

            which bur own age and posterity may compare even with the <lb/>

            of success when the evening lamps are lighted. That hour is <lb/>
            for you the best when the god of wine reigns, when the rose <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>O delightful shore of salubrious Formiæ; Apollinaris, <lb/>
            when he flees from the city of stern Mars, and wearied lays <lb/>
            aside his anxious cares, prefers thee to every other spot. The <lb/>
            charming Tivoli, the birth-place of his virtuous wife, is not to <lb/>
            him so attractive, neither are the retreats of Tusculum, or <lb/>
            Algidus, or Præneste, or Antium. He pines not after the <lb/>
            bland Circe, or Trojan Caieta, or Marica, or Liris, or the <lb/>
            fountain of Salmacis, which feeds the Lucrine lake. At Formiæ <lb/>
            the surface of the ocean is but gently crisped by the breeze; <lb/>
            and though tranquil, is ever in motion, and bears along <lb/>
            the painted skiff under the influence of a gale as gentle as <lb/>
            that wafted by a maiden's fan when she is distressed by <lb/>
            heat. Nor has the fishing-line to seek its victim far out at <lb/>
            sea; but the fish may be seen beneath the pellucid waters, <lb/>
            seizing the line as it drops from the chamber or the couch. <lb/>
            Were AEolus ever to send a storm, the table, still sure of its <lb/>
            provision, might laugh at his railings; for the native fish-pool <lb/>
            protects the turbot and the pike ; delicate lampreys swim <lb/>
            up to their master; delicious mullet obey the call of the <lb/>
            keeper, and the old carp come forth at the sound of his voice. <lb/>
            But when does Rome permit him to partake of these enjoy­ <lb/>
            ments ? How many days at Formiæ does the year allot to <lb/>
            him, closely chained as he is to the pursuits of the city ? <lb/>
            Happy gate-keepers and bailiffs! These gratifications pro­ <lb/>
            vided for your masters, are enjoyed by you.</p>
          <p>O Bay of Formiæ, temperate and fair! <lb/>
            Which, when Apollinaris, tir'd with care, <lb/>
            Flies from the toilsome business of the town, <lb/>
            Than pleasant Tybur holds in more renown, <lb/>
            His chaste wife's soil: prefers to th' sweet recess <lb/>

            Summer's ungrateful heat. The sea is smooth, <lb/>
            Not torpid dead, but a soft gale does soothe <lb/>
            The active calm; and painted gallies move. <lb/>
            For fish you need not launch into the deep, <lb/>
            These you may take, and yet your chamber keep, <lb/>
            Out at your window cast your line and lead, <lb/>
            And draw the dangling prey up to your bed. <lb/>
            And when the waves by winter winds arise, <lb/>
            From your safe board you may the storm despise. <lb/>
            Gardens no less, and fresh springs Formiæ grace, <lb/>
            Fountains are seen to flow in ev'ry place; <lb/>
            Fish-ponds the stranger trout and mullet feed, <lb/>
            The home-bred pike, which call’d, does come with speed; <lb/>
            Fat carps here know their names, and to you make, <lb/>
            And all a pastime is, no pains, to take. <lb/>
            But to the owners when does Rome, give leave, <lb/>
            But a few days these pleasures to receive ? <lb/>
            Fruition's lost, while they to business cleave. <lb/>
            These sweets (0 hinds and gardeners, happy crew!) <lb/>

          <p>Let all maidens, who would please only one husband, read <lb/>
            Sulpicia. Let all husbands, who would please only one wife, <lb/>
            read Sulpicia. She does not describe the fury of Medea, or <lb/>
            paint the feast of the accursed Thyestes; nor does she be­ <lb/>
            lieve in the existence of Scylla or Byblis; but she tells of <lb/>
            chaste and affectionate loves, of pure sports, gratifications, <lb/>
            and amusements. He who shall properly estimate her poems, <lb/>
            will say that no one is more modest, no one more loving. <lb/>
            Such I should suppose were the endearments of Egeria in the <lb/>
            cool grotto of Numa. With Sulpicia as fellow-student, or <lb/>
            as an instructress, Sappho might have been more learned, <lb/>
            and more chaste; and had cruel Phaon seen both at the <lb/>
            same time, he would rather have fallen in love with Sul­ <lb/>
            picia. But in vain; for she would not sacrifice Calenus to <lb/>
            become either the queen of the Thunderer, or the beloved of <lb/>
            Bacchus or Apollo.</p>
          <p>Let all chaste Virgins, that would wed <lb/>
            One man alone, Sulpitia read. <lb/>
            Let all good men, that love the bed <lb/>
            Of one chaste spouse, Sulpitia read. <lb/>
            She sings not of Medea’s spells, <lb/>
            Nor dire Thyestes' banquet tells. <lb/>
            Scylla and Byblis stories lies <lb/>
            She counts ; pure loves, and chastities, <note type="footnote"> 1 By restoring to them their patrons. </note> <lb/>

            Her verse whoe'er well æstimates, <lb/>

            Such jests, I thinke, Ægeria’s were <lb/>

            Brought up with her, or taught by her, <lb/>

          <p>You are always wishing, Matho, to speak finely; speak <lb/>
            sometimes merely well; sometimes neither well nor ill; some­ <lb/>
            times even ill.'</p>
          <p>Thou finely would'st say all ? Say something well: <lb/>
            Nay, something ill, if thou would'st bear the bell. <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>The things that make life happy, dearest Martial, are these: <lb/>
            wealth not gained by labour, but inherited; lands that make <lb/>
            no ill return; a hearth always warm ; freedom from litigation; <lb/>
            little need of business costume; a quiet mind; a vigorous <lb/>
            frame; a healthy constitution; prudence without cunning; <lb/>
            friends among our equals, and social intercourse; a table <lb/>
            spread without luxury; nights, not of drunkenness, yet of <lb/>
            freedom from care; a bed, not void of connubial pleasures, <lb/>
            yet chaste; sleep, such as makes the darkness seem short: <lb/>
            contentment with our lot, and no wish for change; and <lb/>
            neither to fear death nor seek it.</p>
          <p>What makes the happiest life below, <lb/>
            A few plain rules, my friend, will show. <lb/>
            A good estate, not earn'd with toil, <lb/>
            But left by will, or giv*n by fate ; <lb/>
            A land of no ungrateful soil, <lb/>
            A constant fire within your grate : <note type="footnote">1 This Epigram is quoted by Abp. Whakely, in his Rhetoric, as a good <lb/>
            rule in composition.</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="470"/>
            No law; few cares; a quiet mind; <lb/>
            Strength unimpaired, a healthful frame; <lb/>
            Wisdom with innocence combin'd ; <lb/>
            Friends equal both in years and fame; <lb/>
            Your living easy, and your board <lb/>
            With food, but not with luxury stored <lb/>
            A bed, though chaste, not solitary ; <lb/>
            Sound sleep, to shorten night's dull reign; <lb/>
            Wish nothing that is yours to vary; <lb/>
            Think all enjoyments that remain; <lb/>
            And for the inevitable hour, <lb/>
            Nor hope it nigh, nor dread its power. Merivak.</p>
          <p>Martial, the things that do attain <lb/>
            The happy life, be these, I find: <lb/>
            The riches left, not got with pain; <lb/>
            The fruitful ground, the quiet mind: <lb/>
            The equal friend, no grudge, no strife ; <lb/>
            No charge of rule, nor governance; <lb/>
            Without disease, the healthful life; <lb/>
            The household of continuance: <lb/>
            The mean diet, no delicate fare; <lb/>
            True wisdom joined with simpleness; <lb/>
            The night discharged of all care, <lb/>
            Where wine the wit may not oppress: <lb/>
            The faithful wife, without debate; <lb/>
            Such sleeps as may beguile the night. <lb/>
            Contented with thine own estate ; <lb/>
            Ne wish for Death, ne fear his might. <lb/>
            Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey.</p>
          <p>The things that make a life to please <lb/>
            (Sweetest Martial), they are these: <lb/>
            Estate inherited, not got: <lb/>
            A thankful field, hearth always hot: <lb/>
            City seldom, law-suits never: <lb/>
            Equal friends agreeing ever: <lb/>
            Health of body, peace of mind: <lb/>
            Sleeps that till the morning bind: <lb/>
            Wise simplicity, plain fare : <lb/>
            Not drunken nights, yet loos'd from care : <lb/>
            A sober, not a sullen spouse: <lb/>
            Clean strength, not such as his that plows; <lb/>
            Wish only what thou art, to be; <lb/>
            Death neither wish, nor fear to see. <lb/>

            tid-bits such as have no need of a carver; there will be <lb/>
            haricot beans, and young cabbage sprouts. To these will <lb/>
            be added a chicken; and a ham which has already ap­ <lb/>

            pleasantry free from bitterness; there shall be no licence of <lb/>
            speech that brings repentance on the morrow, and nothing <lb/>
            said that we should wish unsaid. But my guests may <lb/>

            away! Sometimes I receive friends in the evening, to re­ <lb/>
            turn my morning calls ; others I have to congratulate on pre­ <lb/>
            ferments, though no one has to congratulate me. Sometimes <lb/>
            I am required to seal some document at the temple of the <lb/>
            lustrous Diana on Mount Aventin; sometimes the first, some­ <lb/>
            times the fifth hour, claims me for its occupations. Some­ <lb/>
            times the consul detains me, or the prætor, or the dancers as <lb/>
            they return; frequently, listening to a poet's recitation oc­ <lb/>
            cupies the entire day. Nor can I fairly refuse a few minutes <lb/>
            to a pleader, or a rhetorician, or a grammarian, should they <lb/>
            make the request. After the tenth hour, I go fatigued to <lb/>
            the bath, and to get my hundred farthings.1 What time have <lb/>

          <p>That scarce a piece I publish in a year, <lb/>

            But rather, that I write at all, admire, <lb/>
            When I am often robb'd of days entire. <lb/>
            Now with my friends the evening I must spend: <lb/>
            To those preferred my compliments must send. <lb/>
            Now at the witnessing a will make one: <lb/>
            Hurried from this to that, my morning's gone. <lb/>
            Some office must attend ; or else some ball ; <lb/>
            Or else my lawyer's summons to the hall. <lb/>
            Now a rehearsal, now a concert hear; <lb/>
            And now a Latin play at Westminster. <lb/>
            Home after ten return, quite tir'd and dos'd. <lb/>

          <p>Once upon a time Galla's demand was twenty thousand <lb/>
            sesterces; and I admit she was not much too dear at the <lb/>
            price. A year passed by: "I am yours," she said, "for ten <lb/>
            thousand sesterces." This seemed to me more than she had <lb/>
            asked before. Six months afterwards, when she came down <lb/>
            to two thousand, I offered one thousand, which she refused. <lb/>
            About two or three months later, so far from refusing this <lb/>
            sum, she herself lowered her demand to four gold pieces. I <lb/>
            declined to give it, and then she asked me to give her a hundred <lb/>
            sesterces; but even this sum seemed greatly too much. A <lb/>
            miserable sportula of a hundred farthings would then have <lb/>
            brought us together; that is, she proposed to accept it; but <lb/>
            I told her I had bestowed it on my slave. Could she descend <lb/>
            lower than this ? She did; she now offers herself for nothing; <lb/>
            but I decline.</p>
          <p>Galla, times past, ask'd me an hundred pound : <lb/>
            And 'twas not much, where such a form was found. <lb/>
            After one year, fifty was her demand : <lb/>
            Methought she now was at a dearer hand. <lb/>
            Some time lapsed: says she, Twenty you'll bestow <lb/>
            Ten I shall gladly: but she answer'd, No. <lb/>
            Two or three months, I know not which, pass'd more: <lb/>
            Then she ask'd nobles, and of them, but four, <lb/>
            And I refus'd. Well, send a hundred pence: <lb/>
            But this seem'd then too much, and I went thence. <lb/>
            She next my poor dry sportula did crave. <lb/>
            Good truth, said I, that to my boy I gave. <lb/>
            Was 't possible that she should lower go ? <lb/>

            You wonder to hear talk of a retreat, <lb/>
            And a retreat so distant as may show <lb/>
            No thoughts of a return when once I go. <lb/>
            Give me a country, how remote soe'er, <lb/>
            Where happiness a moderate rate doth bear; <lb/>
            Where poverty itself in plenty flows, <lb/>
            And all the solid use of riches knows. <lb/>
            The ground about the house maintains it there; <lb/>
            The house maintains the ground about it here. <lb/>
            Here even hunger's dear, and a full board <lb/>

            The land itself does there the feast bestow, <lb/>
            The land itself must here to market go. <lb/>
            Three or four suits one winter here does waste; <lb/>
            One suit does there three or four winters last. <lb/>
             <pb n="496"/>
            Here every frugal man must oft be cold, <lb/>
            And little luke-warm fires to you sold: <lb/>
            There fire's an element as cheap and free <lb/>
            Almost as any other of the three. <lb/>
            Stay you then here, and live among the great, <lb/>
            Attend their sports, and at their table eat; <lb/>
            When all the bounties here of men you score, <lb/>
            The place's bounty there will give you more. Cowley.</p>

            wide, but propitious, waters of the deep, and with unob­ <lb/>
            structed course, and favouring winds, reach the towers of <lb/>

            carried swiftly along, you will see the lofty Bilbilis, and <lb/>
            your dear Salo, after the fifth change of carriages. Do you <lb/>
            ask what are my commissions for you ? That, the moment <lb/>

            must not keep a vessel waiting.</p>

            as Numa had; but Numa was poor. It is an arduous task <lb/>
            to preserve morality from the corruption of riches, and to be <lb/>
            a Numa after surpassing so many Crœsuses. If the great <lb/>
            names of old, our ancient progenitors, were to return to life, <lb/>
            and liberty were granted them to leave the Elysian groves, <lb/>
            unconquered Camillus would worship you as Liberty her­ <lb/>
            self; Fabricius would consent to receive money if you <lb/>
            were to offer it; Brutus would rejoice in having you for his <lb/>
            emperor; to you the blood-thirsty Sylla would offer his <lb/>
            power when about to resign it; Pompey, in concord with <lb/>
            Cæsar, as a private citizen, would love you; Crassus would <lb/>
            bestow upon you all his wealth ; and even Cato himself, were <lb/>
            he recalled from the infernal shades of Pluto, and restored <lb/>
            to the earth, would join the party of Caesar.</p>
          <p>Thy love of right and justice, Cæsar, 's more <lb/>
            Than Numa's was, and Numa yet was poor. <lb/>
            'Tis rare, when riches cannot taint the mind, <lb/>
            In Crœsus' wealth, a Numa's soul to find. <lb/>
            If our old Romans of renowned name <lb/>
            (Dispensed with in Elisium) hither came, <lb/>
            Camillus, thee t' obey, would think it free; <lb/>
            Fabricius would take gold, if giv'n by thee; <lb/>
            In such a king Brutus would take delight j <lb/>
            Sylla, to thee resign th' imperial right; <lb/>

            pale cares, far away from hence; let us say whatever comes <lb/>

          <p>You have given me, Lupus, an estate in the suburbs, but <lb/>
            I have a larger estate on my window-sill. Can you say that <lb/>
            this is an estate,-can you call this, I say, an estate, where a <lb/>
            sprig of rue makes a grove for Diana; which the wing of the <lb/>
            chirping grasshopper is sufficient to cover; which an ant <lb/>
            could lay waste in a single day ; for which the leaf of a rose­ <lb/>
            bud would serve as a canopy; in which herbage is not <lb/>
            more easily found than Cosmus's perfumes,1 or green pepper: <lb/>
            in which a cucumber cannot lie straight, or a snake uncoil <lb/>
            itself. As a garden, it would scarcely feed a single cater­ <lb/>
            pillar ; a gnat would eat up its willow bed and starve ; a mole <lb/>
            would serve for digger and ploughman. The mushroom can­ <lb/>
            not expand in it, the fig cannot bloom, the violet cannot open. <lb/>
            A mouse would destroy the whole territory, and is as much <lb/>
            an object of terror as the Calydonian boar. My crop is car­ <lb/>
            ried off by the claws of a flying Progne, and deposited in a <lb/>
            swallow's nest; and there is not room even for the half of <lb/>
            a Priapus, though he be without his scythe and sceptre. <lb/>
            The harvest, when gathered in, scarcely fills a snail-shell; <lb/>
            and the wine may be stored up in a nut-shell stopped with <lb/>
            resin. You have made a mistake, Lupus, though only in one <lb/>

            given me a prandium.2</p>
          <p>Lupus, a farm near town you gave to me; <lb/>
            A larger plot I in my window see; <lb/>
            Such scrap of earth a farm 'twere hard to prove, <lb/>

            This, which a locust's wing might overlay! <lb/>
            Whose crops would feed an ant one single day! <lb/>

            Where not a herb can any more be found <lb/>
            Than eastern scents or fragrant spices rare, <lb/>
            To please the palate or perfume the hair; <lb/>
            Where e'en a cucumber must crooked lie ; <lb/>
            A snake to coil its tail would vainly try. <lb/>
            Such garden scarce one caterpillar feeds ; <lb/>
            The willow-bed no second insect breeds ; <lb/>
            The mole alone my farm does plough and dig; <lb/>
            No mushroom here can gape ; no early fig, <lb/>
            Nor smiling violet, here has room to grow; <lb/>
            The devastated land a mouse lays low, <lb/>
            More dreaded by the owner than of yore <lb/>
            Was that huge beast the Calydonian boar. <lb/>
            Aloft my crops are carried in the straw, <lb/>
            Caught by the flying swallow's slender claw. <lb/>
            Priapus here can scarce find room to stand, <lb/>
            Though half his size, and reft of wooden brand. <lb/>
            One snail-shell holds our yearly grain, and more; <lb/>

            You shall come to my table, but our seats shall be so far <lb/>

            Knights and patricians make them their delight, <lb/>

            Sometimes contraband silk dresses are to be bad cheap <lb/>
            sometimes a scent casket is brought to me empty. At one <lb/>
            time I am asked for an amphora of old Falernian, to reward <lb/>
            the chattering wise-woman who explains your dreams; at <lb/>
            another, your rich friend has invited herself to sup with you, <lb/>
            and I must buy you a great pike or a mullet of two pounds' <lb/>
            weight. Have some sense of decency, I entreat you, and <lb/>
            some respect for right and justice. I deny you nothing, <lb/>
            Phyllis r deny me, Phyllis, nothing.</p>
          <p>There's not an hour, my Phyllis, in the day, <lb/>
            But you contrive to make my fondness pay. <lb/>
            Your maid, an artful slut, now cries, " Alas! <lb/>
            What shall I do ? I've broke my lady's glass! <lb/>
            Then Phyllis comes herself, in tears, poor thing ! <lb/>
            And tells me she has lost her favourite ring, <lb/>
            Or dropped perchance, a diamond from her locket:— <lb/>
            Then, a new piece of silk must pick my pocket. <lb/>
            Behold her next her essence-box produce, <lb/>
            Which wants some rich perfume, or eau-de-luce, <lb/>
            Now an old hag, pretending to divine, <lb/>
            And solve her dreams, must have some old tent-wine, <lb/>
            I then for fish the market must explore, <lb/>
            Some demirep will dine with us at four. <lb/>
            But, prythee, Phyllis, pay some small regard <lb/>
            To justice, and my generous flame reward: <lb/>
            Since I refuse you nothing, how can you <lb/>
            Thus pick my pocket, and refuse me too ? <lb/>

            know how near the baths of Stephanus are to my house. <lb/>
            Lettuce will first be set before you, a plant useful as a <lb/>
            laxative, and leeks cut into shreds; next tunny-fish, full <lb/>
            grown, and larger than the slender eel, which will be garn­ <lb/>

            ties which not even Stellar except on rare occasions, is used <lb/>

          <p>When you extol death in such extravagant terms, Stoic <lb/>

            Such magnanimity arises from your possession of only a <lb/>
            pitcher with a broken handle, a cheerless hearth, warmed <lb/>
            with no fire, a mat, plenty of fleas, a bare bedstead, and a short <lb/>
            toga that serves you both night and day. How great a man <lb/>
            you are, that can think of abandoning dregs of red vinegar, <lb/>
            and straw, and black bread. But let your cushions swell <lb/>
            with Leuconian wool, and soft purple covers adorn your <lb/>
            couches; and let a favourite share your couch, who, when <lb/>
            mixing the Cæcuban wine for your guests, tortures them <lb/>
            with the ruddiest of lips, how earnestly then will you desire <lb/>
            to live thrice as long as Nestor; and study to lose no part of <lb/>
            a single day! In adversity it is easy to despise life; the <lb/>
            truly brave man is he who can endure to be miserable.</p>
          <p>That thou, Cheræmon, death dost oft desire <lb/>
            Thou would'st have us thy stoic mind admire. <lb/>
            This high resolve comes from an earelesse pot, <lb/>

            And fine french lawne adorned thy downy bed, <lb/>
            Hadst thou a girl, whose rosie lips would fire, <lb/>
            As wine she fills the lustfull guests desire: <lb/>
            Then thou to live thrice Nestor's years would'st pray, <lb/>

          <p>Let him who does not wish yet to descend to the waters ot <lb/>
            Styx, avoid, if he be wise, the barber Antiochus. The knives <lb/>
            with which, when the maddened troop of Cybele's priests <lb/>
            rage to the sound of Phrygian measures, their white arms <lb/>
            are lacerated, are less cruel than the razor of Antiochus. <lb/>
            More gently does Alcon cut a strangulated hernia, and hew <lb/>
            broken bones with his rude hand. Antiochus should deal <lb/>
            with needy Cynics, and the beards of Stoics, and denude <lb/>
            the necks of horses of their dusty manes. If he were to <lb/>
            shave Prometheus under the Scythian rock, the Titan would <lb/>
            again, with bared breast, demand his executioner the vulture. <lb/>
            Pentheus would flee to his mother, Orpheus to the priestesses <lb/>
            of Bacchus, were they to hear but a sound from the bar­ <lb/>
            barous weapon of Antiochus. All these scars, that you <lb/>
            count upon my chin, like those that sit upon the brow of an <lb/>
            aged boxer, were not produced by the nails of an enraged <lb/>
            wife, but by the steel and cursed hand of Antiochus. <lb/>
            Of all animals the goat alone has any sense; he wears his <lb/>
            beard, that he may not risk himself under the hands of <lb/>
            Antiochus.</p>
          <p>You, who wish not to die before your hour, <lb/>
            Trust not your face to barber Scrapeill's power. <lb/>
            A soldier's skin is less severely rent, <lb/>
            Who runs the gantlope through his regiment. <lb/>
            Hawkins by far cuts easier for the stone ; <lb/>
            And any surgeon sets a broken bone. <lb/>
            A barber, fit for beggars in a lane ; <lb/>
            To dock a horse's tail, or cut his mane. <lb/>
            A felon, martyr'd by such hands as these, <lb/>
            Would call upon the hangman's hand for ease. <lb/>
            Debtors for refuge would to bailiffs fly, <lb/>
            And tars to press-gangs, when his razor's nigh. <lb/>
            Look on these scars ! how movingly they speak! <lb/>
            And seem as I were burnt in either cheek! <lb/>
            Not of an angry wife they records stand; <lb/>
            But Scrapeill's razor, and his bungling hand. <lb/>
            A goat is wisest of the brutish herd ; <lb/>
            Who, to avoid a Scrapeill, wears his beard. Hay.</p>

            without consolation and without excuse. Listen then to my <lb/>

            miss the audience to which I had grown accustomed at Rome, <lb/>

            there be anything pleasing in my books it is due to my <lb/>

            ings, in which pleasure does not perceive that it is <lb/>
            studying; everything, in a word, which we left behind us <lb/>
            in satiety, we regret as though utterly deserted. Add to <lb/>
            this the backbiting of the provincials, envy usurping the place <lb/>
            of criticism, and one or two ill-disposed persons, who, in a <lb/>
            small society, are a host ; circumstances under which <lb/>
            it is difficult to be always in the best of humours. Do <lb/>

          <p>Everything that glittered in the Parrhasian1 palace has <lb/>
            been given to our gods and to the eyes of all. Jupiter <lb/>
            wonders at the Scythian radiance of the emeralds2 set in <lb/>
            gold, and is amazed at the objects of imperial magnificence,3 <lb/>
            and at luxuries so oppressive to the nation. Here are cups <lb/>
            fit for the Thunderer; there for his Phrygian favourite.4 We <lb/>
            all now rejoice with Jupiter. But very lately (and with <lb/>
            shame, yes, with shame I confess it) we were all poor as well <lb/>
            as Jupiter.</p>
          <p>Whatever shined in the Parrhasian hall <lb/>
            Is to our eyes and to our gods giv'n all ; <lb/>
            Jupiter stands and wonders to behold <lb/>
            Himself in Scythian flames of sparkling gold ; <lb/>
            Great Caesar's pleasant pride, and vast expense. <lb/>
            These cups may suit with Jove's magnificence, <lb/>

            Now all with Jove are rich and clad with joy. <lb/>

            boar, with you. It is often inebriated with Setine, and often <lb/>
            with Falernian wine ; nor does it quaff Cæcuban unless it be <lb/>
            mixed with snow water. It reclines with you, decked with <lb/>
            roses, and darkened with amomum ; and sleeps with you on <lb/>

          <p>Your fever still attends you, though you grieve; <lb/>

            thirty years. The toga here is unknown, but the nearest <lb/>
            dress is given me, when I ask for it, from an old press. When <lb/>

          <p>O carriage, that affordest a sweet solitude!—Grift of my <lb/>
            eloquent friend Ælianus, more pleasant than open curricle or <lb/>
            chariot! Here, Juvatus, you may say to me whatever comes <lb/>
            into your head. No black driver of a Libyan horse, no well­ <lb/>
            girt running footman in front of us, no muleteer alongside; <lb/>
            and the horses will not babble. Would that Avitus were <lb/>

            'Tis Pleadwell's present: for my age, <lb/>
            There is no better equipage. <lb/>
            Now with thy master, Ball, be free; <lb/>
            And say whatever you please to me. <lb/>
            No master of the horse have I, <lb/>
            Or groom or running footman by. <lb/>
            And though your curb and harness rattle, <lb/>
            The devil's in it, if they tattle. <lb/>
            Would that my honest friend Ned Hearty <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>When you, a senator, go about knocking at sixty doors <lb/>
            every morning, I appear in your estimation but a slothful <lb/>
            knight, for not running all over the city from the first dawn <lb/>
            of day, and bringing home, fatigued and worn out, some <lb/>

            new name to the Fasti, or that you may be sent as governor <lb/>
            to the Numidians or Cappadocians; while, as to me, whom <lb/>
            you persuade to break my slumbers unseasonably, and en­ <lb/>
            dure the morning mud, what have I to expect ? When my <lb/>
            foot bursts out from my torn shoe, when a pelting shower of <lb/>
            rain has suddenly drenched me, and when, on taking off my <lb/>
            outer-coat, no servant answers my call, your slave comes up <lb/>
            to my chilly ear, and says, " Lsetorius requests your company <lb/>
            at dinner." What, at a dinner of which my share is worth <lb/>
            twenty sesterces ? Not I. I prefer my own scanty fare, <lb/>
            rather than have a dinner for my reward, while yours is a <lb/>

            And kiss each voter'is wife throughout the town <lb/>
            By this you may gain credit in the nation ; <lb/>
            Or be made governor of some plantation. <lb/>
            But as for me, what end can I obtain ? <lb/>

          <p>Hermogenes, it seems to me, Ponticus, is as great a thief <lb/>
            of napkins as Massa was of money. Even though you watch <lb/>
            his right hand, and hold his left, he will find means to ab­ <lb/>
            stract your napkin. With like subtilty does the breath of <lb/>
            the stag draw out the cold snake;1 and the rainbow exhale <lb/>
            the waters from the clouds. Lately, while a respite was im­ <lb/>
            plored for Myrinus,2 who had been wounded in a conflict, <lb/>
            Hermogenes contrived to filch four napkins. Just as the <lb/>
            prætor was going to drop his white napkin, to start the horses <lb/>
            in the circus, Hermogenes stole it. When at last nobody <lb/>
            brought a napkin with him, for fear of thefts, Hermogenes stole <lb/>
            the cloth from the table. And should there be nothing of this <lb/>
            kind to steal, Hermogenes does not hesitate to detach the <lb/>
            ornaments from the couches,3 or the feet from the tables. <note type="footnote"> 1 Stags were said to draw serpents from their hiding-places, kill them <lb/>
            with their horns, and then devour them. See Plin. H. N. xi. 83; Ælian. <lb/>

            sails whenever Hermogenes shows himself in the harbour. <lb/>
            The bareheaded priests of Isis, clad in linen vestments, <lb/>
            and the choristers who play the sistrum, betake themselves <lb/>
            to flight when Hermogenes comes to worship. Hermogenes <lb/>

            two years' rent, were carried away by your wife, distinguish­ <lb/>
            able by her seven carroty hairs, your hoary-headed mother, <lb/>
            and your giantess of a sister. I thought at first they were <lb/>
            Furies emerging from the shades of Pluto. They went be­ <lb/>
            fore, while you, wasted with cold and hunger, and paler than <lb/>

            People might have thought that the Aricine Hill was migrat­ <lb/>

            footed table, a lamp, a horn cup, and a cracked chamber­ <lb/>
            pot, leaking through its side. Close to these was a rusty <lb/>

          <p>When recently a miserable bow-legged slave used to carry <lb/>
            Aper's linen to the bath for him, and a one-eyed old woman <lb/>
            sat on his paltry toga to guard it, while a herniose bathing <lb/>
            man supplied him with his drop of oil, he used to be a severe <lb/>
            and unsparing censor of drunkards. " Break your cups, and <lb/>
            throw away your Falernian," he would exclaim to any knight <lb/>
            who drank anything on leaving the bath. But since three <lb/>
            hundred thousand sesterces came to him from his old uncle, <lb/>
            he cannot go home from the warm baths sober. Oh what <lb/>
            power jewelled cups and a retinue of five long-haired servants <lb/>

          <p>WHEN asked what are my employments while living in <lb/>
            the country, I answer briefly thus : At dawn I address my <lb/>
            prayer to the gods; I visit my slaves and my fields, and <lb/>
            allot to my people each his due portion of work. Then I <lb/>
            read, and invoke Phœbus, and solicit the Muses. Next I <lb/>
            anoint myself with olive oil, and take gentle exercise in the <lb/>
            palæstra; at peace in mind, and free from interest-bearing <lb/>
            debts. Then I dine, drink, sing, play, bathe, sup, and go to <lb/>
            bed; while my little lamp consumes its modicum of oil, <lb/>
            and furnishes these trifles elaborated by the aid of the <lb/>
            muses at night.</p>
          <p>When to my farm retired, how I do live <lb/>
            If any ask, this short account I give: <lb/>
            The gods at the first light I do adore; <lb/>
            And place this care, all other cares before. <lb/>
            My grounds I visit then, and servants call, <lb/>
            And their just tasks I do impose on all. <lb/>
            I study next, rouse my poetic vein, <lb/>
            My body then anoint, and gently strain <lb/>
            With some meet exercise; exult in mind <lb/>
            At every turn, myself both free to find <lb/>

          <p>Varus happened lately to ask me to supper; the appoint­ <lb/>
            ments were splendid, the supper itself was paltry. The table <lb/>
            was laden with golden dishes, not with meats ; the servants <lb/>
            placed before us plenty to delight the eye, but very little to <lb/>
            satisfy the appetite. I then observed : " I came to feed, not <lb/>
            my eyes, but my stomach; either place food before me, <lb/>
            Varus, or take away your rich service."</p>
          <p>Varus did lately me to supper call, <lb/>
            The table sumptuous was, the supper small; <lb/>
            Loaden it was with weight of gold, not meat; <lb/>
            Much to be seen was served, little to eat; <lb/>
            Varus, our mouths, not eyes, to feast we're here; <lb/>
            Take hence thy plate, or fill 't with better cheer. <lb/>

            the lowest rank, but that she should assign to me the middle <lb/>
            walk of life. Envy besets those in high places, oppression <lb/>
            those who are needy; how happy does he live, who is free <lb/>
