          <p>IN giving to the public this translation of the Nicoma­ <lb/>
            enean Ethics of Aristotle, the Translator acknowledges the <lb/>
            obligations he is under to former versions. He has not <lb/>
            hesitated to adopt such portions of them as appeared to <lb/>
            him to convey accurately the meaning of the author, whilst <lb/>
            he has entirely retranslated such as he thought failed in this <lb/>
            respect. Every passage, however, has been in all cases care­ <lb/>
            fully compared with the original. The text generally fol­ <lb/>
            lowed has been that of Cardwell, but Bekker's has been <lb/>
            also consulted, and his readings adopted wherever they <lb/>
            appeared preferable.</p>
          <p>The notes are partly original, partly selected. It has been <lb/>
            the object of the Translator not to overburthen the text <lb/>
            with them, but only to give as many as he thought necessary <lb/>
            to render the subject intelligible, and to explain or illus­ <lb/>
            trate such difficulties as were incapable of being removed <lb/>
            by translation. The Analysis and Questions, which are <lb/>
            added, were thought likely to be a valuable assistance tc <lb/>
            the student.</p>
          <p>It is hoped that this work will be found useful to that <lb/>
            numerous class of readers who, though unacquainted with <lb/>
            the language of ancient Greece, are anxious to study the <lb/>
            works of the best writers of antiquity in, as nearly as <lb/>
            possible, their own words.</p>
          <p>For such further information as is not contained in the <lb/>
            notes, the reader is referred to the commentaries of Michelet <note type="footnote"> a </note> <lb/>

            the notes of Cardwell, the edition of the eighth and ninth <lb/>
            books by Fritzsch, Brewer's edition of the Ethics, Blakesley's <lb/>
            Life of Aristotle, the philosophical articles in the Encyclo­ <lb/>
            pædia Metropolitana, Whateley's Logic, and Ritter's History <lb/>
            of Philosophy,a in which latter work will be found an able <lb/>
            and lucid analysis of the Ethics of Aristotle, as well as a <lb/>
            complete investigation of all the systems of the ancient <lb/>
            philosophers. The ingenious and able defence of the sophists <lb/>
            in the eighth volume of Grote's History of Greece may <lb/>
            be advantageously studied with reference to the bearing of <lb/>
            their doctrines on the subject of ethical philosophy. <note type="footnote"> a Translated by A. J. W. Morriton. </note> <pb n="v"/>

          </head>
          <p>ETHICS, according to the theory of Aristotle, formed but a <lb/>
            subdivision of the great and comprehensive science of poli­ <lb/>
            tics. Man is a political or social being; that science, there­ <lb/>
            fore, which professed to investigate the subject of human <lb/>
            good, would study the nature of man, not only as an indi­ <lb/>
            vidual, but also in his relation to his fellows, as a member <lb/>
            of a family, and as a member of a state, or political com­ <lb/>
            munity.</p>
          <p>Aristotle, therefore, following out this view, divides poli­ <lb/>
            tics into three parts : Ethics, Economics, and Politics strictly <lb/>
            so called. Ethics, therefore, or the science of individual <lb/>
            good, must be the ground-work of the rest; families and <lb/>
            states are composed of individuals; unless, therefore, the <lb/>
            parts be good, the whole cannot be perfect. The develop­ <lb/>
            ment, therefore, of the principles of man's moral nature <lb/>
            must necessarily precede, and be an introduction to an <lb/>
            investigation of the principles of human society. This is the <lb/>
            place which ethical science occupies in Aristotle's system : <lb/>
            it is the introduction to politics, or the science of social <lb/>
            life.</p>
          <p>It is plain, from these considerations, that ethics, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to Aristotle, form a subdivision of a great practical <lb/>
            subject; he does not therefore consider it necessary to <lb/>
            examine into the abstract nature of good, but only to pursue <lb/>
            the investigation so far as it relates to man. So utterly <lb/>
            unconnected with his subject does he consider any ideal or <lb/>
            absolute standard of good, that he even denies that the <lb/>
            knowledge or contemplation of it can be in any way useful <lb/>
            to the study of that good which falls within the province of <lb/>
            human nature, and is therefore attainable by man. In this, <lb/>
            as well as in many other respects, the pra- tical nature of his <note type="footnote"> a2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="vi"/>
            mind is strongly contrasted with the poetical idealism of his <lb/>
            great master Plato.</p>
          <p>The foundation of Aristotle's system of ethics is deeply <lb/>
            laid in his psychological system. On the nature of the <lb/>
            human soul the whole fabric is built up, and depends for its <lb/>
            support. According to our author, we are born with a <lb/>
            natural capacity for receiving virtuous impressions, and for <lb/>
            forming virtuous habits : and his conception of the nature <lb/>
            of this capacity is so high a one, that he does not hesitate <lb/>
            to term it “ natural virtue." We are endowed with a moral <lb/>
            sense (<foreign xml:lang="grc">αἴσθησις</foreign>), a perception of moral beauty and excellence, <lb/>
            and with an acuteness on practical subjects (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δεινότης</foreign>), which, <lb/>
            when cultivated, is improved into <foreign xml:lang="grc">φρόνησις</foreign> (prudence or moral <lb/>
            wisdom). From all these considerations, therefore, it is plain <lb/>
            that, according to Aristotle, virtue is the law under which <lb/>
            we are born, the law of nature, that law which, if we would <lb/>
            attain to happiness, we are bound to fulfil. Happiness, <lb/>
            in its highest and purest sense, is our "being's end and <lb/>
            aim and this is an energy or activity of the soul according <lb/>
            to the law of virtue : an energy of the purest of the capacities <lb/>
            of. the soul, of that capacity which is proper and peculiar to <lb/>
            man alone ; namely, intellect or reason. Designed, then, as <lb/>
            man is for virtuous energies, endowed with capacities for <lb/>
            moral action, with a natural taste and appreciation for that <lb/>
            which is morally beautiful, with a natural disposition or <lb/>
            instinct, as it were, to good acts; virtue, and therefore <lb/>
            happiness, becomes possible and attainable. Had this not <lb/>
            been the case, all moral instruction would be useless. That <lb/>
            for which nature had not given man a capacity would have <lb/>
            been beyond his reach ; for that which exists by nature can <lb/>
            never by custom be made to be otherwise.</p>
          <p>But this natural disposition or bias is, according to Axis­ <lb/>
            totle, a mere potentiality; it is possessed, but not active, <lb/>
            not energizing. It is necessary that it should be directed by <lb/>
            he will, and that the will in its turn should be directed to <lb/>
            a right end by deliberate preference; i. e. by moral prin- <lb/>
            PIle. From his belief in the existence of this natural <lb/>
            capacity, and this bias or inclination towards virtue, and <lb/>
            oreover from his believing that man was a free and <lb/>
            voluntary agent, Aristotle necessarily holds the responsibility <lb/>
            of man. Man has power over his individual actions to dc <lb/>
             <pb n="vii"/>
            for to abstain. By repeated acts, habits are formed either of <lb/>
            virtue or vice ; and, therefore, for his whole character when <lb/>
            formed, as well as for each act which contributes to its <lb/>
            formation, man is responsible. Not that men have always <lb/>
            power over their acts, when their character is formed; but <lb/>
            what he contends for is, that they have power over them <lb/>
            whilst their moral character is in process of formation; <lb/>
            and that, therefore, they must, in all reason, be held respon­ <lb/>
            sible for the permanent effects which their conduct in par­ <lb/>
            ticular acts has produced, and which they must at every <lb/>
            step have seen gradually resulting.</p>
          <p>What then is virtue ? In the solution of that part of <lb/>
            this question which has not already been answered, the <lb/>
            practical nature of Aristotle's mind is exhibited in an <lb/>
            eminent degree. It has been seen that it is a habit, that <lb/>
            it is based upon the natural capacities of the human soul, <lb/>
            that it is formed and established by a voluntary agent <lb/>
            acting under the guidance of deliberate preference or moral <lb/>
            principle. But to these conditions it is also necessary to <lb/>
            add, what is the end or object at which the habit is to aim.</p>
          <p>Experience, then, that great practical guide in human <lb/>
            affairs, teaches us what that end is. An induction of <lb/>
            instances shows that it is a mean between excess and defect; <lb/>
            not, indeed, an absolute mean, but a relative one; that is, <lb/>
            one relative to the internal moral constitution, and to the <lb/>
            external circumstances and condition, of the moral agents. <lb/>
            Of this relative mean, each man must judge for himself'by <lb/>
            the light of his conscience, and his moral sense, purified by <lb/>
            moral discipline, and enlightened by education. The moral <lb/>
            philosopher can only lay down general principles-for man's <lb/>
            guidance, and each individual man mustdo the rest. The <lb/>
            casuist may profess to be more particular, he may profess to <lb/>
            lay down accurate special rules of conduct, which will meet <lb/>
            every individual case, but his professions will be unfulfilled : <lb/>
            he will, from the very nature of the subject, which, being a <lb/>
            moral one, will not admit of mathematical exactness, fail of <lb/>
            making morals a definite and exact science. There must, <lb/>
            and will always be, roon left for the moral sense and prac­ <lb/>
            tical wisdom of each individual, to exercise in each case of <lb/>
            moral action its judicial-functions. If, in this cie, or in <lb/>
            any other, you deal with men in this way, you are dealing <lb/>
             <pb n="viii"/>
            with them as children; and, therefore, according to Aris­ <lb/>
            totle's views, as being incapable of perfect moral action.</p>
          <p>The discussion of these virtues or mean states, both moral <lb/>
            and intellectual, forms, it will be found, a very important <lb/>
            portion of this treatise. We shall find, amongst them, <lb/>
            many virtues which belong to man in his political rather <lb/>
            than in his individual character :—magnificence, that virtue <lb/>
            of the rich, which to an Athenian mind appeared nearly <lb/>
            akin to patriotism :-the social qualities, which we should <lb/>
            scarcely in these days formally elevate into the rank of <lb/>
            virtues, but which, nevertheless, practically, we value almost <lb/>
            as highly, and which contribute so much to the happiness of <lb/>
            every-day life :—justice, not only that universal justice which <lb/>
            implies the doing to every one according to the laws of God <lb/>
            and man, and therefore is synonymous with virtue, but also <lb/>
            that particular virtue which is more especially exercised by <lb/>
            one who is intrusted by the constitution of his country with <lb/>
            administrative or executive authority:-and, lastly, friend­ <lb/>
            ship, that law of sympathy, and concord, and love between <lb/>
            the good and virtuous, clearly and inseparably connected with <lb/>
            —nay, based upon, originating in, and springing out of-a <lb/>
            reasonable self-love, which is not, indeed, strictly speaking, a <lb/>
            virtue, but indispensable to virtue and human happiness.</p>
          <p>Friendship is a subject on which the mind of Greece <lb/>
            especially loved to dwell. It pervades many of her historical <lb/>
            and poetical traditions ; it is interwoven with many of her <lb/>
            best institutions, her holiest recollections. In one of its <lb/>
            forms, that of hospitality, it was the bond which united <lb/>
            Greeks in one vast family, as it were, even in times of bitter <lb/>
            hostility. No Greek, therefore, could have considered that a <lb/>
            moral philosopher had fully accomplished his task, and <lb/>
            finished his work, if the discussion of this subject had not <lb/>
            formed part of his treatise. And when we find that Aris­ <lb/>
            totle places friendship so high, as to say that its existence <lb/>
            would supersede and render unnecessary even justice, and <lb/>
            that the true friend loves his friend for that friend's sake, <lb/>
            and for that motive alone, it seems to approach in some <lb/>
            degree to the Christian rule of charity, which teaches us to <lb/>
            love our neighbour as ourselves,-to that love which, based on <lb/>
            principle, and not merely on instinct, is on divine authority <lb/>
            said to be “the fulfilling of the law."</p><pb n="ix"/>
            
          <p>In the practical consideration of each individual virtue, <lb/>
            Aristotle necessarily treats of moral and intellectual virtue <lb/>
            separately from each other; but we must not suppose, for <lb/>
            that reason, that he thought they could exist separately. <lb/>
            According to his view, moral virtue implies the due regula­ <lb/>
            tion of our moral nature, with all its appetites, instincts, and <lb/>
            passions; and this state only exists when they are subordi­ <lb/>
            nate to the dominion and control of the reasoning faculties. <lb/>
            Again, the reason does not act with all the vigour of which <lb/>
            it is naturally capable, unless our moral nature is in a well- <lb/>
            regulated state. Hence the different parts of human nature <lb/>
            reciprocally act and react upon each other, every good reso­ <lb/>
            lution carried into effect, every act of self-control and moral <lb/>
            discipline, increases the vigour of the pure reason, and renders <lb/>
            the highest faculty of our nature more and more able to <lb/>
            perform its work. Again, the more powerful the reason <lb/>
            becomes, the fewer external obstacles, such as vice presents <lb/>
            to its energies, the intellect meets with, the more effectually <lb/>
            does it influence the moral nature, and strengthen, confirm, <lb/>
            and render permanent the moral habits. Thus continence is <lb/>
            gradually improved into temperance; and if human nature <lb/>
            were capable of attaining perfection, man would attain to <lb/>
            that ideal standard which Aristotle terms heroic virtue.</p>
          <p>But this is above human nature, and is impossible to <lb/>
            attain, just as its opposite, brutality, is never found, so long <lb/>
            as human nature continues in its normal condition, but only <lb/>
            in cases where bodily mutilation, or moral perversion, or the <lb/>
            influence of barbarism, has so far degraded the human being, <lb/>
            that he may be considered as having entirely ceased to be <lb/>
            a man.</p>
          <p>There is another important subject connected with morals <lb/>
            of which it was absolutely necessary for Aristotle to treat <lb/>
            fully. Pleasure, as a motive to action, had been so inter­ <lb/>
            woven with other philosophical systems, that the disciple of <lb/>
            the Aristotelian ethical philosophy could not be content with­ <lb/>
            out the place which it ought to occupy being accurately <lb/>
            defined. Pleasure, then, had been held by Plato and others <lb/>
            to be a motion or a generation, and therefore of a transitory <lb/>
            or transient nature : this Aristotle denies, and affirms it to <lb/>
            be a whole, indivisible, complete, perfect, giving a perfection, <lb/>
            a finish, as it were, to an energy ; being, as he says in order <lb/>

            to illustrate its nature, what the bloom is to youth. But if <lb/>
            so, pleasure must be active, energetic; it cannot be simply <lb/>
            rest: and yet the testimony of mankind, if we observe what <lb/>
            they propose to themselves as pleasure, would be in favour <lb/>
            of the notion of its being rest, in some sense or other. How, <lb/>
            then, were these apparent inconsistencies to be reconciled ? <lb/>
            In the following manner. It is rest as regards the body, <lb/>
            but energy as regards the mind. It is an activity of the <lb/>
            soul-not a mere animal activity. This distinction enables <lb/>
            us to mark the difference between true and false pleasures. <lb/>
            Those which are consequent upon the mere activity of our <lb/>
            corporeal nature are low and unreal; those which attend <lb/>
            upon the energies of our intellectual nature are true and <lb/>
            perfect, and worthy of the dignity of man.</p>
          <p>But as happiness is an energy or activity of the soul <lb/>
            according to its highest excellence, and that this must be <lb/>
            that which is the characteristic property of man, namely, <lb/>
            pure intellectual excellence, it is evident that contemplative <lb/>
            happiness is superior to every other kind, and constitutes the <lb/>
            chief good of man. Although happiness must be sought for <lb/>
            and arrived at by the formation of habits of practical virtue, <lb/>
            still all other virtues must be pursued with a view to the <lb/>
            final gratification of our intellectual nature ; the end of the <lb/>
            cultivation of all virtue is to fit us for the pure and unmixed <lb/>
            enjoyment of contemplation. Contemplative enjoyment is <lb/>
            the most perfect, most permanent, and most independent of <lb/>
            external helps and appliances.</p>
          <p>If, then, after all that has been said respecting moral <lb/>
            practical virtue, contemplation is the end and object of man, <lb/>
            his chief good, his highest happiness, why has Aristotle said <lb/>
            so much of the practical nature of human happiness ? why <lb/>
            has he attributed so much importance to the formation of <lb/>
            the moral character ? why has he left the subject of contem­ <lb/>
            plative happiness to be briefly discussed at the very conclu­ <lb/>
            sion of his treatise ?</p>
          <p>The answer to these questions is plain. Until the moral <lb/>
            character is formed, man is unfit, not only for the enjoyment, <lb/>
            but also for forming a correct conception and appreciation of <lb/>
            the happiness which is derived from contemplation. Place <lb/>
            before his eyes in the commencement of his search after <lb/>
            Happiness intellectual contemplation, as the end at which he <lb/>
             <pb n="xi"/>
            is aiming, and he would neither be able to understand its <lb/>
            nature, nor estimate its value. It is by the gradual perfec­ <lb/>
            tion of our moral nature, and by this method only, that we <lb/>
            are brought into that state in which the intellectual principle <lb/>
            is able to act purely and uninterruptedly. The improvement <lb/>
            of our moral and intellectual faculties will go on parallel to <lb/>
            one another. Every evil habit conquered, every good habit <lb/>
            formed, will remove an obstacle to the energy of the intellect, <lb/>
            and assist in invigorating its -nat'Lire. Begin with contem­ <lb/>
            plation, and we shall neither find subjects for it, of a nature <lb/>
            sufficiently exalted to insure real happiness, nor be in a <lb/>
            condition to derive happiness from such subjects, if suggested <lb/>
            to us. Begin with moral training, and we shall attain to <lb/>
            higher capacities for intellectual happiness, whether derived <lb/>
            from the contemplation of abstract truth, or of the perfec­ <lb/>
            tions and attributes of the Deity.a The Christian philoso­ <lb/>
            pher will easily understand the value of this method of <lb/>
            teaching ; for he knows that it is revealed to us, that in <lb/>
            divine things moral training is the way to intellectual culti­ <lb/>
            vation, that the heart is the way to the understanding—“ If <lb/>
            any man will do God's will, he shall know of the doctrine <lb/>
            whether it be of God." (St. John vii. 17.) It is plain that, <lb/>
            in this respect, the way which the heathen moralist has <lb/>
            pointed out to the attainment of happiness is that which is <lb/>
            most in accordance with the principles of human nature, <lb/>
            and therefore with the laws of Him who is both the author <lb/>
            of revelation, and of the moral constitution of man.</p>
          <p>It only remains now to point out how Aristotle connects <lb/>
            the subject of ethics with that of which he considers it a <lb/>
            subordinate division ; namely, politics. The idea of a state <lb/>
            implies a human society united together upon just, moral, <lb/>
            and reasonable principles. These principles are developed <lb/>
            and displayed in its institutions; its end and object is the <lb/>
            greatest good of the body corporate ; and, therefore, so far <lb/>
            as it can be attained consistently with this primary end, the <lb/>
            greatest good of each family and individual. Now, on the <lb/>
            morality of the individual members, the morality, and there­ <note type="footnote"> a We may see from this how far the Aristotelian theory of happiness <lb/>
            and man's highest good harmonizes with that of Plato, and, at the same <lb/>
            time, how far more practical is the method which Aristotle recommends <lb/>
            for the attainment of it. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="xii"/>
            fore the welfare and happiness, of the body depends ; for as <lb/>
            in a state, i. e. a free state, the source of power is ultimately <lb/>
            the people, on the moral tone of the people, the character of <lb/>
            the institutions framed by their representatives must depend. <lb/>
            Hence a state must recognize the moral culture and educa­ <lb/>
            tion of the people as a duty. Private systems of education <lb/>
            may, doubtless, possess some advantages, such as their superior <lb/>
            capability of being moulded and adapted to the particular <lb/>
            circumstances of individual cases, but still they are inferior <lb/>
            to a public one, in uniformity, in the power of enforcing their <lb/>
            authority, and in producing great and extensive results. <lb/>
            As, therefore, the elements of moral virtue must be incul­ <lb/>
            cated and implanted by moral education, the individual has <lb/>
            a right to demand that provision be made for this by well- <lb/>
            regulated public institutions, and, in order to attain such <lb/>
            institutions, the science of politics or social life must be <lb/>
            investigated or systematized. But besides, in order even to <lb/>
            secure the advantages of private education, whatever these <lb/>
            advantages may be, it is necessary that every one who would <lb/>
            conduct and administer such a system efficiently should study <lb/>
            the general political principles of education, and thus endea­ <lb/>
            vour to fit himself for legislating respecting them. On all <lb/>
            accounts, therefore, the study of morals is not complete, <lb/>
            unless that of politics is superadded, and the latter study <lb/>
            should be pursued, not only by the statesman, but by the <lb/>
            private citizen.</p>
          <p>The above general outline of Aristotle's ethical system, <lb/>
            in which the several parts are designedly not presented to <lb/>
            the view in the order in which he has treated them, but <lb/>
            displayed in their relative bearings upon each other, will, it <lb/>
            is hoped, be sufficient to prepare the mind of the student <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>Introductory.—A question lies at the very threshold of <lb/>
            the investigation ; namely, whether there is any chief good <lb/>
            (summwm bonum), and if there is, whether it be, or can be <lb/>
            brought within the reach of the capacities of man. Having <lb/>
            answered these questions in the affirmative, Aristotle pro­ <lb/>
            ceeds to show what its nature and essence is. That all, or <lb/>
            nearly all, agree in calling it happiness, is clear; but this is <lb/>
            not enough; it must be defined, its properties analyzed, its <lb/>
            nature explained. After, therefore, examining and seating <lb/>
            what opinions have been generally held respecting it, as <lb/>
            well popularly as by philosophers, he proceeds to define and <lb/>
            explain his own idea respecting it, and to defend the accu­ <lb/>
            racy of his views by comparing it with those of others. <lb/>
            Certain questions arising out of the method of discussion <lb/>
            which he has pursued, but of no practical importance, <lb/>
            such, for example, as the well-known saying of Solon, are <lb/>
            briefly alluded to ; and respecting them he comes to no <lb/>
            very satisfactory conclusion. And, lastly, the theory which <lb/>
            he has adopted leads him to state, in a few words, the <lb/>
            general principles of man's psychical constitution.</p>
          <p>I.—1. Every art, system, course of action, and deliberate <lb/>
            preference, aims at some good.</p>
          <p>Hence the good is defined “ that which all aim at."</p>
          <p>2. There are differences of ends; namely, energies and <lb/>
            works.</p>
          <p>3, 4. The ends of the master-arts are more eligible than <lb/>
            the ends of those subordinate to them.</p>
          <p>5 This is the case, even though the end of the master­ <lb/>
            art is an energy, and that of the subordinate art a work.</p>
          <p>II.—1. There is some end of human action which is <lb/>
            desired for its own sake.</p>
          <p>3, 4, 5. It is the end of that which is the master-science <lb/>
            in the highest sense ; i. e. the political.</p>
          <p>The political science proved to be the chief science by <lb/>
            several reasons and examples.</p>
          <p>2. The knowledge of the end useful.</p><pb n="xiv"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK 1"/> G. The subject of ' the end " belongs to moral, and there' <lb/>
            fore to political philosophy.</p>
          <p>III.—1, 2. We must not expect too great accuracy in <lb/>
            subjects of moral investigation.</p>
          <p>3. These subjects having to do with contingent matter, <lb/>
            the conclusions arrived at must be of the same kind.</p>
          <p>4, 5. The student, therefore, must be one who is willing <lb/>
            to be content with this method of proof, and therefore must <lb/>
            be an educated person.</p>
          <p>6. He must, therefore, not be young, because the young <lb/>
            are inexperienced in the affairs of life.</p>
          <p>7. By the word young is meant young in character.</p>
          <p>6. The object of this treatise is not knowledge, but <lb/>
            practice.</p>
          <p>IV.—1. What is the aim of the political science, and the <lb/>
            highest of all good ?</p>
          <p>2. All agree in calling it happiness, but differ as to its <lb/>
            definition.</p>
          <p>3, 4. Popular and philosophical theories on the subject <lb/>
            are at variance.</p>
          <p>Certain notions respecting it, including that of the " idea, <lb/>
            enumerated.</p>
          <p>4. Aristotle proposes to consider the most reasonable.</p>
          <p>5, 6. Of the two methods of arguing; namely,-The <lb/>
            synthetical and analytical; Aristotle chooses the latter, for <lb/>
            the following reasons :—</p>
          <p>G. Things are known in two ways: (1.) Absolutely; <lb/>
            (2.) Relatively to ourselves.</p>
          <p>In morals we must begin with the things known to our­ <lb/>
            selves ; i. e. the phenomena, and work backwards from facts <lb/>
            to causes ; sometimes it is even sufficient to know the facts <lb/>
            without the causes.</p>
          <p>7. The student of ethics should listen to the advice oi <lb/>
            Ilesiod.</p>
          <p>V.—1. The majority derive their notions respecting hap­ <lb/>
            piness from the lives they lead.</p>
          <p>2. These are four:—(1.) The vulgar. (2.) The active. <lb/>
            (3.) The contemplative. (4.) The money-getting.</p>
          <p>3. The vulgar consider that happiness consists in sensual <lb/>
            pleasure.</p>
          <p>This is the life of the brute creation.</p><pb n="xv"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. VI.]"/> 4, 5. The active think happiness is honourable distinction. <lb/>
            This is not the chief good,</p>
          <p>(1.) Because it resides in the honourers rather than in <lb/>
            the honoured.</p>
          <p>(2.) Because it is sought for the sake of virtue.</p>
          <p>6. Is virtue then the chief good ? <lb/>
            No, for a man may possess virtue, and yet not live an <lb/>
            active life.</p>
          <p>7. The contemplative life is omitted, and reserved for the <lb/>
            last book.</p>
          <p>8. The money-getting think wealth is happiness.</p>
          <p>(1.) This life does violence to our natural constitution.</p>
          <p>(2.) Money is useful as a means, but is not an end.</p>
          <p>VI.—1. The chief good is not the ideal good.a <lb/>
            Aristotle apologizes for denying the truth of Plato's theory.</p>
          <p>2. Plato did not allow the existence of ideas of things in <lb/>
            which we predicate priority and posteriority.</p>
          <p>The good is predicated in these.</p>
          <p>3. A universal idea could be predicated in only one <lb/>
            category.</p>
          <p>The good is predicated in all the categories.</p>
          <p>4. Of things under one idea there is but one science ; of <lb/>
            goods there are many sciences.</p>
          <p>5. The ideal good, and the good of which it is the idea, <lb/>
            must be in their essence identical.</p>
          <p>6. The theory, therefore, of the Pythagoreans and of <lb/>
            Speusippus is far more reasonable.</p>
          <p>7, 8. It may be objected to Aristotle's argument, that <lb/>
            goods are of two kinds : those “per se," and those “propter <lb/>
            alia." Now Plato's theory applies to the former.</p>
          <p>9, 10. To this it may be answered—(1.) That even goods, <lb/>
            "per se," do not come under our definition. (2.) If the <lb/>
            species contain under it no individuals, the theory is foolish.</p>
          <p>11. Why then is the term "good " applied to all goods ? <lb/>
            Probably from analogy. <note type="footnote"> a In the original, two words of very similar meaning are made use of, <lb/>
            namely, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰδέα</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴδος</foreign>. Now <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰδέα</foreign> is the original archetypal form, which, <lb/>
            according to Plato, existed'from all eternity : <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἴδος</foreign> is the existing form <lb/>
            or resemblance to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰδέα</foreign>, which is visible to us. Although the eternal <lb/>
            nature of the Platonic <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰδέα</foreign>, forbids us to call it an abstract idea, yet the <lb/>
            relation between <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰδέα</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἵδος</foreign> is precisely that which subsists between <lb/>
            the abstract and concrete. </note> <pb n="xvi"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK. 1"/>. 12—16. After all, if there was an ideal good, it would be <lb/>
            practically useless.</p>
          <p>VII.—1—3. Happiness has been shown to be the chief <lb/>
            good, as being the end of the master-science.</p>
          <p>It is now proved to be so, because it is the end of all <lb/>
            human actions.</p>
          <p>4, 5. There are three kinds of ends, of which the last is <lb/>
            that which is sought for its own sake alone, and happiness <lb/>
            is this.</p>
          <p>6, 7. Happiness is also the chief good, because it is self- <lb/>
            sufficient.</p>
          <p>8. Its definition arrived at in the following manner :— <lb/>
            Happiness is the virtue of man, quâ man. <lb/>
            We shall discover man's virtue by seeing what his <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔργο</foreign> via. <lb/>
            9, 10. His <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔργον</foreign> must be something peculiar to him. <lb/>
            This is the practical life of a being which possesses reason,</p>
          <p>11. Such a being may be either obedient to reason, or <lb/>
            have it and use it.</p>
          <p>We must, therefore, take that which is in energy, i. e. <lb/>
            activity.</p>
          <p>12—16. The work of a good man, therefore, is an energy <lb/>
            according to virtue; if there are more virtues than one, <lb/>
            according to the best virtue.</p>
          <p>Lastly, must be added the condition “ in a perfect life."</p>
          <p>Hence the definition of happiness :—" An energy of the <lb/>
            soul according to the best virtue in a perfect life."</p>
          <p>VIII.—1. Aristotle confirms the correctness of his defini­ <lb/>
            tion of happiness by comparing it with the opinions of his <lb/>
            predecessors.</p>
          <p>2. Goods have been divided by the Pythagoreans into <lb/>
            external goods, goods of the body, and gocds of the soul. <lb/>
            The goods of the soul have been always considered the <lb/>
            highest.</p>
          <p>3. Aristotle defines happiness as a good of the soul.</p>
          <p>4. The happy man has been said to live well, and to <lb/>
            do well.</p>
          <p>The definition of Aristotle is almost identical.</p>
          <p>5—8. Others have said that either one virtue or all virtue <lb/>
            is happiness.</p>
          <p>Aristotle says that happiness is not only virtue, but a <lb/>
            Virtuous energy.</p><pb n="xvii"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="CRAt. X.]"/> 9, 10. A fourth class have made pleasure happiness. <lb/>
            Aristotle makes happiness in its essence, and "per se, <lb/>
            pleasant.</p>
          <p>11. The energies of virtue, in fact, unite in themselves all <lb/>
            the qualities enumerated in the Delian inscription.</p>
          <p>12—14. External goods cannot make one happy, but it <lb/>
            is impossible, or at least not easy, to perform virtuous ener­ <lb/>
            gies without a certain quantity of them.</p>
          <p>IX.—1. Is happiness got by learning, or habit, or exer­ <lb/>
            cise, or by the allotment of God, or by chance ?</p>
          <p>2. Whether it is the gift of God, does not belong to the <lb/>
            present inquiry.</p>
          <p>3. It is at any rate certain that it can be attained by <lb/>
            learning and care.</p>
          <p>4—6. It cannot come by chance: (1.) Because nature <lb/>
            effects her work by the best means. (2.) From its very <lb/>
            definition. (3.) It is the end of the political science.</p>
          <p>7. Brutes cannot be called happy.</p>
          <p>Nor children except from hope.</p>
          <p>8. Why <foreign xml:lang="grc">βίος τέλειος</foreign> is added.</p>
          <p>X.—1. The necessity of adding the condition <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν βίῳ <lb/>
            τελειῳ</foreign> leads to the consideration of Solon's saying that we <lb/>
            ought to look to the end of life. a</p>
          <p>2. The saying of Solon may be taken in two senses :—</p>
          <p>(1.) A man is happy when he is dead.</p>
          <p>(2.) He may then be safely said to have been happy. <lb/>
            The first of these involves an absurdity. <lb/>
            3, 4. The second leads to further questions :—</p>
          <p>(1.) May not a man be called happy whilst alive ? <note type="footnote"> a In adding the condition <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν βίῳ τελείῳ</foreign> to his definition of happiness, <lb/>
            Aristotle seems to have been animated by an earnest desire to invest hap­ <lb/>
            piness with a property of permanence, fixedness, and stability. He wished <lb/>
            to represent the happy man as beyond the reach of any liability to change. <lb/>
            He saw that this was impossible in the case of human beings, but there <lb/>
            is nothing unphilosophical in assuming a theoretical standard of this <lb/>
            kind, even though practically unattainable, any more than there is in <lb/>
            physics in laying down the laws of matter and motion. In morals we are <lb/>
            well accustomed to recognize the principle that perseverance to the end <lb/>
            in a course of obedience is required in order to obtain our final reward. <lb/>
            " When the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, all his right­ <lb/>
            eousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned," &amp;c.—Ezek. xviii. <lb/>
            And again, " He that endureth unto the end, the same shall be saved."- <lb/>
            Matt. x. </note> <pb n="xviii"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK I."/> (2.) Are not the dead affected by the fortunes of the <lb/>
            living ?</p>
          <p>5. With regard to the first of these, it is absurd to be able <lb/>
            to say that a man has been happy, and yet not to be able to <lb/>
            say so when he is actually enjoying that happiness.</p>
          <p>6—13. But is external prosperity a part of happiness? <lb/>
            It is, but only to a certain extent; for virtuous energies are <lb/>
            very independent of it, and more permanent than anything.</p>
          <p>14. Therefore, whilst a happy man energizes, he may be <lb/>
            pronounced happy, quâ man.</p>
          <p>XI.—1, 2. As to the second question, Aristotle decides <lb/>
            that a man may be said to be unhappy on account of the <lb/>
            misfortunes of his descendants.</p>
          <p>3, 4. Or he may really be affected by them in a slight <lb/>
            degree, in the same way as horrors, not acted, but related, <lb/>
            affect us at the theatre.</p>
          <p>5. But still they cannot make the happy miserable, or the <lb/>
            miserable happy.</p>
          <p>XII.—1. Philosophers divided goods into honourable, <lb/>
            praiseworthy, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">δυνάμεις</foreign>.</p>
          <p>Happiness cannot be a <foreign xml:lang="grc">δύναμις</foreign>, because <foreign xml:lang="grc">ςυνάμεις</foreign> can be <lb/>
            abused.</p>
          <p>2—4. It cannot belong to the class of things praised, <lb/>
            because praise implies reference to a higher standard.</p>
          <p>There cannot be a higher standard than the chief good.</p>
          <p>5. Therefore happiness belongs to things honoured.</p>
          <p>XIII.—1—4. As happiness is an energy of the soul <lb/>
            according to virtue, we must know, (1) what virtue is; <lb/>
            (2) what the soul is.</p>
          <p>5, 6. The soul is divided first into two parts, the rational <lb/>
            and the irrational.</p>
          <p>7—9. The irrational into the vegetative and the appe­ <lb/>
            titive.</p>
          <p>10—14. The rational soul into the properly rational, and <lb/>
            that which obeys reason.</p>
          <p>According to another principle of division, the part obe­ <lb/>
            dient to reason may be considered as belonging <unclear/> the irra­ <lb/>
            tional soul</p>
          <p>15. Virtue is therefore twofold :—</p>
          <p>(1.) Intellectual, belonging to the rational soul.</p>
          <p>(2 ) Moral, belonging to that which obeys reason.</p><pb n="xix"/>

            <title type="sub">BOOK II.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Introductory.—Aristotle has prepared the student for the <lb/>
            contents of this book, which consist of an inquiry into the <lb/>
            origin and nature of moral virtue; firstly, by defining hap­ <lb/>
            piness as an energy of the soul according to virtue; and, <lb/>
            secondly, by dividing the virtues into moral and intellectual, <lb/>
            in accordance with his assumed division of the human soul. <lb/>
            The consideration of the moral virtues takes precedence of <lb/>
            that of the intellectual, because the formation of moral <lb/>
            habits, and the consequent acquisition of moral virtue, must <lb/>
            be the first step to the unimpeded energy of the intellect, <lb/>
            and therefore to the attainment of intellectual virtue. It <lb/>
            will be observed, that, as the foundation on which to build <lb/>
            up his moral system, Aristotle assumes the existence in <lb/>
            man of certain capacities for virtue, which he denominates, <lb/>
            at the conclusion of the sixth book, <foreign xml:lang="grc">φυσικὴ ἀρετή</foreign> (natural <lb/>
            virtue). These he conceives may be improved by education <lb/>
            and matured by habit, and thus become “ virtue proper." <lb/>
            Thus, although man does not by nature possess virtuous <lb/>
            habits, or even the commencements of these habits, still he is <lb/>
            capable of receiving virtuous impressions by instruction, and <lb/>
            of forming habits by performing acts of virtue and obedience. <lb/>
            Thus, according to Aristotle, " Virtue is the law of our <lb/>
            nature, under which law we are born." The order in which <lb/>
            the questions connected with the subject of moral virtue are <lb/>
            treated of, is</p>
          <p>(1.) The means by which virtue is attained.</p>
          <p>(2.) Its nature and definition.</p>
          <p>(3.) An induction of particular instances.</p>
          <p>(4. Certain practical rules.</p>
          <p>I.—1. Intellectual virtue is principally (though not en­ <lb/>
            tirely, for there is such a thing as " genius ) produced and <lb/>
            increased by teaching.</p>
          <p>2, 3. Moral virtue, as its etymology implies, by habit. <lb/>
            Moral virtue is not innate-</p>
          <p>(1.) Because that which is innate cannot be changed <lb/>
            by habit. <note type="footnote"> b </note> <pb n="xx"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK II."/> 4. (2.) In things innate, the capacities exist in u3 prior to <lb/>
            the energies; in virtue, the case is the reverse.</p>
          <p>5. (3.) The practice of legislators bears testimony to the <lb/>
            truth of this statement.</p>
          <p>6. (4.) Two opposite effects, virtue and vice, are due to <lb/>
            one and the same cause, but natural causes can­ <lb/>
            not produce opposite effects.</p>
          <p>7—9. Hence we must prefer energies of a certain quality, <lb/>
            as on them the character of the habits depends.</p>
          <p>II.—1, 2. Assuming for the present that moral acts must <lb/>
            be done according to the dictates of right reason, and reserv­ <lb/>
            ing that subject for the sixth book, let us consider the nature <lb/>
            of the acts themselves.</p>
          <p>3, 4. Warning the student again not to expect too much <lb/>
            exactness in ethics.</p>
          <p>5—7. Looking at the question practically, we may ob­ <lb/>
            serve—</p>
          <p>(1.) That acts, which avoid excess and defect, produce <lb/>
            virtue, whilst excess and defect destroy it.</p>
          <p>$, 9. (2.) Those acts which produce virtue are in their <lb/>
            turn produced by virtue.</p>
          <p>- III.—1. Pleasure and pain are the tests of moral habits <lb/>
            being formed or not, because moral virtue is conversant with <lb/>
            pleasures and pains. This position is proved in the following <lb/>
            way :-</p>
          <p>(1.) Because men commit sin for the sake of pleasure, <lb/>
            and abstain from what is right through dread of <lb/>
            pain.</p>
          <p>2. From this first reason Aristotle infers the justice of <lb/>
            Plato's remark on the importance of a sound early education.</p>
          <p>3. (2.) Virtue is conversant with actions and feelings, and <lb/>
            these are attended with pleasure and pain.</p>
          <p>4. (3.) Punishments cure by pain, and cures are effected <lb/>
            by contraries.</p>
          <p>(4.) Through the pursuit of pleasures and pains, habits <lb/>
            are made better or worse.</p>
          <p>5. Hence virtue has been thought by some to be <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπάθεια</foreign>.</p>
          <p>6. (5.) Pleasure and pain are, after all, the final causes of <lb/>
            choice and aversion.</p>
          <p>7. (6.) Our ideas of pleasure and pain have from child­ <lb/>
            hood become as it were ingrained in our nature.</p><pb n="xxi"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. VI.]"/> 8. (7.) We make, more or less, pleasure and pair the rule <lb/>
            of our actions; and on these our habits depend.</p>
          <p>9, 10. (8.) Virtue is shown in struggling with difficulty. <lb/>
            and nothing is so difficult to resist as pleasure.</p>
          <p>IV.—1. It may be asked, what is meant by saying that <lb/>
            we become just by performing just actions; are we not <lb/>
            then already just, as in the case of the arts 1 <lb/>
            This question is answered-</p>
          <p>2. (1.) By observing that this is not the case in the arts, <lb/>
            for a man is not a grammarian, unless he speaks <lb/>
            grammatically, because he understands the rules <lb/>
            of grammar.</p>
          <p>3. (2.) Because the cases are not parallel; as in the arts <lb/>
            we only consider the excellence of the produc­ <lb/>
            tion, in morals we look to the character and <lb/>
            motives of the person. <lb/>
            The three requisites, then, for a moral act are</p>
          <p>(1.) Knowledge,</p>
          <p>(2.) Deliberate preference on its own account,</p>
          <p>(3.) Fixedness and stability.</p>
          <p>4—6. A man, therefore, is called virtuous if he acts on <lb/>
            virtuous principles; and to do this requires practice.</p>
          <p>7. The masses, however, think that theory without prac­ <lb/>
            tice will be sufficient to make them virtuous.</p>
          <p>V.—1—4. What, then, is the genus of virtue ? In that <lb/>
            division of the soul in which moral virtue resides, there are <lb/>
            only three properties; namely, passions, capacities, and <lb/>
            habits.</p>
          <p>5, 6. Now virtue and vice are not passions.</p>
          <p>(1.) Because we are not called good or bad for our pas­ <lb/>
            sions.</p>
          <p>(2.) We are not praised or blamed for them.</p>
          <p>(3.) Virtue implies deliberate preference, passion does <lb/>
            not.</p>
          <p>(4.) We are said to be moved by our passions, but dis­ <lb/>
            posed by virtues or vices.</p>
          <p>7. They are not capacities.</p>
          <p>(1.) For the first and second reasons given above,</p>
          <p>(2.) Because our capacities are innate.</p>
          <p>8. Therefore virtue must be a habit.</p>
          <p>VI.—1, 2. What is the differentia of virtue ! <note type="footnote">b 2 </note> <pb n="xxii"/>
             </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK It."/> All excellence makes that of which it is the excellence <lb/>
            good, and also its <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔργον</foreign>.</p>
          <p>This is seen to be the case in the arts.</p>
          <p>Therefore, the case must be the same with moral excel­ <lb/>
            lence, i. e. virtue.</p>
          <p>3. Now, everything continuous and divisible implies <lb/>
            more, less, and equal.</p>
          <p>4, 5. The equal is the mean between the other two, and <lb/>
            is either absolute or relative.</p>
          <p>6. Now, every scientific man will seek the relative mean, <lb/>
            and avoid the extremes.</p>
          <p>7. If this is the case in art and science, a fortiori, virtue­ <lb/>
            will do the same.</p>
          <p>8. In actions and feelings, there are an excess, a mean, and <lb/>
            a defect, and the mean is relative.</p>
          <p>9. Again, we may be wrong in many ways; but there is <lb/>
            only one right way : now, this right way is the mean, and <lb/>
            the wrong ways are the excess and defect.</p>
          <p>10. Virtue, therefore, is " habit founded on, and exer­ <lb/>
            cising deliberate preference, in a mean relative to ourselves, <lb/>
            defined by right reason, and according to the definition of a <lb/>
            man of moral wisdom."</p>
          <p>11. Hence, in its essence, virtue is a mean, but if consi­ <lb/>
            dered with reference to the standard of excellence, it is the <lb/>
            highest extreme (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκρότης</foreign>).</p>
          <p>12—14. It must be remembered, however, that some <lb/>
            actions and feelings do not admit of a mean, and are there­ <lb/>
            fore in all cases blame-worthy.</p>
          <p>VII.—1. This chapter contains a catalogue of particular <lb/>
            examples illustrating the general principle.</p>
          <p>2. (1.) Courage is a mean, on the subject of fear and con­ <lb/>
            fidence, between rashness and cowardice.</p>
          <p>3. (2.) Temperance a mean on the subject of some plea­ <lb/>
            sures and pains, but especially pleasures, between <lb/>
            intemperance and a nameless extreme.</p>
          <p>4. (3.) Liberality on the subject of money, between prodi­ <lb/>
            gality and illiberality.</p>
          <p>5. (4.) Magnificence, only on matters of great expense, <lb/>
            between vulgar ostentation and meanness.</p>
          <p>6. (5.) Magnanimity, on the subject of great honours. <lb/>
            between empty boasting and little-mindedness.</p><pb n="xxiii"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. IX.]"/> 7—9. (6.) A nameless virtue, on the subject of small ho­ <lb/>
            nours, between ambition and the absence of it.</p>
          <p>10. (7.) Meekness, between irascibility, or passion, and <lb/>
            insensibility to the feeling of anger.</p>
          <p>11—16. (8.) Three several virtues; namely-</p>
          <p>(a.) With respect to truth; truthfulness, between arro­ <lb/>
            gance and false modesty.</p>
          <p>(b.) With respect to "the pleasant" in amusement, <lb/>
            graceful wit, or easy pleasantry, between ribaldry <lb/>
            or buffoonery and clownishness.</p>
          <p>(c.) With respect to “the pleasant" in the intercourse <lb/>
            of life; friendship, between flattery and the being <lb/>
            over-complaisant and moroseness.</p>
          <p>17—19. (9.) Two mean states in the feelings.</p>
          <p>(a.) Modesty, between bashfulness and impudence.</p>
          <p>(b.) Indignation, between envy and malevolence.</p>
          <p>VIII.—1—4. The extremes are in opposition to each <lb/>
            other, and the mean to both.</p>
          <p>5, 6. But the extremes are more repugnant to each other <lb/>
            than each of them is to the mean.</p>
          <p>7—9. This may take place either from the nature of the <lb/>
            means themselves, or from the constitution of the person.</p>
          <p>IX.—1 2. Aristotle recapitulates briefly the description <lb/>
            of moral virtue, and states that therefore it is difficult of <lb/>
            attainment. Hence he gives three useful practical rules for <lb/>
            arriving at the mean.</p>
          <p>3. (1.) Go farthest from that extreme which is most <lb/>
            opposed to the mean.</p>
          <p>4. (2.) Struggle against that to which you have the strongest <lb/>
            propensity.</p>
          <p>5. (3.) Beware of pleasure.</p>
          <p>6—8. As it is difficult to hit the mean exactly, slight <lb/>
            deviations are pardonable. No exact casuistical rules can be <lb/>
            laid down : our moral sense must be our guide.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">BOOK III.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Introductory. — The principle of all moral action is <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">προαίρεσις</foreign>, i.e. what is commonly termed moral choice, or <lb/>
            the deliberately preferring one act or one course of action <pb n="xxiv"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK III."/> <lb/>
            to any other, on sound moral grounds, under the direction <lb/>
            of right reason. It is this which determines the moral <lb/>
            quality of an act; it is the principal part of the differential <lb/>
            property which distinguishes the habit of virtue from an­ <lb/>
            other. Hence Aristotle now proceeds to treat of this sub­ <lb/>
            ject, and other subjects immediately and intimately connected <lb/>
            with it.</p>
          <p>Now of these, the first, and most important, as lying at <lb/>
            the very threshold of the investigation, is the freedom of the <lb/>
            human will. On the establishing of this doctrine depends <lb/>
            the whole question of human responsibility, and yet it is a <lb/>
            doctrine which Aristotle could not assume at once, because <lb/>
            views had been held respecting it which required refutation. <lb/>
            Socrates had held that all the virtues were sciences ; there­ <lb/>
            fore, that vice was the result of ignorance ; that no one sins <lb/>
            contrary to knowledge ; and therefore, that vice is involun­ <lb/>
            tary. Plato held that virtue was voluntary, because the <lb/>
            natural bias of the will was towards good, but that a vicious <lb/>
            state was an unnatural one-a morbid action, as it were, and <lb/>
            therefore involuntary.</p>
          <p>Aristotle agreed with Plato so far as to maintain, that a <lb/>
            bias towards virtue is the normal condition of the -will He <lb/>
            saw, also, that when habits are formed, they are often beyond <lb/>
            our power, because they have become a second nature ; and <lb/>
            that the reason why we are responsible for them is because <lb/>
            we are responsible for the original formation of them; but <lb/>
            still he believes that the will is necessarily free.</p>
          <p>He supports this view by many arguments, and amongst <lb/>
            them, by the common-sense view of the case, as shown in the <lb/>
            practice of legislators. His argument is somewhat of the <lb/>
            same kind as that of Bishop Butler (Analogy, Part I. c. vi.), <lb/>
            where he says, that whatever our abstract opinion may be <lb/>
            respecting the doctrine of necessity as influencing practice, <lb/>
            there can be no doubt that men deal with one another as if <lb/>
            they were free agents, nor could civil society hold together <lb/>
            on any other principles. Educate a child in the principles <lb/>
            of fatalism, and however delighted he may be at first with <lb/>
            his freedom from responsibility, he would soon discover the <lb/>
            error in which he had been brought up, immediately he came <lb/>
            abroad into the world, and would do somewhat very soon, <lb/>
            for which he would be delivered over into the hands of civil <lb/>
            justice.</p><pb n="xxv"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. I.]"/> The third book commences with an analysis of the nature <lb/>
            of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑκούσιον</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκούσιον</foreign> ; Aristotle then proceeds to <lb/>
            discuss the subject of <foreign xml:lang="grc">προαίρεσις</foreign>. Next, as <foreign xml:lang="grc">προαίρεσις</foreign> is <lb/>
            subsequent to the deliberative process, deliberation is next <lb/>
            treated of; and lastly, the subject of the will. These points <lb/>
            occupy the first five chapters ; and here Michelet considers <lb/>
            the first part of the treatise to terminate. He divides the <lb/>
            Ethics into three parts; the first of which treats of the <lb/>
            summum bonum ; the second, of the virtues in detail; the <lb/>
            third, of the instrumental to virtue.</p>
          <p>I.—1. The consideration of the voluntary and involuntary <lb/>
            necessary.</p>
          <p>(1.) Because voluntary acts are praised or blamed , <lb/>
            involuntary acts pardoned or pitied.</p>
          <p>(2.) Because it will be useful to legislators to do so.</p>
          <p>2. Involuntary acts are of two kinds- <lb/>
            (1.) <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ βίᾳ</foreign>, (2.) <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ δι</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄγνοιαν</foreign>.</p>
          <p>By <foreign xml:lang="grc">βίαια</foreign> is meant that of which the principle or cause is <lb/>
            external.</p>
          <p>3, 4. There are also acts of a mixed nature. For example, <lb/>
            those which we do from fear of greater evils.</p>
          <p>5, 6. These acts most resemble voluntary acts, because the <lb/>
            principle of action is in the agent.</p>
          <p>7, 8. But abstractedly they are perhaps to be considered <lb/>
            involuntary.</p>
          <p>These acts are, according to circumstances, praised, blamed, <lb/>
            or pardoned.</p>
          <p>9. There are some acts which nothing should induce us <lb/>
            to do.</p>
          <p>10. But it is difficult to decide in many cases what we <lb/>
            ought to prefer to do, and still more so to abide by our <lb/>
            decisions.</p>
          <p>11. The points of difference between these acts and volun­ <lb/>
            tary and involuntary acts further considered.</p>
          <p>12. Everything which we do for the sake of the pleasant <lb/>
            and the honourable is voluntary.</p>
          <p>13. Acts done through ignorance (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δι</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄγνοιαν</foreign>) are either <lb/>
            non-voluntary or involuntary.</p>
          <p>14. If repented of, they are involuntary.</p>
          <p>15, 16. Ignorance of the principles of justice and expe­ <lb/>
            diency (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰγνοω̃ν</foreign>) is always held as voluntary and inexcusable</p><pb n="xxvi"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK III."/> 17—20. Cases of ignorance brought forward which arc <lb/>
            pardonable if followed by repentance.</p>
          <p>21. The voluntary is defined as that of which the principle <lb/>
            is in the agent knowing the circumstances of the act.</p>
          <p>22—24. That acts done under the influence of passion and <lb/>
            anger are not involuntary, proved by six reasons.8</p>
          <p>II.—1. Deliberate preference (<foreign xml:lang="grc">προαίρεσις</foreign>) must be con­ <lb/>
            sidered, because it is the moral principle which determines <lb/>
            the moral quality of an act.</p>
          <p>2. It is a species of the voluntary.</p>
          <p>3. It is not desire-</p>
          <p>(1.) Because irrational beings participate in desire and <lb/>
            anger, but not in <foreign xml:lang="grc">προαίρεσις</foreign>.</p>
          <p>(2.) Because the incontinent man acts from desire, and <lb/>
            not from <foreign xml:lang="grc">προαίρεσις</foreign>; the continent from <foreign xml:lang="grc">προαί­ <lb/>
            ρεσις</foreign>, and not from desire. Therefore they can be <lb/>
            evidently separated.</p>
          <p>(3.) They are often opposed.</p>
          <p>(4.) Desire, and not <foreign xml:lang="grc">προαίρεσις</foreign>, has to do with pleasure <lb/>
            and pain.</p>
          <p>4. Still less is it anger, for the same reasons.</p>
          <p>5. It is not volition, though it approaches very near it.</p>
          <p>(1.) Because we wish for impossibilities.</p>
          <p>(2.) We wish things which are not in our own power.</p>
          <p>6. (3.) Volition is for the end, and not the means. <lb/>
            It is not opinion simply,</p>
          <p>7. (1.) Because opinion is of things eternal and impossible.</p>
          <p>(2.) Its quality is determined by truth and falsehood, <lb/>
            not by virtue and vice.</p>
          <p>It is not some particular opinion, because <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_11_fig1.jpg"/></figure> <pb n="xxvii"/>
              </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. III.]"/> 8. (1.) Moral character is determined by our <foreign xml:lang="grc">προαίρεσις</foreign>.</p>
          <p>9. (2.) We deliberately prefer to take a thing or not; we <lb/>
            form an opinion as to its nature.</p>
          <p>(3.) <foreign xml:lang="grc">Προαίρσις</foreign> is praised for the rightness of its object; <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δόξα</foreign> for its truth.</p>
          <p>10. (4.) We form opinions respecting subjects we do not <lb/>
            know.</p>
          <p>(5.) Some persons form good opinions, but exercise a <lb/>
            bad <foreign xml:lang="grc">προαίρεσις</foreign>.</p>
          <p>11. The definition, therefore (nominally), of the object of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">προαίρεσις</foreign> is a voluntary act which has been previously the <lb/>
            object of deliberation.</p>
          <p>III.—1. The object of deliberation is that about which a <lb/>
            reasonable man would deliberate.</p>
          <p>2, 3. No one deliberates about things eternal, or about <lb/>
            those which come to pass by nature, necessity, or chance.</p>
          <p>Nor about everything human, if it is not brought about <lb/>
            by our own agency.</p>
          <p>Nor about the exact sciences.</p>
          <p>But besides the three principles of causation-nature, <lb/>
            necessity, and chance-there is a fourth; namely, mind or <lb/>
            intellect.</p>
          <p>4, 5. The object of deliberation, therefore, is that which <lb/>
            comes to pass through this fourth cause, which is in our <lb/>
            power, and which is uncertain as to its event.</p>
          <p>6. We also deliberate about means, not ends.</p>
          <p>7. If there are more means than one, deliberation deter­ <lb/>
            mines which is the better.</p>
          <p>If only one, it determines how it can be done by this, and <lb/>
            so it goes backwards by an analytical process until it either <lb/>
            meets with an impossibility, or the first cause, which is the <lb/>
            first step in the constructive process.</p>
          <p>8. It is, therefore, a species of investigation.</p>
          <p>9, 10. We deliberate sometimes about the instruments, <lb/>
            sometimes the use of them.</p>
          <p>11, 12. Deliberation and deliberate preference differ in <lb/>
            that we are not obliged after all to choose the means re­ <lb/>
            specting which we have deliberated, but if we do choose them, <lb/>
            we are exercising <foreign xml:lang="grc">προαίρεσις</foreign>, and therefore its definition is <lb/>
            the deliberate desire of things in our power.</p><pb n="xxviii"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK III."/> IV.—1, 2. Volition is of the end, but is its object the <lb/>
            good or the apparent good ?</p>
          <p>3. The good man wishes for the real good. The bad man <lb/>
            for that which he thinks good.</p>
          <p>4. The case is analogous to that of the senses.</p>
          <p>5. The above constitutes the principal difference between <lb/>
            the good and the bad man.</p>
          <p>6. In determining what they ought to wish for, the masses <lb/>
            are deceived by pleasure.</p>
          <p>V. 1, 2. If the end is the object of volition, and the means <lb/>
            the object of deliberation and deliberate preference, the acts <lb/>
            respecting them must be voluntary; now with these acts vir­ <lb/>
            tuous energies are conversant, therefore virtue is voluntary. <lb/>
            Therefore vice is voluntary; for, if we can do, we can <lb/>
            abstain.</p>
          <p>If vice is not voluntary,</p>
          <p>3. (1.) We must deny that man is the origin of his <lb/>
            actions.</p>
          <p>4,5. (2.) The principles would be in our power, and the <lb/>
            acts which result from them would not be.</p>
          <p>The practice of legislators confirms Aristotle's view.</p>
          <p>6. They even punish ignorance itself if self-caused.</p>
          <p>7. Especially ignorance of the law.</p>
          <p>8. If it be objected that the guilty person could not pay <lb/>
            attention enough to understand the law, the answer is, that <lb/>
            vice has caused the inability.</p>
          <p>9—11. Moreover, vicious acts, which are in our power, <lb/>
            produce vicious habits, and therefore we are responsible for <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>12, 13. (3.) Bodily faults which are in our power are <lb/>
            blamed, and no others; therefore vice, being <lb/>
            blamed, must be considered as in our power too.</p>
          <p>14. If it be objected that all aim at what they think good, <lb/>
            but have not power over the conception which they form of it, <lb/>
            the answer is, if we are the causes of our habits, we are also <lb/>
            of our imaginations.</p>
          <p>15. If it be objected that vice is involuntary, because it is <lb/>
            owing to ignorance of the end, ;he answer is, that in that <lb/>
            case virtue is involuntary.</p>
          <p>16. Besides, if the notion we form of the end is due to <lb/>
            nature, still the means are in our power.</p><pb n="xxix"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="CEAF. VIII.],"/> 17, 18. If virtue is voluntary, vice must be so.</p>
          <p>19, 20. Still, habits, when formed, are not so much in our <lb/>
            power as the acts were.</p>
          <p>VI.—1. Courage is a mean state on the subjects of fear <lb/>
            and confidence.</p>
          <p>Fear is denned " The expectation of evil."</p>
          <p>2. Now some evils, such as disgrace, we ought to fear. <lb/>
            The brave man can have nothing to do with these.</p>
          <p>3, 4. Others, again, we ought not to fear; as poverty, &amp;c. ; <lb/>
            still he who is fearless of these evils is not termed brave, <lb/>
            except metaphorically.</p>
          <p>5. The brave man, therefore, has to do with the most ter­ <lb/>
            rible of all things, i. e. death.</p>
          <p>6—8. Yet not with all kinds of death, but only death in <lb/>
            battle.</p>
          <p>Still the brave man will be fearless in sickness or in a <lb/>
            storm at sea, but not from the same cause that sailors are.</p>
          <p>VII.—1, 2. Things terrible are of two kinds.</p>
          <p>(1.) <foreign xml:lang="grc">Υπὲρ ἂνθρωπον</foreign>. (2.) Kar' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂνθρωπον</foreign>.</p>
          <p>Every man of sense will fear the former.</p>
          <p>The latter differ in magnitude.</p>
          <p>3. And may be feared too much or too little.</p>
          <p>4. The brave man fears or feels confidence at what he <lb/>
            ought, as he ought, when he ought, and for the right motive.</p>
          <p>5. This motive is <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ καλόν</foreign>.</p>
          <p>He who is in the extreme of fearlessness may be called <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">άνάλγλτος</foreign>.</p>
          <p>7. He who is in the extreme of confidence, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϑρασύς</foreign>.</p>
          <p>8. He who is in the extreme of fear, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δειλός</foreign>.</p>
          <p>9, 10. The brave man, the coward, and the rash, are all <lb/>
            conversant with the same things.</p>
          <p>11. Suicide is the act of a coward.</p>
          <p>VIII.—1—4. There are five other forms of courage.</p>
          <p>(1.) Political courage.</p>
          <p>The motive of this is not the abstractedly honourable, <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλόν</foreign>; but honourable distinction, <foreign xml:lang="grc">τιμή</foreign>.</p>
          <p>5—7. Courage arising from experience.</p>
          <p>The difference between this and real courage is exempli­ <lb/>
            fied by a comparison between the conduct of regular troops <lb/>
            and that of a native militia.</p>
          <p>8—10. (3.) Courage arising from anger.</p><pb n="xxx"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK III."/> This is not for the sake of the right motive, but in obe­ <lb/>
            dience to the dictates of an irrational passion.</p>
          <p>11—13. (4.) The courage of the sanguine.</p>
          <p>Their courage is based upon like motives with that of the <lb/>
            experienced.</p>
          <p>In unexpected perils it often fails.</p>
          <p>14, 15. (5.) The courage of the ignorant.a</p>
          <p>This is even worse than that of the sanguine; for when <lb/>
            they find they are deceived in their estimate of the danger, <lb/>
            they fly.</p>
          <p>IX.—1. Courage has more to do with fear than confi­ <lb/>
            dence.</p>
          <p>2, 3. It is painful and more difficult to attain than tem­ <lb/>
            perance.</p>
          <p>Not but that its end is pleasant, although the means to <lb/>
            that end are painful.</p>
          <p>4, 5. The fact that the brave man feels pain, not only does <lb/>
            not diminish, but rather increases his reputation.</p>
          <p>6. It is plain, therefore, that it is not possible to energize <lb/>
            with pleasure in all the virtues.</p>
          <p>7. Though mercenaries are less brave, still they may be the <lb/>
            best fighters.</p>
          <p>X.—1. Courage and temperance are first discussed, be­ <lb/>
            cause they are the virtues of the irrational part of the soul. <lb/>
            Temperance is a mean state on the subject of pleasure. <lb/>
            2, 3. Pleasures are of two kinds.</p>
          <p>(1.) Those of the soul.</p>
          <p>(2.) Those of the body.</p>
          <p>4—10. Temperance belongs to the latter.</p>
          <p>But not to those of sight, hearing, or smell, except acci­ <lb/>
            dentally, nor of taste, except in a slight degree.</p>
          <p>11. It has to do with the pleasures of touch.</p>
          <p>Touch belongs to us not so far forth as we are men, but <lb/>
            so far forth as we are animals, and therefore is the lowest of <lb/>
            the senses.</p>
          <p>12. Even the more liberal pleasures of touch are those <lb/>
            which are excluded from those with which temperance and <lb/>
            intemperance are conversant.</p>
          <p>XI.—1—3. Desires are of two kinds. <note type="footnote"> a "0 <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοι̃ς ἓλλοιςάμαθίαμὲν ϑράσος, λογσμὸς δὲ ὃκνον φέρει</foreign>- <lb/>

            </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. XII.]"/> (1.) Common and natural.</p>
          <p>(2.) Peculiar and acquired.</p>
          <p>In the former, errors are seldom met with.</p>
          <p>In the latter, they are frequent.</p>
          <p>The intemperate are in excess under all circumstances.</p>
          <p>If the desires are wrong, they delight in them.</p>
          <p>If the desires are innocent, they delight in them more <lb/>
            than they ought.</p>
          <p>4, 5. The difference between temperance and courage con­ <lb/>
            sists in the relation which they respectively bear to pains.</p>
          <p>For example, a man is called brave for bearing pain, but <lb/>
            temperate for not feeling pain at the absence of pleasure.</p>
          <p>6. The character which is in the defect as to pleasure has <lb/>
            no name, because it is never found.</p>
          <p>7, 8. The chapter concludes with the character of the <lb/>
            temperate man.</p>
          <p>XII.—1. Intemperance seems more voluntary than coward­ <lb/>
            ice, and therefore more blameworthy.</p>
          <p>(1.) Because fear gives a shock to the natural character, <lb/>
            and throws it off its balance.</p>
          <p>2, 3. (2.) Though cowardice as a habit is more volun­ <lb/>
            tary than intemperance, still particular acts of <lb/>
            cowardice are less voluntary.</p>
          <p>4. The term <foreign xml:lang="grc">άκολασία</foreign>, because of its etymological meaning, <lb/>
            is applied to the faults of children metaphorically, because <lb/>
            desires and children require <foreign xml:lang="grc">κόλασις</foreign>.</p>
          <p>5—7. Since desires, if not controlled, will increase, the <lb/>
            part of the soul in which they reside should be obedient to <lb/>
            reason, and be in harmony with it.</p>

          <p>Introductory.—This book requires but few words by way <lb/>
            of introduction. It consists of a continuation of that sub­ <lb/>
            ject which Aristotle touched upon briefly in outline in the <lb/>
            second book, and commenced in detail in the sixth chapter <lb/>
            of Book III. The virtues investigated here are magni­ <lb/>
            ficence, liberality, magnanimity, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">φιλοτιμία</foreign> in the best <lb/>
            acceptation of the term, meekness, the three social virtues, <pb n="xxxii"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK IT."/> <lb/>
            and the sense of shame, which Aristotle decides is to be <lb/>
            considered as a passion or feeling, rather than a virtue.</p>
          <p>The second book of the Rhetoric, and the characters of <lb/>
            Theophrastus, should be compared with the discussion of the <lb/>
            moral virtues in this book.</p>
          <p>I.—1. Liberality is a mean on the subject of possessions or <lb/>
            property.</p>
          <p>Property is that, the value of which is measured by money.</p>
          <p>2. The extremes are illiberality and prodigality.</p>
          <p>The epithet prodigal is sometimes applied to the intem­ <lb/>
            perate.</p>
          <p>3. This application of the term is incorrect.</p>
          <p>4. Liberality has more to do with giving than with <lb/>
            receiving.</p>
          <p>(1.) For the former is the use of money, the latter only <lb/>
            the way of acquiring it.</p>
          <p>(2.) It is more honourable to do than to receive good.</p>
          <p>(3.) To abstain from receiving is easier than to give; <lb/>
            and those who abstain from receiving are rather <lb/>
            praised for justice.</p>
          <p>6, 7. The motive of liberality is <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ καλόν</foreign>.</p>
          <p>The liberal will give to proper objects, and in proportion <lb/>
            to his means.</p>
          <p>8. The liberal will not receive from improper sources, nor <lb/>
            be fond of asking favours, nor be carelessly extravagant.</p>
          <p>9. Though the liberal man will not look overmuch to his <lb/>
            own interest, still his profuseness will be proportioned to <lb/>
            his means.</p>
          <p>10. Those who inherit wealth are most liberal.</p>
          <p>It is not easy for the liberal man to be rich.</p>
          <p>11. Therefore men sometimes upbraid the unfairness of <lb/>
            fortune.</p>
          <p>12. The liberal differs from the prodigal.</p>
          <p>Kings cannot be prodigal.</p>
          <p>13. The liberal differs from the prodigal in receiving.</p>
          <p>The relation of the liberal man to the feelings of pleasure <lb/>
            and pain.</p>
          <p>14. Definition of the extremes.</p>
          <p>15. Prodigality shown to be better than illiberality.</p>
          <p>16, 18. Prodigals are often guilty of meannesses in order <lb/>
            to supply resources for their extravagance, and are-generally <lb/>
            intemperate.</p><pb n="xxxiii"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. III.]"/> 19. Illiberality is incurable.</p>
          <p>20—24. Various forms of illiberality.</p>
          <p>25. Illiberality is worse than prodigality, and is the ex­ <lb/>
            treme to which men are most liable.</p>
          <p>II.—1. Magnificence is appropriate expenditure in great <lb/>
            matters.</p>
          <p>2. Propriety depends-</p>
          <p>(1.) On the relation of the expense to the expander.</p>
          <p>(2.) On the object of the expense.</p>
          <p>(3.) On the quantity expended.</p>
          <p>3. The defect is meanness, the excess, bad taste and vulgar <lb/>
            profusion.</p>
          <p>4. Magnificence implies in some degree science.</p>
          <p>5. The motive is <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ καλόν</foreign>.</p>
          <p>6. The magnificent man will a fortiori be liberal.</p>
          <p>Magnificence is of two kinds :—(1.) Public. (2.) Private,</p>
          <p>7—12. The poor man cannot be magnificent.</p>
          <p>13, 14. The extremes described.</p>
          <p>These two habits, though vicious, are neither hurtful, nor <lb/>
            very disgraceful.</p>
          <p>III.—1. The nature of magnanimity in the abstract dis­ <lb/>
            covered from considering it in the concrete.</p>
          <p>The magnanimous man is " He who, being worthy, esti­ <lb/>
            mates his own worth highly."</p>
          <p>2. He whose worth is low, and who estimates it lowly, is <lb/>
            a modest man.</p>
          <p>3, 4. The extremes are the vain man and the little- <lb/>
            minded.</p>
          <p>5. The magnanimous man, as to his merits, is in the <lb/>
            highest place, as to his estimate of himself, in the mean.</p>
          <p>6. He is conversant with honour.</p>
          <p>7. He must be a good man.</p>
          <p>8. Magnanimity is an ornament of the virtues.</p>
          <p>The magnanimous man will accept honour from the good <lb/>
            with moderate gratification, but not from others.</p>
          <p>9. In success or failure, he will behave with modem­ <lb/>
            tion.</p>
          <p>10, 11. Instances of good fortune are thought to contribute <lb/>
            to magnanimity; but without virtue men may be supercilious, <lb/>
            but they cannot be magnanimous.</p>
          <p>12—19. The character of a magnanimous man. will dis- <pb n="xxxiv"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK IV"/> <lb/>
            play itself in his views and conduct as to all the virtues, <lb/>
            and even in his gait, voice, and manners.</p>
          <p>20, 21. The little-minded and vain are not vicious; but <lb/>
            rather, the former idle, the latter foolish. The little-minded <lb/>
            are the worst of the two, and much opposed to the mean <lb/>
            state.</p>
          <p>IV.—1. There is a nameless virtue, the object-matter of <lb/>
            which is small honours.</p>
          <p>It bears the same relation to magnanimity which liberality <lb/>
            does to magnificence.</p>
          <p>2. It is nameless, because we use the term <foreign xml:lang="grc">φιλοτιμία</foreign> some­ <lb/>
            times as praise, sometimes as reproach.</p>
          <p>3. As the mean is as it were vacant, the extremes appear <lb/>
            to contend for the middle place.</p>
          <p>V.—1. Meekness is a mean state which has anger for its <lb/>
            object-matter.</p>
          <p>Its extremes are irascibility and insensibility to anger.</p>
          <p>2. The characteristic of the meek is propriety as to the <lb/>
            feeling of anger under all circumstances.</p>
          <p>3. Insensibility to anger is blameworthy and slavish.</p>
          <p>4. The excess cannot exist in all the categories, as the <lb/>
            evil would then destroy itself <lb/>
            The different varieties of irascibility are- <lb/>
            5, 8. The choleric, the bitter, and the ill-tempered. <lb/>
            Irascibility is most opposed to the mean. <lb/>
            Although a precise rule cannot be laid down, still slight <lb/>
            transgressions are not blamed.</p>
          <p>VI.—3. In the social intercourse of life, there is a virtue <lb/>
            which, though nameless, may be called friendliness.</p>
          <p>It may be defined as friendship, minus the feeling of <lb/>
            affection.</p>
          <p>1, 2. The characters in the extremes are-</p>
          <p>(1.) "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αρεσκοι</foreign>, men-pleasers, or the over-complaisant.</p>
          <p>(2.) <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δύσκολοι</foreign>, the cross and quarrelsome.</p>
          <p>4, 5. This virtue is true politeness, or good-breeding; it <lb/>
            avoids giving pain, it aims at giving pleasure. The polite <lb/>
            man will regulate his behaviour towards persons of different <lb/>
            ranks by a regard to propriety.</p>
          <p>He will only inflict pain for the sake of giving greates <lb/>
            pleasure.</p>
          <p>6. He who aims solely at giving pleasure is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂρεσκος</foreign>.</p><pb n="xxxv"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. IX.]"/> He who does so from selfishness is <foreign xml:lang="grc">κόαξ</foreign>.</p>
          <p>VII.—1, 2. The virtue which has truth for its object <lb/>
            matter has no name, but it may be called truthfulness.</p>
          <p>3. The excess is arrogance, the defect false modesty.</p>
          <p>The former is more blameable than the latter.</p>
          <p>4, 5. Truthfulness does not mean truthfulness in con­ <lb/>
            tracts, for that is justice, but in all words and actions, even <lb/>
            those which are of slight importance.</p>
          <p>The truthful rather inclines to the defect than the excess, <lb/>
            as being better taste.</p>
          <p>6, 7. Arrogance for the sake of honour, not so blameablo <lb/>
            as for the sake of money.</p>
          <p>8. The falsely-modest have more refinement than the <lb/>
            arrogant.</p>
          <p>9. False modesty sometimes proceeds from arrogance.</p>
          <p>VIII.—3. In periods of relaxation, the social virtue is <lb/>
            graceful, or polished wit, or easy pleasantry (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εύτραελία</foreign>).</p>
          <p>1, 2. The extremes are buffoonery and clownishness.</p>
          <p>4. Tact peculiarly belongs to the mean habit.</p>
          <p>The difference between polished wit and the reverse may <lb/>
            be seen in the wit of the old and new comedy.</p>
          <p>5. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">εύτρπελος</foreign> will jest, but he will jest as a gentleman <lb/>
            ought, and not so as to pain or disgust any one. He will <lb/>
            have tact and good taste.</p>
          <p>6. The buffoon will sacrifice himself or anybody to a <lb/>
            joke.</p>
          <p>The clownish will neither jest himself, nor be amused with <lb/>
            the jests of others.</p>
          <p>IX.—1. The sense of shame is rather a passion or feeling, <lb/>
            than a virtue.</p>
          <p>Its physical effects are somewhat like those of fear.</p>
          <p>2. It is especially suitable to youth.</p>
          <p>An older person ought to do nothing to be ashamed of.</p>
          <p>3. The feeling of shame is no proof of a man being good.</p>
          <p>Hypothetically it may be a worthy feeling. <lb/>
            Because shamelessness is bad, it does not follow that the <lb/>
            sense of shame is a virtue.</p>
          <p>4. In like manner, continence, properly speaking, is not a <lb/>
            virtue, but a kind of mixed virtue. <note type="footnote"> c </note> <pb n="xxxvi"/>

            <title type="sub">BOOK V</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Introductory.—The analysis of a subject by contemplating <lb/>
            its ideal nature is a course by no means suited to the prac­ <lb/>
            tical turn of Aristotle's mind. He prefers, therefore, gene­ <lb/>
            rally speaking, to consider virtues, not in the abstract, but <lb/>
            in the concrete, as the quality of an act, or as the charac­ <lb/>
            teristic of a moral agent. In this way he proceeds to treat <lb/>
            of justice and injustice. He first investigates the nature <lb/>
            of just and unjust actions, and of the just and unjust man, <lb/>
            and thus arrives at his definition and description of justice <lb/>
            and injustice. Of course, it is plain, from the nature of <lb/>
            moral habits, that the knowledge of the principles of one <lb/>
            contrary, namely, justice, conveys to us an acquaintance <lb/>
            with the principles of the other contrary, injustice.</p>
          <p>Now a man is termed unjust, for two reasons :—Firstly, <lb/>
            as being a transgressor of the law, whether that be the <lb/>
            written or the unwritten; and, Secondly, as being unequal <lb/>
            or unfair, as taking more of good, and less of evil, which <lb/>
            comes to the same thing, than he has a right and title to. <lb/>
            Hence injustice, and therefore justice, is of two kinds: <lb/>
            (1) a habit of obedience to law ; (2) a habit of equality.</p>
          <p>Now, as law, in the most comprehensive acceptation of <lb/>
            the term, implies the enactment of all the principles of <lb/>
            virtue which are binding on mankind as members of a <lb/>
            social community (which, be it remembered, Aristotle con­ <lb/>
            siders their proper normal condition), the only difference <lb/>
            between universal justice (1) and universal virtue is, that <lb/>
            the habit of obedience to the fixed principles of moral recti­ <lb/>
            tude is, when considered absolutely, termed virtue, when <lb/>
            considered relatively to others, justice.</p>
          <p>This universal justice is not the justice which Aristotle <lb/>
            considers in this book; as of course it forms the subject­ <lb/>
            mattor of his whole treatise (at least the whole of that <lb/>
            division of it which treats of moral virtue), if we take into <lb/>
            consideration the additional condition of. relation."</p>
          <p>Particular justice, which he does investigate, is of two <lb/>
            kinds, distributive and corrective. The former is a virtuous <pb n="xxxvii"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="XXXVII"/> <lb/>
            habit, which, strictly speaking, can only be exercised by man <lb/>
            in his capacity as a free citizen intrusted with political func­ <lb/>
            tions, either legislative or executive, for it deals with the <lb/>
            distribution, according to merit, of the public rewards and <lb/>
            punishments of a state. But the exercise of this virtue is <lb/>
            by no means so limited as this idea of it would lead us at <lb/>
            first sight to suppose. For, in the first place, in the free <lb/>
            states of Greece, every citizen was, to a certain extent, in­ <lb/>
            trusted with these functions, which is not the case under the <lb/>
            modern system of political institutions ; and, in the second <lb/>
            place, analogically, the same principles, mutatis mutandis, will <lb/>
            regulate our conduct in the distribution of rewards and <lb/>
            punishments, towards children, dependants, and so forth.</p>
          <p>Besides, it is scarcely conceivable in how many instances <lb/>
            a man is called upon to act as a judge, and to exercise his <lb/>
            judicial functions as a divider and distributor of honours and <lb/>
            rewards, of censures and of punishments, and thus to keep <lb/>
            in mind the principles which Aristotle here lays down of <lb/>
            equality and impartiality.</p>
          <p>When we contemplate justice as one of the divine attri­ <lb/>
            butes, it is distributive justice to which we allude. God will, <lb/>
            and always has, dealt with mankind on principles of justice, <lb/>
            which are in accordance with, and proportioned to, the <lb/>
            position amongst created beings in which he has himself <lb/>
            placed him. He is the distributor of rewards and punish­ <lb/>
            ments to every man according to his works, the punisher <lb/>
            of the ungodly, the rewarder of them that diligently seek <lb/>
            him. He doubtless weighs well, with that strict and un­ <lb/>
            erring justice of which Omniscience alone is capable, the <lb/>
            circumstances and privileges of each individual, according to <lb/>
            that analogy which is implied in the following words of <lb/>
            inspiration :—" To whom much is given, from him much <lb/>
            shall be required."</p>
          <p>The second division of particular justice may also be­ <lb/>
            viewed in two lights. Firstly, as that habit by which the <lb/>
            state, either by criminal or civil processes, corrects the in­ <lb/>
            equalities which unjust conduct produces between man and­ <lb/>
            man; and, Secondly, as the habit, the observance of which <lb/>
            prevents individuals from violating the principles of equality <lb/>
            which we are bound to observe in our dealings or intercourse <lb/>
            with each other. <note type="footnote"> c 2 </note> <pb n="xxxviii"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK V."/> We may illustrate the nature of corrective justice by <lb/>
            reference to our own judicial system in the following way :- <lb/>
            In civil actions, such as for assault, seduction, &amp;c., the amount <lb/>
            of the injury inflicted is estimated in the form of damages. <lb/>
            The defendant is presumed to have more than he ought, and <lb/>
            the plaintiff less by this amount, and the equality is re­ <lb/>
            stored by the former paying to the latter the damages <lb/>
            assessed by the jury. In criminal cases-the state, and not <lb/>
            the person against whom the offence has actually been com­ <lb/>
            mitted, is considered the injured party. A certain diminu­ <lb/>
            tion has taken place in the public security of life and <lb/>
            property, and the balance is restored by the penalty, either <lb/>
            as to person or property, which the law inflicts.</p>
          <p>There still remain to be considered the principles of com­ <lb/>
            mutative justice; but these Aristotle has not laid down <lb/>
            quite so clearly as he has those of the other two divisions. <lb/>
            He, evidently, as far as can be seen from the fifth chapter, <lb/>
            considers it as a branch of corrective justice, but, at the <lb/>
            same time, as regulated in some degree by the principles of <lb/>
            distributive justice also. Equality is maintained by an <lb/>
            equivalent payment for the commodities exchanged or pur­ <lb/>
            chased : and, therefore, arithmetical proportion is observed, <lb/>
            as in corrective justice; but this equivalent is estimated, <lb/>
            and the commodities and the parties compared, according to <lb/>
            the law of geometrical proportion.</p>
          <p>There is one point which requires observation as presenting <lb/>
            an apparent difficulty. How is it that Aristotle considers <lb/>
            natural justice as a division of political justice, whereas it <lb/>
            might be supposed that the immutable principles of jus­ <lb/>
            tice were implanted in, and formed a part of man's nature, <lb/>
            antecedently even to any idea of his social condition as a <lb/>
            member of political society? The answer to this ques­ <lb/>
            tion is, that the natural state of man is his social condition. <lb/>
            Under any other circumstances, it would be in vain to look <lb/>
            for the development of any one of his faculties. The his­ <lb/>
            tory of the human race never presents man to us except in <lb/>
            relation to his fellow-man. Even in savage life, the rude <lb/>
            elements of civil society are discoverable. If we could con­ <lb/>
            ceive the existence of an individual isolated from the rest of <lb/>
            his species, he would be a man only in outward form, he <lb/>
            would possess no sense of right and wrong, no moral senti, <pb n="xxxix"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. III.]"/> <lb/>
            ments, no ideas on the subject of natural justice. The <lb/>
            principles of natural justice are doubtless immutable and <lb/>
            eternal, and would be the same had the man never existed; <lb/>
            but as far as man is concerned, the development of them <lb/>
            must be sought for in him as we find him ; that is, in his <lb/>
            social condition, and no other.</p>
          <p>In the tenth chapter Aristotle treats of equity, the prin­ <lb/>
            ciples of which furnish the means of correcting the imperfec­ <lb/>
            tions of law. These imperfections are unavoidable, because, <lb/>
            from the nature of things, the enactments of law must be <lb/>
            universal, and require adaptation to particular cases.</p>
          <p>1.—1, 2. Justice is roughly defined as the habit from <lb/>
            which men are apt to perform just actions and entertain <lb/>
            just wishes.</p>
          <p>Injustice is the contrary habit.</p>
          <p>3, 4. The same capacity and science comprehends within <lb/>
            its sphere contraries, but a habit cannot be of contraries.</p>
          <p>And if we know the things connected with a habit, we <lb/>
            know the habit itself.</p>
          <p>5—7. Therefore, if we know what <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂδικον</foreign>means, we know <lb/>
            what <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκαιον</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικαιοσύνη</foreign> mean. <lb/>
            Now, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂδικον</foreign> implies the unlawful and the unequal. <lb/>
            Therefore, the just is the lawful and the equal.</p>
          <p>8—11. The object of the law is to direct and enforce <lb/>
            virtue.</p>
          <p>12—14. Therefore, justice, which has to do with law, is <lb/>
            perfect virtue, considered not absolutely, but relatively.</p>
          <p>II.—1—5. Besides this universal justice, there is a parti­ <lb/>
            cular justice also, which is violated when the law is broken <lb/>
            for the sake of gain. <lb/>
            It differs from universal justice as a part from a whole.</p>
          <p>6, 7. The consideration of universal justice is dismissed.</p>
          <p>8. 9. Particular justice is of two kinds.</p>
          <p>(1.) Distributive of the honours, &amp;c. of the state.</p>
          <p>(2.) Corrective, in transactions between man and man.</p>
          <p>Transactions are twofold-voluntary and involuntary.</p>
          <p>III.—1. Justice implies equality.</p>
          <p>The equal is a mean between more and less.</p>
          <p>Therefore the just is a mean.</p>
          <p>2. It is conversant with four terms at least, two persons <lb/>
            and two things.</p><pb n="xl"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK V."/> ' 3—7. Distributive justice pays respect to the relative <lb/>
            merits of the persons, and in it geometrical proportion is <lb/>
            observed.</p>
          <p>IV.—1—3. The province of corrective justice, is transac­ <lb/>
            tions of all kinds.</p>
          <p>In it no respect is paid to persons. <lb/>
            The object of it is to remedy inequalities of loss and gain. <lb/>
            Under these terms are included all cases of wrong; as the <lb/>
            doer of a wrong may be considered as a gainer, and the <lb/>
            injured party a loser. <lb/>
            The proportion observed is arithmetical.</p>
          <p>4. The corrective just is a mean between loss and gain.</p>
          <p>5. The judge is a living personification of the principle.</p>
          <p>6, 7. From his remedying inequality according to the rule <lb/>
            of arithmetical proportion, arises the etymology of the term <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκαιον</foreign>.</p>
          <p>8—10. The method of determining the mean explained <lb/>
            and illustrated.</p>
          <p>V.—1. The Pythagoreans were wrong in considering reta­ <lb/>
            liation (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άπλω̃ς</foreign>) as justice.</p>
          <p>That it is not distributive justice, is self-evident.</p>
          <p>It is not corrective justice, because in many cases it would <lb/>
            be unjust.</p>
          <p>2. By retaliation (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κατ' άναλογία</foreign>) civil society is held <lb/>
            together.</p>
          <p>3. This proportion is attained by what Aristotle terms <lb/>
            diametrical conjunction.</p>
          <p>And equality is produced by observing the relative pro­ <lb/>
            portion between persons and things.</p>
          <p>4. This cannot be effected without a common measure.</p>
          <p>5—9. This common measure is demand, or its substitute <lb/>
            money.</p>
          <p>10—12. It is the least fluctuating standard of value, and <lb/>
            a pledge that we can at any time get what we want.</p>
          <p>14, 15. Justice differs from all the other virtues in the <lb/>
            following respect; that they are mean states, whereas in <lb/>
            justice TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">δκαιον</foreign> is itself the mean.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, Aristotle defines justice and injustice.</p>
          <p>VI.—1, 2. It does not follow that a man is unjust be­ <lb/>
            cause he commits an unjust act.</p>
          <p>3. Political justice is that which exists between members</p><pb n="xli"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. IX.j"/> of a free community, and this, as well as abstract justice, is <lb/>
            the object of Aristotle's investigation.</p>
          <p>7. Justice in the cases of master and slave, father and <lb/>
            child, is not the same as political justice; but that between <lb/>
            husband and wife most resembles it.</p>
          <p>VII.—1. Political or social justice is of two kinds:</p>
          <p>(1.). Natural. (2.) Legal.</p>
          <p>The former is everywhere the same, the latter is arbitrary,</p>
          <p>2, 3. They are wrong who hold that all things just are <lb/>
            matters of law, and that there is no natural unchangeable <lb/>
            principle of justice.</p>
          <p>4. Legal justice depends upon agreement, and varies in <lb/>
            different countries, like their measures of corn and wine.</p>
          <p>5, 6. Before a tiling is committed, it is unjust (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂδικον</foreign>); <lb/>
            when committed, it is an act of injustice (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άδίκημα</foreign>); so like­ <lb/>
            wise, a just act is <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικιοράγηα</foreign>, the correction of an unjust <lb/>
            act, <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικαίωμα</foreign>.</p>
          <p>VIII.—1, 2. The justice or injustice of an act is deter­ <lb/>
            mined by its being voluntary or involuntary.</p>
          <p>3—6. A voluntary act is that which is done knowingly, <lb/>
            not by compulsion nor by accident.</p>
          <p>7. Voluntary acts are done from deliberate preference, or <lb/>
            not.</p>
          <p>8, 9. If a hurt takes place accidentally, it is an accident. <lb/>
            If without wicked intent, it is an error.</p>
          <p>10. If knowingly, but without previous deliberation, it is <lb/>
            an unjust act.</p>
          <p>11, 12. If a man acts on <foreign xml:lang="grc">προαίρεσις</foreign>, he is an unjust man.</p>
          <p>13. He who acts justly on <foreign xml:lang="grc">προαίρεσις</foreign> is a just man. <lb/>
            IX.—1. Can a man be injured with his own consent ?</p>
          <p>2. The same question may arise as to being justly dealt with.</p>
          <p>3, 4. Is he who has suffered an injury always necessarily <lb/>
            injured ?</p>
          <p>5. Can a man injure himself?</p>
          <p>6—8. These questions are answered at once, by stating, <lb/>
            that, in order that a man may be injured, the condition is re­ <lb/>
            quisite, that the hurt should be inflicted against his will.</p>
          <p>The case of the incontinent man, who often harms himself, <lb/>
            constitutes no objection.</p>
          <p>9. Does he who has awaraded too great a share, or he who <lb/>
            receives it, commit the injury ?</p><pb n="xlii"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK V."/> Does he who awards too little to himself injure himself ?</p>
          <p>10. The second question is already answered by the fact <lb/>
            that the harm he suffers is not against his will.</p>
          <p>11—14. To the first the answer is, that it is the distri­ <lb/>
            butor, and not the receiver, who acts unjustly.</p>
          <p>The receiver does unjust acts, but does not act unjustly</p>
          <p>He who decides through ignorance is unjust in a certain <lb/>
            sense.</p>
          <p>15, 16. People are apt to think that the practice and <lb/>
            knowledge of justice are easy.</p>
          <p>This is not the case.</p>
          <p>17,18. For in estimating the justice or injustice of an <lb/>
            action, we must look not to the act, but the habit.</p>
          <p>X.—1, 2. How is it if equity differs from justice, that it as <lb/>
            well as justice is praiseworthy ?</p>
          <p>3—7. Although they differ, they are not opposed; the fact <lb/>
            being, that equity corrects the errors of law, which errors <lb/>
            are unavoidable, because the general enactments of the law <lb/>
            will not always apply to particular cases.</p>
          <p>8. The equitable man is one who does not push the letter <lb/>
            of the law to the furthest or the worst side, but is disposed <lb/>
            to make allowances.</p>
          <p>XI.—1, 2. Although it has been already proved that a <lb/>
            man cannot injure himself, Aristotle adduces additional <lb/>
            arguments in support of this position.</p>
          <p>In universal justice he cannot, because to do what the <lb/>
            law forbids is an offence against the law, not against himself</p>
          <p>For example, suicide is an offence against the law.</p>
          <p>3—5. Four reasons are also given to prove that a man can­ <lb/>
            not injure himself in particular injustice.</p>
          <p>6, 7. Is it worse to injure or to be injured ?</p>
          <p>Both are bad; but to injure is the worse, as implying de­ <lb/>
            pravity ; but, accidentally, to be injured may be worse.</p>
          <p>8, 9. Metaphorically a man may be said to injure himself <lb/>
            because we may imagine a kind of justice subsisting between <lb/>
            the two parts of his soul.</p><pb n="xliii"/>

            <title type="sub">BOOK VI.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Introductory.—In this book Aristotle has two objects in <lb/>
            view : to treat of the intellectual virtues, and to show the <lb/>
            relation in which right reason stands to moral virtue. Ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the definition which he gave of moral virtue, the <lb/>
            intellect is the directing and governing power, to whose <lb/>
            dictates and suggestions the other parts of man's nature <lb/>
            must be obedient, and right reason and the possession of an <lb/>
            intellectual virtue (<foreign xml:lang="grc">φρόνησις</foreign>) has the province of deciding the <lb/>
            relative mean, which constitutes the characteristic of virtuous <lb/>
            habits.</p>
          <p>Now, referring to the division of the soul in the first <lb/>
            book, we find that one part is purely rational. The object- <lb/>
            matter of this part of the soul is truth: truth in necessary, <lb/>
            and truth in contingent matter. The habits of mind which <lb/>
            contemplate truth in necessary matter are, that which <lb/>
            takes cognizance of principles (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νου̃ς</foreign>), and that which takes <lb/>
            cognizance of deductions from principles (<foreign xml:lang="grc">έπιστήμη</foreign>). These <lb/>
            two combined make up <foreign xml:lang="grc">σοφία</foreign>, which implies a perfect know­ <lb/>
            ledge of scientific truth. In contingent matter, the habit <lb/>
            which takes cognizance of moral truth is <foreign xml:lang="grc">φρόνησις</foreign>, and that <lb/>
            which operates upon truth as related to productions is <foreign xml:lang="grc">τεχνή</foreign>-</p>
          <p>These, then, are the five intellectual habits which Aristotle <lb/>
            considers it necessary to discuss as connected with the <lb/>
            subject of ethics. Of course, it must not be supposed that <lb/>
            this discussion will embrace the whole of Aristotle's psycho­ <lb/>
            logical system, as this must be sought for in his Treatise <lb/>
            on the SouL</p>
          <p>I.—1—3. Since we ought to choose the mean, and since <lb/>
            right reason determines what that mean is, we must investi­ <lb/>
            gate the subject of right reason.</p>
          <p>4. The soul has been supposed to consist of two parts : <lb/>
            the rational, in which the intellectual virtues reside; the <lb/>
            irrational, which is the seat of the moral virtues. The <lb/>
            rational part is subdivided into the <foreign xml:lang="grc">έπιστηνικὸν</foreign>, which con­ <lb/>
            templates necessary matter, and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">λογιστικὸν</foreign>, which con­ <lb/>
            templates contingent matter.</p><pb n="xliv"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK VI."/> By <foreign xml:lang="grc">λογιστικὸν</foreign> Aristotle means deliberative, for no one <lb/>
            deliberates respecting necessary matter.</p>
          <p>Right reason must be the virtue of one of these parts. <lb/>
            In order, therefore, to see what it is, we must ascertain what <lb/>
            is the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἓργον</foreign> of each.</p>
          <p>II.—1, 2. There are three principles or functions of the <lb/>
            soul which influence moral action and truth.</p>
          <p>These are sensation, intellect, and appetite.</p>
          <p>Now sensation is the origin of no moral action. The <lb/>
            origin of moral action is <foreign xml:lang="grc">προαίρεσις</foreign>, which is made up of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὃρεξις</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγος</foreign>. If, therefore, the action is virtuous, the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὃρεξις</foreign> must be right, and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγος</foreign> true.</p>
          <p>Therefore truth is the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἓργον</foreign> of the reasoning or delibera­ <lb/>
            tive part.</p>
          <p>3. It is evident that truth is the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἓργονο</foreign>f the scientific <lb/>
            part.</p>
          <p>4, 5. Practical intellect, and not pure intellect, is the <lb/>
            motive principle of moral action.</p>
          <p>6. Nothing past is the object of deliberate preference.</p>
          <p>III.—1. There are five habits by which the soul arrives at <lb/>
            truth,-art, science, prudence, wisdom, a and intuition.</p>
          <p>2. Science is conversant with things eternal, immutable, <lb/>
            and is acquired by learning.</p>
          <p>3. We learn by means of induction and syllogism.</p>
          <p>To know a subject scientifically, we must not only know <lb/>
            facts, but also the logical connection between them, and the <lb/>
            Erst principles from which they are derived.</p>
          <p>4. Therefore science is " a demonstrative habit." But in <lb/>
            order to make the definition complete, all those other parts <lb/>
            of it must be added which are given in the Later Analy­ <lb/>
            tics, I. 1, 2.</p>
          <p>IV.—1, 2. Contingent matter may be either made or <lb/>
            practised.</p>
          <p>Therefore there must be two habits conversant with con­ <lb/>
            tingent matter; namely, a practical habit joined with reason. <lb/>
            and a productive habit joined with reason. <note type="footnote"> 2 Although <foreign xml:lang="grc">σοφία</foreign> is sometimes translated science, and doubtless i. <lb/>
            does imply that knowledge of abstract truth which is implied by that <lb/>
            term, I have preferred, on the whole, translating it wisdom, because wis­ <lb/>
            dom is used by old English authors in the same way in which <foreign xml:lang="grc">σοφία</foreign> is <lb/>
            used by the Greeks, to express skill in the arts.-See Exodus XXXVI. 1. </note> <pb n="xlv"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. VII.]"/> The latter of these is art.</p>
          <p>3. Art is conversant with three processes : production, <lb/>
            contrivance, and contemplation as to the mode of contriving <lb/>
            and producing.</p>
          <p>4. A relation subsists between chance and art.</p>
          <p>Art is defined "a habit of making, joined with true reason."</p>
          <p>V.—1. According to his common practice, Aristotle inves­ <lb/>
            tigates what prudence is, by considering it in the concrete.</p>
          <p>The prudent man is one who is apt to deliberate respecting <lb/>
            that which is his interest.</p>
          <p>2. The matter of <foreign xml:lang="grc">φρόνησις</foreign> differs from that of <foreign xml:lang="grc">έπιστήμη</foreign>.</p>
          <p>Prudence, therefore, is a true habit joined with reason, <lb/>
            and practical, having to do with the subjects of human good <lb/>
            and evil.</p>
          <p>4. This definition is illustrated by the examples of Pericles <lb/>
            and others, and also by the etymology of <foreign xml:lang="grc">σωφροσύνη</foreign>.</p>
          <p>5. It is clear that intemperance destroys <foreign xml:lang="grc">φρόνησις</foreign>, although <lb/>
            it may not pervert our ideas on scientific subjects.</p>
          <p>Prudence differs from art.</p>
          <p>6. (1.) Because in prudence there are no degrees of excel­ <lb/>
            lence, in art there are.</p>
          <p>(2.) Because in art voluntary error is better, in pru <lb/>
            dence worse.</p>
          <p>Prudence, finally, must be something more than a mere <lb/>
            habit joined with reason; for such habits can be forgotten, <lb/>
            prudence cannot.</p>
          <p>VI.—1. There must be a habit which takes cognizance of <lb/>
            those first principles from which science draws its conclusions.</p>
          <p>It cannot be science, for that is a demonstrative habit.</p>
          <p>It cannot be art or prudence, because they are conversant <lb/>
            with contingent matter.</p>
          <p>2. It cannot be wisdom, because wisdom demands demon­ <lb/>
            stration.</p>
          <p>Therefore it must be <foreign xml:lang="grc">νοῡς</foreign> (intuition).</p>
          <p>VII.—1. In the arts, by the term wisdom (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σοφία</foreign>) we <lb/>
            mean skill.</p>
          <p>But there is a general sense of the term, as well as this <lb/>
            special one.</p>
          <p>2, 3. Wisdom is the most accurate of all knowledge. <lb/>
            It knows the principles, and the facts deduced from them. <lb/>
            It is, therefore, intuition and science combined together.</p><pb n="xlvi"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK VI."/> It surpasses political science or prudence, (1) inasmuch as <lb/>
            the subjects with which it is conversant are superior to man.</p>
          <p>(2.) Because its suojects are invariable.</p>
          <p>(3.) Because, in a certain sense, even brute animals may <lb/>
            be said to be prudent.</p>
          <p>4, 5. Wisdom is superior to the science of social life, be­ <lb/>
            cause, though man may be superior to all other animals, still <lb/>
            there are many other things more divine than man.</p>
          <p>Wisdom, therefore, is science, combined with intuition.</p>
          <p>Hence Anaxagoras, Thales, &amp;c., are called wise, but not <lb/>
            prudent.</p>
          <p>7. Prudence must have a knowledge of particulars as well <lb/>
            as of universals.</p>
          <p>8. Nay, particulars may possibly be even more important <lb/>
            than universals.</p>
          <p>VIII.—1. Political prudence and prudence are the same <lb/>
            habit, but they differ, in that the object of the former is the <lb/>
            good of the state, that of the latter the good of the individual.</p>
          <p>2. There are various species of prudence, which are best <lb/>
            exhibited in the following table :— <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_11_fig2.jpg"/></figure></p>
          <p>3, 4. Prudence properly relates to our own affairs, and hence <lb/>
            politicians are sometimes called busy-bodies. But still the <lb/>
            happiness of the individual is so intimately involved with <lb/>
            the good of his family and his country, that we cannot be <lb/>
            devoted to the one to the exclusion of the others.</p>
          <p>5, 6. Prudence is not easy to acquire; in proof of which <lb/>
            we may adduce the fact that young men may become <foreign xml:lang="grc">σοφοὶ</foreign> <lb/>
            but not easily <foreign xml:lang="grc">φρόνιμοι</foreign> Besides, the possibility of error is <lb/>
            twofold,-in the universal and the particular.</p><pb n="xlvii"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. XI.]"/> Prudence is not science ; because science is conversant with <lb/>
            universals, prudence with particulars.</p>
          <p>These particulars are not the first principles from which <lb/>
            scientific conclusions are deduced, of which <foreign xml:lang="grc">νοῡς</foreign> takes cogni­ <lb/>
            zance, but (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἓσχατα</foreign>) the last results at which we arrive after <lb/>
            deliberation, which are perceived by common sense. There­ <lb/>
            fore prudence is opposed to intuition.a</p>
          <p>IX.—1. Prudence implies deliberation, which is a kind of <lb/>
            investigation.</p>
          <p>Good deliberation is not science ; because no one investi­ <lb/>
            gates what he knows.</p>
          <p>2. It is not happy conjecture; for this is quick, whereas <lb/>
            deliberation requires time.</p>
          <p>It is not, therefore, sagacity.</p>
          <p>3. It is not opinion.</p>
          <p>It is a correctness ; not of science, because in science <lb/>
            there can be no error, and therefore no correctness.</p>
          <p>Nor of opinion; because the correctness of opinion is <lb/>
            truth.</p>
          <p>4. It is a correctness of <foreign xml:lang="grc">διάνοια</foreign>, not simply, but of the <lb/>
            intellect pursuing a deliberative process.</p>
          <p>5—8. In what, then, does correctness of deliberation <lb/>
            consist ?</p>
          <p>(1.) The goodness of the end.</p>
          <p>(2.) The propriety of the mean.</p>
          <p>(3.) The sufficiency of the time.</p>
          <p>9. Hence Aristotle derives his definition of <foreign xml:lang="grc">εύουλία</foreign>.</p>
          <p>X.—1. Intelligence is not identical with science or opinion; <lb/>
            for if it were, as all men are capable of acquiring science <lb/>
            and forming opinions, all men might be intelligent; but <lb/>
            this is not the case.</p>
          <p>2—5. It is not conversant with the objects of science, <lb/>
            but with those of prudence.</p>
          <p>It differs from prudence, in that prudence dictates and <lb/>
            prescribes, intelligence judges and decides.</p>
          <p>XI.—1. Candour (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γνώμη</foreign>) is the correct decision of the <lb/>
            equitable man.</p>
          <p>Fellow-feeling (<foreign xml:lang="grc">συγγνώμη</foreign>), the correct discriminating can­ <lb/>
            dour of the equitable man. <note type="footnote"> a The <foreign xml:lang="grc">άρχαὶ</foreign>, or principia sciendi, are those first principles which are <lb/>

              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_11_fig3.jpg"/></figure>(which here means practical common sense, the habit which <lb/>
              takes cognizance of the practical extremes), are the practical <lb/>
              habits, and all tend to the same point, and are usually found <lb/>
              combined in the same person. As the practical habits seem <lb/>
              not to be the result of teaching, but rather of observation, <lb/>
              they have been thought natural gifts.</p>
          <p>5. This view is corroborated by the fact that they seem <lb/>
            peculiarly to belong to certain periods of life.</p>
          <p>6. Hence we ought to pay attention to the sayings of the <lb/>
            old, even though undemonstrated; because experience has <lb/>
            sharpened their powers of observation.</p>
          <p>XII.—1. A question might arise as to the utility of <lb/>
            wisdom and prudence; for</p>
          <p>(1.) Wisdom does not contemplate the means of human <lb/>
            happiness.</p>
          <p>2. (2.) If prudence is merely knowledge, that alone will <lb/>
            not give us virtuous habits.</p>
          <p>3. (3.) Prudence is useless to whose who already possess <lb/>
            virtue, and also to those who have not acquired <lb/>
            it; for they can listen to the instructions of those <lb/>
            who have.</p>
          <p>(4.) It seems absurd that prudence, the inferior, should <lb/>
            ' dictate to wisdom, the superior.</p>
          <p>4. To these doubts and questions, it may be answered-</p>
          <p>(1.) That these virtues, because they are virtues, would <lb/>
            be eligible for their own sake, even if they pro­ <lb/>
            duced no effect.</p>
          <p>(2.) They do produce an effect, as being the formal <lb/>
            cause of happiness.</p>
          <p>5. (3.) Man's <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἓργονι</foreign>s accomplished by means of prudence <lb/>
            and moral virtue.</p>
          <p>6, 7. (4.) Virtue makes the deliberate preference correct; <lb/>
            but the acts in which the moral principle is <lb/>
            developed are directed by some other faculty.</p>
          <p>8. This faculty is <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεινότης</foreign> (cleverness). If its aim is bad, <lb/>
            it becomes <foreign xml:lang="grc">πανουργία</foreign> (craft).</p>
          <p>•9. It is not prudence, but is improved and educated <lb/>
            into prudence.</p>
          <p>Now, when we act morally, we always act upon a. syl <lb/>
            logism.</p><pb n="xlix"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAT. XIII.]"/> Our major premiss is-Such and such a thing is the end; <lb/>
            our minor-This act is such and such a thing.</p>
          <p>Now, prudence supplies the middle term ; and yet no one <lb/>
            but the good man, whose moral vision is not distorted by <lb/>
            depravity, can discern it.</p>
          <p>Therefore virtue and prudence are inseparably connected.</p>
          <p>XIII.—1. Now, as prudence is to cleverness, so is natural <lb/>
            virtue to virtue proper, i. e. perfected and matured.</p>
          <p>2. Natural virtue exists in children, but without intellect <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νοῡς</foreign>) ; it is blind, and may stumble and fall.</p>
          <p>Add <foreign xml:lang="grc">νοῡς</foreign>, and it becomes virtue proper.</p>
          <p>3, 4. As virtue proper cannot be formed without pru­ <lb/>
            dence, Socrates and others supposed that the virtues were <lb/>
            prudences. They were partly right and partly wrong. They <lb/>
            thought the virtues were simply intellectual processes. Axis­ <lb/>
            totle says they are joined with reason.</p>
          <p>5. Prudence, therefore, and moral virtue, are inseparable, <lb/>
            but when we say this, we mean virtue proper, for the <lb/>
            natural virtues are separable.</p>
          <p>Aristotle again repeats his former answers to Questions (1) <lb/>
            and (2), and answers Question (4), by saying that prudence <lb/>
            prescribes and dictates, not to wisdom, but for the sake of it.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>Introductory. — According to the division adopted by <lb/>
            Michelet, Aristotle here commences the third part of his <lb/>
            treatise ; namely, that which treats of the instrumentals to <lb/>
            virtue. Up to this point he has contemplated the virtues, <lb/>
            both moral and intellectual, theoretically as perfect, and as if <lb/>
            mankind were capable of attaining moral and intellectual <lb/>
            perfection. This is, of course, the most philosophical way to <lb/>
            investigate the moral laws of man's nature, as well as the <lb/>
            physical laws by which the material universe is governed. <lb/>
            But before the results to which we arrive can be reduced to <lb/>
            practice, they, in both cases, require to be modified by facts <lb/>
            and by experience.</p>
          <p>Now, whether man can or cannot attain to perfect virtue, <lb/>
            there can be no doubt that if he aims at happiness, he muat <pb n="l"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK VII."/> <lb/>
            endeavour to do so. He must labour to form imperfect <lb/>
            habits of virtue in his onward course towards the acquisition <lb/>
            of perfect virtue. He must earnestly strive to improve <lb/>
            them day by day, and thus gradually approach nearer and <lb/>
            nearer to the standard of absolute perfection, which is coinci­ <lb/>
            dent with the idea of perfect virtue. Now, in order to this, <lb/>
            he must strive to form habits of self-control; he must <lb/>
            struggle against the obstacles which the infirmities of his <lb/>
            natural constitution place in his way; he must master as <lb/>
            well as he can his passions, which, by their strength and evil <lb/>
            bias, lead him astray from the right path.</p>
          <p>The imperfect habit of self-restraint which man will thus <lb/>
            form, and which, by perseverance, he will improve and <lb/>
            strengthen, is termed by Aristotle <foreign xml:lang="grc">έγκράτια</foreign> (continence), <lb/>
            to distinguish it from <foreign xml:lang="grc">σωφροσύνη</foreign> (temperance), which implies <lb/>
            that the bad passions and appetites are entirely overcome, <lb/>
            and are completely under the control of right reason.</p>
          <p>The imperfect habit, then, is evidently instrumental, and <lb/>
            necessarily instrumental, to the formation of the perfect one ; <lb/>
            and to the investigation of the nature of this habit, and the <lb/>
            subjects related, Aristotle devotes this book.</p>
          <p>We must next inquire with what view Aristotle has <lb/>
            introduced here the subjects of heroic virtue and brutality. <lb/>
            There is no point which he so earnestly endeavours to im­ <lb/>
            press upon his hearers as this, that the subject of ethical <lb/>
            philosophy is human happiness, and virtue and vice, so far as <lb/>
            they come within the province of man, and so far as his <lb/>
            moral nature is capable of ther. But as there are beings <lb/>
            whose nature is superior to that of man, that is, the Deity, <lb/>
            and, according to the popular belief (which he always con­ <lb/>
            siders deserving of respect and consideration), demi-gods and <lb/>
            heroes, so are there human beings who, by defect of nature, <lb/>
            or early depravity, have become degraded below the rank <lb/>
            which man occupies amongst created beings.</p>
          <p>The virtue which belongs to the former Aristotle desig­ <lb/>
            nates heroic virtue ; the vice which characterizes the latter <lb/>
            he terms brutality. The discussion of these must not be, <lb/>
            of., course, considered as forming part of Aristotle's ethical <lb/>
            system, but rather as questions of curiosity parallel to his <lb/>
            examination of man's moral habits, and helping to illustrate <lb/>
            and throw light on their nature.</p><pb n="li"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. II."/> The attempt which Socrates and his followers made to <lb/>
            establish the purely intellectual nature of moral virtue, the <lb/>
            exactness and mathematical certainty of moral science, and <lb/>
            of the reasoning processes by which its facts and phenomena <lb/>
            are demonstrated, causes another question to arise connected <lb/>
            with the subject of continence. This is, whether the inconti­ <lb/>
            nent man acts contrary to knowledge.</p>
          <p>These two dogmas are directly contradictory to the moral <lb/>
            theory of Aristotle, and, notwithstanding what he says in <lb/>
            the conclusion respecting the superiority of the happiness <lb/>
            and satisfaction derived from intellectual contemplation, he <lb/>
            is consistent in combating them throughout.</p>
          <p>I.-1, 2. There are three forms of what is to be avoided in <lb/>
            morals-vice, incontinence, and brutality.</p>
          <p>Three contrary to these to be sought-virtue, continence, <lb/>
            heroic virtue.</p>
          <p>3. Heroic virtue and brutality are extremely rare. The <lb/>
            latter is generally found amongst savages, and those suffering <lb/>
            from disease or maiming.</p>
          <p>4. Aristotle, in treating of continence and patience, incon­ <lb/>
            tinence and effeminacy, states and discusses the opinions <lb/>
            generally entertained, and then examines and solves diffi­ <lb/>
            culties.</p>
          <p>5. The opinions commonly held are seven in number; these <lb/>
            he enumerates and afterwards discusses in the subsequent <lb/>
            chapters.</p>
          <p>II.—1. He first discusses Opinion III.; namely, how one <lb/>
            who forms a right conception can be incontinent.</p>
          <p>Socrates thought it absurd that, if a man had knowledge, <lb/>
            anything else should master him.</p>
          <p>2. Others thought that an incontinent man might possess, <lb/>
            not knowledge, but opinion.</p>
          <p>If they mean a weak opinion, and his desires are strong, <lb/>
            then to yield is pardonable; but incontinence is blameable <lb/>
            and nothing blameable is pardonable.</p>
          <p>3. If not a weak opinion, or knowledge, they must mean <lb/>
            prudence (this is Opinion VI.) ; but it is impossible, accoro­ <lb/>
            ing to Aristotle's theory already laid down, for the same mar <lb/>
            to be prudent and incontinent.</p>
          <p>4. If the continent man resists strong and bad desiree <lb/>
            he is not the same as the temperate man this is Opi­ <note type="footnote">d </note> <pb n="lii"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[ROOK VII"/> <lb/>
            ilion IV.) ; if he resists weak ones, there is nothing great IL <lb/>
            so doing.</p>
          <p>5. If continence is the same as perseverance in every <lb/>
            opinion, it would sometimes be bad, and incontinence would <lb/>
            oe good. (Opinion II.)</p>
          <p>6. Again, if, by sophistical reasoning, a man is led to <lb/>
            admit premisses and therefore is forced to admit, but cannot <lb/>
            approve of the conclusion, he would be considered inconti­ <lb/>
            nent, because unable to refute the argument.</p>
          <p>7. Thirdly. If this is the case, incontinence, together with <lb/>
            folly, would make up virtue.</p>
          <p>8. Fourthly. On this supposition, incontinence would be <lb/>
            incurable, and therefore worse than intemperance, which <lb/>
            cannot be the case.</p>
          <p>These four arguments refute Opinion II.</p>
          <p>9. If temperance and continence are conversant with every­ <lb/>
            thing, what is meant by simple continence ? (Opinion VII.)</p>
          <p>III.—1—4. Certain questions are here proposed, of which <lb/>
            the first and most important is answered in the following <lb/>
            manner. That the temperate and the continent are con­ <lb/>
            versant with the same object-matter, but they differ in their <lb/>
            relation to it.</p>
          <p>The temperate and intemperate act from deliberate prefer­ <lb/>
            ence ; the incontinent knows what is right, but does not <lb/>
            pursue it.</p>
          <p>5. As to the question whether the incontinent acts con­ <lb/>
            trary to knowledge, it may be said that knowledge implies <lb/>
            either the possession only, or the possession and use of it.</p>
          <p>6. In the syllogisms of moral action, there are two pre­ <lb/>
            misses, the universal and the particular. Now, a man may <lb/>
            possess both, but only use the universal.</p>
          <p>7. There is also a difference in the universal: it may <lb/>
            relate partly to oneself, partly to the matter in hand. If <lb/>
            the particular to be attached to the universal, as a minor <lb/>
            to a major premiss, relates to oneself, then the knowledge of <lb/>
            the major involves that of the minor; if it relates to the <lb/>
            matter in hand, this knowledge is not implied: in the one <lb/>
            case it would be strange that a man possessing knowledge <lb/>
            should act wrong; in the other it would not.</p>
          <p>8. Again, some obstacle, such as sleep, madness, to which <lb/>
            passion is similar, may prevent knowledge from acting.</p><pb n="liii"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP, IV.]"/> 9, We must not suppose that the utterance of moral <lb/>
            sentiments is a proof of knowledge exerting itself.</p>
          <p>10, 11. The question may also be considered physically, <lb/>
            that is, according to the principles on which the mind carries <lb/>
            on its operations.</p>
          <p>As we always act on a syllogism, suppose, for example, the <lb/>
            presence in the mind of the minor premiss, " This is sweet," <lb/>
            the knowledge of which we gain by <foreign xml:lang="grc">αίσθησις</foreign> (sensation, either <lb/>
            mental or bodily). To this we may apply, as a major <lb/>
            premiss, "Everything sweet is pleasant," instead of one <lb/>
            which forbids self-indulgence. The consequence is, that if <lb/>
            we are under the influence of desire or appetite, we act <lb/>
            wrong. Had we applied the other major premiss, we should <lb/>
            have acted right. Hence it is desire, and not the opinion to <lb/>
            which we have logically come, which opposes right reason. <lb/>
            In other words, in the case of incontinence, desire resists <lb/>
            reason, and is victorious; whereas, if it had not been for <lb/>
            desire, we should have come to a right conclusion, and acted <lb/>
            in obedience to the dictates of reason.</p>
          <p>12. Brutes, therefore, cannot be incontinent, because they <lb/>
            act from instinct, and not from a reasoning process.</p>
          <p>13, 14. How the incontinent is to regain the knowledge <lb/>
            he has lost, Aristotle considers a question for the physiolo­ <lb/>
            gist. (The term " physics," as used in this chapter, of course <lb/>
            includes metaphysics.)</p>
          <p>IV.—1.Is there such a thing as incontinence "simply" <lb/>
            or "absolutely?" (Opinion VII.)</p>
          <p>It is plain that the continent and patient are so with <lb/>
            respect to pleasures and pains.</p>
          <p>2. The causes of pleasures are of two kinds:- <lb/>
            (1.) Necessary. (2.) Unnecessary.</p>
          <p>When a man is incontinent with respect to the lattei. we <lb/>
            add the difference, as, for instance, we say-</p>
          <p>3. Incontinent of anger, of gain, &amp;c. The term inconti­ <lb/>
            nence is applied analogically.</p>
          <p>4. Those who are incontinent in bodily enjoyments, we <lb/>
            call incontinent simply.</p>
          <p>A proof of this is, that it is only this incontinence which <lb/>
            is blamed as a vice, and not as an error.</p>
          <p>5. Another proof is, that, with respect to these pleasures, <lb/>
            men are called effeminate (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μαλακοί</foreign>). <note type="footnote"> d 2 </note> <pb n="liv"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="(BOOK. VII."/> Delibeiate preference makes the difference between inlem­ <lb/>
            perance and incontinence.</p>
          <p>G. The degree of intemperance is inverselv as the strength <lb/>
            of the temptation.</p>
          <p>7. Pleasant things maybe arranged undei three heads :—</p>
          <p>(1.) Those which are in their nature eligible.</p>
          <p>(2.) The contrary to these.</p>
          <p>(3. Those which are between both.</p>
          <p>8. The incontinent with respect to the first and second <lb/>
            kind are not blamed for desiring them, but for excess in so <lb/>
            doing.</p>
          <p>9. Still, as these pleasures are not vicious, the excess, <lb/>
            though blameable, does not amount to vice.</p>
          <p>The term incontinent is applied because of the similarity <lb/>
            of the affection, just as we may call a roan a bad physician, <lb/>
            although we would not call him a bad man.</p>
          <p>V.—1—3. Things pleasant are divided in the following <lb/>
            way :— <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_11_fig4.jpg"/></figure></p>
          <p>4—8. No one would call him incontinent in whom nature <lb/>
            or custom is the cause of his diseased state j such a man, <lb/>
            strictly speaking, is not vicious, but vitiated, and his state is <lb/>
            a morbid one.</p>
          <p>9. If he does conquer his brutal inclination, he is only <lb/>
            called continent metaphorically.</p>
          <p>VI.—1—3. Incontinence of anger is less disgraceful than <lb/>
            incontinence of desire.</p>
          <p>(1.) Because anger does appear to listen to reason, but <lb/>
            listens imperfectly; whilst desire rushes to en­ <lb/>
            joyment, in obedience to mere instinct.</p>
          <p>4, 5. (2.) Anger is more natural and therefore more par­ <lb/>
            donable, than desire, even when carried to excess.</p>
          <p>6. (3.) Anger is open in its attacks, desire is insidious, <lb/>
            and therefore more unjust.</p><pb n="lv"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. VIII.]"/> 7. (4.) The feeling of anger is attended with pain, and is <lb/>
            not accompanied with wanton insolence ; but the <lb/>
            gratification of lustful desires is attended with <lb/>
            pleasure, and implies wanton insult also.</p>
          <p>8. The object-matter of continence is the bodily pleasures <lb/>
            which are proper to man. The term cannot be applied to <lb/>
            orutes, because they, like insane persons, have no deliberate <lb/>
            preference.</p>
          <p>9. Brutality is, morally considered, not so bad as vice, but <lb/>
            it is more terrible ; because it implies the entire absence and <lb/>
            want, not the corruption of the best principle.</p>
          <p>VII.-1. The incontinent is he who is disposed to yield <lb/>
            to such pleasures as most men are superior to.</p>
          <p>The continent is superior to those pleasures to which <lb/>
            most men yield.</p>
          <p>Substitute pains for pleasures, and the former case is that <lb/>
            of the effeminate, the latter that of the patient.</p>
          <p>The moral character of most men is something between <lb/>
            these two.</p>
          <p>2. lie who pursues pleasure in excess, or avoids bodily <lb/>
            pain from deliberate preference, is intemperate.</p>
          <p>He is incapable of repentance, and therefore incurable.</p>
          <p>3. The incontinent and effeminate are not so bad as the <lb/>
            intemperate.</p>
          <p>4, 5. Continence is opposed to incontinence, patience to <lb/>
            effeminacy. Patience implies resistance, continence victory; <lb/>
            therefore continence is better than patience.</p>
          <p>6. To yield to excessive pleasure and pain is by no means <lb/>
            astonishing, but pardonable.</p>
          <p>But to yield to pleasures and pains which most men resist, <lb/>
            is astonishing.</p>
          <p>7. He who is devoted to sport is effeminate, rather than <lb/>
            intemperate.</p>
          <p>8. There are two sorts of incontinence ; namely, weakness <lb/>
            and precipitancy.</p>
          <p>9. The latter is that to which the quick and choleric are <lb/>
            liable.</p>
          <p>VIII.-1. Intemperance is not inclined to repentance, <lb/>
            incontinence is ; therefore the former, like chronic diseases, is <lb/>
            incurable, the latter, like acute diseases, is curable; the latter <lb/>
            is unperceived, the former not so.</p><pb n="lvi"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK VII."/> 2.Of incontinent persons, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἱ ἐκστικοὶ</foreign> are the better.</p>
          <p>3. Incontinence is not vice absolutely, but only in a <lb/>
            certain sense, because the principle of moral action is not <lb/>
            corrupted.</p>
          <p>4, 5. The intemperate acts from a perverted principle, and <lb/>
            his state, therefore, is a hopeless one.</p>
          <p>IX.-1. The question (II.) is again considered ; namely, <lb/>
            whether the continent man is identical with him who abides <lb/>
            by his opinion.</p>
          <p>The answer is, that those are absolutely continent or in­ <lb/>
            continent who abide by a true opinion, those who abide by <lb/>
            an opinion of any kind are only accidentally so; i. e., whether <lb/>
            they are or are not, must be decided by the result.</p>
          <p>2. There is a class of persons called obstinate; they re­ <lb/>
            semble in some measure the continent, but they really differ, <lb/>
            in that, even contrary to the suggestions of reason, they, <lb/>
            influenced by pleasure, abide by their opinion.</p>
          <p>The continent may be persuaded to change, the obstinate <lb/>
            never.</p>
          <p>3. There are three kinds of obstinate persons :—</p>
          <p>(1.) The self-opinionated.</p>
          <p>(2.) The uneducated.</p>
          <p>(3. The clownish.</p>
          <p>4. There are also some who depart from their opinions on <lb/>
            right grounds e. g., for the sake of honourable pleasures; <lb/>
            these cannot be called incontinent.</p>
          <p>5. Since the defect as to the desire of bodily pleasures is <lb/>
            rare, continence is thought to be opposed to incontinence, <lb/>
            and temperance to intemperance.</p>
          <p>6. The temperate and continent, and also the intemperate <lb/>
            and incontinent, have points in common, although in reality <lb/>
            they are distinct.</p>
          <p>X.—1. A man cannot be both prudent and incontinent.</p>
          <p>(1.) Because prudence implies goodness.</p>
          <p>(2.) Because the prudent man not only knows what is <lb/>
            right, but is apt and inclined to practise it.</p>
          <p>2. Cleverness, as it does not imply <foreign xml:lang="grc">προαίρεσις</foreign>, is consistent <lb/>
            with incontinence.</p>
          <p>The incontinent is like a man who possesses knowledge, <lb/>
            but is under the influence of sleep or wine. He acts volun- <lb/>
            Larily, but is not vicious absolutely. He is not unjust. He <pb n="lvii"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. X.J"/> <lb/>
            resembles a state which has good laws, but does not use <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>4, 5. Of the two kinds, precipitancy is more curable than <lb/>
            weakness; and incontinence, which is the result of custom, <lb/>
            than that which is the result of nature.</p>
          <p>As the concluding chapters of this book most probably <lb/>
            belong to the Eudemean Ethics, and the subject of pleasure <lb/>
            is discussed fully in Book X., no analysis is given of them.</p>

          <p>Introductory.-In popular language, the expression "a <lb/>
            state of nature," is usually applied to man in a savage state ; <lb/>
            this, however, is by no means a correct or philosophical use <lb/>
            of the term. The real natural state of man is, as Aristotle <lb/>
            truly asserts, the social state. In no nation was the prin­ <lb/>
            ciple of social union more powerfully exemplified than it <lb/>
            was amongst the Greeks. Their associations for uniting the <lb/>
            whole race under one common name, their public games <lb/>
            periodically recurring, their Amphictyonic institutions, which <lb/>
            existed amongst them in the times of the earliest traditions, <lb/>
            are instances, on a vast scale, of an " esprit de corps," so to <lb/>
            speak, a tendency to unite closely together, on the principle <lb/>
            of community of interest. Founded as these unions were <lb/>
            on the ties of race and blood, and consecrated by religious <lb/>
            ceremonies and observances, in which only those of the same <lb/>
            race and kindred could participate, they appealed to the <lb/>
            same principles of human nature which hold together fami­ <lb/>
            lies and relations. They were not merely like the alliances <lb/>
            between modern states, grounded upon motives of expediency <lb/>
            and policy, but, theoretically at least, they implied affection; <lb/>
            they were, in fact, international friendships.</p>
          <p>Again, the intercourse which was kept up between the <lb/>
            several states of Greece by means of <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόξενοι</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐθελοπρόξενοι</foreign> <lb/>
            originated in the same mutual feeling towards each other, <lb/>
            and was a development of the same principle of inter­ <lb/>
            national goodwill. It is customary to compare this institu­ <lb/>
            tion of the ancient Greeks to the consulate of modern times. <pb n="lviii"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK VItI."/> <lb/>
            Doubtless the object, and effect produced are the same ; <lb/>
            namely, the protection of foreigners ; but still the appoint­ <lb/>
            ment of an officer to reside in a foreign country, whose duty <lb/>
            it is to watch over the interests of his own countrymen, <lb/>
            would give a very inadequate idea of the Greek system. <lb/>
            The Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόξενος</foreign> was one whose sacred duty it was to wel­ <lb/>
            come as a friend and a brother the citizens of a foreign state, <lb/>
            whose occupations called him to a land of strangers. And <lb/>
            these duties, as in the case of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐθελοπρόξενος</foreign>, were often <lb/>
            voluntarily undertaken.</p>
          <p>Lastly, within the states of Greece themselves, the asso­ <lb/>
            ciations which existed for the purposes of mutual combina­ <lb/>
            tion were innumerable, and exercised, sometimes for good, <lb/>
            but far more frequently for evil, a great influence over the <lb/>
            political consitution of the different states. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔρανοι</foreign> or <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑταιρίαι</foreign> were clubs instituted, some for charitable, others for <lb/>
            convivial purposes. Another class (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐμπορικαὶ</foreign>) were for corn <lb/>
            mercial purposes ; and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϑίασοι</foreign> were of a religious nature. <lb/>
            But whatever the primary objects of these combinations or <lb/>
            unions may have been, they were generally of a political <lb/>
            nature, and, so far as the testimony of history goes, their <lb/>
            tendency was generally prejudicial to good order and govern­ <lb/>
            ment ; they were, in fact, antagonists, and formidable ones, <lb/>
            to constituted authority. Thucydides (Book III. c. 82), when <lb/>
            speaking of the terrible results of the Corcyrean sedition, <lb/>
            when moral and political corruption raged throughout the <lb/>
            states of Greece, and utterly disorganized society, mentions <lb/>
            that irrational audacity was commended as <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνδρία φιλέταιρος</foreign>, <lb/>
            meaning a devotion to those unions which, at that period of <lb/>
            political convulsion, usurped the place of genuine patriotism.</p>
          <p>Pisander, too, at a later period of Greek history (B.C. 411), <lb/>
            made these unions instrumental in effecting the political <lb/>
            changes which he contemplated. Thirlwall says (History of <lb/>
            Greece, vol. iv. p. 26), " In most of the Greek states, the <lb/>
            ambition of individuals, or the conflict of parties, had given <lb/>
            rise to a number of private associations, for purposes either <lb/>
            mainly or wholly political, some attached to a single leader, <lb/>
            others united by the common interests of the members. <lb/>
            These clubs were of long standing in Athens. Cimon had <lb/>
            Formed one, which rallied round him as its centre, attracted <lb/>
            act more. perhaps, by his fortune and abilities than by his <pb n="lix"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="BOOK VIII.]"/> <lb/>
            principles, shared the reproach which he incurred by his <lb/>
            partiality for Sparta, and proved its devoted ness to his <lb/>
            person at the battle of Tanagra. It seems to have been by <lb/>
            means of a similar union that Thucydides, the rival of <lb/>
            Pericles, endeavoured to defeat the attempt of Hyperbolus. <lb/>
            It was on his command over such associations, that Alci­ <lb/>
            biades relied for the accomplishment of his ambitious de­ <lb/>
            signs.</p>
          <p>" But there appear to have been many political clubs at <lb/>
            Athens, which did not acknowledge any chief, but merely <lb/>
            aimed at certain objects in which all the members were <lb/>
            equally concerned. The defective administration of justice <lb/>
            exposed unprotected individuals to vexation and wrong, but <lb/>
            enabled a number who combined their fortunes and credit, <lb/>
            the more easily to shield each other, or to strike a common <lb/>
            enemy. Another end for which such coalitions were formed, <lb/>
            was to control the elections for offices of trust and power, <lb/>
            either with a view to self-defence, or to the extension of <lb/>
            their influence.</p>
          <p>" In every case both the object and the means, if not posi­ <lb/>
            tively illegal, were such as the law did not recognize ; the <lb/>
            mutual attachment of the associates was stronger than the <lb/>
            ties by which they were bound to the state, and even those <lb/>
            of blood; and the law of honour, which generally prevailed <lb/>
            amongst them, required that they should shrink from no <lb/>
            sacrifice, and from no crime, which the common interest <lb/>
            might demand. These associations, therefore, wero hot-beds <lb/>
            of seditious and revolutionary projects; and I'hrynicus <lb/>
            found it easy to engage them on his side ; and, before he <lb/>
            left Athens, lie had organized an extensive conspiracy among <lb/>
            them for the immediate subversion of the democratical <lb/>
            government."</p>
          <p>The above brief view of the state of feeling and habit <lb/>
            prevalent in Greece, in all ages, on these important points, <lb/>
            will account for the way in which Aristotle treats the sub­ <lb/>
            ject of friendship. It will, hence, be seen why he discusses <lb/>
            it not only as a virtue of private individuals, but in relation <lb/>
            to social communions of different kinds, and even to the <lb/>
            theory of civil government itself:</p>
          <p>The place which friendship occupies in ethics is, firstly, <lb/>
            as being instrumental tc moral virtue, as supplying oppor. <pb n="lx"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK VIII,"/> <lb/>
            tunities for the most satisfactory exercises of virtuous ener­ <lb/>
            gies, and performance of relative duties ; and, secondly, as <lb/>
            being absolutely necessary to the happiness of man, which <lb/>
            cannot be complete, unless his amiable affections and social <lb/>
            sympathies are satisfied.</p>
          <p>I.-1-3. The subject of friendship is introduced, because-</p>
          <p>(1.) It is either a virtue or conjoined with virtue.</p>
          <p>(2.) It is most necessary to life, to young and old, rich <lb/>
            and poor.</p>
          <p>4. (3.) The principles of friendship are innate.</p>
          <p>5. (4.) It is the bond of social communities.</p>
          <p>(5.) It supplies the place of justice.</p>
          <p>6. (6.) It is not only necessary, but honourable.</p>
          <p>7, 8. According to custom, Aristotle states the opinion <lb/>
            generally entertained respecting friendship.</p>
          <p>Some say it originates in resemblance.</p>
          <p>Others from physical causes.</p>
          <p>Heraclitus, for example, asserts it is due to contrariety of <lb/>
            physical constitution. Empedocles to similarity.</p>
          <p>He dismisses the discussion of physical questions, and <lb/>
            confines himself to moral ones, and proposes to inquire-</p>
          <p>(1.) Can all be friends, or is it impossible for bad men <lb/>
            be so?</p>
          <p>(2.) Are there more kinds of friendship than one ?</p>
          <p>II.—1, 2. We must discover what is the object of friendship</p>
          <p>It is (1.) The good.</p>
          <p>(2.) The pleasant.</p>
          <p>(3.) The useful.</p>
          <p>Is it then the good, or the apparent good ?</p>
          <p>Abstractedly, it is the good ; relatively to the individual, <lb/>
            it is the apparent good. This distinction, however, will <lb/>
            make no difference.</p>
          <p>We cannot use the term friendship of fondness for inani­ <lb/>
            mate things ; because friendship must be reciprocal.</p>
          <p>3, 4. Unless reciprocity exists, the feeling is goodwill.</p>
          <p>Friends, therefore, must feel goodwill to each other, both <lb/>
            parties must be aware of the feelings of each other, and they <lb/>
            must wish good to each other for one of the three reasons <lb/>
            above mentioned.</p>
          <p>IIT.-I. There are three kinds of friendship, correspond­ <lb/>
            ing to the three objects.</p><pb n="lxi"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. V.]"/> 2. Friendship for the sake of the useful is not real friendship.</p>
          <p>The same is the case with respect to that for the sake of <lb/>
            the pleasant.</p>
          <p>3. These two kinds of friendship are easily dissolved.</p>
          <p>4—6. The former generally is found to exist between tho <lb/>
            old, the latter between the young.</p>
          <p>For this reason the young are apt to be in love.</p>
          <p>They quickly form and quickly put an end to their friend­ <lb/>
            ships.</p>
          <p>7, 8. The friendship between the good and virtuous is <lb/>
            respect.</p>
          <p>The virtuous are good both absolutely and relatively, and <lb/>
            as they are likewise mutually pleasant, their friendship <lb/>
            therefore comprehends all the essentials of friendship, and <lb/>
            consequently is permanent.</p>
          <p>9, 10. Such friendships are rare, as they require time and <lb/>
            intimacy.</p>
          <p>IV.—1, 2. The friendships for the sake of the pleasant <lb/>
            and the useful resemble true friendship, because the good arc <lb/>
            pleasant and useful to each other.</p>
          <p>3. Friends for the sake of the useful cease to be so when <lb/>
            the usefulness ceases.</p>
          <p>4. For these motives bad men may be friends.</p>
          <p>5. The friendship of the virtuous is alone superior to <lb/>
            calumny.</p>
          <p>6. False friendships are only called so from analogy.</p>
          <p>7. The same persons are rarely friends for the sake both <lb/>
            )f the pleasant and the useful, for these qualifications are <lb/>
            seldom found combined.</p>
          <p>V.—1. As in virtues some are called good according to <lb/>
            the habit, others according to the energy, so in friendship, <lb/>
            absence does not destroy it, but only impairs the energy.</p>
          <p>2. If the absence be long, forgetfulness is the result. <lb/>
            The old and morose are not inclined to friendship.</p>
          <p>3. Those who do not live together and are not intimate <lb/>
            may be said to resemble those who have goodwill rather <lb/>
            than friendship.</p>
          <p>The friendship of the good, therefore, is friendship in the <lb/>
            highest sense.</p>
          <p>4. The feeling of fondness resembles a passion, friendship <lb/>
            itself a habit.</p><pb n="lxii"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="BOOK VIlI"/> The good when they love their friend love that which ii <lb/>
            good to themselves.</p>
          <p>YI.—1, 2. The old and the morose are less suited than <lb/>
            others to friendship, but still they are perfectly capable of <lb/>
            entertaining goodwill.</p>
          <p>3. It is impossible to entertain true friendship for many, <lb/>
            bE'cause-</p>
          <p>(1.) It resembles an excess of feeling, and this can only <lb/>
            be felt towards one object.</p>
          <p>(2.) It requires experience and intimacy.</p>
          <p>We may be friends with many <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ τὸ χρήσμον</foreign>and <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ τὶ</foreign> </p>
          <p>4. The friendship <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ τὸ ἡδὺ</foreign> most resembles true friend­ <lb/>
            ship.</p>
          <p>That <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ τὸ χρήσιμον</foreign> is that of tradesmen.</p>
          <p>5. The happy and prosperous require pleasant friends, and <lb/>
            not useful ones.</p>
          <p>6. Men in power require friends of both kinds, because <lb/>
            the two qualities are seldom found in the same person.</p>
          <p>The good man combines both ; but he will not be a friend <lb/>
            to a man in power unless he is his superior in goodness, so <lb/>
            as to produce equality between them.</p>
          <p>7. The false friendships bear the name of friendship, from <lb/>
            their resemblance to the true; again, they are unlike friend­ <lb/>
            ship in point of permanence and stability.</p>
          <p>VII—1, 2. There is also friendship between persons who <lb/>
            are unequal.</p>
          <p>In the subdivision of this kind of friendship, the relative <lb/>
            duties are different, but the necessary equality is produced <lb/>
            by the person who is inferior in merit being superior in <lb/>
            strength of affection.</p>
          <p>3. The idea of equality in justice and friendship differs.</p>
          <p>In justice, equality in proportion to merit is considered <lb/>
            first, and equality in quantity second; in friendship, the <lb/>
            reverse.</p>
          <p>4. The necessity of a certain equality is plain, from the <lb/>
            fact that, where the difference of rank is very great, friend­ <lb/>
            ship does not exist.</p>
          <p>5. Hence a question has arisen, whether men really <lb/>
            wish to their friends the greatest goods, because, if they got <lb/>
            the greatest goods, they would lose their friends..</p><pb n="lxiii"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. X.]"/> VIII.—1—3. The love of honour leads the majority to <lb/>
            wish to be loved rather than to love ; therefore the majority <lb/>
            love flattery, for being loved resembles being honoured, <lb/>
            although in reality it is better.</p>
          <p>4. But, notwithstanding this prevalent notion, friendship <lb/>
            really consists in loving rather than in being loved.</p>
          <p>This is proved by the strength of maternal affection.</p>
          <p>5. As, therefore, the essence of friendship is the feeling of <lb/>
            affection, by the superior strength of this feeling any ine­ <lb/>
            quality which exists between parties may be readily remedied.</p>
          <p>This stability is insured between the good, because equality <lb/>
            and similarity, especially in goodness, are the essentials of <lb/>
            friendship.</p>
          <p>6. The bad, on the contrary, have no stability.</p>
          <p>7, 8. The friendship for the sake of the useful is based <lb/>
            upon the possession of contrary qualities, because the one <lb/>
            party has what the other wants.</p>
          <p>9. But though, in a certain sense, the contrary wants the <lb/>
            contrary, what it really wants is the mean, for this is " the <lb/>
            good...</p>
          <p>IX.—1. Every community implies a principle of justice <lb/>
            as well as a principle of friendship.</p>
          <p>These principles are co-extensive.</p>
          <p>2. For example, the relative rights, as well as the affections <lb/>
            between parents and children, brothers, &amp;c. differ, and they <lb/>
            are in direct proportion to each other.</p>
          <p>3. All communities come under and form parts of the <lb/>
            social community, whatever may be the motives for which <lb/>
            the association is formed.</p>
          <p>Even the social community has been supposed to be the <lb/>
            result of some mutual compact for the sake of mutual benefit.</p>
          <p>4, 5. At any rate, all communities or associations are <lb/>
            formed with a view to advantage or pleasure.</p>
          <p>Corresponding friendships will accompany these commu­ <lb/>
            nities.</p>
          <p>X.—1—5. There are three kinds of political constitutions <lb/>
            and three corruptions of them.</p>
          <p>(1.)Monarchy.</p>
          <p>(2.) Aristocracy.</p>
          <p>(3.) Timocracy.</p>
          <p>Of these, monarchy is the best, and timocracy the worst.</p><pb n="lxiv"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOUK VIII"/> The three corruptions arc-</p>
          <p>(1.) Tyranny.</p>
          <p>(2. Oligarchy.</p>
          <p>(3. Democracy.</p>
          <p>Of these, tyranny is the worst, and democracy the least had.</p>
          <p>G. Resemblances to these constitutions may be found in <lb/>
            domestic life.</p>
          <p>The relation between a father and his children is like that <lb/>
            between a king and his subjects.</p>
          <p>7. That between a master and his slaves is like a tyranny.</p>
          <p>That between husband and wife resembles an aristocracy.</p>
          <p>This relation, if the husband is overbearing, degenerates <lb/>
            into one which resembles an oligarchy.</p>
          <p>8. The relation between brothers is like a timocracy.</p>
          <p>The state of families without a master is like a demo­ <lb/>
            cracy.</p>
          <p>XI.—1, 2. In each of these forms, there is a friendship <lb/>
            co-extensive with the just in each.</p>
          <p>The friendship between a king and his subjects is like <lb/>
            that between a father and his children, only that the latter <lb/>
            is superior in the amount of benefits conferred.</p>
          <p>3. The friendship between husband and wife is the same <lb/>
            as in an aristocracy.</p>
          <p>4. The friendship in a timocracy is like that between bro­ <lb/>
            thers, and also that between companions.</p>
          <p>5. There is but little friendship in the corrupt forms, as <lb/>
            there is but little justice.</p>
          <p>In a tyranny there is least of all, perhaps none.</p>
          <p>6, 7. In like manner, there is none between master and <lb/>
            slave, so far forth as he is a slave, although there may be, so <lb/>
            far forth as he is a man.</p>
          <p>In a democracy there is most friendship, because equals <lb/>
            have many things in common.</p>
          <p>XII.—1. All friendships are based upon community, <lb/>
            which is either natural or by compact.</p>
          <p>Civil communities exist in virtue of a compact.</p>
          <p>2—4. The friendships between relatives are by nature, and <lb/>
            all depend upon the parental.</p>
          <p>The love of parents is stronger than that of children, <lb/>
            because children are, as it were, part of themselves, and it <lb/>
            has also existed for a longer time.</p><pb n="lxv"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. XVI.J"/> 5. Brothers love one another, because they are sprung from <lb/>
            the same parents. a</p>
          <p>The friendship of brothers resembles that between com­ <lb/>
            panions.</p>
          <p>The friendship between all other relations is owing to <lb/>
            the same cause.</p>
          <p>6. The friendship of children towards their parents, and <lb/>
            of men towards the gods, is, as it were, towards something <lb/>
            superior.</p>
          <p>7. The friendship between man and wife owes its origin <lb/>
            to nature; but besides, they marry for the sake of mutual <lb/>
            help and comfort.</p>
          <p>This friendship unites the useful, the pleasant, and, if the <lb/>
            parties be virtuous, the good.</p>
          <p>8. Children are a common good, and therefore a bond of <lb/>
            union between man and wife.</p>
          <p>XIII.—1, 2. In equal friendships, disputes arise almost <lb/>
            exclusively in those friendships which are for the sake of the <lb/>
            useful.</p>
          <p>3, 4. In friendship for the sake of the pleasant, disputes <lb/>
            are ridiculous.</p>
          <p>5. Friendship for the sake of the useful is of two kinds. <lb/>
            (1.) Moral. (2.) Legal.</p>
          <p>6. Moral friendship is not upon settled specified terms, <lb/>
            legal is.</p>
          <p>In it a man gives as to a friend, but still he expects to <lb/>
            receive an equivalent.</p>
          <p>7. Indeed, it is the duty of the receiver of a kindness to <lb/>
            make a return, if he is able to do so.</p>
          <p>8. He must measure the value of the favour received, <lb/>
            and estimate the kindness of the giver, and make his return <lb/>
            accordingly.</p>
          <p>9. The conclusion to which Aristotle comes appears to be <lb/>
            that the benefit conferred on the receiver must be the measure.</p>
          <p>In friendships for the sake of virtue, the measure is the <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">προαίρεσς</foreign> of the giver.</p>
          <p>XTV.—1,2. In unequal friendships, disputes arise, because <lb/>
            each thinks he has less than his due. <note type="footnote"> 6 Compare Malachi xi. 10 : " Have we not all one Father?—hath not <lb/>
            one God created us ? Why do we deal treacherously every man against <lb/>
            his brother ?" </note> <pb n="lxvi"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK IX."/> Both appear to be right; both ought to get more, but not <lb/>
            more of the same thing.</p>
          <p>The superior should get more honour, the needy more <lb/>
            profit.</p>
          <p>3. This rule is observed in political communities.</p>
          <p>4. Every man must make his return according to his <lb/>
            ability. More than this, friendship cannot demand.</p>
          <p>In some cases, an adequate return cannot be made, as, for <lb/>
            instance, to parents.</p>
          <p>Hence it may be lawful for a father to disown his son, but <lb/>
            not for a son to disown his father.</p>

          <p>Introductory.-In this book Aristotle completes his inves­ <lb/>
            tigation of the subject of friendship. He commences it with <lb/>
            a continuation of the discussion respecting the means of <lb/>
            preserving and preventing the dissolution of unequal friend­ <lb/>
            ships. He devotes a chapter (chapter iv.) to the casuistical <lb/>
            consideration of certain relative duties, and another (chap­ <lb/>
            ter iii) to the enumeration of those cases in which friendships <lb/>
            may or may not be dissolved.</p>
          <p>He then proceeds to the consideration of an important <lb/>
            branch of the subject; namely, the connection and relation <lb/>
            which subsists between the love of others and the love of <lb/>
            ourselves. A reasonable self-love, totally different and dis­ <lb/>
            tinguishable from selfishness, he considers as the source and <lb/>
            origin of a real love of others. The former is indispensable <lb/>
            to the existence of the latter. The good man will feel a <lb/>
            right and proper regard for his own best and highest interests, <lb/>
            and this same' regard he will entertain towards his friend, <lb/>
            as towards another self. The standard of his affection for <lb/>
            his friend will be the same as that by which the Gospel <lb/>
            requires us to measure our love towards all mankind, when <lb/>
            we are bid " to love our neighbour as oorselves." As none <lb/>
            but a good man can entertain a real friendship, so he alone <lb/>
            is capable of loving himself, in the true sense of the term; <lb/>
            and, conversely, since none but a good man can entertain <lb/>
            towards himself those qualities which are the developments <pb n="lxvii"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="SHAP. III.]"/> <lb/>
            of friendship,—namely, beneficence, good-will, and sympathy, <lb/>
            -therefore none but the good can really be friends. The <lb/>
            other questions which are considered in this book are of <lb/>
            minor interest and importance, but are incidental to, and <lb/>
            naturally arise out of it.</p>
          <p>I.-I. All dissimilar friendships are rendered equal, and <lb/>
            herefore preserved by proportion.</p>
          <p>2, 3. Complaints arise from three causes :</p>
          <p>(1.) That there is not a sufficient return of affection.</p>
          <p>(2.) That the person who loves does not perform his <lb/>
            promises.</p>
          <p>4. (3.) When what is received differs from what was <lb/>
            expected.</p>
          <p>5, 6. As to the question, " Who is to fix the value of the <lb/>
            return ?"the opinion of Aristotle is, that the receiver ought <lb/>
            to do so.</p>
          <p>7. When no agreement has been made, the return must be <lb/>
            estimated by the deliberate intention of the giver.</p>
          <p>8. When an agreement has been made, the return should <lb/>
            be such as both parties think fair.</p>
          <p>If this cannot be, the receiver should value it at as much <lb/>
            as he thought the favour worth before it was conferred upon <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>II.—1, 2. No accurate rules can be laid down as to our <lb/>
            relative duties towards relations and friends.</p>
          <p>It is clear, however, that we should, generally speaking, <lb/>
            repay kindnesses, rather than do kindnesses to those who <lb/>
            have not done them to us.</p>
          <p>3—5. Cases however may occur in which this rule will not <lb/>
            hold good, because the latter may be more honourable.</p>
          <p>6. We ought to render to all their due.</p>
          <p>7. For example, we ought to assist our parents rather <lb/>
            than any other persons, and pay them the respect due to them.</p>
          <p>8. We ought to pay respect to the aged.</p>
          <p>9. With this view, we ought to compare the claims of <lb/>
            relatives, fellow-citizens, &amp;c.</p>
          <p>To do this in the case of relat ives, is easy; in the case of <lb/>
            ethers, it is difficult.</p>
          <p>III.—1. When may friendships be dissolved?</p>
          <p>(1.) When the motives for the sake of which they <lb/>
            were formed cease. <note type="footnote"> e </note> <pb n="lxviii"/>
            </p>
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK IX"/> 2. (2.) When parties are deceived as to the real motives <lb/>
            which led to the friendship.</p>
          <p>3,4. (3.) If one party becomes wicked, and his wickedness <lb/>
            is incurable.</p>
          <p>5, 6. When one party remains the same, and the other <lb/>
            becomes far better, and the difference becomes excessively <lb/>
            great, sympathy is impossible, and therefore they cannot <lb/>
            really be friends ; but still the one who has improved must <lb/>
            remember their former intimacy, and feel goodwill towards <lb/>
            the other as towards a friend.</p>
          <p>IV.—1. The real source of friendship for others is the <lb/>
            feelings of a man towards himself.</p>
          <p>A friend has been defined in various ways; but the neces­ <lb/>
            sary qualities which all these definitions involve, are benefi­ <lb/>
            cence, good-will, and sympathy.</p>
          <p>2—5. Now, all the feelings contained in these definitions <lb/>
            are entertained by a good man towards himself.</p>
          <p>By " self" is meant each man's intellectual part, or <lb/>
            thinking principle.</p>
          <p>A friend is a second self.</p>
          <p>6. Aristotle dismisses the question as to whether there be <lb/>
            such a thing as friendship towards one's-self.</p>
          <p>7. He asserts that, though the feelings spoken of exist <lb/>
            in many, although they are bad, still they cannot possibly <lb/>
            exist in those who are utterly bad. They cannot love <lb/>
            themselves really, because they are at variance with them­ <lb/>
            selves.</p>
          <p>They choose the pleasant rather than the good, which is <lb/>
            their true interest.</p>
          <p>8. They hate life, and destroy themselves.</p>
          <p>They shun their own thoughts, and seek, for the sake of <lb/>
            distraction, the society of others.</p>
          <p>They have no sympathy with themselves.</p>
          <p>They look back upon their past pleasures with pain.</p>
          <p>They are full of remorse.</p>
          <p>They have no friendly feeling towards themselves.</p>
          <p>In order to escape this wretchedness, their only way is tc <lb/>
            flee from wickedness, and to strive to become good.</p>
          <p>V.—1. Goodwill resembles, but is not identical with <lb/>
            friendship ;</p>
          <p>For it is felt towards those whom we do not know.</p><pb n="lxix"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. VII.]"/> It is not affection, <foreign xml:lang="grc">φίλησις</foreign>; for it has no intensity, nor <lb/>
            desire, and may be felt on a sudden.</p>
          <p>2. It is the beginning and origin of friendship, as sight is <lb/>
            the beginning of love.</p>
          <p>3. It is impossible to feel friendship without goodwill.</p>
          <p>4. So that it may be defined friendship in a state of <lb/>
            inactivity, which by intimacy becomes true friendship.</p>
          <p>5. It is entertained on account of virtue, or goodness.</p>
          <p>VI.—1. Unanimity (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁμόνοια</foreign>) differs from unity of opi­ <lb/>
            nion (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁμοδοξία</foreign>), in being between persons known to each <lb/>
            other, and on practical matters.</p>
          <p>2. Especially on those which are important, and of com­ <lb/>
            mon interest.</p>
          <p>3. There is no unanimity when two persons covet the <lb/>
            same thing; but the reverse.</p>
          <p>4. It is therefore political friendship.</p>
          <p>It exists between the good, for they wish and desire in <lb/>
            common the just and expedient.</p>
          <p>5. It cannot exist between the bad, because they only <lb/>
            agree in shunning duty, and in coveting personal advantage.</p>
          <p>VII.-1. The love felt by benefactors is stronger than that <lb/>
            felt by the benefited.</p>
          <p>2. Most people think the reason for this is, because the <lb/>
            benefactor, like a creditor, wishes for the safety and pros­ <lb/>
            perity of his debtor, with a view to repayment.</p>
          <p>3. This, Epicharmus would say, is looking to the bad side <lb/>
            of human nature; nevertheless, it is not unlike human <lb/>
            nature.</p>
          <p>4, 5. However, the true reasons are,</p>
          <p>(1.) That the benefactor looks upon the person bene­ <lb/>
            fited as his work, and men love their own works, <lb/>
            as proofs of energy, and therefore of existence.</p>
          <p>6. (2.) The benefactor gets honour, the benefited only <lb/>
            advantage; and honour is preferable to advan­ <lb/>
            tage.</p>
          <p>7. (3.) The pleasure derived from the honourable is <lb/>
            permanent, that derived from the useful is transi­ <lb/>
            tory.</p>
          <p>8. (4.) To love is an active feeling, to be loved passive.</p>
          <p>(5.) All love that best which has cost them trouble.</p>
          <p>VIII.—The difficulty of deciding whether we ought to <note type="footnote"> e 2 </note> <pb n="lxx"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK IX."/> <lb/>
            love ourselves or others best, arises from not distinguishing <lb/>
            between proper and improper self-love.</p>
          <p>The popular opinion is, that the bad man does nothing <lb/>
            without reference to self.</p>
          <p>The good man acts for the sake of the honourable, and <lb/>
            passes over his own interests.</p>
          <p>2, 3. On the other hand, it is said that a man should <lb/>
            love his greatest friend best; now, the best friend a man <lb/>
            has is himself; therefore, he ought to love himself best.</p>
          <p>4—7. Now, improper self-love, or selfishness, causes a <lb/>
            man to give to himself more than his share of money, or <lb/>
            distinctions, or bodily pleasures, in fact, of the gratifications <lb/>
            of the irrational part of his nature.</p>
          <p>True self-love desires the honourable, and to be virtuous, <lb/>
            and to gratify the ruling part of his nature, i. e. the in­ <lb/>
            tellect.</p>
          <p>8. For the intellectual part especially constitutes what <lb/>
            we call " self."a</p>
          <p>9. Now, all praise him who is particularly earnest in per­ <lb/>
            forming virtuous and honourable acts.</p>
          <p>10. Therefore, the good man must be a self-lover, but the <lb/>
            wicked man ought not to be so.</p>
          <p>11. The good man will sacrifice everything for the sake of <lb/>
            appropriating to himself the greatest share of the honour­ <lb/>
            able (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ καλόν</foreign>).</p>
          <p>12. Hence, he will sacrifice even life itself in the cause of <lb/>
            his country.</p>
          <p>13. Therefore, reasonable self-love is right, but selfishness <lb/>
            is wrong.</p>
          <p>IX.-1. Some have said that the happy man does not need <lb/>
            friends, because be has all he wants, and needs no one to <lb/>
            provide more for him.</p>
          <p>2. But yet it seems absurd to give a man all other goods, <lb/>
            and deny him the greatest of all goods.</p>
          <p>Besides, a good man will want persons to do good to.</p>
          <p>3. Hence, it has been asked, when do we most need friends ? <note type="footnote">a See Bishop Butler's Analogy, Part I. chap. i. " On a Future State,” <lb/>
            where he shows that the living agent or sentient being, which each man <lb/>
            calls himself, is related to the body merely as to a system of instruments <lb/>
            and organs destitute of perception, which convey perceptions to the per­ <lb/>
            leering ana reflecting powers. </note> <pb n="lxxi"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. X.]"/> <lb/>
            In prosperity, for us to help them, or in adversity, for them <lb/>
            to help us ?</p>
          <p>4. It also seems absurd, when man is a social being, to <lb/>
            make the happy man a solitary being.</p>
          <p>The happy man, therefore, does need friends.</p>
          <p>5. The mistake of the generality seems to be, that they <lb/>
            think only of useful friends.</p>
          <p>Now, the happy man will not want either useful or plea­ <lb/>
            sant friends.</p>
          <p>6. But he will want virtuous friends; because he delights <lb/>
            in contemplating good actions, and such actions as his own ; <lb/>
            and we can better contemplate a friend's actions than we <lb/>
            can our own.</p>
          <p>7. Again, a solitary life is burthensome ; and it is not easy <lb/>
            to energize constantly by one's-self.</p>
          <p>8. Let the question now be examined physiologically.</p>
          <p>That which is naturally good is good and pleasant to the <lb/>
            good man.</p>
          <p>Therefore, life is good and pleasant to the good man.</p>
          <p>9. Now, life, in man, consists in the exercise of sensation <lb/>
            and intellect.</p>
          <p>10. When we speak of life, we do not mean a depraved <lb/>
            and corrupt one, but the life of the good and happy.</p>
          <p>11, 12. Therefore, the consciousness of living and existing <lb/>
            must be pleasant to a good man.</p>
          <p>Now, a friend is a second self.</p>
          <p>13, 14. Therefore, the perception of a friend's existence <lb/>
            is the perception of our own.</p>
          <p>Therefore, it is good and pleasant.</p>
          <p>Therefore, it is good to have friends, and consequently <lb/>
            even a happy man will need good friends.</p>
          <p>X.—1. Should we, then, have many friends, or, as in the <lb/>
            case of hospitality, should we not be without, but still not <lb/>
            have too many ?</p>
          <p>2. Of useful friends we certainly must not have many, for <lb/>
            it is troublesome to requite many favours.</p>
          <p>3. Of pleasant friends, a few are sufficient, like sweetening <lb/>
            in our food.</p>
          <p>To the number of virtuous friends there must be alsc <lb/>
            some limit, as the numbers of a political community must be <lb/>
            limited.</p><pb n="lxxii"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOCK IX."/> 4. Perhaps the best limit is the greatest number with <lb/>
            whom we can associate.</p>
          <p>Besides, we ought to remember that our friends ought to <lb/>
            be friends to each other, and that we ought to sympathize <lb/>
            with them all in joys and sorrows.</p>
          <p>These considerations will also tend to limit the number.</p>
          <p>a. It is as impossible to be strong friends with many as to <lb/>
            be in love with many.</p>
          <p>6. All celebrated friendships have been between two.</p>
          <p>In a political sense only, can we have many friends.</p>
          <p>We must be content with a few virtuous friends, because <lb/>
            it is even impossible to meet with many.</p>
          <p>XI.—1. Friends are needful, both in prosperity and in <lb/>
            adversity.</p>
          <p>In the latter, we require useful friends, in the former, <lb/>
            virtuous ones.</p>
          <p>In adversity, they are more necessary, in prosperity, more <lb/>
            honourable.</p>
          <p>2. The sympathy of friends is also pleasant in adversity.</p>
          <p>How it comes to pass that sympathy lightens the weight <lb/>
            of sorrow, it is unnecessary to inquire ; the fact is certain.</p>
          <p>3. The presence of friends, when we are in misfortune, <lb/>
            causes a mixed feeling. We are pleased and comforted by <lb/>
            their sympathy, but we are pained by seeing them grieved <lb/>
            by our misfortunes.</p>
          <p>4. Therefore, the <unclear>maply</unclear> character will be cautious of thus <lb/>
            causing pain to his friends, the effeminate will delight in <lb/>
            having others to mourn with him.</p>
          <p>5. In prosperity, friends make our time pass pleasantly <lb/>
            therefore, in prosperity we should be glad to invite them, in <lb/>
            adversity reluctant.</p>
          <p>6. When friends are in trouble, we should go to them <lb/>
            gladly.</p>
          <p>When they are in prosperity, we should go to them will­ <lb/>
            ingly, if we can forward any object they have in view, but <lb/>
            reluctantly, if we go to enjoy their good fortune.</p>
          <p>XII.—1. As the sight of the beloved object is most <lb/>
            desirable to lovers, so society is most desirable to friends.</p>
          <p>Again, a friend is a second self; as, therefore, the percep­ <lb/>
            tion of our own existence is desirable, so is the perception <lb/>
            of the existence of a friend.</p><pb n="lxxiii"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="BOOK X.]"/> 2, 3. In whatever pursuit a man thinks the enjoyment of <lb/>
            life consists, this pursuit he likes to enjoy with his friends.</p>
          <p>4. Hence, the friendship of bad men becomes depraved, <lb/>
            that of good men good, by intercourse.</p>
          <p>5. By associating together, good men mutually correct and <lb/>
            improve each other.</p>

          <p>Introductory.-There are two objects which Aristotle has <lb/>
            in view in making pleasure the subject of a great part of <lb/>
            this his concluding book. The first is to examine, and <lb/>
            refute when erroneous, the various opinions which Plato and <lb/>
            other philosophers had held respecting it; and the second, <lb/>
            to show the exact place which pleasure occupies in relation <lb/>
            to virtue and human happiness. This he can now safely do, <lb/>
            without any risk of his hearers being misled by false notions <lb/>
            and incorrect estimates of its nature and value. He has <lb/>
            insisted on a moral preparation and discipline of the habits <lb/>
            as the only road to happiness ; and, therefore, the student <lb/>
            may now be informed that pleasure, such pleasure as he is <lb/>
            now fitted by moral discipline to appreciate and enjoy, shall <lb/>
            be the reward of his endeavours, and the adjunct of that <lb/>
            happiness which he has been seeking by the only road which <lb/>
            could really lead to its attainment.</p>
          <p>Aristotle shows that pleasure is not "per se" an evil, <lb/>
            because the grounds on which it may be considered to be so <lb/>
            only belong to those of a grosser corporeal kind, and not to <lb/>
            the purer enjoyments of the ruling part of man's nature, the <lb/>
            intellect. By another series of arguments, he also proves, <lb/>
            on the other hand, that though a good, it is not the chief <lb/>
            good.</p>
          <p>The connection between happiness and pleasure may be <lb/>
            briefly expressed in the following words :-Happiness is an <lb/>
            energy, and every energy is completed and rendered perfect <lb/>
            by the pleasure peculiar to it. It is plain, that, although <lb/>
            pleasure perfects the energy, and is therefore an adjunct <lb/>
            to it, it is not itself an energy or activity, for it is not in <pb n="lxxiv"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK X"/> <lb/>
            any way an act either of the perceptive or the reasoning <lb/>
            faculties.</p>
          <p>From this definition of pleasure, we can see how Aria.. <lb/>
            totle, in the next division of this book, arrives at the con. <lb/>
            clusion that the highest human happiness must be sought <lb/>
            for in intellectual contemplation, and that it will be in­ <lb/>
            separably united with pleasure of the highest kind. It is <lb/>
            plain, also, that he arrives at it by the safest and most <lb/>
            practical road.</p>
          <p>In order that man's divinest and purest nature, the intel­ <lb/>
            lectual, may energize independently and without impediment, <lb/>
            his moral nature must have been brought into its highest <lb/>
            condition ; but when this is the case, the intellect is capable <lb/>
            of exercising its powers, that is, it is capable of the act of <lb/>
            contemplation. Now happiness has been laid down to be an <lb/>
            energy according to the most perfect virtue ; and this must <lb/>
            be the virtue of the highest faculties which man possesses, <lb/>
            namely, the intellectual. But every energy is perfected by <lb/>
            its own peculiar pleasure, and therefore the most perfect <lb/>
            energies must be accompanied by the highest pleasures.</p>
          <p>I.—1, 2. Pleasure is, more than anything else, intimately <lb/>
            bound up with the nature of man; and one of the principal <lb/>
            parts of education is to instil right notions respecting its <lb/>
            nature.</p>
          <p>3. For this reason, as well as because of the erroneous <lb/>
            views prevalent respecting it, this subject ought not to be <lb/>
            passed over.</p>
          <p>4. The evil of erroneous views may be seen in the follow­ <lb/>
            ing example :-Suppose a teacher of morals censures plea­ <lb/>
            sure, and is then seen to desire it, this inconsistency entirely <lb/>
            destroys his influence and authority.</p>
          <p>II.—1—3. Eudoxus thought that pleasure was the chief <lb/>
            good, because-</p>
          <p>(1.) All creatures seek it.</p>
          <p>(2.)Pain, its contrary, is universally avoided.</p>
          <p>(3.) It is eligible for its own sake.</p>
          <p>(4.) If added to any other good, it makes it more eligible.</p>
          <p>The excellence of his moral character gave weight to his <lb/>
            assertions.</p>
          <p>4. Argument (4) proves that pleasure is a good, but not <lb/>
            the chief good.</p><pb n="lxxv"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="CHA P. III.]"/> 5. By an argument similar to argument (4), Plato proved <lb/>
            that pleasure was not the chief good; for he said that a <lb/>
            pleasant life became more eligible by the addition of moral <lb/>
            wisdom.</p>
          <p>6. That pleasure is a good, because all aim at it, is a valid <lb/>
            argument, although this does not prove that it is the chief <lb/>
            good. Had it only been said that irrational creatures sought <lb/>
            pleasure, an objection might have been made to the argu­ <lb/>
            ment, but not when rational beings are included.</p>
          <p>7. Again, there is no force in the objection, “ that because <lb/>
            pain is an evil, it does not follow that pleasure is a good." <lb/>
            Of course it is not necessarily so ; but still it is a probable <lb/>
            argument, and experience supports it.</p>
          <p>III.—1. Plato says, pleasure is not a good, because it is <lb/>
            not a quality; but, for the same reason, neither happiness <lb/>
            nor the energies of virtue would be qualities.</p>
          <p>2. Again, he says, that good is definite, but that pleasure <lb/>
            admits of degrees.</p>
          <p>If this objection applies to the act of being pleased, it <lb/>
            equally applies to justice, and all the moral virtues.</p>
          <p>3. If it is meant to apply to pleasure abstractedly, then <lb/>
            the distinction is forgotten between mixed and unmixed <lb/>
            pleasures, for the unmixed are definite, i. e. capable of being <lb/>
            defined.</p>
          <p>But, after all, health is definite, and admits of degrees ; <lb/>
            why then should not pleasure be definite, and admit of <lb/>
            degrees also 1</p>
          <p>4. Again, it is said pleasure is a motion and generation, <lb/>
            and motions and generations are imperfect.</p>
          <p>It is not a motion, for quickness and slowness oelong to <lb/>
            every motion.</p>
          <p>5, 6. But although we can become pleased quickly or <lb/>
            slowly, we cannot feel pleasure quickly or slowly.</p>
          <p>7. It cannot be a generation, because that which is <lb/>
            generated is resolved into the same elements which pro­ <lb/>
            duced it.</p>
          <p>Now those sensations which pleasure generates, pain <lb/>
            destroys.</p>
          <p>Again, it is said pain is a want, pleasure the supply of <lb/>
            that want.</p>
          <p>8. But these wants are corporeal; therefore, if pleasure <pb n="lxxvi"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK X."/> <lb/>
            were the supplying of them, the body would feel the plea­ <lb/>
            sure ; but it is the mind, and not the body which feels it.</p>
          <p>The truth is, when the want is supplied, pleasure is felt</p>
          <p>9, 10. Besides, there are many pleasures which neither <lb/>
            imply a want to be satisfied, nor a pain to be removed.</p>
          <p>11. If reprehensible pleasures be brought forward in proof, <lb/>
            it may be answered, that they are not really pleasures.</p>
          <p>12. Or it may be answered, that the eligibility of pleasures <lb/>
            depends upon whence they are derived.</p>
          <p>13. Or we may say that pleasures differ in kind.</p>
          <p>14. This may be illustrated by the difference between a <lb/>
            friend and a flatterer.</p>
          <p>15, 16. Again, experience proves that pleasures differ; <lb/>
            for we should not choose to be children all our lives, even if <lb/>
            the pleasures of children were the highest possible.</p>
          <p>And, on the other hand, we should be anxious for some <lb/>
            things, even if they brought no pleasure.</p>
          <p>17. It is clear, therefore,</p>
          <p>(1.) That pleasure is not the chief good.</p>
          <p>(2.) That some pleasures are eligible, and therefore <lb/>
            goods ; but that others are not so.</p>
          <p>IV.-1. Pleasure is, like the act of vision, perfect at any <lb/>
            moment.</p>
          <p>2. For this reason, it is not a motion; as a motion is <lb/>
            imperfect at any separate moment of time.</p>
          <p>3, 4. This may be illustrated by the process of constructing <lb/>
            a building.</p>
          <p>5, 6. One cannot form any idea of motion, except as con­ <lb/>
            nected with place, as well as time.</p>
          <p>But motion is more properly treated of at length in <lb/>
            Aristotle's Physics.</p>
          <p>7—9. The same arguments which prove that pleasure is <lb/>
            not a motion also prove that it is not a generation.</p>
          <p>10. There is an appropriate pleasure attendant upon <lb/>
            every act of perception (<foreign xml:lang="grc">αἵσθησις</foreign>), every operation of the in­ <lb/>
            tellect employed either in the investigation of the truth <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">διάνοια</foreign>), or in the contemplation of truth (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ϑεωρία</foreign>).</p>
          <p>The perfection of pleasure will depend upon the perfect <lb/>
            state of the faculty or habit, and the perfect nature of the <lb/>
            object on which it energizes or is active.</p>
          <p>To make up a perfect energy, therefore, there are three <pb n="lxxvii"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. VI.]"/> <lb/>
            requisites : a perfect faculty, a perfect object, a perfect atten­ <lb/>
            dant pleasure.</p>
          <p>11—14. Pleasure, therefore, as the final requisite, perfects <lb/>
            the energy, not as an efficient, but as a formal cause, not as <lb/>
            an inherent habit, but as the bloom completes the beauty of <lb/>
            those who are in the prime of life.</p>
          <p>The reason why we cannot feel pleasure continually is, that <lb/>
            the sense of enjoyment, like other faculties, flags and wearies <lb/>
            and becomes blunted, and requires novelty to excite it.</p>
          <p>15, 16. It matters not whether we choose life for the sake <lb/>
            of pleasure, or pleasure for the sake of life.</p>
          <p>This is, at any rate, plain, that life is energy, that pleasure <lb/>
            renders our energies perfect, and therefore gives perfection <lb/>
            to our life.</p>
          <p>V.—1, 2. Pleasures differ in kind, because--</p>
          <p>(1.) The energies which they perfect differ.</p>
          <p>3, 4. (2.) The appropriate pleasure contributes to increase <lb/>
            each energy ; the connection, therefore, must be <lb/>
            so close, that if the energies differ, the pleasure <lb/>
            must likewise.</p>
          <p>5—8. (3.) Energies are hindered, and the pleasures resulting <lb/>
            from them destroyed, by pleasures arising from <lb/>
            other sources. Nay, opposite pleasures act like <lb/>
            pains.</p>
          <p>9—11. (4.) Energies differ in quality; therefore the atten­ <lb/>
            dant pleasures differ also. It may be observed, <lb/>
            that in their nature, as well as in point of time, <lb/>
            the pleasures are more closely connected with <lb/>
            the energies than with the desires, so that they <lb/>
            are sometimes, though imperfectly, confounded <lb/>
            with them.</p>
          <p>12, 13. Different animals, as well as men under different <lb/>
            circumstances, have each their proper pleasure, as they have <lb/>
            each their proper energy.</p>
          <p>14—16. True pleasure, therefore, is that which appears so <lb/>
            to the good man; and those which attend the energies of the <lb/>
            perfect and happy man are properly the pleasures of man.</p>
          <p>VI.—1. Recapitulating what has been said before on the <lb/>
            same subject, Aristotle asserts that happiness is—</p>
          <p>2, 3. An energy, eligible for its own sake, and therefo re <lb/>
            according to virtue</p><pb n="xxviii"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK X."/> 4, 5. That it does not consist in amusement, although the <lb/>
            popular opinion respecting it would lead us to suppose so, <lb/>
            because-</p>
          <p>6, 7. (1.) The best men do not think so.</p>
          <p>8, 9. (2.) Amusement or relaxation is not an end, but a <lb/>
            means.</p>
          <p>10. (3.) Serious pursuits are held to be better than <lb/>
            amusements.</p>
          <p>11. (4.) If happiness were mere amusement, a slave could <lb/>
            be happy.</p>
          <p>VII.—1. If happiness is an energy according to virtue, <unclear/> <lb/>
            i t must be according to the highest virtue.</p>
          <p>This must be the virtue of the best part of man.</p>
          <p>That is, the intellect.</p>
          <p>The highest happiness, therefore, is the contemplative.</p>
          <p>2. This energy is--</p>
          <p>(1.) The noblest.</p>
          <p>(2.) The most continuous.</p>
          <p>3. (3.) The pleasantest.</p>
          <p>4,5. (4.) Self-sufficient.</p>
          <p>Not but what it will require the necessaries of life, but it <lb/>
            does not, like the moral virtues, require persons to energize <lb/>
            upon.</p>
          <p>6. (5.) It is loved for its own sake.</p>
          <p>7, 8. (6.) It is consistent with leisure.</p>
          <p>9. Now the active virtues are displayed in politics or war.</p>
          <p>These allow of no leisure ; and we do not choose all this <lb/>
            troublesome occupation for its own sake.</p>
          <p>All this being the case, perfect happiness is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϑεωρία</foreign>.</p>
          <p>10—14. Though this happiness is beyond man, yet, as <lb/>
            there is in him something divine, he ought to aspire to the <lb/>
            satisfaction of this divine nature, and not to mind only <lb/>
            earthly things because he is mortal He should remembei <lb/>
            that this principle is his “self,”a and though it may be <note type="footnote"> a Bishop Butler, when speaking of that which constitutes each man's <lb/>
            “ self," uses similar language, doubtless influenced by the same mode of <lb/>
            thought as Aristotle. He says,—“ Persons can trace up the existence of <lb/>
            themselves to a time when the bulk of their bodies was extremely small, <lb/>
            in comparison of what it is in mature age." This leads him to observe. <lb/>
            “ That we have no means of determining by experience what is the certain <lb/>
            bulk of the living being each man calls himself; and yet till it be deter­ <lb/>
            mined that it is larger in bulk than the solid elementary particles of <lb/>
            matter, which there is no ground to think any natural power can dis </note> <pb n="lxxix"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. VIII.]"/> <lb/>
            small in size as compared with his bodily frame, yet it <lb/>
            immeasurably surpasses it in value.</p>
          <p>VIII.—1—3. The happiness resulting from moral virtue <lb/>
            is of a secondary kind, because-</p>
          <p>(1.) Moral virtues belong to our compound nature, nay, <lb/>
            some seem to be the consequence even of our <lb/>
            corporeal nature, and to be connected with the <lb/>
            passions.</p>
          <p>4. Whereas intellectual virtue is separate and distinct.</p>
          <p>5. (2.) Intellectual happiness requires external good far <lb/>
            less than moral happiness, for the latter requires <lb/>
            means, resources, and occasions for its exercise.</p>
          <p>3, 7. (3.) The perfection of a moral act consists not only <lb/>
            in the moral principle from which it proceeds, but <lb/>
            also in the act itself</p>
          <p>Now, for the perfection of an act, external means arc <lb/>
            needed.</p>
          <p>To contemplation, these are even impediments; nor are <lb/>
            they required by the contemplative man, except so far forth <lb/>
            as he is man.</p>
          <p>8—11. The happiness of contemplation is that which <lb/>
            Aristotle supposes the gods enjoy, as he conceives it ridicu­ <lb/>
            lous that they should be represented as engaged in pursuits <lb/>
            which give scope and opportunity for exercising the moral <lb/>
            virtue.</p>
          <p>12,13. The lower animals are incapable of true happi­ <lb/>
            ness, because they are incapable of contemplation ; therefore, <lb/>
            as far as contemplation extends, so far does happiness.</p>
          <p>14, 15. Although the happy man, so far as he is man, <lb/>
            requires a certain portion of external good, nevertheless, he <lb/>
            does not want much,-a competence is sufficient. He should <lb/>
            have “ neither poverty nor riches j" he need not be lord of <lb/>
            earth and sea; as private individuals are at least quite as <lb/>
            capable of honourable acts as men in power.</p>
          <p>16, 17. The opinions of Solon and Anaxagoras seem to <lb/>
            be perfectly consistent with those of Aristotle.</p>
          <p>18. If arguments agree with facts, the corroborative testi­ <lb/>
            mony borne to their correctness by the opinions of philoso­ <lb/>
            phers ought to have weight.</p>
          <p>19, 20. As contemplation is most probably the occupa­ <note type="footnote"> soLve, there is no sort of reason to think death to be the dissolution of <lb/>
            it.”—Analogy, Part I. chap. i. </note> <pb n="lxxx"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK X."/> <lb/>
            tion of the gods, he is most likely to be a favourite of heaven, <lb/>
            who, in his occupations and enjoyments, resembles them ; so <lb/>
            that, on these grounds, the wise man is the happiest man.</p>
          <p>IX.—1, 2. Moral precepts, and a knowledge of the theory <lb/>
            of virtue, are insufficient to make men virtuous, and yet, as <lb/>
            has been said, the object of moral science is not knowledge, <lb/>
            but practice.</p>
          <p>3—5. Ethical instruction has power over generous and <lb/>
            liberal minds, but not over the minds of the masses, who are <lb/>
            influenced by fear rather than by reason.</p>
          <p>6. Now men are made good by nature, reasoning, and <lb/>
            teaching.</p>
          <p>Over nature we have no power, and reasoning and teach­ <lb/>
            in,, exercise an influence only over minds cultivated for their <lb/>
            reception by the moral cultivation of the habits, and thus <lb/>
            instilling right principles, and correct views respecting the <lb/>
            government of the passions, and on the subject of pleasure <lb/>
            and pain.</p>
          <p>7, 8. The moral character, therefore, must be formed by <lb/>
            education, and this education ought to be enforced by law.</p>
          <p>9—11. Nor is education and discipline necessary only so <lb/>
            long as we are children, but throughout the whole of our <lb/>
            lives. Hence it is thought that exhortations to virtue are <lb/>
            the duty of legislators, as much as the punishment of evil- <lb/>
            doers, and the entire banishment of the incorrigible from the <lb/>
            community.</p>
          <p>12, 13. Paternal or individual authority has no power to <lb/>
            enforce its decrees, but the law has, and men are willing to <lb/>
            acknowledge the supremacy of law, although they will not <lb/>
            submit to individuals.</p>
          <p>Therefore, the state ought to undertake education, and in <lb/>
            this follow the very rare example of Lacedæmon and a few <lb/>
            other states.</p>
          <p>14—16. If the state neglects the duty, it devolves upon <lb/>
            the parent.</p>
          <p>In order, therefore for him to qualify himself, he should <lb/>
            make himself acquainted with the principles of legislation, <lb/>
            for the same laws which regulate public systems would be <lb/>
            also applicable to private ones.</p>
          <p>17, 18. There are advantages in private education; such as <lb/>
            the force of filial duty, and the power of adapting the sys­ <lb/>
            tern to particular cases.</p><pb n="lxxii"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. IX.]"/> 19—21. A man may certainly legislate for particular <lb/>
            cases, even without scientific knowledge ; but nevertheless a <lb/>
            theoretical study of the general principles of legislation will <lb/>
            make him a better educator.</p>
          <p>22—28. How, then, is the science of legislation to be <lb/>
            acquired ?</p>
          <p>The sophists profess to teach it, but have no experience or <lb/>
            practical knowledge.</p>
          <p>The statesman has practical knowledge, but he either <lb/>
            does not understand teaching, or at least he does not profess <lb/>
            to teach.</p>
          <p>29. Is it then sufficient to study digests and collections of <lb/>
            laws ? No; unless the student has experience and know­ <lb/>
            ledge enough to guide him in determining which laws are <lb/>
            best, and which, therefore, ought to be selected.</p>
          <p>He must by habit have acquired the power of forming <lb/>
            a correct judgment of the relative merits of laws and insti­ <lb/>
            tutions.</p>
          <p>30, 31. Now, this subject has been neglected by previous <lb/>
            writers; therefore Aristotle proposes, in a treatise on <lb/>
            politics,</p>
          <p>(1.) To explain what former writers have correctly laid <lb/>
            down.</p>
          <p>(2.) To examine what are the causes of the preservation <lb/>

          <p>EVERY art and every scientific system, and in like <note type="chapter">1. </note> <lb/>
            manner every course of action and deliberate pre­ <lb/>
            ference, seems to aim at some good ; and conse­ <lb/>
            quently “ the Good " has been well defined as “ that <note type="margin">What <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ <lb/>

            Ends differ, <lb/>
            some beinj </note> <lb/>
            which all things aim at."</p>
          <p>But there appears to be a kind of difference in <lb/>
            ends ; for some are energies; others again beyond <note type="footnote"> a Aristotle in his ethical system takes somewhat lower <lb/>
            ground than Plato, inasmuch as the latter investigates what is <lb/>
            good,-the former what is good for man ; nevertheless, owing <lb/>
            to this very difference, the system of Aristotle is more prac­ <lb/>
            tical than that of Plato. The chief good is considered by <lb/>
            Aristotle to be the end of the political science, by which he <lb/>
            understands that science, the object of which is all that relates <lb/>
            to the welfare of man. It therefore branches out into three <lb/>
            divisions :-Ethics, which treat of the good of the individual; <lb/>
            Economics, of the good of a family; Politics, properly so <lb/>
            called, of the good of a state. Aristotle was the author of <lb/>
            three ethical treatises -(1.) The Nicomachean Ethics, so <lb/>
            called either because he dedicated them to his son Nicoma­ <lb/>
            chus, or because Nicomachus arranged the MS. which <lb/>
            his father left: Cicero appears to have considered Nico­ <lb/>
            machus the author. (2.) The Eudemian, which were ar­ <lb/>
            ranged and published by his pupil Eudemus. (3.) The " Magna <lb/>
            Moralia." It is not improbable that the two latter treatises <lb/>
            were compiled from the notes of Aristotle's pupils. </note> <note type="footnote"> B </note> <pb n="2"/>

            tain ends besides the actions, there the works are <lb/>

          <p><note type="chapter">3. </note> Now since there are many actions, arts, and <lb/>
            sciences, it follows that there are many ends; for <lb/>
            of medicine the end is health; of ship-building, a <lb/>
            ship ; of generalship, victory ; of economy, wealth. <note type="margin">4. <lb/>
            Ends of the <lb/>
            chief arts <lb/>
            superior to <lb/>
            those of <lb/>
            subordinate <lb/>
            ones. </note> <lb/>
            But whatever of such arts arc contained under any <lb/>
            one faculty, (as, for instance, under horsemanship is <lb/>
            contained the art of making bridles, and all other <lb/>
            horse furniture; and this and the whole art of war <lb/>
            is contained under generalship; and in the same <lb/>
            manner other arts are contained under different <lb/>
            faculties;) in all these the ends of the chief arts are <lb/>
            more eligible than the ends of the subordinate ones ; <lb/>
            because for the sake of the former, the latter are <note type="chapter">5. </note> <lb/>
            pursued. It makes, however, no difference whether <lb/>
            the energies themselves, or something else besides <lb/>
            these, are the ends of actions, just as it would make <lb/>
            no difference in the sciences above mentioned. <note type="footnote"> b The term energy, which I have retained as the translation <lb/>
            of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐνέργεια</foreign>, requires some explanation. Energy, then, implies <lb/>
            an activity or active state; it is opposed to <foreign xml:lang="grc">δύναμις</foreign>, i.e. capa­ <lb/>
            city, faculty, potentiality, inasmuch as the latter may be <lb/>
            dormant, and though capable of improvement, may be left <lb/>
            unimproved ; and it is possible for a thing to have the capa­ <lb/>
            city of being, and yet not to be : as, for example, a coal has <lb/>
            the capacity for burning, and yet it may perhaps never do so. <lb/>
            Energy implies actual and active existence, not a mere possi­ <lb/>
            ble or potential one. It is opposed to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕξις</foreign>, habit, because by <lb/>
            means of it habits are acquired and formed. </note><note type="footnote"> Hence we can see the difference between an energy and a <lb/>
            work (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕργον</foreign>) when considered as ends or final causes of <lb/>
            action. Whenever we enter upon a course of action, we have <lb/>
            one of two objects in view,-either the action itself, or some <lb/>
            production or work to which it leads. For example, a painter <lb/>
            paints either merely for the sake of painting, feeling an actual <lb/>
            delight in this active exertion of his faculty for its own sake, <lb/>
            or in order to produce a picture ; in the former case, his end <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τελος</foreign>) is an energy, in the latter a work. An energy, there­ <lb/>
            fore, is perfect and complete, and has its end in itself, it looks <lb/>
            to nothing further, it is eligible for its own sake ; and hence <lb/>
            seeing, contemplating, being happy &amp;c., are energies. </note> <pb n="3"/>

          <p>IF, therefore, there is some end of all that we do, <note type="margin">1. <lb/>
            The chief <lb/>

            not choose everything for the sake of something <lb/>
            else (for thus we should go on to infinity, so that <lb/>
            desire would be empty and vain), it is evident that <lb/>
            this must be "the good," and the greatest good. <lb/>
            Has not, then, the knowledge of this end a great <note type="margin">2. <lb/>
            Knowledge <lb/>
            of it useful </note> <lb/>
            influence on the conduct of life ? and, like archers, <lb/>
            shall we not be more likely to attain that which is <lb/>
            right, if we have a mark? If so, we ought to <lb/>
            endeavour to give an outline at least of its na­ <lb/>
            ture, and to determine to which of the sciences <lb/>
            or faculties it belongs.</p>
          <p>Now it would appear to be the end of that which <note type="margin">3. <lb/>
            It is the <lb/>
            end of the <lb/>
            chief, or <lb/>
            political <lb/>
            science. </note> <lb/>
            is especially the chief and master science, and this <lb/>
            seems to be the political science ; for it directs what <lb/>
            sciences states ought to cultivate, what individuals <lb/>
            should learn, and how far they should pursue them. <lb/>
            We see, too, that the most valued faculties are com- <note type="chapter">4. </note> <lb/>
            prehended under it, as, for example, generalship, <lb/>
            economy, rhetoric. Since, then, this science makes <note type="chapter">5. </note> <lb/>
            use of the practical sciences, and legislates re­ <lb/>
            specting what ought to be done, and what abstained <lb/>
            from, its end must include those of the others ; so <lb/>
            that this end must be the good of man. For al­ <lb/>
            though the good of an individual and a state be the <lb/>
            same, still that of a state appears more important <lb/>
            and more perfect both to obtain and to preserve. <lb/>
            To discover the good of an individual is satisfactory, <note type="chapter">6. </note> <lb/>
            but to discover that of a state or a nation is more <lb/>
            noble and divine. This, then, is the object of my <lb/>
            treatise, which is of a political kind. <note type="footnote"> B 2 </note> <pb n="4"/>

            and not in the nature of things. Things good have <lb/>

            of enjoyment.</p>
          <p>For there are three kinds of lives which are most <note type="chapter">2. </note> <lb/>

            and by their acquaintances, and on account of vir­ <lb/>

            opinion, virtue is superior. But perhaps it may <lb/>
            rather be supposed that virtue is the end of the <lb/>

            it seems possible for a man, while in possession of <lb/>

            and besides this, to suffer the greatest misfortunes <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>BUT perhaps it would be better to examine the <note type="margin">1. <lb/>
            Plato's <lb/>
            doctrine of <lb/>
            'foa. </note> <lb/>
            theory of a universal good, and to inquire what is <note type="footnote"> I Previous to examining the nature of the doctrine itself, <lb/>
            it is important to observe that Aristotle does not attempt to <lb/>
            discuss the truth or falsehood of the Platonic doctrine of the <lb/>
            idea generally; but that the only object which he has in view <lb/>
            is to prove that the chief good is not an idea. </note><note type="footnote"> Hence he assumes as true, certain acknowledged positions <lb/>
            in the Platonic theory, and shows that these are inconsistent <lb/>
            with the belief in the ideal nature of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθόν</foreign>. After <lb/>
            having done this, he dismisses the subject with the remark <lb/>
            that such a view would be utterly unpractical; whereas some­ <lb/>
            thing practical is the object of his investigation. Let us now <lb/>
            proceed to examine what the Platonic doctrine of the idea <lb/>
            is. According to Plato, the sensible is in a state of continual <lb/>
            change, and consequently the sensible is not the true. But <lb/>
            the object of true science is to investigate what each thing is <lb/>
            of itself absolutely (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ αὐτὸ ἕκαστον</foreign>, TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτὸ καθ᾽ αὑτὸ</foreign>). <lb/>
            Hence he assumed that there existed from all eternity certain <lb/>
            archetypal forms immutable and absolutely existent; and <lb/>
            that all else which exists, either physically or metaphysi. <lb/>
            catty, is only real so far as it participates in them <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κοινωνίαν</foreign> These forms are the " ideas:" and the idea <lb/>
            may be defined, “ That which makes everything which is, to <lb/>
            be what it is," or “ whatever exhibits an eternal truth, which <lb/>
            forms the basis of the mutability of the sensible." These were <lb/>
            the types (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παραδίγματα</foreign>) after which God made all created <lb/>
            things, impressing their likeness upon matter (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕλη</foreign>), which was <lb/>
            itself also eternal, formless, yet fitted to receive form. From <lb/>
            the universal nature of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἵδεα</foreign>, it follows that there must be <lb/>
            ideas of all abstract qualities, such as the good, the beautiful, <lb/>
            the evil, health, strength, magnitude, colour ; also of all sensible <lb/>
            objects; such as a horse, a temple, a cup, a man ; even of each </note> <pb n="10"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK I."/> <lb/>
            meant by it, although such an inquiry involves diffi­ <lb/>
            culties, because men who are our friends have <lb/>
            introduced the doctrine of ideas. But perhaps it <lb/>
            would seem to be better, and even necessary, at least <lb/>
            for the preservation of truth, that we should even <lb/>
            do away with private feelings, especially as we are <lb/>
            philosophers; for both being dear to us, it is a <lb/>
            sacred duty to prefer truth.</p>
          <p><note type="margin">2. <lb/>
            Good is <lb/>
            prior and <lb/>
            posterior. </note> But those who introduced this doctrine, did not <lb/>
            suppose ideas of those things in which they predi­ <lb/>
            cated priority and posteriority, and therefore they <lb/>
            did not establish an idea of number.- But the good <lb/>
            is predicated in substance, in quality, and in relation. <lb/>
            But the self-existent and the essence are naturally <lb/>
            prior to that which is related ; for this is like an <lb/>
            offshoot, and an accident of the essence ; so that <lb/>
            there cannot be any common idea in these.</p>
          <p><note type="margin">3. <lb/>
            Different in <lb/>
            each cate­ <lb/>
            gory. </note> Again, since the good is predicated in as many <lb/>
            ways as being (for it is predicated in essence, as God <lb/>
            and intellect; and in quality, as the virtues ; and in <lb/>
            quantity, as the mean; and in relation, as utility ; <lb/>
            and in time, as opportunity; and in place, as a <lb/>
            habitation, and so on), it is evident, that it cannot <lb/>
            be anything common, universal, and one : for then <note type="footnote"> individual man; e. g., Socrates and Simmias. It is evident, <lb/>
            therefore, that we must not confound the Platonic idea with what <lb/>
            we mean by abstract ideas, which are properties, accidents, &amp;c. <lb/>
            drawn off from objects, and contemplated separately; as, <lb/>
            e. g., we may contemplate the scent or colour of a flower. <lb/>
            Each of these, according to the Platonic theory, would have <lb/>
            its corresponding "idea;" but still, as we have shown, there <lb/>
            are other ideas which are not abstract. Nor did Plato teach <lb/>
            that the idea is arrived at by abstraction or generalization ; it <lb/>
            is self-existent, eternal, and becomes known to us in our pre­ <lb/>
            sent condition by reminiscence; having been previously known <lb/>
            to us in a former state of being. </note><note type="footnote"> m As Plato held with the Pythagoreans that number and the <lb/>
            elements of number were the elements of all things, therefore <lb/>
            the ideas must be identical with numbers. In order, therefore, <lb/>
            to understand the assertion that Plato did not form an " idea" <lb/>
            of numbers, we must be careful to distinguish between the <lb/>
            ideal numbers (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀριθμοὶ εἰδητικοί</foreign>) and the numbers which <lb/>
            admit of continuation (<foreign xml:lang="grc">αυμλητοί</foreign>), which are the mathema­ <lb/>
            tical ; to the latter Aristotle refers in this passage. See <lb/>
            Brewer's Ethics, Appendix, pp. 451-2. </note> <pb n="11"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. VI.]"/> <lb/>
            it would not have been predicated in all the cate­ <lb/>
            gories, but in one only.n</p>
          <p>Again, since of things which are comprehended <note type="margin">4. <lb/>
            Also in the <lb/>
            same cate­ <lb/>
            gory. </note> <lb/>
            under one idea there is also one science, there would <lb/>
            then be some one science of all goods; but now <lb/>
            there are many sciences, even of goods which fall <lb/>
            under the same category; as, for instance, under the <lb/>
            category of opportunity; for in war there is the <lb/>
            science of generalship, but in disease, that of medi­ <lb/>
            cine ; and again, in the category of the mean, in <lb/>
            diet, there is the science of medicine ; in labours, <lb/>
            that of gymnastics.</p>
          <p>But one might doubt as to what they mean by <note type="margin">5. <lb/>
            Man and <lb/>
            self-man <lb/>
            the same. </note> <lb/>
            the term self-anything, since in self-man and man <lb/>
            there is one and the same definition of man; for <lb/>
            as far as they are man, they will not differ. But if <lb/>
            so, neither will the good and the self-good differ, so <lb/>
            far as they are good; nor yet will the self-good be <lb/>
            more a good from being eternal; if the white which <lb/>
            is of long duration is not whiter than that which <lb/>
            lasts but for a day.</p>
          <p>But the Pythagoreans seem to speak more plausi- <note type="margin">6. <lb/>

              account of these, and after another manner. It is <lb/>
              evident, then, that goods may be so called in two <lb/>
              ways; some on their own account, the others on <lb/>
              account of the former. Having, therefore, separated <lb/>
              those which are good on their own account, from <lb/>
              those which are useful, let us consider whether they <lb/>
              are predicated under one idea.</p>
          <p><note type="chapter">9. </note> Now, what kind of goods may we assume to be <lb/>
            goods on their own account? May we assume <lb/>
            all those which are pursued even when alone, such <lb/>
            as wisdom, sight, and some pleasures and honours ? <lb/>
            for these, even if we pursue them on account of <lb/>
            something else, one would nevertheless class among <lb/>
            things good on their own account: or is there no­ <lb/>
            thing else good per se besides the idea ? so that, in <lb/>
            this view of the subject, the doctrine of the idea is <note type="chapter">10. </note> <lb/>
            without foundation. But if these also belong to <lb/>
            the class of goods on their own account, the defini­ <lb/>

            minutely. The same observation may be applied <lb/>
            to the doctrine of the idea; for if there is some <lb/>

            neither be practical nor capable of being acquired <lb/>
            by man; but something of this kind is the object <lb/>
            of our present inquiry.</p>
          <p>Perhaps, however, some might think that it were <note type="margin">14. <lb/>

            are to be possessed and acted upon; for having this <lb/>
            as a pattern, we shall better know the goods which <lb/>
            are so relatively to ourselves : and if we know them, <lb/>
            we shall obtain them. Certainly this position has <note type="chapter">15. </note> <lb/>
            some plausibility, but it appears to be at variance <lb/>
            with the sciences; for all of them, although aspiring <lb/>
            after some good, and seeking to supply that which is <lb/>
            deficient, omit the knowledge of this; and yet, that all <lb/>
            artists should be ignorant of an aid of such conse­ <lb/>
            quence, and never inquire for it, is not at all reason­ <lb/>
            able. It is likewise difficult to say how a weaver or <note type="margin">16. <lb/>

            he who has contemplated the idea itself be a more <lb/>
            skilful physician, or a more able general? for the <lb/>
            physician does not appear to regard health in this <lb/>

            that of a particular individual; for he cures indi­ <lb/>

            Subject <lb/>

            search of, and inquire what it is; for it seems to <lb/>
            be different in different courses of action and arts; <lb/>
            for it is different in the art of medicine, in general­ <lb/>
            ship, and in like manner in the rest. What then <lb/>
            is the good in each ? Is it not that, for the sake <lb/>
            of which the other things are done ? Now in the <lb/>
            art of medicine this is health ; in the art of general­ <lb/>
            ship, victory ;in architecture, a house; in differen4 <note type="chapter">2. </note> <lb/>
            arts, different ends. But in every action and delibe­ <lb/>
            rate preference, it is the end ; since for the sake of <lb/>
            this all men do everything else. So that, if there <lb/>
            is any end of all human actions, this must be the <lb/>
            practical good ; but if more ends than one, these <lb/>
            must be it. By a different path, therefore, our <lb/>
            argument has arrived at the same point; and this <lb/>
            we must attempt to explain still farther.</p>

            The highest <lb/>
            good the <lb/>

            these we choose some for the sake of others, as, for <lb/>
            instance, riches, musical instruments, and univer­ <lb/>
            sally all instruments whatever, it is plain that they <lb/>
            are not all perfect. But the chief good appears to <lb/>
            be something perfect; so that if there is some one <lb/>
            end which is alone perfect, that must be the very <lb/>
            thing which we are in search of; but if there are <note type="margin">4. <lb/>
            Ends are <lb/>
            three. </note> <lb/>
            many, it must be the most perfect of them. Now <lb/>
            we say, that the object pursued for its own sake is <lb/>
            more perfect than that pursued for the sake of <lb/>
            another ; and that the object which is never chosen <lb/>
            on account of another thing, is more perfect <lb/>
            than those which are eligible both by themselves, <lb/>
            and for sake of that other: in fine, we call that <lb/>
            completely perfect, which is always eligible for <lb/>

            But honour, and pleasure, and intellect, and every <lb/>

            for the sake of happiness, because we suppose that <lb/>
            we shall attain happiness by their means ; but no one <lb/>
            chooses happiness for the sake of these, nor in short <lb/>

            sufficiency, for the perfect good appears to be self- <lb/>
            sufficient ; but we attribute self-sufficiency not to him <lb/>
            who leads, for himself alone, a solitary life, but to him <lb/>
            who lives also for his parents and children, and wife, <lb/>
            and, in short, for his friends and fellow-citizens ; since <lb/>
            man is naturally a social being. Some limit, however, <lb/>
            must be assigned ; for, if we go so far as to include <lb/>
            parents and descendants, and the friends of friends, <lb/>
            we may go on to infinity. But this must be made <lb/>
            the subject of future investigation. We define the <note type="margin">7. <lb/>

            defined. </note> <lb/>
            "self-sufficient as that which, when separated irom <lb/>
            everything else, makes life eligible, and in want of <lb/>
            nothing ; and such we suppose the nature of happi­ <lb/>
            ness to be; and moreover, we suppose it the most <lb/>
            eligible of all things, even when not reckoned toge­ <lb/>
            ther with any other good ; but more eligible, doubt­ <lb/>
            less, even when reckoned together with the smallest <lb/>
            good; for the part added becomes an excess of <lb/>
            good ; but of two goods the greater is always more <lb/>
            eligible. Happiness, then, appears something per­ <lb/>

          <p>But, perhaps, to say that happiness is the <note type="chapter">8. </note> <lb/>
            greatest good, appears like stating something which <lb/>
            is already granted : and it is desirable that we <lb/>

          <p><note type="chapter">10. </note> What, then, must this peculiar work be ? For <lb/>
            life man appears to share in common with plants; <lb/>
            but his peculiar work is the object of our inquiry : <lb/>
            we must, therefore, separate the life of nutrition <lb/>
            and growth. Then a kind of sensitive life would <lb/>

            Its defini­ <lb/>
            hen. </note> <lb/>
            There remains, therefore, a certain practical life of a <lb/>
            being which possesses reason; and of this one part is, <lb/>
            as it were, obedient to reason, the other as possessing <lb/>
            it, and exercising intellect. But this life also being <lb/>
            spoken of in two ways [according to energy and <note type="margin"><foreign xml:lang="grc">κατ' ἐνέρ­ <lb/>
            γειαν</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
            according to habit], we must take that according <lb/>
            to energy ; for that appears to be more properly so <note type="chapter">12. </note> <lb/>
            called. Now if the work of man is an energy of <lb/>
            the soul according to reason, or not without reason ; <lb/>
            and if we say that the work of man, and of a good <lb/>
            man, is the same generically, as in the case of a <lb/>
            harper, and a good harper (and so, in short, in all <note type="margin"><foreign xml:lang="grc">κατ' ἀρε­ <lb/>

            cases, superiority in each particular excellence being <lb/>
            added to each. particular work) ; for it is the work <lb/>
            of a harper to play, of a good harper to play well: <lb/>
            and if we assume the peculiar work of man to be a <lb/>
            kind of life, and this life an energy of the soul <lb/>
            and actions performed with reason ; and the pecu­ <lb/>
            liar work of a good man to be the same things <lb/>
            done well, and honourably; and everything to be <lb/>
            complete according to its proper excellence : if. T <pb n="17"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. VII.]"/> <lb/>
            repeat, these things are true, it follows, that man's <lb/>
            chief good is " an energy of the soul according to <lb/>
            virtue;" but if the virtues are more than one, <lb/>
            according to the best and most perfect virtue ; and <lb/>
            besides this, we must add, in a perfect life: q for as <note type="margin"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν βίϕ <lb/>

            neither one swallow, nor one day, makes a spring; <lb/>
            so neither does one day, nor a short time, make a <lb/>
            man blessed and happy.</p>
          <p>Let this then be the good in its general outlines; <note type="margin">13. <lb/>

            sketched in <lb/>
            outline. </note> <lb/>
            for it is necessary, perhaps, first to sketch, then <lb/>
            afterwards to complete the drawing. But it would <lb/>
            seem to be incumbent upon every one to improve <lb/>
            and distinctly delineate the figures which are cor­ <lb/>
            rectly sketched, and time would seem to be the dis­ <lb/>
            coverer of such features as these, or at least a good <lb/>
            assistant; whence also proceed the improvements <lb/>
            in the arts ; for it is the duty of every one to sup­ <lb/>
            ply deficiencies. But it is necessary to bear in <note type="chapter">11 </note> <lb/>
            mind what has been mentioned already, and not to <lb/>
            demand exactness equally in all subjects, but in <lb/>
            each according to its subject-matter, and just so far <lb/>
            as is appropriate to the system to which it belongs: <lb/>
            for the carpenter and geometrician examine a right <lb/>
            angle with different views ; the one, so far as it is <lb/>
            useful for his work, whilst the other investigates its <lb/>
            nature and properties; for his object is the con­ <lb/>
            templation of the truth, for he is a contemplator <lb/>
            of the truth. In the same manner, then, must we <note type="chapter">15. </note> <lb/>
            act in all other instances, that the mere accessories <lb/>
            may not become more numerous than the works <note type="margin">The or! <lb/>

            themselves. Nor, indeed, is the cause to be re­ <lb/>

            Aristotle! a <lb/>
            definition. </note> <lb/>
            appear to exist in our definition ;s for to some it <lb/>
            seems to be virtue, to others prudence, and to <lb/>
            others a kind of wisdom : to some, again, these, or <lb/>
            some one of these, with pleasure, or at least, not with­ <lb/>
            out pleasure ; others, again, include external pros­ <lb/>
            perity : but of these opinions, many ancient writers <lb/>
            support some; a few celebrated philosophers the <lb/>
            others; but it is reasonable to suppose that none <lb/>
            of these have totally erred, but that in some one <lb/>
            particular, at least, they are for the most part right.</p>
          <p>Now with those, who say that it is every <note type="margin">6. <lb/>
            It is active <lb/>
            virtue. </note> <lb/>
            virtue, or some virtue, our definition accords; for <lb/>
            to this virtue belongs the energy. But perhaps it <lb/>
            makes no slight difference whether we conceive the <lb/>
            chief good to consist in possession, or in use ; in <lb/>
            habit, or in energy. For it is possible, that the <note type="chapter">7. </note> <lb/>
            habit, though really existing, should cause the <lb/>
            performance of no good thing; as in the case of a <lb/>
            man who is asleep, or in any other way is incapable <lb/>
            of acting : but that the energy should do so is im­ <lb/>
            possible ; for of necessity it will act, and will act <lb/>
            well. But as in the Olympic games, it is not the <note type="chapter">8. </note> <lb/>
            most beautiful and the strongest who are crowned, <lb/>
            but those who engage in the conflict (for some of <lb/>
            these are the conquerors); thus it is those only who <lb/>
            act aright, who obtain what is honourable and good <lb/>
            in life. Moreover, their life is of itself pleasant; <note type="margin">9. <lb/>
            It is essen­ <lb/>
            tially plea­ <lb/>
            sant, </note> <lb/>
            for to be pleased, is one of the goods of the soul; <lb/>
            but that is to every man pleasant, with reference <lb/>
            to which he is- said to be fond of such a thing; as, <lb/>
            for example, a horse to the man who is fond of <lb/>
            horses, and a spectacle to the man who is fond of <lb/>
            spectacles; in like manner also, things just to the <lb/>
            lover of justice ; and, in a word, virtuous things to <lb/>
            the lover of virtue. <note type="footnote"> I These primary opinions respecting happiness our author <lb/>
            also enumerates in his Eudemean Ethics. The first he refers <lb/>
            to Socrates, Plato, and some others ; the second to Socrates; <lb/>
            the third to Thales and Anaxagoras. Amongst those who <lb/>
            added external happiness, he mentions Xenocrates.—Pell, <lb/>

            rality of mankind, are at variance with each other, <lb/>
            because they are not naturally pleasant; but things <lb/>
            naturally pleasant, are pleasant to those who are <lb/>
            fond of that which is honourable; and such are <lb/>
            always the actions according to virtue ; so that to <lb/>
            these men they are pleasant, even of themselves. <lb/>
            Their life therefore stands in no need of the addi <lb/>
            tion of pleasure, as a kind of appendage or amulet, <lb/>
            but possesses pleasure in itself; for, besides what <lb/>
            has been said, the man who does not take pleasure <lb/>
            in honourable actions, has no title to be called good; <lb/>
            for neither would any person call that man just, <lb/>
            who takes no pleasure in acting justly j nor that <lb/>
            man liberal, who takes no pleasure in liberal actions; <lb/>
            and in the other cases in like manner. But if <lb/>
            this is the case, the actions of virtue must be <lb/>
            pleasant of themselves ; and yet they are also <lb/>
            good and honourable, and each of these in the <lb/>
            highest degree, if, indeed, the good man judges <lb/>
            rightly concerning them; but he judges as we said. <note type="margin">11. <lb/>

            Happiness, therefore, is the best, the most honour­ <lb/>

            these qualities are not divided, as in the Delian <lb/>

              so whose children or friends are utterly wicked, or <lb/>
              have been good, and are dead. As, therefore, we <note type="chapter">14. </note> <lb/>
              said, there seems to be need of the addition of this <lb/>
              sort of external prosperity; whence some people set <lb/>

            of happi. <lb/>
            ness. </note> <lb/>
            is acquired by learning, by habit, or by exercise of <lb/>
            any other kind ; or whether it is produced in a <lb/>
            man by some heavenly dispensation, or even by <lb/>
            chance. Now, if there is any other thing which is <note type="margin">2. <lb/>
            A divine <lb/>
            gift. </note> <lb/>
            the gift of God to men, it is reasonable to suppose <lb/>
            that happiness is a divine gift, and more than any- i <lb/>
            thing else, inasmuch as it is the best of human <lb/>
            things. But this, perhaps, would more fitly belong <lb/>
            to another kind of investigation : but, even if it be <lb/>
            not sent from heaven, but is acquired by means of <lb/>
            virtue, and of some kind of teaching or exercise, it <lb/>
            appears to be one of the most divine of things; <lb/>
            for the prize and end of virtue seems to be some­ <lb/>
            thing which is best, godlike, and blessed. It must <note type="margin">3. <lb/>
            Common to <lb/>
            many. </note> <lb/>
            also be common to many; for it is possible, that by <lb/>
            means of some teaching and care, it should exist in <lb/>
            every person who is not incapacitated for virtue. <lb/>
            But if it is better that people should be happy by <note type="margin">4. <lb/>

            of happi. <lb/>

            these means, than by chance, it is reasonable to <lb/>
            suppose it is so, since natural productions are pro­ <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK I."/> <lb/>
            them to be produced; and likewise tie productions <lb/>
            of art, and of every efficient cause, and especially of <lb/>
            the best cause. But to commit the greatest and <lb/>
            the noblest of things to chance would be very <note type="chapter">5. </note> <lb/>
            inconsistent. Now the thing we are at present in <lb/>
            search of receives additional clearness from the <lb/>
            definition; for happiness has been said to be a kind <lb/>
            of energy of the soul according to virtue; but of <lb/>
            the remaining goods it is necessary that some exist <lb/>
            in it, and that others should be naturally assistant <note type="chapter">6. </note> <lb/>
            and useful, instrumentally. But this will agree <lb/>
            with what we stated in the beginning ; for we set <lb/>
            down the end of the political science as the good; <lb/>
            and this devotes its principal attention to form the <lb/>
            characters of the citizens, to make them good, and <lb/>
            dispose them to honourable actions.</p>

            For this cause, also, a child cannot be called happy; <lb/>
            for from his time of life he is not yet able to perform <lb/>
            such actions; but those who are so called, are <lb/>

            tunes, even this assertion admits of some dispute. <lb/>
            For if there is some good and evil to the man who is <note type="chapter">3. </note> <lb/>
            alive, and who is not aware of it, there may be sup­ <lb/>

            children and descendants generally. But this too <note type="chapter">4. </note> <lb/>
            occasions some difficulty; for when a man has lived <lb/>

            because he is, but because lie has been, happy, how <lb/>
            can it be otherwise than absurd, if, when he is <lb/>
            happy, the thing which really exists in him shall be <lb/>
            unable to be truly said of him, because we do not <lb/>
            choose to call living men happy on account of the <lb/>
            changes of life, and because we have in our minds <lb/>

            because good and evil fortune come frequently <lb/>

            shall frequently call the same man at one time <lb/>
            happy, and at another miserable, exhibiting the <lb/>

            wise the most stable, because happy men most fre­ <lb/>
            quently and most constantly pass their lives in <lb/>
            them; for this seems to be the reason why there is <lb/>
            no forgetfulness of them. Therefore, the thing <lb/>
            which we are in search of will exist in the happy <lb/>
            man, and throughout his life he will be of this <lb/>
            character; for he always, or most of all men, will <lb/>
            live in the practice and contemplation of virtuous <lb/>
            actions, and he will bear the accidents of fortune <lb/>
            most nobly, and in every case, and altogether suit­ <lb/>

            numerous accidents, if on the side of good fortune, <lb/>
            will make life more happy, for they naturally unite <lb/>
            in giving additional embellishment, and the use of <lb/>
            them becomes honourable and good ; but if they <lb/>
            happen on the other side, they crush and spoil the <lb/>
            happiness; for they bring on sorrows, and are impe­ <lb/>
            diments to many energies. But nevertheless, even <note type="chapter">9. </note> <lb/>
            in these, the honourable is conspicuous, whenever <lb/>
            a man bears with equanimity many and great mis­ <lb/>
            fortunes, not from insensibility, but because he is <lb/>
            high-spirited and magnanimous.</p>
          <p>But if the energies are the essential constituents <note type="chapter">10. </note> <lb/>
            of the happiness or the misery of life, as we said, <lb/>
            no happy man can ever become miserable; for he <lb/>
            will never do hateful and worthless actions ; for we <lb/>
            conceive that the man who is in reality good and <lb/>
            wise, bears every accident of fortune in a becoming <lb/>
            manner, and always acts in the most honourable <lb/>
            manner that the circumstances admit of, just as the <lb/>
            good general makes the most skilful use of the army <lb/>

            having in the course of it successfully attained to <note type="chapter">13. </note> <lb/>
            great and honourable things. What then hinders <lb/>
            us from calling that man happy, who energizes <lb/>
            according to perfect virtue, and is sufficiently fur­ <lb/>
            nishedx with external goods, and that not for a short <lb/>
            time, but for the full period of his life ? or must we <lb/>

            praised seems to be praised because it is of a certain <lb/>
            character, and has a certain relation to something ; <lb/>
            for we praise the just man, and the brave man, and <lb/>
            the good man generally, and virtue, on account of <lb/>
            their works and actions; and the strong man, and <lb/>
            the good runner, and every one else whom we praise, <lb/>
            because he naturally is of a certain character, and <lb/>
            has a certain relation to something that is good and <lb/>
            excellent.</p>
          <p><note type="chapter">3. </note> But this is clear from the praises that are given <lb/>
            to the gods; for they appear ridiculous when re­ <lb/>
            ferred to us; but this happens because praises are <lb/>
            bestowed relatively to some standard, as we said. <lb/>
            But if praise belongs to things of this kind, it is <lb/>
            clear that it does not belong to the best things, but <lb/>
            something greater and better is bestowed upon <lb/>
            them, as also seems to be the case : for we predicate <lb/>
            blessednessz and happiness of the gods, and of the <lb/>
            most godlike of men; and likewise of the most <lb/>
            godlike of goods; for no man praises happiness as <lb/>

            in reality is skilled in political philosophy, appears <lb/>
            to devote the principal part of his study to this ; for <lb/>
            he wishes to make the citizens good and obedient <lb/>

            legislators of the Cretans and Lacedæmonians, and <lb/>
            any others who may have become like them. But if <lb/>
            this is the peculiar study of political philosophy, it <lb/>
            is clear that the investigation would be consistent <lb/>

            happy and the miserable. But it is reasonable that <lb/>
            this should be the case; for sleep is the inaction of <lb/>
            the soul, so far forth as it is called good or bad; <lb/>
            except if some emotions in a small degree reach <lb/>
            it, and in this manner the visions of good men <lb/>
            become better than those of the generality. But <pb n="31"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. XIII.]"/> <lb/>
            enough of these things; we must therefore put aside <lb/>
            the part which consists in nourishment, since it <lb/>
            has naturally no connection with human virtue.</p>
          <p>Now another natural power of the soul appears <note type="margin">10. <lb/>

            to be irrational, but to participate in reason in some <lb/>
            sort j for we praise the reason of the continent and <lb/>
            incontinent man, and that part of the soul which is <lb/>
            endued with reason; for it exhorts us aright, and <lb/>
            to the best actions. But there seems to be in man <lb/>
            something else by nature contrary to reason, which <lb/>
            contends with and resists reason. For, in reality, <lb/>
            just as the paralyzed limbs of the body, when we <lb/>
            intend to move them to the right hand, are turned <lb/>
            aside the opposite way to the left, so it is with <lb/>
            the soul; for the impulses of the incontinent are <lb/>
            directed towards the contraries. But in the case of <lb/>
            the body we see the part that is turned aside, in the <lb/>
            soul we do not see it; but perhaps we must no less <lb/>
            believe that there is in the soul something contrary <lb/>
            to reason, which opposes and resists it; but how it <lb/>
            differs it matters not. But this part also seems, as <note type="chapter">12. </note> <lb/>
            we said, to partake of reason; at least in the con­ <lb/>
            tinent man it obeys reason ; but in the temperate or <lb/>
            brave man it is perhaps still more ready to listen to <lb/>
            reason : for in them it entirely agrees with reason.</p>
          <p>The irrational part therefore appears to be two- <note type="chapter">13. </note> <lb/>
            fold ; for the part which is common to plants does not <lb/>
            at all partake of reason; but the part which contains <lb/>
            the desires and the appetites generally in some sense <lb/>
            partakes of reason, in that it is submissive and obe­ <lb/>
            dient to it. Thus, in fact, we say that a man has <lb/>
            regard for his father and friends, but not in the same <lb/>
            sense in which we use the expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγον ἔχειν</foreign> in <unclear/> <lb/>

            moral virtue arises from habit, whence also it has <lb/>

            rience alteration from habit; for instance, the stone <lb/>
            which by nature goes downwards could never be <lb/>
            accustomed to go upwards, not even if one should <lb/>
            attempt ten thousand times, by throwing it up, to <lb/>
            give it this habit; nor could fire be accustomed to <lb/>
            burn downwards; nor could anything else which <lb/>
            has one natural bent get another different one from <lb/>
            habit. The virtues, then, are produced in us neither <note type="chapter">3. </note> <lb/>
            by nature nor contrary to nature, but, we being <note type="footnote"> a Anglicè " habit." <unclear>’Πθoς</unclear> is the result of the accumulation <lb/>
            of habits, i. e. character. Plato taught that the moral virtues <lb/>
            were not generated in us either by nature or by learning, but <lb/>
            were divinely bestowed. The Stoics rejected the twofold divi­ <lb/>
            sion of the soul and of virtue, mentioned in Book I., and <lb/>
            asserted that they were all sciences. Hence Cicero says (de <lb/>
            Off. lib. iii.), temperantia est scientia. They believed, how­ <lb/>
            ever, that the virtues were acquired; for that there were <lb/>
            innate in us certain common ideas (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κοιναὶ ἔννοιαι</foreign>), cer­ <lb/>
            tain " seeds of virtue," and “lights of nature," which could <lb/>
            be cultivated and brought to perfection. Aristotle, on the <lb/>
            other hand, denied the existence of innate ideas, and corn. <lb/>
            pared the soul to a blank tablet, on which nothing was in­ <lb/>

            naturally adapted to receive them, and this natural <note type="margin">4. <lb/>
            (2.) Be­ <lb/>
            cause we <lb/>
            get the <lb/>
            energies <lb/>
            first. </note> <lb/>
            capacity is perfected by habit. Further, in every <lb/>
            case where anything is produced in its naturally, <lb/>
            we first get the capacities for doing these things, and <lb/>
            afterwards perform the energies; which is evident <lb/>
            in the case of the senses; for it was not from fre­ <lb/>
            quently seeing or frequently hearing that we got <lb/>
            the senses, but, on the contrary, we had them first, <lb/>
            and then used them, and did not get them by <lb/>
            having used them. But we get the virtues by <lb/>
            having first performed the energies, as is the case also <lb/>
            in all the other arts; for those things which we <lb/>
            must do after having learnt them we learn to do by <lb/>
            doing them ; as, for example, by building houses men <lb/>
            become builders, and by playing on the harp, harp­ <lb/>
            players ; thus, also, by doing just actions we become <lb/>
            just, by performing temperate actions, temperate, <lb/>
            and by performing brave actions we become brave.</p>

            testimony to this; for legislators, by giving their <lb/>
            citizens good habits, make them good; and this is <lb/>
            the intention of every lawgiver, and all that do <lb/>
            not do it well fail; and this makes all the differ­ <lb/>

            Virtue and <lb/>
            vice arise <lb/>
            from the <lb/>
            same cause. </note> <lb/>
            Again, every virtue is produced and corrupted <lb/>
            from and by means of the same causes ;b and in <lb/>
            like manner every art; for from playing on tlio <lb/>
            harp people become both good and bad harp­ <lb/>
            players ; and, analogously, builders and all the <lb/>
            rest; for from building well men will become good <lb/>
            builders, and from building badly bad ones ; for if <lb/>
            this were not the case, there would be no need of <lb/>
            a person to teach, and all would have been by <note type="chapter">7 </note> <lb/>
            birth, some good and some bad. The same holds <lb/>
            good in the case of the virtues also; for by per­ <lb/>
            forming those actions which occur in our inter­ <note type="footnote"> b Actions produce contrary moral effects. Two men en­ <lb/>
            gaged in the same pursuits, exposed to the same temptations, <lb/>
            may become, the one virtuous, the other vicious. In the <lb/>
            order of nature, causes act uniformly, they cannot produce <lb/>
            opposite effects ; therefore, virtue does not come by nature. </note> <pb n="35"/>

            coarse with other men, some of us become just and <lb/>

            danger, and being accustomed to be fearful or con­ <lb/>
            fident, some become brave and others cowards. The <note type="chapter">8. </note> <lb/>
            same thing is true in cases of desire and anger; or <lb/>
            some become temperate and mild, and others in­ <lb/>
            temperate and passionate-one class from having <lb/>
            behaved themselves in such cases in one way. and <lb/>
            the other class in another. In a word, the habits are <note type="margin">9. <lb/>

            habits correspond. It does not therefore make a <lb/>
            slight, but an important, nay, rather, the whole <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK II."/> <lb/>
            jects ought to be said in outline, and not with ex­ <lb/>
            actness ; just as we said in the beginning, that <lb/>
            arguments must be demanded of such a nature <lb/>
            only as the subject-matter admits; but the subjects <lb/>
            of moral conduct and of expediency have no stabi- <note type="margin">4. <lb/>
            Ethics do <lb/>
            not admit <lb/>
            of exact­ <lb/>
            ness. </note> <lb/>
            lity, just as also things wholesome. But if the <lb/>
            treatment of the subject generally is of this nature, <lb/>
            still less does it admit of exactness in particulari, <lb/>
            for it comes under no art or set of precepts, but it <lb/>
            is the duty of the agents themselves to look to the <lb/>
            circumstances of the occasion, just as is the case in <lb/>
            the arts of medicine and navigation. But although <lb/>
            the subject before us is of this description, yet we <lb/>
            must endeavour to do the best we can to help it.</p>
          <p><note type="margin"> 5. <lb/>
            Actions <lb/>
            admit of <lb/>
            excess and <lb/>
            defect. </note> This, then, we must first observe, that things of <lb/>
            this kind are naturally destroyed both by defect <lb/>
            and excess (for it is necessary in the case of things <lb/>
            which cannot be seen to make use of illustrations <lb/>
            which can be seen), just as we see in the case of <lb/>
            strength and health ; for too much as well as too <note type="chapter">6. </note> <lb/>
            little exercise destroys strength. In like manner <lb/>
            drink and food, whether there be too little or too <lb/>
            much of them, destroy health, but moderation in <lb/>
            quantity causes, increases, and preserves it. The <lb/>
            same thing, therefore, holds good in the case of tem­ <lb/>
            perance, and courage, and the other virtues ;d for he <lb/>
            who flies from and is afraid of everything, and <lb/>
            stands up against nothing, becomes a coward; and <lb/>
            he who fears nothing at all, but goes boldly at every­ <lb/>
             <note type="chapter"> I. </note> <lb/>
            thing, becomes rash. In like manner, he who in­ <lb/>
            dulges in the enjoyment of every pleasure, and re­ <lb/>
            frains from none, is intemperate ; but he who shuns <lb/>
            all, as clowns do, becomes a kind of insensible man. <lb/>
            Fortemperance and courage are destroyed both by the <lb/>
            excess and the defect, but are preserved by the mean.</p>
          <p><note type="chapter">8. </note> But not only do the generation, and increase, and <lb/>
            destruction of these originate in the same sources and <note type="footnote"> d This assertion must be limited to the moral virtues, of <lb/>

            other things which are more plain to be seen; as <lb/>
            in the case of strength, for it is produced by taking <lb/>
            much food and sustaining many labours; and the <lb/>
            strong man is more able to do these things than <lb/>
            any other person. The case with the virtues is <lb/>
            the same; for by abstaining from pleasures we be­ <lb/>
            come temperate, and when we have become so, we <lb/>
            are best able to abstain from them. The same also <lb/>
            is the case with courage ; for by being accustomed <lb/>
            to despise objects of fear, and to bear them, we <lb/>
            become brave, and when we have become so, we <lb/>
            are best able to bear them.</p>

            pain at it is intemperate ; and he who meets dangers <lb/>

            he who feels pain is a coward; for moral virtue is con­ <lb/>

            we abstain from honourable acts. Therefore it is <lb/>

              pleasure and pain at- propel objects; for this is <note type="chapter"> 3. </note> <lb/>

              sant with' actions and passions, and pleasure and <lb/>
              pain are consequent upon every action and passion , <lb/>
              on this account, also, virtue must be conversant <lb/>
              with pleasures and pains. Punishments also, which <note type="chapter">4. </note> <lb/>
              are inflicted by means of pleasure and pain, indi­ <lb/>
              cate the same tiling ; for they are kinds of reme­ <lb/>
              dies, and remedies naturally work by contraries. <lb/>
              Again, as we said before, every habit of the soul <lb/>
              has a natural relation and reference to those things <lb/>
              by which it naturally becomes better and worse. <lb/>
              But habits become bad by means of pleasures and <lb/>
              pains, by pursuing or avoiding either improper <lb/>
              ones, or at improper times, in improper ways, or <lb/>
              improperly in any other manner, which reason <lb/>

            relation to propriety of time or manner, and so on <lb/>
            through the other categories. Therefore virtue is <lb/>
            supposed to be such as we have said, in relation to <lb/>
            pleasures and pains, and apt to practise the best <lb/>

            the following considerations. Since there are three <lb/>
            things which lead us to choice, and three to aver­ <lb/>
            sion,—the honourable, the expedient, and the plea­ <lb/>

            the inexpedient, and the painful; on all these sub­ <lb/>
            jects the good man is apt to be right in his actions, <lb/>
            and the bad man is apt to be wiong, and especially <lb/>
            on the subject of pleasure; for this is common to <lb/>
            all living creatures, and accompanies all things <lb/>
            which are the objects of choice; for both the <lb/>
            honourable and the expedient appear pleasant. <note type="chapter">7. </note> <lb/>
            Again, from our infancy it has grown up with all of <note type="footnote"> h The Cynics, and after them the Stoics and Epicureans, <lb/>
            adopted this theory of virtue ; it is probable that Aristotle is <lb/>
            here alluding to it as an opinion held by Socrates, </note> <pb n="39"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. IV.]"/> <lb/>
            us : and therefore it is difficult to rub out this affec­ <lb/>
            tion, which is, as it were, engrained in our very <note type="chapter">8. </note> <lb/>
            existence. Again, we make pleasure and pain the <lb/>
            rule of our actions, some of us in a greater, some in <lb/>
            less degree. For this reason, therefore, it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary that our whole business must be with these <lb/>
            subjects; for, to feel pleasure or pain, properly or <lb/>
            improperly, makes no slight difference to our ac­ <lb/>
            tions. Again, it is more difficult to resist pleasure <note type="chapter">9. </note> <lb/>
            than anger, as Heraclitus says, and both art and <lb/>
            excellence are always conversant with that which <lb/>
            is more difficult ; for excellence in this case is <lb/>
            superior. So that, for this reason also, the whole <lb/>
            business of virtue, and political philosophy, must <lb/>
            be with pleasures and pains; for he who makes a <lb/>
            proper use of these will be good, and he who makes <lb/>

            Aristotle, but also the important distinction which he draws <lb/>
            between practical habits and passive impressions. " In like <lb/>

            The case <lb/>
            differs in <lb/>

            virtues. </note> <lb/>
            musicians. Or, is this not the case in the arts also ? <lb/>
            for it is possible to do a grammatical action acci­ <lb/>

            fore, will only then be a grammarian, when he not <lb/>
            only does a grammatical action, but also does it <lb/>

            the virtues, for the productions of art have their <lb/>
            excellence in themselves. It is enough, then, that <lb/>
            these should themselves be of a certain character ; <lb/>
            but acts of virtue are done justly and temperately, <lb/>
            not, if they have themselves a certain character, but <lb/>
            if the agent, being himself of a certain character, <lb/>

            the possession of all other arts, these qualifications, <lb/>
            with the exception of knowledge, do not enter into <lb/>
            the calculation; but towards the possession of the <lb/>

            the importance which the Aristotelian philosophy attaches to <lb/>
            language. Verbal arguments are seldom very conclusive, but <lb/>
            as doubtless words are the signs of things and ideas, there <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>BUT it is necessary not only to say that virtue is a <note type="margin">1. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ποία ἕξ ς</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
            habit, but also what sort of a habit it is. We must <lb/>
            say, therefore, that every virtue m both makes that <lb/>
            of which it is the virtue to be in a good state, and <lb/>
            makes its work good also ; for instance, the virtue <lb/>
            of the eye makes both the eye and the work of the <lb/>
            eye good ; for by the virtue of the eye we see well. <lb/>
            In like manner, the virtue of a horse makes a horse <lb/>
             <note type="chapter"> 2. </note> <lb/>
            good, and good in speed, and in carrying its rider, <lb/>
            and in standing the attack of the enemy. If, then, <lb/>
            this is the case in all instances, the virtue of man <lb/>
            also must be a habit, from which man becomes <lb/>
            good, and from which he will perform his work well. <lb/>
            But how this will be, we have already stated.n And <note type="margin">3. <lb/>
            In every. <lb/>
            thing there <lb/>
            is a mean <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μέσον</foreign>.) </note> <lb/>
            again, it will be made manifest in the following <lb/>
            manner, if we investigate the specific nature of <lb/>
            virtue. Now, in all quantity, continuous or divi­ <lb/>
            sible, it is possible to take the greater, the less, or <lb/>
            the equal; and these either with relation to the <lb/>
            thing itself, or to ourselves ; but the equal is some <note type="margin">4. <lb/>
            This is <lb/>
            twofold. </note> <lb/>
            mean between excess and defect. But by the mean <lb/>
            with relation to the thing itself, I mean that which <lb/>
            is equidistant from both of the extremes, and this <note type="margin">1. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Του̃ <lb/>

            is one and the same in all cases; but by the mean, <lb/>
            with relation to ourselves, I mean that which is <lb/>
            neither too much nor too little for us. But this <lb/>
            is not one and the same to all; as, for example, if <lb/>
            ten is too many, and two too few, six is taken for <lb/>
            the absolute mean, for it exceeds two as much as it <lb/>
            is exceeded by ten. But this is the mean according <note type="chapter">5. </note> <lb/>
            to arithmetical proportion. But the relative mean <note type="footnote"> m The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρετὴ</foreign> means not only moral virtue but the <lb/>
            excellence and perfection of anything whatever. Thus Cicero <lb/>
            says (de Leg. i. 8) : " Est autem virtus nihil aliud quam in <unclear>se</unclear> <lb/>
            perfecta et ad summum perducta natura." </note><note type="footnote"> n See Book II. ch. ii. </note> <pb n="44"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK II"/> <lb/>
            is not to be taken in this manner; for it does not <lb/>
            follow, that if ten pounds are too much for any per­ <lb/>
            son to eat, and two pounds too little, the training- <lb/>
            master will prescribe six pounds; for perhaps this <lb/>
            is too much or too little for the person who is to <lb/>
            eat it. For it is too little for Milo,0 but too much <lb/>
            for one just commencing gymnastics ; and the case <lb/>
            is similar in running and wrestling. Thus, then, <note type="margin">Virtue <lb/>
            seeks the <lb/>

            every person who has knowledge shuns the excess <lb/>
            and the defect, but seeks for the mean, and chooses <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin">6. <lb/>
            Why virtue <lb/>
            consists in <lb/>
            a mean. </note> If, then, every science accomplishes its work <lb/>
            well, by keeping the mean in view, and directing <lb/>
            its works to it (whence people are accustomed to <lb/>
            say of excellent works, that it is impossible to take <lb/>
            anything away, or add anything to them, since excess <lb/>
            and defect destroy the excellence, but the being in <lb/>
            the mean preserves it), and if good artisans, as we <lb/>
            may say, perform their work, keeping this in view, <lb/>
            then virtue, being, like nature, more accurate and <lb/>
            excellent than any art, must be apt to hit the <note type="chapter">7. </note> <lb/>
            mean. But I mean moral virtue; for it is con­ <lb/>
            versant with passions and actions; and in these <lb/>
            there is defect and excess, and the mean; as, for <lb/>
            example, we may feel fear, confidence, desire, anger, <lb/>
            pity, and, in a word, pleasure and pain, both too <lb/>
            much and too little, and in both cases improperly. <lb/>
            But the time when, and the cases in which, and <lb/>
            the persons towards whom, and the motive for <lb/>
            which, and the manner in which, constitute the <lb/>
            mean and the excellence ; and this is the character­ <lb/>
            istic property of virtue.</p>
          <p><note type="chapter"> 8. </note> In like manner, in actions there are excess and <lb/>
            defect, and the mean; but virtue is conversant <lb/>
            with passions and actions, and in them excess is <lb/>
            wrong, and defect is blamed, but the mean is praised, <lb/>
            and is correct; and both these are properties of <note type="footnote"> 0 The story of Milo is well known :— <lb/>

            virtue. Virtue, then, is a kind of mean state, being <lb/>
            at least apt to hit the mean. Again, it is pos- <note type="margin">9. <lb/>
            To hit the <lb/>
            mean is <lb/>
            difficult. </note> <lb/>
            gible to go wrong in many ways (for evil, as the <lb/>
            Pythagoreans conjectured, is of the nature of the <lb/>
            infinite, but good of the finiteP) ; but we can go <lb/>
            right in one way only ; and for this reason the <lb/>
            former is easy, and the latter difficult; it is easy to <lb/>
            miss a mark, but difficult to hit it; and for these <lb/>
            reasons, therefore, the excess and defect belong to <lb/>
            vice, but the mean state to virtue; for, “we are <lb/>
            good in one way only, but bad in all sorts of <lb/>
            ways.”</p>
          <p>Virtue, therefore, is a “habit, accompanied with <note type="margin">10. <lb/>
            Virtue <lb/>
            defined. </note> <lb/>
            deliberate preference, in the relative mean, defined <lb/>
            by reason, and as the prudent man would define <lb/>
            it." It is a mean state between two vices, one <lb/>
            ia excess, the other in defect; and it is so, more­ <lb/>
            over, because of the vices one division falls short <lb/>
            of and the other exceeds what is right, both in <lb/>
            I assions and actions, whilst virtue discovers the <lb/>
            mean and chooses it. Therefore, with reference <note type="margin">11. <lb/>
            Virtue is <lb/>
            also an <lb/>
            extreme <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀκρότης</foreign>) <lb/>
            12, </note> <lb/>
            to its essence, and the definition which states its <lb/>
            substance,q virtue is a mean state; but with re­ <lb/>
            ference to the standard of “the best" and " the <lb/>
            excellent," it is an extreme. But it is not every <lb/>
            action, nor every passion, which admits of the <lb/>
            mean state; for some have their badness at once <lb/>
            implied in their name ; as, for example, malevolence, <lb/>
            shamelessness, envy ; and amongst actions, adultery, <lb/>
            theft, homicide. For all these, and such as these, <lb/>
            are so called from their being themselves bad, not <lb/>
            because their excesses or defects are bad. In these, <lb/>
            then, it is impossible ever to be right, but we must <note type="chapter">13. </note> <lb/>
            always be wrong. N or does the right or wrong in <lb/>
            such cases as these depend at all upon the person <lb/>
            with whom, or the time when, or the manner in <note type="footnote"> See the co-ordinate catalogue of goods adopted by the <lb/>

            which, adultery is committed; but absolutely the <lb/>
            doing of any one of these things is wrong. It <lb/>
            would be equally absurd, then, to require a mean <lb/>
            state, and an excess, and a defect, in injustice, and <lb/>
            cowardice, and intemperance. For thus there would <note type="chapter">14. </note> <lb/>
            be a mean state of excess and defect, and an excess <lb/>
            of excess, and a defect of defect. But just as there <lb/>
            is no excess and defect of temperance and courage <lb/>
            (owing to the fact that the mean is in some sense <lb/>
            an extreme), so neither in the case of these is <lb/>
            there a mean state, excess, or defect; but however <lb/>
            they be done, sin is committed. For, in a word, <lb/>
            there is neither a mean state of excess and defect, <lb/>
            nor an excess and defect of a mean state.</p>

            money, liberality is the mean state, and the excess <lb/>
            and defect, prodigality and illiberality. But in <lb/>
            these, the excess and defect are mutually contrary <lb/>
            to each other; for the prodigal man is in the <lb/>
            excess in giving money, but is in the defect in re­ <lb/>
            ceiving ; but the illiberal man is in the excess in <lb/>
            receiving, but in the defect in giving. Now, there­ <lb/>
            fore, we are speaking on these points as in an out­ <lb/>
            line, and summarily, because we consider this sum­ <lb/>

            Magnifi­ <lb/>
            cence. </note> <lb/>
            positions also : magnificence is a mean state; but <lb/>
            the magnificent man differs from the liberal man; <lb/>
            for one has to do with great things, the other with <lb/>
            small ones; the excess is bad taste and vulgar pro­ <lb/>
            fusion, the defect shabbiness. But these differ from <lb/>
            the vices which are related to liberality; but their <lb/>
            points of difference shall be stated hereafter.</p>

            mity. </note> <lb/>
            nanimity is the mean ; the excess, a vice called <lb/>
            empty vanity; the defect, meanness of spirit.</p>
          <p>But as we said that liberality, when compared <note type="margin">7. <lb/>

            with magnificence, differed from it in being con­ <lb/>
            cerned with small things, so there is a kind of feeling <lb/>
            which, being itself about small honour, has the same <lb/>
            relation to magnanimity, which is about great ho­ <lb/>
            nour ; for it is possible to desire honour as we ought, <lb/>
            and more than we ought, and less than we ought. <lb/>
            Now he who is in the excess in the desire of honour <note type="chapter">a </note> <lb/>
            is called ambitious, and he who is in the detect <lb/>
            unambitious, but he that is in the mean has no <lb/>
            name; and the dispositions are likewise nameless, <lb/>
            except that of the ambitious, which is called ambi­ <lb/>
            tion ; and from this cause the extremes claim the <pb n="48"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK II."/> <note type="chapter">9. </note> <lb/>
            middle place. And we sometimes call him who is <lb/>
            in the mean ambitious, and sometimes unambitious; <lb/>
            and sometimes we praise the ambitious man, and <lb/>
            sometimes the man who is unambitious. But here <lb/>
            after the reason why we do this will be explained ; <lb/>

            Meekness. </note> There are also on the subject of anger an excess, <lb/>
            a defect, and a mean state; but since they may be <lb/>
            said to be nameless, and as we call him who is in <lb/>
            the mean meek, we will call the mean meekness; <lb/>

            and pleasantness in all tiling which concern <note type="chapter">12. </note> <lb/>
            life. We must therefore treat of these also <lb/>
            in order to see more distinctly that the mean <lb/>
            state is in all cases praiseworthy, and the ex­ <lb/>
            tremes neither right nor praiseworthy, but blame- <note type="chapter">13. </note> <lb/>
            able. Now the greater number of these likewise <lb/>
            are nameless; but we must endeavour, as in <lb/>
            the other cases, to make names ourselves, for the <note type="chapter">14. </note> <lb/>
            sake of clearness and perspicuity. On the sub­ <lb/>
            ject of truth, therefore, let him who is in the mean <lb/>

            The mean <lb/>
            and the <lb/>
            extreme <lb/>
            are opposed <lb/>
            in three <lb/>
            ways. </note> BUT since there are three dispositions,-two vicious, <lb/>
            one in excess and the other in defect, and one <lb/>
            virtuous, namely, the mean state, they are all in <lb/>
            some sense opposed to each other ; for the extremes <lb/>
            are opposed both to the mean state and to each <lb/>
            other, and the mean state to the extremes. For as <note type="margin">2. <lb/>
            The mean <lb/>
            to the ex­ <lb/>
            tremes. </note> <lb/>
            the equal when compared with the less is greater, <lb/>
            and when compared with the greater is less; so <lb/>
            the mean states when compared with the defects <lb/>
            are in excess, and when compared with the excesses <lb/>
            are in defect, both in the passions and in the <lb/>
            actions; for the brave man in comparison with <lb/>
            the coward appears rash, and in comparison with <note type="chapter">3. </note> <lb/>
            the rash man a coward. In like manner also the <lb/>
            temperate man in comparison with the insensible <lb/>
            is intemperate, and in comparison with the intem­ <lb/>
            perate is insensible ; and the liberal man in com­ <lb/>
            parison with the illiberal is prodigal, and in com­ <lb/>
            parison with the prodigal is illiberal.</p>
          <p><note type="chapter">4. </note> Therefore those who are in the extreme thrust <lb/>
            away from them him who is in the mean state, each <lb/>
            to the other, and the coward calls the brave man <lb/>
            rash, and the rash man calls him a coward;and so <note type="margin">5. <lb/>
            The ex­ <lb/>
            tremes to <lb/>
            eacb other. </note> <lb/>
            on in the other cases. But though they are thus <lb/>
            opposed to each other, there is a greater opposition <lb/>
            between the extremes one to the other, than to the <lb/>
            mean; for these stand further apart from each <lb/>
            other than from the mean; just as the great is <lb/>
            further from the small, and the small from the <note type="chapter">6 </note> <lb/>
            great, than either from the equal. Again, there <lb/>
            appears in some extremes some resemblance to the <lb/>
            mean, as rashness seems to resemble courage, and pro­ <lb/>
            digality liberality; but there is the greatest dissimi­ <lb/>
            larity between the extremes. Now things that are <lb/>
            furthest apart from each other arc defined to be <pb n="51"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. IX.]"/> <lb/>
            opposites ; so that those that arc further off are more <lb/>
            opposite. But in some cases the defect is more op- <note type="margin">7. <lb/>
            Extremes to <lb/>
            the means <lb/>
            in two <lb/>
            ways :— </note><note type="margin"> 1. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξ αὐτου̃</foreign> <lb/>

            posed to the mean, and in some cases the excess; <lb/>
            as, for example, rashness, which is the excess, is not <lb/>
            so much opposed to courage as cowardice, which is <lb/>
            the defect; and insensibility, which is the defect, <lb/>
            is less opposed to temperance than intemperance, <lb/>
            which is the excess.</p>
          <p>But this happens for two reasons; the first from <lb/>
            the nature of the thing itself; for from one extreme <lb/>
            being nearer and more like the mean than the <lb/>
            other, it is not this but its opposite which we set <lb/>
            down as most opposite; as, since rashness appears <lb/>
            to be nearer and more like courage than cowardice, <lb/>
            and cowardice less like than rashness, we oppose <lb/>
            cowardice to courage rather than rashness, because <lb/>
            those things that are further from the mean appear <lb/>
            to be more opposite to it. This, therefore, is one <note type="chapter">9. </note> <lb/>
            reason arising from the nature of the thing itself; <lb/>
            the other originates in ourselves; for those things <lb/>
            to which we are more naturally disposed, appear to <lb/>
            be more contrary to the mean; as, for instance, we <lb/>
            are more naturally disposed to pleasures, and there­ <lb/>
            fore we are more easily carried away to intem­ <lb/>
            perance than to propriety of conduct. These, then, <lb/>
            to which the inclination is more decided, we call <lb/>
            more opposite ; and for this reason, intemperance, <lb/>
            which is the excess, is more opposite to temperance.</p>

            only in the power of him who knows how, to find the <lb/>

            worthy, and honourable. It is therefore needful <lb/>
            for him who aims at the mean, first to keep away <lb/>
            from that extreme which is more contrary, like <lb/>
            the advice that Calypso gave :v <lb/>
            " Keep the ship clear of this smoke and surge." <lb/>
            For of the extremes, one is more and one less <lb/>
            erroneous.</p>
          <p><note type="chapter">4. </note> Since, then, it is difficult to hit the mean exactly, <lb/>
            we must, as our second trial,w choose the least of <lb/>
            these evils ; and this will be best done in the man- <note type="margin">2nd rule. </note> <lb/>
            ner which we have stated. But it is necessary to <lb/>
            consider to which of the vices we ourselves are <lb/>
            most inclined; for some of us are naturally dis­ <lb/>
            posed to one, and some to another; and this we <lb/>
            shall be able to discover from the pleasure and <lb/>
            pain which arise in us. But it is necessary to drag <lb/>
            ourselves away towards the opposite extreme; for <lb/>
            by bringing ourselves far from the side of error, we <lb/>
            shall arrive at the mean ; as people do with crooked <note type="margin">5. <lb/>

            sticks to make them straight. But in every case <lb/>
            we must be most upon our guard against what is <lb/>

            sneak summarily, we shall be best able to hit the <lb/>
            mean. But perhaps this may be difficult, and <note type="chapter"> 6. </note> <lb/>
            especially in particular cases ; for it is not easy to <lb/>
            define the manner, and the persons, and the occa­ <lb/>
            sions, and the length of time for a person to be <lb/>
            angry ;for we sometimes praise those who are in <lb/>

            defect, but he who does it too much; for he does <lb/>
            not escape notice. But it is not easy to define <lb/>
            verbally how far, and to what point, a man is blame­ <lb/>
            able, nor is anything else that is judged of by the <lb/>
            common feeling and sense of mankind easy to be <lb/>

            ticular cases, and the decision of them belongs to <lb/>
            moral perception. What we have said hitherto, <note type="chapter"> 8. </note> <lb/>
            therefore, proves, that the mean state is in every <lb/>
            case praiseworthy, but that we must incline <lb/>
            sometimes towards excess, and sometimes towards <lb/>
            deficiency; for thus we shall most easily hit the <lb/>

            ranee. Aristotle has omitted the third kind of involuntary <lb/>
            actions, viz., where both conditions are wanting; e. g. where <lb/>
            there is an external force, sucu as sleep, insanity, drunkenness, <lb/>

            but in the case of our refusal should be put to <lb/>
            death,-it admits of a question whether they are <lb/>
            involantary or voluntary. Something of this kind <note type="chapter">4. </note> <lb/>
            happens likewise in the case of throwing things <lb/>
            overboard in a storm ; for, abstractedly, no one <lb/>
            voluntarily throws away his goods,' but for his <lb/>
            own and his companions' safety every sensible man <lb/>
            does it.</p>
          <p>Such actions as these, therefore, are of a mixed <note type="margin">5. <lb/>
            Reasons <lb/>
            why they <lb/>

            -it the time of their performance they are eligible, <lb/>
            and the end of the action depends upon the time of , <lb/>
            performance. An act, therefore, is to be called volun­ <lb/>
            tary and involuntary at the time when a man does <lb/>
            it. But he does it voluntarily, for the principle of <lb/>
            moving the limbs, which are used as instruments, <lb/>
            rests in such actions with the man himself; and <lb/>
            where the principle is in himself, the doing or not <lb/>
            doing the actions is in himself also. Such actions <note type="chapter"> 7. </note> <lb/>
            as these, therefore, are voluntary, but abstractedly <lb/>
            they are perhaps involuntary, for no person would <lb/>
            choose anything of the kind for its own sake. In <note type="margin">Sometimes <lb/>

            winch it is wrong to do, even on compulsion, and <lb/>
            a man ought rather to undergo the most dreadful <lb/>

            which compelled the Alcmæon of Euripides' to <lb/>

            particulars are voluntary.</p>
          <p><note type="chapter">12. </note> But it is not easy to lay down a rule as to <lb/>

            and honourable things are compulsory, for, being <lb/>
            external, they force a person to act, everything <lb/>
            would in this way be compulsory; for, for the sake <lb/>

            those who act from constraint, and involuntarily, <lb/>
            do it painfully; but those who act for the sake of <lb/>

            To act " through ignorance " (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δι' ἂγνοιαν</foreign>) signifies ignorance <lb/>
            of the fact. If an action of this kind is followed by repent­ <lb/>
            ance, Aristotle calls it involuntary (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άκούσιον</foreign>), and therefore <lb/>
            considers it excusable; but if not repented of, he terms it <lb/>

            who acts, and what he does, and about what and in <lb/>
            what case he does it; and sometimes with what, as <lb/>
            the instrument; and from what motive, as safety ; <note type="chapter">18. </note> <lb/>
            and in what manner, as gently or violently. No <lb/>
            person except a madman could be ignorant of all <lb/>
            these particulars; and it is clear that he cannot be <lb/>
            ignorant of the agent, for how could he be ignorant <lb/>
            of himself? But a man might be ignorant of what <lb/>
            he does, as those who say that they had forgotten <lb/>
            themselves, or that they did not know that they <lb/>
            were forbidden to speak of it, as Æschylus said <lb/>
            respecting the mysteries ;d or that, wishing to ex­ <lb/>
            hibit an engine, he let it off by mistake, as the man <note type="chapter">19. </note> <lb/>
            let off the catapult. Again one might fancy one's <lb/>
            son an enemy, as did Merope ;e and that a sharp­ <lb/>
            ened spear was rounded at the point, or that a <lb/>
            stone was pumice ; and, striking a person in order <lb/>
            to save him, might kill him, and wishing to show a <lb/>
            hit, as boxers do when they spar, might strike a <note type="chapter">20. </note> <lb/>
            person. Ignorance, therefore, being possible on all <lb/>
            these circumstances connected with the act, he <lb/>
            who was ignorant of any one of these, seems to <lb/>
            have acted involuntarily, and particularly in the <lb/>
            principal circumstances; but the principal circum­ <lb/>
            stances appear to be those of the act itself, and the <lb/>
            motive. But though involuntariness is said to <lb/>
            consist in such ignorance as this, still the act must <lb/>

            be voluntary agents ; and in the second place, <lb/>
            we may ask the question, is no one of the acts of <lb/>
            desire or anger, which we do, done voluntarily ? or <lb/>
            are the good ones done voluntarily, but the bad ones <lb/>

            distinctions, when the cause of both is one and <lb/>
            the same ? Perhaps, too, it is absurd to call objects <note type="chapter">23. </note> <lb/>

            with respect to involuntariness between the faults <lb/>
            that are committed on principle' and in anger ? <lb/>
            for both are to be avoided; and the irrational <lb/>
            passions appear to be no less naturally belonging <lb/>

            bility be performed by one's self; as, that a par­ <lb/>
            ticular actor, or wrestler, should gain the victory ; <lb/>
            but no person deliberately prefers such things a.­ <lb/>
            these, but only such things as he thinks may come <note type="chapter"> 6. </note> <lb/>
            to pass by his own agency. But, further, volition <lb/>
            is rather of the end, and deliberate preference of <lb/>
            the means ; for instance, we wish to be in health, <lb/>
            but we deliberately prefer the means of becoming <lb/>
            so ; and we wish to be happy, and say so; but <lb/>
            it is not a suitable expression to say, we deliberately <lb/>
            prefer it ; for, in a word, there appears to be no <lb/>
            deliberate preference in matters which are out of <lb/>
            our power.</p>

            Nor yet can it be opinion; for opinion seems to <lb/>
            be about all objects, and on things eternal and <lb/>
            impossible, just as much as on things which are in <lb/>

            Why not <lb/>

            deliberate preference. But, perhaps, no one says <lb/>
            it is the same as opinion generally; but it is not <lb/>
            even the same as any particular opinion; for we <lb/>
            get our character from our deliberate preference of <lb/>
            things good or bad, and not from our opinions. <lb/>
            And we deliberately prefer to take a thing, or not <note type="chapter">9. </note> <lb/>
            to take it, or something of this kind; but we form <lb/>
            an opinion as to what a thing is, or to whom it is <lb/>
            advantageous, or how ; but we do not form an <lb/>
            opinion at all about taking or not taking it; and <lb/>
            deliberate preference is rather praised for its being <lb/>
            directed to a right object, or for being rightly directed, <lb/>
            but opinion, for its being true. And we deliberately <note type="chapter">10. </note> <lb/>
            prefer those things which we most certainly know <lb/>
            to be good, but we form opinions about those things <lb/>
            which we do not know for certain. And it does not <lb/>
            appear that the same people are the best both in <lb/>
            forming opinions, and in exercising deliberate pre­ <lb/>
            ference ; but some are good in opinion, but through <lb/>
            vice prefer not what they ought. But whether opi- <note type="chapter">11. </note> <lb/>
            nion arises before deliberate preference, or whether <lb/>
            it follows upon it, matters not; for this is not the <lb/>
            point which wa are investigating, but whether it <lb/>
            is the same with any opinion. What, then, is its <lb/>
            genus, and what its species, since it is not any of <lb/>
            the things we have mentioned ? It seems, in fact, <lb/>
            voluntary; but not everything which is voluntary <lb/>
            is the object of deliberate preference, but only that <note type="margin">Its nomina <lb/>

            And respecting the exact and self-sufficient sciences, <lb/>

            we do not doubt how we ought to write. But <lb/>
            we deliberate about all those things which happen <lb/>

            than the sciences ; for we debate more about <note type="footnote"> I The diagonal and side of a square are incommensurable ; <lb/>
            for let the side = a, then the diagonal = √2 . a, and √2 <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. III.]"/> <lb/>
            them. But deliberation takes place in the case <lb/>
            of things that generally happen, but respecting <lb/>
            which it is uncertain how they may turn out, and <lb/>
            in which there is indefiniteness. But we take <note type="margin">a <lb/>

            ends, but about means ; for the physician does not <lb/>
            deliberate whether he shall heal, nor the orator <lb/>
            whether he shall persuade, nor the lawgiver whether <lb/>
            he shall make good laws, nor anybody else about <lb/>
            the end; but having determined on some. end, <lb/>
            they deliberate how and by what means it, may be <lb/>
            effected. I</p>
          <p>And if it appears that it may be -done by <note type="chapter"><unclear/>. </note> <lb/>
            more means than one, they next deliberated by <lb/>
            which it may be done most easily and honourably ; <lb/>
            but if it can be accomplished by one means, how it <lb/>
            can be done by this, and by what means this can <lb/>
            be effected, until they arrive at the first cause, <lb/>
            which is the last in the analysis ; for be who delibe­ <lb/>
            rates appears to investigate and analyze the subject <lb/>
            like a mathematical problem, in the way that we <lb/>
            have mentioned. Now, not all investigation seems <note type="margin">8. <lb/>
            It differs <lb/>
            from inves­ <lb/>
            tigation. </note> <lb/>
            to be deliberation, as the investigations of mathe­ <lb/>
            matics ; but every deliberation is an investigation ; <lb/>
            and the last tiling in the analysis is the first in the <lb/>
            execution. And if men come to an impossibility, <lb/>
            they leave off deliberating; as;; for example, if <lb/>
            money is necessary, but it is impossible to get it; <lb/>
            but if it appears possible, they 'set about acting. <lb/>
            For those things which can be done through our <lb/>
            own agency are possible; for those things which <lb/>
            happen by means of our friends, happen in some <lb/>
            sense through our own agency; for the principle <lb/>
            is in ourselves. But sometimes the instruments, <lb/>
            and sometimes the use of them, are the subject of <note type="chapter">9. </note> <lb/>
            investigation, and in like manner in the other <lb/>
            categories, sometimes we investigate by whose as. <note type="footnote">alone are capable of being made the subjects of deliberation <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK III."/> <lb/>
            sistance, and sometimes how, or by what means. <lb/>
            herefore, as we have said, it seems that man is the <lb/>
            origin of all actions; but deliberation is about those <lb/>
            subjects of moral conduct which are in one's own <lb/>
            power : but actions are for the sake of other things. <note type="margin">tO. <lb/>

            The end, therefore, cannot be a subject of delibera­ <lb/>
            tion, but the means; nor yet are particulars the <lb/>
            object of deliberation; as whether this is a loaf or <lb/>
            whether it is baked as it ought; for these points <lb/>
            belong to the province of sensual perception, and <lb/>
            if a man is always deliberating, he will go on for <note type="margin">11. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Βουλευτὸν</foreign> <lb/>
            and irpoat­ <lb/>

            differ. </note> <lb/>
            ever. Now, the object of deliberation and that of <lb/>
            deliberate preference are the same, except that <lb/>
            the object of deliberate preference has already <lb/>
            been restricted in its meaning; for that which <lb/>
            after deliberation is preferred, is an object of de­ <lb/>
            liberate preference; for every person ceases to <lb/>
            deliberate how he shall act, when he refers the <lb/>
            principle to himself, and his ruling part ; for it is <note type="chapter">12. </note> <lb/>
            this which deliberately prefers. But this is clear <lb/>
            from the ancient forms of government also, which <lb/>
            Homer mentions in his poems ;h for the kings used <lb/>
            to refer to the people those measures which they <lb/>
            had decided to be preferable. Now, since the ob­ <lb/>
            ject of deliberate preference is the object of delibe­ <lb/>
            ration and of desire, and for things in our own power, <lb/>
            it follows that deliberate preference is the deliberate <note type="margin"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">Προαίρεσις</foreign> <lb/>
            defined. </note> <lb/>
            desire of things in our power; for having made our <lb/>
            decision after deliberation, we desire according to <lb/>
            our deliberation. Now, let deliberate preference <lb/>
            have been sufficiently described in outline, and <lb/>
            its object stated, and that it is respecting the <lb/>
            means. <note type="footnote">h See for example Horn. Il. ii. 66, Pope's translation. <lb/>
            " Th' assembly placed, the king of men expressed <lb/>

            Friends and confederates ! with attentive ear <lb/>
            Receive my words, and credit what you hear." <lb/>
            The illustration of which Aristotle here makes use reminds us <lb/>
            of the psychical theory of Plato: for he compares the ra­ <lb/>
            tional part of the soul to kings, as though it possessed a divine <lb/>

            to some it appears to be of the good, and to others <lb/>

            good, will be, that what he wishes who chooses in- j <lb/>

            to be an object of volition, it must also be good j <lb/>
            but it might be, if it so happens, bad) ; but according <lb/>
            to those who, on the other hand, tell us that the <lb/>
            object of volition is the apparent good, there will be <lb/>
            no natural object of volition, but only that which <lb/>
            seems to each person to be so ; and different things <lb/>

            vidual, that which to him appears to be so ? That <lb/>
            the good man's object of volition is the real good, <lb/>
            but the bad man's anything which he may happen <lb/>

            just, or that the man who does intemperate actions <lb/>
            does not wish to become intemperate. But if any <lb/>
            one without involuntary ignorance does those acts, <lb/>
            from doing which he will become unjust, he must <lb/>
            be unjust voluntarily ; nevertheless, he will not be <lb/>
            able to leave off being unjust, and to become just, <lb/>

            it was in his own power not to be ill, but when he <lb/>
            has allowed himself to become ill, it is no longer in <lb/>
            his own power; just as it is no longer in the power <lb/>
            of a man who has thrown a stone, to recover it; <lb/>
            and yet the throwing and casting it was in his <lb/>
            own power ; for the origin of the action was in his <lb/>
            own power; and thus in the beginning it was in <lb/>
            the power of the unjust and the intemperate man <lb/>
            not to become such; and therefore they are so <lb/>
            voluntarily ; but when they have become so, it is no <lb/>

            the aiming at the end by which he judges well, <lb/>
            and will choose the true good, is not a matter of <lb/>
            choice, but that it is necessary for a man to be <lb/>
            born with it, as with the faculty of sight; and he <lb/>
            is well gifted by nature, who is born with this <lb/>
            good faculty; (for he will have a most honourable <lb/>
            and excellent thing, and one which he cannot get <lb/>

            in both cases vice is just as voluntary as virtue; <lb/>

            Fifth rea­ <lb/>

            in his actions as the good man. If then, as is said, <lb/>
            the virtues are voluntary, (for we are in some sense <lb/>
            joint causes of our habits, and from our being of a <lb/>
            certain character, we propose to ourselves the same <lb/>

            about the virtues we have spoken generally; we <lb/>
            have said in outline, as it were, that they are mean <lb/>
            states, and that they are habits ; we have stated <lb/>
            from what things they derive their origin, and that <lb/>
            these things they are themselves apt to practise; <lb/>
            that they are in our own power, that they are <lb/>
            voluntary, and that they are under the direction <lb/>
            of right reason.</p>

            Habits not <lb/>
            sovoluntary <lb/>
            as actions. </note> But the actions and the habits are not in the <lb/>
            same manner voluntary ; for we are masters of our <lb/>
            actions from the beginning to the end, since we <lb/>
            know the particulars; but we are masters only of <lb/>
            the beginning of our habits; but the addition of <lb/>
            particulars we are not aware of, as we are in the case <lb/>
            of sicknesses; but because it was in our power to <lb/>
            make this or that use of particulars in the first <note type="chapter">20. </note> <lb/>
            instance, on this account they are voluntary. Let <lb/>
            us then take up the virtues again separately, and <lb/>
            state what they are, what their subjects are, and <lb/>
            how they are virtues; and it will be at the same <lb/>

            things is not brave. But him, too, we call so, from <lb/>

            are liberal, and behave with courage under pecu­ <lb/>

            those which are within the power of man to bear <lb/>
            differ in magnitude, and in being some greater and <lb/>
            some less; and circumstances which cause con <lb/>
            fidence differ likewise. But the brave man is fear­ <lb/>
            less, as becomes a man ; therefore at such things <lb/>
            he will feel fear ; but he will bear up, as far as <lb/>
            right and reason dictate, for the sake of what is <lb/>
            honourable; for there is this same end to all the <note type="chapter">3. </note> <lb/>
            virtues. But it is possible for these things to be <lb/>
            feared too much and too little, and, again, for <lb/>
            things not terrible to be feared as if they were so. <lb/>
            But of faults, one is that the thing itself is not <lb/>
            right; another, that the manner is not right ; <lb/>
            another, that the time is not right, and so on; <lb/>
            and the case is similar with respect to things that <note type="chapter"> 4. </note> <lb/>
            cause confidence. Now he who bears bravely, and <pb n="73"/>

            time, and feels confidence in like manner, is brave. <lb/>
            For the brave man suffers and acts just as the <lb/>

            honourable in the case of the brave man; such <lb/>
            therefore is his end ; for everything is defined by <lb/>
            its end. For the sake, therefore, of what is honour­ <lb/>

            be called mad or insensate. The other, who is ex- <note type="chapter">7. </note> <lb/>
            cessive in his confidence in terrible circumstances, <lb/>
            is rash; and the rash man is thought to be arro­ <note type="margin"><foreign xml:lang="grc">θρασεῑς</foreign>, if. </note> <lb/>

            to seem what the courageous man is in terrible cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances ; wherever he can, therefore, he imitates <lb/>
            him. Most of these, therefore, are at once bold and <lb/>
            cowardly; for though they are bold in these cases, <lb/>
            yet they do not bear up under circumstances of <lb/>
            terror. But he who is excessive in fear is a cow- <note type="margin">8. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δειλοί</foreign> <lb/>

            fearing what he ought not, and as he ought not, <lb/>
            and so forth ; besides, he is deficient in confidence; <lb/>
            but where he is called upon to bear pain, he more <lb/>
            especially shows that he'is in excess. Now the <lb/>
            coward is desponding, for he fears everything ; but <lb/>

            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πολιτική</foreign>. </note> THERE are, besides this, five other forms of courage <lb/>
            spoken of: first, the political, for it is most like <lb/>
            true courage ; for citizens seem to undergo dangers, <lb/>
            on account of the rewards and punishments enacted <lb/>
            by law, to avoid reproach and to obtain distinction. <note type="chapter">2. </note> <lb/>
            And for this reason those nations appear to be the <lb/>
            most valiant, among whom cowards are disgraced, <lb/>
            and brave men honoured; and it is characters of <lb/>
            this kind that Homer makes the heroes of his <lb/>
            poems, as Diomede and Hector,—“Polydamas will <lb/>
            be the first to load me with reproach."P And <lb/>
            Diomede says, “ For Hector will ore day say, when <lb/>
            speaking among the Trojans, The son of Tydeus <note type="chapter">3. </note> <lb/>
            beneath my hand.” But this most nearly resem- <note type="footnote"> P See Horn. II. xxii. 100, or Pope's translation, line 140 : <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. VIII.]"/> <lb/>
            bles the courage before mentioned, because it arises <lb/>
            from virtue; for it arises from shame, and the de­ <lb/>
            sire of what is honourable, that is, distinction, and <lb/>
            from shunning reproach, which is disgraceful. But <note type="chapter">4. </note> <lb/>
            one might class with these those who are coin­ <lb/>
            pelled by their commanders to fight; but they <lb/>
            are worse, inasmuch as they do it, not from shame, <lb/>
            but from fear, and in order to avoid, not what is <lb/>
            disgraceful, but what is painful; for those who have <lb/>
            power over them compel them, as Hector says, <lb/>
            “ Whomsoever I shall find crouching far away <lb/>
            from the battle, it shall not be in his power to <lb/>
            escape the dogs and those who issue orders to' <lb/>
            them, and strike them if they retreat, do the same ; <lb/>
            also those who draw up their men in front of <lb/>
            trenches, or things of the kind, for they all use <lb/>
            compulsion :r a man must therefore be brave, not <lb/>
            because he is compelled, but because it is honourable <lb/>
            to be so.</p>

            enemy. </note><note type="footnote"> s The moral theory of Socrates was, that as virtue was the <lb/>
            only way to happiness, and no one could be willingly his own <lb/>

            other men, with which soldiers, more than any one <lb/>
            else, have become acquainted. They therefore ap­ <lb/>
            pear courageous, because all other people are not <lb/>
            aware of the nature of these things ; besides, <lb/>
            through their experience they are better able to <lb/>
            do, and not to suffer, and to protect themselves, <lb/>
            and to wound others, because they are able to use <lb/>
            dexterously their arms, and because they have such <lb/>
            arms as are best adapted for offence and defence. <note type="chapter">6. </note> <lb/>
            In battle, therefore, they are like armed men <lb/>
            against unarmed, and like professional wrestlers <lb/>
            against amateurs; for in conflicts of this kind, it is <lb/>
            not the bravest men, but those who have the <lb/>
            greatest strength, and who are in the best state of <note type="chapter">7. </note> <lb/>
            body, who make the best fighters. Now regular <lb/>
            troops become cowardly when the danger surpasses <lb/>
            their experience, and when they are inferior in <lb/>
            numbers or equipments; for they are the first to <lb/>
            fly; but a native militia stands its ground, and <lb/>
            dies, which happened in the Hermseum ;u for to <lb/>
            them flight is disgraceful, and death is preferable to <lb/>
            such safety; while the. others only expose them­ <lb/>
            selves to danger at the beginning, under the idea <lb/>
            that they are superior; but when they discover <lb/>
            the true state of the case they fly, because they <lb/>
            fear death more than disgrace. But this is not the <lb/>
            character of the courageous man.</p>

            to be courageous; because courageous men have the <lb/>

            adopts the latter reading. </note><note type="footnote"> u The Greek scholiast informs us that the Hermæum was <lb/>
            an open space in the city of Coronæa, in Boeotia. Here the <lb/>

            an engagement with Nonarchus the Phocian, who had got <lb/>

            for anger is a thing which above all others is apt <lb/>
            to rush into dangers; whence Homer also says-­ <lb/>
            “it infused strength into his soul." <lb/>
            ———“ it aroused his fury and rage." <lb/>
            “he breathed stem fury thro' his nostrils." <lb/>
            “his blood boiled." T <lb/>
            For all such signs as these seem to denote the <lb/>
            rousing and awakening of anger. Now brave men <note type="chapter">9. </note> <lb/>
            act for the sake of what is honourable; and anger <lb/>
            co-operates with them; but beasts act from pain; <lb/>
            for it is owing to their being struck or frightened ; <lb/>
            at least when they happen to be in a wood or a. <lb/>
            marsh, they do not attack. Now it is not courage <lb/>
            in them to rush into danger, because they are im­ <lb/>
            pelled by pain or rage, without foreseeing anything <lb/>
            of the danger they incur. Since, according to such <lb/>
            an idea, even asses would be brave when they are <lb/>
            hungry; for even when they are beaten they do <lb/>
            not leave their pasture; and adulterers also do <lb/>
            many acts of daring through lust. Therefore those <lb/>
            who from pain or rage are urged forward into <lb/>
            danger are not brave. But that form of courage <note type="chapter">10. </note> <lb/>
            which owes its origin to anger, appears to be more <lb/>
            physical than the other forms; but when deliberate <lb/>
            preference and the proper motive are added, it <lb/>
            becomes real courage. And men who are angry <lb/>
            suffer pain, and when they have have satisfied their <lb/>
            vengeance they feel pleasure; but those whose <lb/>
            courage is owing to this feeling, are fond of fight­ <lb/>
            ing, but not really courageous; for they do not act <lb/>
            from the motive of the honourable, nor according <lb/>
            to the suggestion of reason, but in obedience to <lb/>
            passion, and yet their courage bears a strong re­ <lb/>

            feels as he ought on subjects of confidence. Now <lb/>
            men are called brave for bearing painful things : <lb/>
            and hence it follows also that courage is attended <lb/>
            with pain, and is justly praised; for it is more diffi­ <lb/>
            cult to bear painful things than to abstain from <lb/>
            pleasant things.x Not but that the end in courage <lb/>
            is pleasant, but it is kept out of sight by the ac­ <lb/>
            companying circumstances: just as is the case in <lb/>
            the gymnastic exercises; for, to pugilists, the end <lb/>
            for which they act, namely, the crown and the ho­ <lb/>
            nours, is pleasant; but the being beaten is painful, <lb/>
            at least, if they are made of flesh, and all toil is <lb/>
            painful ; and because the painful circumstances are <lb/>
            numerous, the motive, which is a small matter, <lb/>
            appears to have nothing pleasant in it.</p>

            because it is honourable to do so, and because it is <lb/>
            disgraceful not to do so. And in proportion as he <lb/>
            is nearer the possession of all virtue and happiness, <lb/>
            he will be more pained at death; for to such a man <lb/>
            as this, more than to any other, it is worth while <lb/>
            to live, and he will knowingly be deprived of the <lb/>

            these two, courage and temperance, seem to be the <lb/>
            virtues of the irrational parts of the soul. Now, we <lb/>
            have said that temperance is a mean state on the <lb/>
            subject of pleasures ; for it has not the same, but <lb/>
            less connection with pains ; and with the same in­ <lb/>
            temperance appears to be conversant likewise. But <lb/>
            let us now distinguish the kinds of pleasures which <lb/>
            are the subject of it.</p>
          <p><note type="margin"> 2. <lb/>
            Pleasures <lb/>

            love of <lb/>
            honour, &amp;c. <lb/>
            3. </note> Let pleasures be divided into those of the soul, <lb/>
            and those of the body; as, for example, the love of <lb/>
            honour, the love of learning; for, in both these cases. <lb/>
            a man takes pleasure in that which he is art to love, <lb/>
            while his body feels nothing, but rather his intellect ; <lb/>
            but those who have to do with pleasures of this kind <lb/>
            are neither called temperate nor intemperate. Nor <lb/>
            are those called temperate nor intemperate who <lb/>
            have to do with the other pleasures which do not <lb/>
            belong to the body ; for, as to those who are fond <lb/>
            of fables, and telling long stories, and those who pass <lb/>
            their days idly in indifferent occupations, we call <lb/>
            them triflers, but not intemperate; nor yet do we <lb/>
            call those intemperate who are too much grieved <lb/>
            at the loss of money or friends.</p>

            pleasures; but not to all even of these. For those <lb/>
            who are delighted at the pleasures derived from <lb/>
            sight, as with colour, and form, and painting, are <lb/>
            neither called temperate nor intemperate, and yet <lb/>
            it would seem to be possible for a man to bo <note type="margin"> 5. <unclear/> <lb/>

            pleased even with these as they ought, or too much, <lb/>
            or too little. The same thing holds good in cases <pb n="81"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. X.]"/> <lb/>
            of hearing ; for no person calls those who are ex­ <lb/>

            perate, nor does he call those who take proper <lb/>
            pleasure in them temperate ; nor yet in cases of <note type="margin">6. <foreign xml:lang="grc">δσμή</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
            smell, except accidentally ;y for we do not call those <lb/>
            who are pleased with the smell of fruit, or roses, or <lb/>
            aromatic odours, intemperate, but rather those who <lb/>
            delight in the smell of perfumes and viands; for <lb/>
            the intemperate are pleased with these, because by <lb/>
            them the are put in mind of the objects of their <lb/>
            desire. And one might see even others besides <note type="chapter">7. </note> <lb/>
            intemperate people, who when hungry take delight <lb/>
            in the smell of meat ; but taking delight in these <lb/>
            things is a mark of the intemperate man, for to him <lb/>
            these things are objects of desire. But even other <note type="chapter">S. </note> <lb/>
            animals perceive no pleasure through the medium <lb/>
            of these senses, except accidentally; for dogs do not <lb/>
            take delight in the smell of hares, but in eating <lb/>
            them, although the smell caused the sensation. Nei­ <lb/>
            ther does the lion feel pleasure in the lowing of an <lb/>
            ox, but in eating it ; but he perceived from the low­ <lb/>
            ing that the ox was near, and therefore he appears <lb/>
            to be pleased at this; and likewise he is not de­ <lb/>
            lighted at merely seeing or finding a stag or wild <lb/>
            goat, but because he will get food. Therefore tem- <note type="chapter">9. </note> <lb/>
            perance and intemperance belong to those pleasures <lb/>
            in which other animals participate; whence they <lb/>
            appear slavish and brutal; and these are touch and <lb/>
            taste. Now they seem to have little or nothing <note type="margin">10. <foreign xml:lang="grc">γευ̃σις</foreign>, <lb/>

            take much or indeed any pleasure in these flavours, <lb/>
            but only in the enjoyment, which is caused en­ <lb/>
            tirely by means of touch, and which is felt in meat, <lb/>
            in drink. and in venereal pleasures. Wherefore <note type="margin">11. <foreign xml:lang="grc">άφὴ</foreign>, <lb/>

            that he had a throat longer than a crane's ; because <lb/>
            he was pleased with touch, the most common of <lb/>
            senses, and the one to which intemperance belongs; <lb/>
            and it would appear justly to be deserving of <lb/>
            reproach, since it exists in us, not so far forth as we <note type="chapter">12. </note> <lb/>
            are men, but so far forth as we are animals. Now, <lb/>
            to delight in such things as these, and to be better <lb/>
            pleased with them than anything else, is brutal; <lb/>
            for the most liberal of the pleasures of touch are <lb/>
            not included, those, namely, which arise from fric­ <lb/>
            tion and warmth in the gymnastic exercises; for <lb/>
            the touch in which the intemperate man takes <lb/>
            pleasure belongs not to the whole body, but to <lb/>
            particular parts of it.</p>

            others peculiar and acquired; as, for example, the <lb/>
            desire of food is natural ; for every man desires, when <note type="margin">2. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κοινοὶ</foreign> ; in <lb/>

            hungry, meat or drink, or sometimes both; and a <lb/>
            young man in his prime, Homer says, desires the <lb/>
            nuptial couch; but it is not every man who feels <lb/>
            this or that desire, nor db all feel the same. <lb/>
            Therefore this appears to be peculiarly our own; <lb/>
            not but that it has something natural in it, for <lb/>
            different things are pleasant to different people, and <lb/>
            some things are more pleasant universally than <lb/>
            others which might be selected at random. In the <lb/>
            natural desires, then, few err, and only on one side, <lb/>
            that of excess; for to eat or drink anything till a <lb/>
            man be overfilled is exceeding the natural desire in <lb/>
            quantity; for the object of natural desire is the <lb/>
            satisfaction of our wants. Therefore these are <lb/>
            called belly gods, because they satisfy their wants <lb/>

            dispositions are apt to do this. But in the case of <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. XI.]"/> <lb/>
            for people who are called lovers of these things, <lb/>
            arc so called either from being pleased with im­ <lb/>
            proper objects, or in improper degree, or as the <lb/>
            vulgar are, or in an improper manner, or at an <lb/>
            improper time; but intemperate persons are in <lb/>
            the excess in all these particulars; for they are <lb/>
            pleased with some things that ought not to please <lb/>
            them, because they are hateful; and if any of these <lb/>
            things are proper objects of delight, they are de­ <lb/>
            lighted with them either more than they ought, <lb/>
            or as the vulgar are.</p>
          <p>It is clear, therefore, that excess in pleasures is <lb/>
             <note type="margin">Courage <lb/>

            bearing them; but a man is called intemperate for <lb/>
            feeling more pain than he ought at not obtaining <lb/>
            pleasant things; (so the pleasure is the cause <lb/>
            of the pain;) but the temperate man is called so <lb/>

            reason he feels pain both on account of his failure <lb/>
            in obtaining, and his desire to obtain; for desire is <lb/>
            accompanied by pain; but it seems absurd to be <lb/>
            pained through pleasure.</p>
          <p>But there are, in fact, none who fall short on the <note type="margin">6. <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK 111."/> <lb/>
            excessively with anything; nor is he pained at their <lb/>
            absence\ nor does he feel desire, except in modera­ <lb/>
            tion, nor more than he ought, nor when he ought <note type="chapter">8. </note> <lb/>
            not, nor in any case improperly. But he feels <lb/>
            moderate and proper desire for all those pleasant <lb/>
            things which conduce to health, or a sound habit of <lb/>
            body; and he feels the same desire for those other <lb/>
            pleasures which do not hinder these, which are not <lb/>
            contrary to the honourable, nor beyond his means; <lb/>
            for he who feels otherwise sets too high a price <lb/>
            upon such pleasures. But this is not the character <lb/>
            of the temperate man; but he feels them according <lb/>
            to the suggestions of right reason.</p>

            Why in­ <lb/>
            temperance <lb/>
            is more <lb/>
            voluntary <lb/>
            than <lb/>
            cowardice. </note> BUT intemperance seems more voluntary than cow­ <lb/>
            ardice ; for one arises from pleasure, and the other <lb/>
            from pain; one of which is to be chosen, and the <lb/>
            other to be avoided. And pain puts a man beside <lb/>
            himself, and disturbs his natural character; whereas <lb/>
            pleasure has no such effect. It is, therefore, more <lb/>
            voluntary, and for this reason more deserving of <lb/>
            reproach ; for it is easier to become accustomed to <lb/>
            resist pleasures, because they frequently occur in <lb/>
            life ; and in forming the habits there is no danger; <lb/>
            but the case of things formidable is just the con­ <lb/>
            trary.</p>
          <p><note type="chapter">2. </note> And it would appear that cowardice is not <lb/>
            equally voluntary in the particular acts; for cow­ <lb/>
            ardice itself is not painful; but the particular <lb/>
            circumstances through pain put a man beside him­ <lb/>
            self, and cause him to throw away his arms, and to <lb/>
            do other disgraceful things :and therefore it appears <note type="chapter">3. </note> <lb/>
            to be compulsory. In the case, however, of the <lb/>
            intemperate man, on the contrary, his particular <lb/>
            acts are voluntary; for they are committed in obe. <pb n="85"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. XII.]"/> <lb/>
            dience to his lusts and desires; but the whole habit <lb/>
            is less voluntary ; for no one desires to be intempe­ <lb/>
            rate. We apply the term intemperance to children's <note type="margin">4. <lb/>
            Analogy <lb/>
            between <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">άκοασία</foreign> <lb/>
            (etymolo­ <lb/>
            gically un­ <lb/>
            chastened­ <lb/>
            ness), and <lb/>
            the faults <lb/>
            of children. </note> <lb/>
            faults also ; for there is some resemblance between <lb/>
            the two cases; but which use of the word is derived <lb/>
            from the other, matters not for our present purpose. <lb/>
            But it is evident that the latter meaning was derived <lb/>
            from the former ; and the metaphor seems to be by <lb/>
            no means a bad one : for whatever desires those <lb/>
            things which are disgraceful, and is apt to increase <lb/>
            much, requires chastisement; and this is especially <lb/>
            the case with desires and children; for children <lb/>
            live in obedience to desire, and in them the desire <lb/>
            of pleasure is excessive. If, therefore, it is not <note type="margin">5. <lb/>
            Rules re­ <lb/>
            specting <lb/>
            the desires. </note> <lb/>
            obedient, and subject to rule, it will increase greatly; <lb/>
            for the desire of pleasure is insatiable, and attacks <lb/>
            the foolish man on all sides ; and the indulgence of <lb/>
            desire increases the temper which is congenial to it, <lb/>
            and if the desires are great and strong, they expel <lb/>
            reason also. Hence it is necessary that they should be <note type="chapter">6. </note> <lb/>
            moderate and few, and not at all opposed to reason: <lb/>
            and this state is what we call obedient and disci­ <lb/>
            plined ; for as a child ought to live in obedience to <lb/>
            the orders of his master, so ought that part of the <lb/>
            soul which contains the desires, to be in obedience <lb/>
            to reason. It is therefore necessary for that part <note type="chapter"> 7. </note> <lb/>
            of the soul of the temperate man which contains <lb/>
            the desires, to be in harmony with reason; for <lb/>
            the honourable is the mark at which both aim; <lb/>
            and the temperate man desires what he ought, and <lb/>
            as he ought, and when he ought; and thus reason <lb/>
            also enjoins. Let this suffice, therefore, on the <lb/>
            subject of temperance.</p><pb n="86"/>

            be a mean on the subject of possessions; for the <lb/>
            liberal man is praised, not for matters which re­ <lb/>
            late to war, nor for those in which the temperate <lb/>
            character is exhibited, nor yet for his judgment, but <lb/>
            in respect to the giving and receiving of property; <lb/>
            and more in giving than receiving. But by pro­ <lb/>
            perty we mean everything, of which the value is <note type="margin">2. <lb/>
            The ex­ <lb/>
            tremes are <lb/>
            often con­ <lb/>
            founded <lb/>
            with other <lb/>
            vices. </note> <lb/>
            measured by money. Now, the excess and defect <lb/>
            on the subject of property are prodigality and <lb/>
            illiberality; the term illiberality we always attach <lb/>
            to those who are more anxious than they ought <lb/>
            about money; but that of prodigality we sometimes <lb/>
            use in a complex sense, and attach it to intem­ <lb/>
            perate people, for we call those who are inconti­ <lb/>
            nent, and profuse in their expenditure for purposes <lb/>
            of intemperance, prodigal; therefore they seem to <lb/>
            be the most wicked, for they have many vices at <note type="chapter">3. </note> <lb/>
            once. Now, they are not properly so called, for the <lb/>
            meaning of the word prodigal is the man who has <lb/>
            one single vice, namely, that of wasting his fortune ; <lb/>
            for the man who is ruined by his own means is <lb/>
            prodigal, and the waste of property appears to be a <lb/>
            sort of ruining one's self, since life is supported by <lb/>
            means of property. This is the sense, therefore, <lb/>
            that we attach to prodigality. But it is possible <lb/>
            to make a good and bad use of everything which <lb/>
            has use. Now, money is one of the useful things ; <lb/>
            and that man makes the best use of everything <lb/>
            who possesses the virtue which relates to it, and, <pb n="87"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. I.]"/> <lb/>
            therefore, lie who possesses the virtue that relates <lb/>
            to money will make the best use of it, and the <lb/>
            possessor of it is the liberal man.</p>
          <p>But spending and giving seem to be the use of <note type="margin">4. <lb/>
            Why libe­ <lb/>
            rality con­ <lb/>
            sists more <lb/>
            in giving <lb/>
            than re­ <lb/>
            ceiving. </note> <lb/>
            money, and receiving and taking care of it are more <lb/>
            properly the method of acquiring it; hence it is <lb/>
            more the part of the liberal man to give to proper <lb/>
            objects than to receive from proper persons, or to <lb/>
            abstain from receiving from improper persons; for <lb/>
            it belongs more to the virtue of liberality to do than <lb/>
            to receive good, and to do what is honourable than <lb/>
            to abstain from doing what is disgraceful. And it <note type="chapter">5. </note> <lb/>
            is clear that doing what is good and honourable <lb/>
            belongs to giving, and that receiving good and ab­ <lb/>
            staining from doing what is disgraceful, belongs to <lb/>
            receiving; and thanks are bestowed on the giver, <lb/>
            and not on him who abstains from receiving, and <lb/>
            praise still more so; and abstaining from receiving <lb/>
            is more easy than giving, for men are less disposed to <lb/>
            give what is their own than not to take what be­ <lb/>
            longs to another; and givers are called liberal, while <lb/>
            those who abstain from receiving are not praised <lb/>
            for liberality, but nevertheless they are praised for <lb/>
            justice; but those who receive are not praised at all. <lb/>
            But liberal men are more beloved than any others, <lb/>
            for they are useful, and their usefulness consists in <lb/>
            giving.</p>
          <p>But actions according to virtue are honourable, <note type="margin">6. <lb/>

            and are done for the sake of the honourable; the <lb/>
            liberal man, therefore, will give for the sake of <lb/>
            the honourable, and will give properly, for he will <lb/>
            give to proper objects, in proper quantities, at pro­ <lb/>
            per times; and his giving will have all the other <lb/>
            qualifications of right giving, and he will do this <lb/>
            pleasantly and without pain ; for that which is done <lb/>
            according to virtue is pleasant, or without pain, and <lb/>
            by no means annoying to the doer. But he who <note type="chapter"> 7. </note> <lb/>
            gives to improper objects, and not for the sake of <lb/>
            the honourable, is not to be called liberal, but some­ <lb/>
            thing else ; nor yet he who gives with pain. for In; <lb/>
            would prefer the money to the performance of an <pb n="88"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK IT."/> <lb/>

            improper persons, for such receiving is not charac­ <lb/>
            teristic of him who estimates things at their proper <lb/>
            value ; nor would he be fond of asking, for it is not <lb/>
            like a benefactor, readily to allow himself to be be­ <lb/>
            nefited ; but he will receive from proper sources; <lb/>
            for instance, from his own possessions ; not because <lb/>
            it is honourable, but because it is necessary, in order <lb/>
            that he may have something to give; nor will he <lb/>
            be careless of his own fortune, because he hopes by <lb/>
            means of it to be of use to others; nor will he give <lb/>
            at random to anybody, in order that he may have <lb/>
            something to give to proper objects and in cases <lb/>
            where it is honourable to do so.</p>

            Requisites <lb/>
            for the <lb/>
            liberal <lb/>
            giver. </note> It is characteristic of the liberal man to be pro­ <lb/>
            fuse and lavish in giving, so as to leave but little <lb/>
            for himself, for it is characteristic of him not to look <lb/>
            to his own interest. But the term liberality is ap­ <lb/>
            plied in proportion to a man's fortune, for the liberal <lb/>
            consists not in the quantity of the things given, <lb/>
            but in the habit of the giver; and this habit gives <lb/>
            according to the means of the giver. And there is <lb/>
            nothing to hinder the man whose gifts are smaller <lb/>
            being more liberal, provided he gives from smaller <note type="margin">10. <lb/>
            Those <lb/>
            who inherit <lb/>
            wealth the <lb/>
            most <lb/>
            liberal. </note> <lb/>
            means. But those who have not been the makers <lb/>
            of their own fortune, but have received it by in­ <lb/>
            heritance, are thought to be more liberal, for they <lb/>
            are inexperienced in want, and all men love their own <lb/>
            productions most, as parents and poets. But it is <lb/>
            not easy for the liberal man to be rich, since he is not <lb/>
            apt to receive or to take care of money, but rather <lb/>
            to give it away, and to be careless of it for its own <lb/>
            sake, and only to care for it for the sake of giving <note type="chapter">11. </note> <lb/>
            away. And for this reason people upbraid fortune, <lb/>
            because those who are most deserving of wealth are <lb/>
            the least wealthy. But this happens not without <lb/>
            reason, for it is impossible for a man to have money <lb/>
            who takes no pains about getting it, as is the case <lb/>
            in other things.</p>
          <p><note type="margin">Liberal 12. </note> Yet the liberal man will not give to improper <pb n="89"/>

            from the <lb/>
            prodigal in <lb/>
            giving. </note> <lb/>
            if he did, he would cease to act with liberality ; <lb/>
            and if he were to spend money upon these things, <lb/>
            he would have none to spend upon proper objects, <lb/>
            for, as has been observed, the man who spends <lb/>
            according to his means, and upon proper objects, is <lb/>
            liberal, but he who is in the excess is prodigal. For <note type="margin">Kings <lb/>
            cannot be <lb/>
            prodigals. </note> <lb/>
            this reason we do not call kings prodigal, for it <lb/>
            does not appear easy to exceed the greatness of <lb/>
            their possessions in gifts and expenditure.</p>
          <p>Liberality, therefore, being a mean state on the <note type="chapter">13. </note> <lb/>
            subject of giving and receiving money, the liberal <lb/>
            man will give and expend upon proper objects, and <lb/>
            in proper quantities, in small and great matters <lb/>
            alike, and this he will do with pleasure ; and he will <note type="margin">Liberal <lb/>
            man dif­ <lb/>
            ferent <lb/>
            from the <lb/>
            prodigal in <lb/>
            receiving. </note> <lb/>
            receive from proper sources, and in proper quanti­ <lb/>
            ties ; for, since the virtue of liberality is a mean state <lb/>
            it both giving and receiving, he will in both cases <lb/>
            act as he ought; for proper receiving is naturally <lb/>
            consequent upon proper giving, and improper re­ <lb/>
            ceiving is the contrary. Habits, therefore, which <lb/>
            arc naturally consequent upon each other are pro­ <lb/>
            duced together in the same person, but those that <lb/>
            are contrary clearly cannot. But if it should happen <note type="margin">14. <lb/>
            When and <lb/>
            how the <lb/>
            liberal will <lb/>
            feel pain. </note> <lb/>
            to the liberal man to spend in a manner inconsistent <lb/>
            with propriety and what is honourable, he will feel <lb/>
            pain, but only moderately and as he ought, for it is <lb/>
            characteristic of virtue to feel pleasure and pain at <lb/>
            proper objects, and in a proper manner. And the <note type="chapter">12. </note> <lb/>
            liberal man is ready to share his money with others; <lb/>
            for, from his setting no value on it, he is liable to <lb/>
            be dealt with unjustly, and he is more annoyed at <lb/>
            not spending anything that he ought to have spent, <lb/>
            than pained at having spent what he ought not; <lb/>
            and he is no mend of Simonides.a But the prodigal <note type="chapter">13. </note> <lb/>
            man even in these cases acts wrongly, for he neither <lb/>
            feels pleasure nor pain, where he ought nor as <lb/>
            he ought. But it will be more clear to us as we <lb/>
            proceed. <note type="footnote"> a The poet Simonides is generally accused of avarice. Com­ <lb/>

            in giving, but excessive in receiving, but only in <lb/>
            cases of small expenditure. Both the characteristics <lb/>
            of prodigality, therefore, are seldom found in the <lb/>
            same person; for it is not easy for a person who <lb/>
            receives from nobody to give to everybody, for their <lb/>
            means soon fail private persons who give, and these <note type="margin">15. <lb/>
            Why pro­ <lb/>
            digality is <lb/>
            better <lb/>
            than illi­ <lb/>
            berality. </note> <lb/>
            are the very persons who seem to be prodigal. This <lb/>
            character now would seem considerably better than <lb/>
            the illiberal one; for he is easily to be cured by age <lb/>
            and by want, and is able to arrive at the mean ; for <lb/>
            he has the qualifications of the liberal man ; for <lb/>
            he both gives and abstains from receiving, but in <lb/>
            neither instance as he ought, nor well. If, there­ <lb/>
            fore, he could be accustomed to do this, or could <lb/>
            change his conduct in any other manner, he would <lb/>
            be liberal, for he will then give to proper objects, <lb/>
            and will not receive from improper sources; and for <lb/>
            this reason he does not seem to be bad in moral <lb/>
            character, for it is not the mark of a, wicked or an <lb/>
            ungenerous man to be excessive in giving and not <lb/>
            receiving, but rather of a fool. But he who is in <lb/>
            this manner prodigal seems far better than the illi­ <lb/>
            beral man, not only on account of the reasons already <lb/>
            stated, but also because he benefits many people, <lb/>
            while the other benefits nobody, not even himself.</p>

            character­ <lb/>
            istics of <lb/>
            prodigality. </note> But the majority of prodigals, as has been stated, <lb/>
            also receive from improper sources, and are in <lb/>
            this respect illiberal. Now, they become fond of <lb/>
            receiving, because they wish to spend, and are not <lb/>
            able to do it easily, for their means soon fail them ; <lb/>
            they are, therefore, compelled to get supplies from <lb/>
            some other quarter, and at the same time, owing to <lb/>
            their not caring for the honourable, they receive <lb/>
            without scruple from any person they can ; for they <lb/>
            are anxious to give, and the how or the whence they <pb n="91"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. I.]"/> <lb/>
            get the money matters not to them.b Therefore <note type="chapter">17. </note> <lb/>
            their gifts are not liberal, for they are not honour­ <lb/>
            able, nor dene for the sake of the honourable, nor <lb/>
            as they ought to be done ; but sometimes they <lb/>
            make men rich who deserve to be poor, and will <lb/>
            give to men of virtuous characters nothing, and to <lb/>
            flatterers, or those who provide them with any <lb/>
            other pleasure, much. Hence the generality of pro- <note type="chapter">18. </note> <lb/>
            digals are intemperate also; for, spending money <lb/>
            carelessly, they are expensive also in acts of in­ <lb/>
            temperance, and, because they do not live with a <lb/>
            view to the honourable, they fall away towards <lb/>
            pleasures. The prodigal, therefore, if he be without <lb/>
            the guidance of a master, turns aside to these vices; <lb/>
            but if he happen to be taken care of, he may pos­ <lb/>
            sibly arrive at the mean, and at propriety.</p>
          <p>But illiberality is incurable, for old age and im- <note type="margin">19. <lb/>

            and it is more congenial to human nature than pro­ <lb/>
            digality ; for the generality of mankind are fond of <lb/>
            money rather than of giving, and it extends very <lb/>

            two things, the defect of giving, and the excess <lb/>

            satisfied neither to receive nor give. Again, in re­ <lb/>
            ceiving, some are excessive in receiving from any <lb/>
            source, and any thing; those, for instance, who ex­ <lb/>

            all persons of this kind, and usurers, and those who <lb/>

            ceive from improper sources, and in improper quan- <note type="chapter">23. </note> <lb/>
            titles. And the love of base gain appears to be <lb/>
            common to them all; for they all submit to re­ <lb/>
            proach for the sake of gain, and even for small <lb/>
            gain. For we do not call those illiberal who receive <lb/>
            great things from improper sources, as tyrants, who <lb/>
            lay waste cities, and pillage temples, but rather <lb/>

            gamester, the clothes-stealer, and the robber, are of <lb/>
            the illiberal class, for they are fond of base gain ; <lb/>
            for, for the sake of gain, both of them ply their <lb/>
            trades, and incur reproach. Clothes-stealers and <lb/>
            robbers submit to the greatest dangers for the sake <lb/>
            of the advantage they gain, and gamesters gain from <note type="chapter">25. </note> <lb/>
            their friends, to whom they ought to give. Both, <lb/>
            therefore, are lovers of base gain, in that they desire <lb/>
            to gain from sources whence they ought not; and <lb/>
            all such modes of receiving are illiberal. With <lb/>
            reason, therefore, is illiberality said to be contrary <lb/>

            fers from <lb/>
            liberality. </note> <lb/>
            is the next to be discussed ; for this likewise is a vir­ <lb/>
            tue on the subject of money ; but it does not, like <lb/>
            liberality, extend to all acts that pertain to money, <lb/>
            but only those which involve great expenditure. <lb/>
            And in these it surpasses liberality in greatness ; <lb/>
            for, as its name signifies, it is appropriate expendi­ <lb/>
            ture in great matters; but greatness is a relative <lb/>
            term; for the expense of the office of trierarch <lb/>
            and of the chief of a sacred embassyc is not the <lb/>
            same. Propriety therefore depends upon the rela- <note type="margin">2. <lb/>

            propriety <lb/>

            tion of the expense to the expender ; the object of <lb/>
            the expense ; and the quantity expended. But he <lb/>
            who in trifling, or in moderate matters, spends with <lb/>
            propriety, is not called magnificent; as in the line, <lb/>
            "I often gave to the wandering beggar ;”d but <lb/>
            he who expends with propriety in great matters <lb/>
            is so called; for the magnificent man is liberal; <lb/>
            but it does not follow any more for that, that the <lb/>
            liberal man should be magnificent. Of this habit <note type="chapter">3. </note> <lb/>
            the defect is called meanness ; the excess, bad taste <lb/>
            and vulgar profusion,e and all other names which <lb/>
            are applied to excess, not on proper, but improper <lb/>

            appropriate, and to incur great expense in accor­ <lb/>
            dance with it; for, as we said in the beginning, the <lb/>
            habit is defined by the energies, and by the acts of <lb/>
            which it is the habit. The expenses of the magni­ <lb/>
            ficent man, therefore, are great and appropriate ; <lb/>
            such also are his works ; for so will his expense be <lb/>
            great, and be appropriate to his work. So that the <lb/>
            work ought to be worthy of the expense, and the <lb/>
            expense worthy, or even more than worthy, of the <note type="margin">5. <lb/>
            Motive. </note> <lb/>
            work. Now the magnificent man will incur such <lb/>
            expenses for the sake of the honourable ; for this <lb/>
            is common to all the virtues ; and besides, he will <lb/>
            do it with pleasure and with profuseness ; for exact <lb/>
            accuracy is mean ; and he would be more likely to <lb/>
            consider how he could do the thing most beautifully <lb/>
            or most appropriately, than how much it would <lb/>
            cost, or how he might do it at the smallest price. <note type="chapter">6. </note> <lb/>
            Consequently the magnificent man must necessarily <lb/>
            be liberal also; for the liberal man will spend <lb/>
            what he ought, and as he ought; but in these cases <lb/>
            greatness is characteristic of the magnificent man. <lb/>
            Since, then, liberality belongs to these subjects, mag­ <lb/>
            nificence will, even with the same expense, make its <lb/>
            work more magnificent; for the excellence of a <lb/>
            possession and a work is different; for a possession <lb/>
            is most excellent when it is of the greatest value, <lb/>
            and would fetch most money, as gold; but a work, <lb/>
            when it is great and honourable ; for the contem­ <lb/>

            magnifi­ <lb/>

            platon of a work like this causes admiration, and <lb/>
            the magnificent causes admiration. The excellence <lb/>
            of a work, therefore, is magnificence in greatness.</p>
          <p>Now all those things which we call honourable, <lb/>
            are included under the term expenses, as, for <lb/>
            example, those that relate to the gods, offerings, <lb/>
            temples, and sacrifices; likewise all those that <lb/>
            relate to anything divine ; and those which, being <lb/>
            done for the public good, are objects of laudable <lb/>
            ambition; as if men think that a person ought to <lb/>
            be splendid in the offices of choragus, or trierarch, <lb/>
            or public entertainer. But in all cases, as has been <lb/>
            said, there must be a reference to the rank and <pb n="95"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. II.]"/> <lb/>
            property of the person who expends; for the ex­ <lb/>
            pense must have proper relation to these things, <lb/>
            and not only be appropriate to the work, but to the <lb/>
            doer of the work also. Hence a poor man cannot <note type="margin">8. <lb/>
            The poor <lb/>

            be magni­ <lb/>
            ficent. </note> <lb/>
            be magnificent, for he has not property from which <lb/>
            he can expend large sums with propriety; and the <lb/>
            poor man who attempts it is a fool; for it is incon­ <lb/>
            sistent with his rank, and with propriety; but <lb/>
            excellence consists in doing it rightly. But magnifi- <note type="chapter">9. </note> <lb/>
            cent actions become those, to whom magnificent pro­ <lb/>
            perty belongs previously, either by their own means, <lb/>
            or their ancestors, or any with whom they are con­ <lb/>
            nected ; they also become the nobly born, the <lb/>
            famous, and so on ; for all these have greatness and <lb/>
            dignity. Such, then, is the character of the magni­ <lb/>
            ficent man as near as possible, and in such expenses <lb/>
            is magnificence displayed; for these are the greatest <lb/>
            and most had in honour.</p>
          <p>But of private expenses, those are the most <note type="margin">10. <lb/>

            or anything in which the whole city, or the princi­ <lb/>

            to the reception and dismissal of strangers, and to <lb/>
            honorary gifts and recompenses; for the magnificent <lb/>
            man is not inclined to spend upon himself, but <lb/>
            upon the public; but gifts bear some resemblance <lb/>
            to offerings. It is also characteristic of the mag- <note type="chapter">II. </note> <lb/>

            coming his wealth; for this is an ornament to him ; <lb/>

            works as are lasting ; for these are the most honour­ <lb/>
            able ; and in every case to attend to propriety; for <lb/>
            the same things are not suitable to gods and men, <lb/>

            most beautiful ball or oil-bottle is magnificent as a <lb/>
            gift to a child, but the price of it is trifling and <lb/>

            man to do what he does, of whatever description <lb/>
            it be, magnificently; for this is not easily sur­ <lb/>

            is in excess, as we have said, in spending impro­ <lb/>

            sums, and be inconsistently splendid ; for instance, <lb/>
            he will entertain his club-follows with a marriage <lb/>
            feast and when furnishing a chorus for a comedy, <lb/>
            will introduce a purple robe into the parode, g like <lb/>
            the Megareans; and all this he will do, not for the <lb/>
            sake of the honourable, but to display his wealth, <lb/>
            imagining that by tins means he shall be admired ; <lb/>
            and where he ought to spend much, he will spend <lb/>
            little, and where he ought to spend little, much.</p>

            the magnanimous man appears to be he who, being <lb/>
            really worthy, estimates his own'worth highly; for <lb/>
            he who makes too low an estimate of it is a fool; <lb/>
            and no man who acts according to virtue can be a <lb/>
            fool, nor devoid of sense. The character before- <note type="chapter">2. </note> <lb/>
            mentioned, therefore, is magnanimous; for he whose <lb/>
            worth is low, and who estimates it lowly, is a modest <note type="margin">∑<foreign xml:lang="grc">ώφρωυ</foreign>. </note> <lb/>

            with good stature;i for little persons may be pretty, <lb/>
            and well proportioned, but cannot be beautiful. <lb/>

            cases vain. He who estimates it less highly than <note type="chapter">4. </note> <lb/>
            it deserves, is little-minded, whether his worth be <lb/>
            great or moderate, or if, when worth little, he esti­ <lb/>

            tian knows his utter unworthiness in the sight of God, and <lb/>
            therefore cannot form too low an estimate of his own worth. <lb/>
            Nevertheless that there is such a virtue as Christian magna­ <lb/>
            nimity is abundantly shown in the character of St. Paul. The <lb/>
            heathen virtue of magnanimity constituted a marked feature <lb/>
            in the character of a virtuous Athenian, and was doubtless also, <lb/>
            as Zell observes, a strong feature in the character of Aristotle <lb/>
            himself. </note><note type="footnote"> I The Greeks considered a good stature a necessary charac­ <lb/>

            The magnanimous man, therefore, in the greatness <lb/>

            estimates himself at the proper rate, while the <lb/>
            others are in the excess and defect. If, there­ <lb/>

            and which men of eminence are most desirous of, <lb/>
            and which is the prize of the most honourable acts; <lb/>

            and dishonour. And, even without arguments to <lb/>
            prove the point, it seems that the magnanimous <lb/>
            are concerned with honour, for great men esteem <lb/>
            themselves worthy of honour more than anything <lb/>
            else; for it is according to their desert. But the <lb/>

            we examine the particulars of the case, it vill ap­ <lb/>

            not be a good man; and he could not even be de­ <lb/>

            is the prize of virtue, and is bestowed upon the good.</p>
          <p>Magnanimity, then, seems to be, as it were, a kind <note type="margin">3. <lb/>

            of ornament of the virtues ; for it makes them <lb/>
            greater, and cannot exist without them. And for <lb/>
            this reason it is difficult to be really magnanimous; <lb/>
            for it is impossible, without perfect excellence and <lb/>
            goodness. The magnanimous character, therefore, <note type="margin">The mag­ <lb/>

            man con­ <lb/>

            is principally displayed on the subject of honour <lb/>
            and dishonour. And in the case of great instances <lb/>
            of honour, bestowed by the good, he will be mode­ <lb/>
            rately gratified, under the idea that he has ob­ <lb/>
            tained what is his due, or even less than he de­ <lb/>
            serves; for no honour can be equivalent to perfect <lb/>
            virtue. Not but that he will receive it, because <lb/>
            they have nothing greater to give him; but honour <lb/>
            from any other persons, and on the score of trifles, <lb/>
            he will utterly despise; for these he does not de­ <lb/>
            serve ; and likewise he will despise dishonour ; for <lb/>
            he cannot justly deserve it.</p>
          <p>The magnanimous character is, therefore, as has <note type="margin">9. <lb/>

            been said, principally concerned with honours; not <lb/>
            but that in wealth and power, and all good and bad <lb/>
            fortune, however it may come to pass, he will behave <lb/>
            with moderation; and not be too much delighted <lb/>
            at success, nor too much grieved at failure ; for he <lb/>
            will not feel thus even at honour, though it is the <lb/>
            greatest thing of all; for power and wealth are <lb/>
            eligible because of the honour they confer ; at any <lb/>
            rate, those who possess them desire to be honoured <lb/>
            on account of them. To him, therefore, by whom <lb/>

            fortune also appear to contribute to magnanimity; <lb/>
            for the nobly born are thought worthy of honour, <lb/>
            and those who possess power and wealth, for they <lb/>
            surpass others; and everything which is superior in <lb/>
            goodness is more honourable. Hence, such things <lb/>
            as these make men more magnanimous ; for by some <note type="chapter">II. </note> <lb/>
            people they are honoured. But in reality the good <lb/>
            man alone is deserving of honour; but he who has <lb/>
            both is thought more worthy of honour; but those <lb/>
            who, without virtue, possess such good things as <lb/>
            these, neither have any right to think themselves <lb/>
            worthy of great things, nor are properly called mag­ <lb/>
            nanimous ; for magnanimity cannot exist without <lb/>
            perfect virtue. But those who possess these things <lb/>
            become supercilious and insolent; for without virtue <lb/>
            it -is difficult to bear good fortune with propriety; <lb/>
            and being unable to bear it, and thinking that <lb/>
            they excel others, they despise them, while they <lb/>
            themselves do anything they please; for they imi­ <lb/>
            tate the magnanimous man, though they are not <lb/>
            like him; but this they do wherever they can. Ac­ <lb/>
            tions according to virtue they do not perform, but <lb/>
            they despise others. But the magnanimous man <lb/>
            feels contempt justly; for he forms his opinions <lb/>
            truly, but the others form theirs at random.</p>
          <p><note type="margin">12. <lb/>
            As to <lb/>
            courage. </note> The magnanimous man neither shuns nor is fond <lb/>
            of danger, because there are but few things which he <lb/>
            cares for; but to great dangers he exposes himself, <lb/>
            and when he does run any risk, he is unsparing of <lb/>
            his life, thinking that life is not worth having on <note type="margin">IS. <lb/>
            As to libe . <lb/>
            rality, </note> <lb/>
            some terms. He is disposed to bestow, but ashamed <lb/>
            to receive benefits; for the former is the part of a <lb/>
            superior, the latter of an inferior; and he is dis­ <lb/>
            posed to make a more liberal return for favours; <lb/>
            for thus the original giver will have incurred an ad­ <lb/>
            ditional obligation, and will have received a benefit. <lb/>
            He is thought also to recollect those whom he has <lb/>
            benefited, but not those from whom he has re­ <lb/>
            ceived benefits; for the receiver is inferior to the <lb/>
            giver : but the magnanimous man wishes to be <lb/>
            superior and the benefits which he confers he hears <pb n="101"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. III.]"/> <lb/>
            of with pleasure, but those which he receives with <lb/>
            pain. Thetis therefore says nothing to Jupiter about <lb/>
            the benefits she has conferred upon him, nor do the La­ <lb/>
            cedæmonians to the Athenians, but only about those <lb/>
            which they have received.- Again, it is characteristic <note type="margin">14. <lb/>
            As to ask­ <lb/>
            ing favours. </note> <lb/>
            of the magnanimous man to ask no favours, or very <lb/>
            few, of anybody, but to be willing to serve others ; <lb/>
            and towards men of rank or fortune to be haughty <lb/>
            in his demeanour, but to be moderate towards men <lb/>
            of middle rank; for to be superior to the former is <lb/>
            difficult and honourable, but to be superior to the <lb/>
            latter is easy; and among the former there is no­ <lb/>
            thing ungenerous in being haughty; but to be so <lb/>
            amongst persons of humble rank is bad taste, just <lb/>
            like making a show of strength to the weak.</p>
          <p>Another characteristic is, not to go in search of <note type="margin">15. <lb/>
            As to seek. <lb/>
            ing honour </note> <lb/>
            honour, nor where others occupy the first places; <lb/>
            and to be inactive and slow, except where some <lb/>

            be performed; and to be inclined to do but few <lb/>
            things, but those great and distinguished. He must <lb/>
            also necessarily be open in his hatreds and his friend­ <lb/>
            ships; for concealment is the part of a man who <lb/>
            is afraid. He must care more for truth than for <note type="margin">16. <lb/>

            opinion. He must speak and act openly ; for this <lb/>
            is characteristic of a man who despises others; for <lb/>
            he is bold in speech, and therefore apt to despise <note type="footnote"> m See Hom. II. i. 503; where Thetis only hints at any <lb/>

            however (Hell. VI. v. 53), relates that they made mention of <lb/>
            the good offices that they conferred upon each other. It has <lb/>

            ther overlooks them. He is not fond of talking of <lb/>
            people; for he will neither speak of himself, nor of <lb/>
            anybody else; for he does not care that he himself <lb/>
            should be praised, nor that others should be blamed. <lb/>
            He is not disposed to praise; and therefore he does <lb/>
            not find fault even with his enemies, except for the <lb/>
            sake of wanton insult. He is by no means apt to com­ <lb/>
            plain or supplicate help in unavoidable or trifling cala­ <lb/>
            mities; for to be so in such cases shows anxiety about <lb/>
            them. He is apt to possess rather what is honourable <lb/>

            this shows more self-sufficiency. The step of the <lb/>
            magnanimous man is slow, his voice deep, and his <lb/>
            language stately; for he who only feels anxiety <lb/>
            about few things is not apt to be in a hurry; and <lb/>
            he who thinks highly of nothing is not vehement; <lb/>
            and shrillness and quickness of speaking arise from <lb/>
            these things. This, therefore, is the character of <lb/>
            the magnanimous man.</p>

             <lb/>
            said before. But it is clear, that as the expression, <lb/>
            " lover of anything," is used in more senses than <lb/>
            one, we do not use the term lover of honour always <lb/>
            with the same signification ; but when we praise <lb/>
            him, we mean that he loves honour more than most <lb/>

            has no name, the extremes seem to contend for <lb/>
            the middle place, as being vacant; but wherever <lb/>
            there are an excess and defect, there is also a <lb/>
            mean. And men desire honour both too much <lb/>
            and too little, so that it is possible to desire it as <lb/>
            they ought. At any rate, this habit is praised, <lb/>
            being a nameless mean state on the subject of <lb/>
            honour. But compared with love of honour, it <lb/>
            appears to be the absence of all love for it; and <lb/>
            compared with this, it appears to be love of honour. <lb/>
            Compared with both, therefore, it in some sense has <lb/>

            name, and we can scarcely say that the extremes <lb/>
            have any, we give to the mean the name of <lb/>
            meekness, though it declines towards the defect, <lb/>
            which has no name. But the excess might be <note type="margin">Its ex­ <lb/>

            called a species of irascibility; for the passion is <lb/>
            anger, and the things that cause it are many and <lb/>
            various. He, therefore, who feels anger on proper <note type="margin">2. <lb/>

            occasions, at proper persons, and besides in a proper <lb/>
            manner, at proper times, and for a proper length of <lb/>
            time, is an object of praise. This character will <lb/>
            therefore be -the meek man, in the very points in <lb/>
            which meekness is an object of praise; for by the <lb/>
            meek man we mean him who is undisturbed, and <lb/>
            not carried away by passion, but who feels anger <lb/>
            according to the dictates of reason, on proper occa­ <lb/>
            sions, and for a proper length of time. But the <lb/>
            meek man seems to err rather on the side of defect; <lb/>
            for he is not inclined to revenge, but rather to for­ <lb/>
            give. But the defect, whether it be a kind of <note type="margin">3. <lb/>

            insensibility to anger, or whatever it be, is blamed; <lb/>

            are thought to be fools, as well as those who do <lb/>
            not feel it in the proper manner, nor at the proper <lb/>
            time, nor at the proper persons; for such an one <lb/>
            seems to have no perception, nor sense of pain; <lb/>
            and from his insensibility to anger, he is not dis­ <lb/>
            posed to defend himself; but it is like a slave to <lb/>
            endure insults offered to one's self, and to overlook <lb/>
            them when offered to one s relations. But the excess <note type="margin">4. <lb/>
            The excess. </note> <lb/>
            takes place in all the categories; for it is possible <lb/>

            occasions, too much, too quickly, or too long; yet. <lb/>
            all these circumstances are not unitedin the same <pb n="106"/>

            person; for it is impossible that they should be ; <lb/>

            much; but their anger quickly ceases, and this is <lb/>
            the best point in their character. And this is the <lb/>
            case with them, because they do not restrain <lb/>
            their anger, but retaliate openly and visibly, be­ <lb/>
            because of their impetuosity, and then they be- <note type="margin">6. <lb/>

            their rage ; but there comes a cessation, when they <lb/>
            have retaliated ; for revenge makes their anger <lb/>
            cease, because it produces pleasure instead of the <lb/>
            previous pain. But if they do not get revenge, they <lb/>
            feel a weight of disappointment: for, owing to its <lb/>
            not showing itself, no one reasons with them; and <lb/>
            there is need of time for a man to digest his anger <lb/>

            to give no pain or annoyance to those in whose <lb/>
            society they happen to be; others, contrary to <lb/>
            these, who oppose everything, and are utterly <lb/>
            careless of giving pain, are called cross and quar­ <lb/>

            </note>evident; and likewise that the mean habit be­ <lb/>

            objects, and in a proper manner. There is no <lb/>
            name assigned to this habit, but it most resembles <lb/>
            friendship ; for he who acts according to the mean <lb/>
            habit is such as we mean by the expression, "a kind <lb/>
            and gentle friend," if we add thereto the idea of <lb/>
            affection; while this habit differs from friendship, <lb/>
            in being without passion and affection for those <lb/>
            with whom one has intercourse ; for it is not from <lb/>
            being a friend or an enemy that he approves or dis­ <lb/>
            approves in every case properly, but because it is <lb/>
            his nature ; for he will do it alike in the case of <lb/>
            those whom he knows, and those whom he does not <lb/>
            know, and to those with whom he is intimate, and to <lb/>
            those with whom he is not intimate, except that he <lb/>
            will always do it properly; for it is not fit in the <lb/>
            same way to pay regard to, or to give pain, to <lb/>

            It aims at <lb/>
            giving <lb/>
            pleasure. </note> Generally, therefore, we have said, that in his <lb/>
            intercourse he will behave properly; and referring <lb/>
            his conduct to the principles of honour and ex­ <lb/>
            pediency, he will aim at not giving pain, or at <lb/>
            giving pleasure. For he seems to be concerned <lb/>
            with the pleasures and pains that arise in the inter­ <lb/>
            course of society ; and in all of these in which it is <lb/>
            dishonourable or inexpedient to give pleasure, he <lb/>
            will show disapprobation, and will deliberately prefer <lb/>
            to give pain.. Andif the action bring upon the <lb/>
            doer disgrace or harm, and that not small, and the <lb/>
            opposite course of conduct only slight pain, he will <note type="chapter">5. </note> <lb/>
            not approve, but will disapprove of it highly. But <lb/>
            his manner of intercourse will be different with <lb/>
            persons of rank, and with ordinary persons, and <lb/>
            with those who are more or less known to him; <lb/>
            and in all other cases of difference he will act in <lb/>
            like manner, awarding to each his due: and <lb/>
            abstractedly preferring to give pleasure, and <lb/>
            cautious about giving pain, but yet attending <lb/>
            always to the results, I mean to the honourable <lb/>
            and the expedient, if they be greater than the <lb/>
            pain. And for the sake of giving great pleasure <lb/>
            afterwards, he will inflict small pain. Such, then, <pb n="109"/>

            plan to go through and enumerate such habits as <lb/>
            these; for we should have a more accurate knowledge <lb/>
            of what relates to moral character, when we have gone <lb/>
            through them individually ; and we should believe <lb/>
            that the virtues are mean states, if we saw at one <lb/>
            comprehensive view that the position was true in <lb/>
            every instance. Now, in social intercourse, those <note type="chapter">2. </note> <lb/>
            persons who associate with others for the purpose <lb/>
            of giving pleasure, and those who do it for the <lb/>
            purpose of giving pain, have been treated of. But <lb/>
            let us speak of those who are true, and those who <lb/>
            are false, in their words, their actions, and their <lb/>
            pretensions.</p>

            him, and to things greater than what belong to <lb/>
            him : the falsely modest, on the other hand, is apt <lb/>
            to deny what really does belong to him, or to <lb/>
            make it out to be less than it is. But he who is <lb/>
            in the mean is, as it were, a real character, truthful <lb/>
            in his actions and his words, and ready to allow <lb/>
            that he possesses what he really possesses, without <pb n="110"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK IV."/> <lb/>
            making greater or less. But it is possible to do <lb/>
            all these things with or without a motive. But <lb/>
            every one, except he acts with a motive, speaks, <lb/>
            acts, and lives, according to his character. But <lb/>
            falsehood, abstractedly, is bad and blameable, and <lb/>
            truth honourable and praiseworthy ; and thus the <lb/>
            truthful man being in the mean, is praiseworthy ; <lb/>
            while the false are both blameable; but the arrogant <note type="margin">4. <lb/>

            θευτικου̃</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
            man more so than the other. But let us speak <lb/>
            about each separately: and first, about the truthful; <lb/>
            for we are not speaking of him who speaks truth <lb/>
            in his agreements, nor in matters that relate to <lb/>
            injustice or justice; for this would belong to another <lb/>
            virtue; but of him who in cases of no such conse­ <lb/>
            quence observes truth in his words and actions, <lb/>
            from being such in character.</p>
          <p><note type="chapter">5. </note> But such a man would appear to be a worthy <lb/>
            man ; for the lover of truth, since he observes it in <lb/>
            matters of no consequence, will observe it still more <lb/>
            in matters of consequence; inasmuch as he who is <lb/>
            cautious of falsehood for its own sake, will surely <lb/>
            be cautious of it as being disgraceful; and such a man <lb/>
            is praiseworthy. But he declines from the truth <lb/>
            rather on the side of defect; for this appears to be <lb/>
            in better taste, because excesses are hateful.</p>
          <p><note type="margin">6. <lb/>
            Arrogant. </note> But he who makes pretensions to greater things <lb/>
            than really belong to him, without any motive, re­ <lb/>
            sembles a base man, for otherwise he would not have <lb/>
            taken pleasure in the falsehood; but still he appears <lb/>
            foolish rather than bad. But if it be with a motive, <lb/>
            he who does it for the sake of glory or honour is <lb/>
            not very blameable, as the arrogant man; but he <lb/>
            who does it for the sake of money is more dishonour- <note type="chapter"> 7 </note> <lb/>
            able. But the character of the arrogant man does <lb/>
            not consist in the power of being so, but in the de­ <lb/>
            liberate preference to be so; for he is arrogant, just <lb/>
            as the liar, from the habit, and from his being of <lb/>
            this character. Those, therefore, who are arrogant <lb/>
            for the sake of honour, pretend to such things <lb/>
            as are followed by praise or congratulation ; those <lb/>
            who are so for the sake of gain pretend to such <pb n="111"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP !VII.]"/> <lb/>
            things as their neighbours reap the advantage of, <lb/>
            and of which the absence in themselves may escape <lb/>
            notice, as that they are skilful u physicians or sooth­ <lb/>
            sayers ; wherefore most men pretend to such things <lb/>
            as these, and are thus arrogant; for they possess <lb/>
            the qualities which we have mentioned.</p>
          <p>But the falsely modest, who speak of themselves <note type="margin">8. <lb/>
            Falsely <lb/>
            modest. </note> <lb/>
            on the side of defect, seem more refined in character; <lb/>
            for they are not thought to speak for the sake of <lb/>
            gain, but to avoid that which is troublesome to <lb/>
            others. These, too, more than other men, deny that <lb/>
            they possess honourable qualities ; as Socrates also <lb/>
            did. But those who pretend to things of small im­ <lb/>
            portance, and which they evidently do not possess, <lb/>
            are called cunning and consequential, and are very <lb/>
            contemptible. And false modesty appears some- <note type="margin">9. <lb/>

            where the truth is not too obvious and plain, appear <lb/>
            polished. But the arrogant seems to be opposed to <lb/>
            the truthful character, for it is the worse of the two <lb/>
            extremes.v <note type="footnote"> u If <foreign xml:lang="grc">σοφὸν</foreign> is here a substantive, it must be an attack upon <lb/>

            one great difference between the Sophists and the philoso­ <lb/>
            phers, who were, like Plato and Aristotle, opposed to them, <lb/>
            was that they taught for gain. This their opponents thought <lb/>
            unworthy of the dignity of a philosopher. The teaching of <lb/>
            Socrates professed to be, as Aristotle asserts below, directly <lb/>
            opposed to anything like pretension, hence the <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰρωνεία</foreign>, <lb/>
            which was one characteristic of it. On this subject Michelet <lb/>

            for we think it right that young persons should be <lb/>

            to passion they commit many faults, and are re­ <lb/>
            strained by a sense of shame. And we praise those <lb/>
            young persons who are apt to feel shame; but no <lb/>
            man would praise an older person for being shame­ <lb/>
            faced ; for we think it wrong that he should do <lb/>
            anything to be ashamed of; for shame is no part <lb/>

            it be true that it follows unworthy actions; for <lb/>
            such things he ought not to do. But whether the <lb/>

            it makes no difference; for neither ought to be <lb/>

          <p>L BUT we must inquire into the subject of justice and <lb/>
            injustice, and see what kind of actions they are con­ <lb/>
            cerned with, what kind of mean state justice is, and <note type="footnote"> * This book is almost identically the same with the fourth <lb/>
            book of the Eudemean Ethics. A passage in Plato's treatise <lb/>
            De Legibus, p. 757, quoted by Brewer, p. 167, shows how <lb/>
            far the views of the great master and his distinguished pupil <lb/>
            coincided on this subject of particular justice. As far as <lb/>
            regarded universal justice, the theory of Plato was as fol­ <lb/>
            lows:— He considered the soul a republic (De Rep. iv.), <lb/>
            composed of three faculties or orders. (1.) Reason, the go­ <lb/>
            verning principle. (2.) The irascible passions. (3.) The <lb/>
            concupiscible passions. When each of these three faculties of <lb/>
            the mind confined itself to its proper office, without attempt­ <lb/>
            ing to encroach upon that of any other ; when reason go­ <lb/>
            verned, and the passions obeyed, then the result was that <lb/>
            complete virtue, which Plato denominated justice. Under <lb/>
            the idea of universal justice will be comprehended the " jus­ <lb/>
            titia expletrix," and " justitia attributrix," of Grotius; the <lb/>
            former of which consists in abstaining from what is another's, <lb/>
            and in doing voluntarily whatever we can with propriety be <lb/>
            forced to do ; the latter, which consists in proper beneficence, <lb/>
            and which comprehends all the social virtues. This latter <lb/>
            kind has been by some termed " distributive justice," but in <lb/>
            a different sense from that in which the expression is used by <lb/>
            Aristotle. — (A. Smith, Mor. Sent. Part VII. 2.) With <lb/>
            respect to particular justice, distributive justice takes cogni­ <lb/>
            zance of the acts of men, considered in relation to the state, <lb/>
            and comprehends what we call criminal cases. Corrective <lb/>
            justice considers men in relation to each other, and compre­ <lb/>
            hends civil cases. Aristotle has also treated the subject of <lb/>
            justice and injustice, though in a less scientific manner, in <lb/>
            his Rhetoric, Book I. cc. xii. xiii. xiv., to the translation of <lb/>
            which, in this series, together with the accompanying notes­ <lb/>

            investigation be conducted after the same method as <lb/>
            in the case of the virtues, already discussed. We see, <note type="margin">2. <lb/>

            then, that all men mean by the term justice- that. <lb/>

            injustice, that habit from which they act unjustly, <lb/>
            and wish for unjust things. Let these things, <lb/>
            therefore, be first laid down as itwere in outline; <lb/>

            one contrary habit does not infer the other con­ <lb/>

            the habit of health, the contrary acts are performed, <lb/>
            but only the healthy ones ; for we say, that a man <lb/>
            walks healthily when he .walks as a healthy man <lb/>
            would walk. Hence a contrary habit is often <lb/>
            known from its contrary; and the habits are often <lb/>
            known from the -things. connected with and attend- <note type="margin">4. <lb/>
            A habit <lb/>
            may be <lb/>

            from its <lb/>
            contrary. </note> <lb/>
            ant upon them; for if the good habit of body be <lb/>
            well known, the bad habit becomes known also; and. <lb/>
            the good habit is known from the things which be­ <lb/>
            long to it, and these, things from the good habit ; <lb/>
            for if the good habit of body be firmness of flesh, it <lb/>

            looseness of flesh; and that which is likely to cause <lb/>
            the good habit of body is that which is likely to <lb/>

          <p>But it, generally speaking, follows, that .if the one <lb/>
            of two contraries be used in more senses than one, <lb/>
            the other contrary is likewise used in more senses <lb/>

            it is clear that the just man also will mean the man <lb/>

            The just will therefore be the lawful and the equal ; <lb/>

            there is ; for he who energizes according to the other <lb/>

            but still from some vice (for we blame him) ; <lb/>
            namely from injustice. There is, therefore, some <note type="margin">2. <lb/>
            It differs <lb/>
            from uni­ <lb/>

            be intemperate rather than taking more than his <lb/>
            share; and the former unjust, but not intemperate: <lb/>
            it is clear, at any rate, that he committed the crime <lb/>
            for the sake of gain; Again, in all other acts of <note type="chapter">3. </note> <lb/>
            injustice it is possible always to refer the action to <lb/>
            some specific vice : for instance, if a person has <lb/>
            committed adultery; you may refer it to intempe­ <lb/>
            ranee ; if he has deserted his comrade's side in the <lb/>
            ranks, to cowardice; if he has committed an assault, <lb/>
            to anger ; but if he has gained anything by the <lb/>
            act, you can refer it to no vice but injustice. So <note type="chapter">4. </note> <lb/>
            that it is evident that there is another kind of in­ <lb/>
            justice besides universal injustice, which is a part of <lb/>
            it, and is called by the same name, because the <lb/>
            generic definition of both is the same; for the whole <lb/>
            force of both consists in relation; but one is conver- <note type="margin">Particular <lb/>

            motive is the pleasure arising from gain ; whilst the <note type="margin">Universal <lb/>
            justice. </note> <lb/>
            other is conversant with all things with which a <lb/>

            there are more kinds of justice than one, and that <lb/>
            there is another kind besides that which is universal <lb/>
            virtue : but we must ascertain its generic and spe­ <lb/>
            cific character.</p>
          <p>Now, the "unjust" has been divided into the un­ <note type="chapter">5.</note><lb/>
             <unclear/><lb/>
            lawful and the unequal; and the just" into the <lb/>
            lawful and the equal. Now, the injustice before <lb/>
            mentioned is according to the unlawful. But since <lb/>
            the unequal and the more are not the same, but <pb n="122"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK V."/> <lb/>
            different. that is, that one bears to the other the <lb/>
            relation of a part to a whole,g for everything which is <lb/>
            more is unequal, but it is not true that everything <lb/>
            which is unequal is more ; and in the same way the <lb/>
            unjust and injustice arc not the same, but different <lb/>
            in the two cases; in the one case being as parts, in the <lb/>
            other as wholes ; for this injustice of which we are <lb/>
            now treating is a part of universal injustice ; and <lb/>
            in like manner particular justice is a part of uni­ <lb/>
            versal justice; so that we must speak of the parti­ <lb/>
            cular justice and the particular injustice; and in <lb/>
            like manner of the particular just, and the parti- <note type="margin">6. <lb/>
            Universal <lb/>
            justice dis­ <lb/>
            missed. </note> <lb/>
            cular unjust. Let us, then, dismiss that justice and <lb/>
            injustice which is conversant with universal virtue, <lb/>
            the one being the exercise of universal virtue with <lb/>
            relation to another, and the other of universal vice ; <lb/>
            and it is clear that we must dismiss also the just and <lb/>
            unjust which are involved in these ; for one may <lb/>
            almost say that the greater part of things lawful <lb/>
            are those the doing of which arises from universal <lb/>
            virtue ; for the law enjoins that we live according <lb/>
            to each particular virtue, and forbids our living ac­ <lb/>
            cording to each particular vice; and all those law­ <lb/>
            fill things which are enjoined by law in the matter <lb/>
            of social education are the causes which produce <note type="chapter"> 7. </note> <lb/>
            universal virtue. But as to private education, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to which a man is good absolutely, we must <lb/>
            hereafter determine whether it belongs to the poli­ <lb/>
            tical or any other science ; for it is not perhaps en- <note type="margin">8. <lb/>

            justice di­ <lb/>

            tirely the same thing in every case to be a good <lb/>
            man and a good citizen. But of the particular jus­ <lb/>
            tice, and of the particular just which is according <lb/>
            to it, one species is that which is concerned in the <note type="footnote"> ' The generic word “ unequal" comprehends under it the <lb/>
            specific ones “more” and “less,” and therefore is to them <lb/>
            as a whole to its parts. Hence it is to be observed that the <lb/>
            words “whole” and “part” are used in their logical rela­ <lb/>
            tion : for, logically, the genus contains the species; whereas, <lb/>
            metaphysically, the species contains the genus : e. g. we divide <lb/>
            logically the genus “ man" into European, Asiatic," &amp;c., <lb/>
            but each of the species, European, &amp;c., contains the idea of <lb/>
            man, together with the characteristic difference. </note> <pb n="123"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. III.]"/> <lb/>
            distributions of honour, or of wealth, or of any of <lb/>
            those other things which can possibly be distributed <lb/>
            among the members of a political community ; for <lb/>
            in these cases it is possible that one person, as com­ <lb/>
            pared with another, should have an unequal or an <note type="margin">9. <lb/>
            Corre( tive. </note> <lb/>
            equal share ; the other is that which is corrective <lb/>
            in transactionsh between man and man. And of <lb/>
            this there are two divisions : for some transactions <lb/>
            are voluntary, and others involuntary : the vo- <note type="margin">Transac­ <lb/>
            tions are <lb/>
            twofold. <lb/>
            Voluntary. <lb/>
            Involun­ <lb/>

            luntary are such as follow; selling, buying, lending, <lb/>
            pledging transactions, borrowing,i depositing of trusts, <lb/>
            hiring; and they are so called because the origin of <lb/>
            such transactions is voluntary. Of involuntary trans­ <lb/>
            actions, some are secret, as theft, adultery, poison­ <lb/>
            ing, pandering, enticing away of slaves, assassination, <lb/>
            false witness ; others accompanied with violence, as <lb/>
            assault, imprisonment, death, robbery, mutilation, <lb/>
            evil-speaking, contumelious language.</p>

            A just act <lb/>
            is a mean in <lb/>
            two things, <lb/>
            and with <lb/>
            reference <lb/>
            to two <lb/>
            persons. </note> <lb/>
            is unequal, it is clear that there is some mean of the <lb/>
            unequal; and this is the equal; for in every action <lb/>
            in which there is the more and the less, there <lb/>
            is the equal also. If, therefore, the unjust be un­ <lb/>
            equal, the just is equal; but this, without argument, <note type="footnote"> b The word <foreign xml:lang="grc">συναλλάγματα</foreign>, here rendered "transactions," <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK V."/> <lb/>
            must be clear to everybody. But since the equal is. <lb/>
            a mean, the. just must also be a kind of mean.. But, <lb/>
            the equal implies two terms at least ; the just, there­ <lb/>
            fore, must be both a mean and, equal, it must relate <lb/>
            to some things and some persons. In that it is a <lb/>
            mean, it must relate to two things, and these arc <lb/>
            the more and the less; in that it is equal, to two <lb/>
            things, and in that it is just to certain persons. <note type="margin">2., <lb/>
            There will <lb/>
            be four <lb/>
            terms; <lb/>
            two per­ <lb/>
            sons and <lb/>
            two things. </note> <lb/>
            It follows, therefore, that the just must imply four <lb/>
            terms at least; for the persons to whom the just <lb/>
            relates are two, and the things that are the subjects <lb/>
            of. the actions are two. rAnd there will be the <lb/>
            same equality between the persons and between the <lb/>
            things; for as the things are to one another so <lb/>
            are the persons, for if the persons are unequal, they <lb/>
            will not have equal things.</p>
          <p><note type="chapter">3. </note> But hence arise all disputes and quarrels, - when <lb/>
            equal persons have unequal things, or unequal, per­ <lb/>
            sons have and have assigned to them equal things. <lb/>
            Again, this is clear from the expression "according <lb/>
            to worth for, in distributions, all agree that justice <lb/>
            ought to be according to some standard of worth, yet <lb/>
            all do not make that standard the same; for those <lb/>
            who are inclined to democracy consider liberty as <lb/>
            the standard ; those who are inclined to oligarchy, <lb/>
            wealth; others, nobility of birth ; and those who are <note type="chapter">4. </note> <lb/>
            inclined to aristocracy, virtue.k Justice, therefore, is <lb/>
            something proportionate ; for proportion is the pro­ <lb/>
            perty not of arithmetical numbers only, but of num­ <lb/>
            ber universally; for proportion is an equality of ratio, <lb/>
            and implies four terms at least. Now it is clear, <lb/>
            that disjunctive proportion implies four terms; but <lb/>
            continuous proportion is in four terms also; for it <lb/>
            will use one term in place of two, and mention it <lb/>
            twice ; for instance, as A to B, so is B to C; B has <lb/>
            therefore been mentioned twice. So that if B be <lb/>
            put down twice, the terms of the proportion are four. <note type="chapter">5. </note> <lb/>
            Moreover, the just also implies four terms at least, <lb/>
            and the ratio is the same, for the. persons and the <lb/>
            thin gs are similarly divided. Therefore, as the term <note type="footnote"> k Compare Arist. Rhet. Book I. c. viii, </note> <pb n="125"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. IV.]"/> <lb/>
            A to the term B, so will be the term C to the term D; <lb/>
            and therefore, alternately, as A to C so B to D. So <lb/>
            that the whole also bears the same proportion to the <lb/>
            whole which the distribution puts together in pairs; <lb/>
            and if it puts them together in this way, it puts <lb/>
            them together justly.1 The conjunction, therefore, <lb/>
            of A and C and of B and D is the just in the dis­ <lb/>
            tribution ; and this just is a mean, that is, a mean <lb/>
            between those things which are contrary to propor­ <lb/>
            tion : for the proportionate is a mean, and the just <lb/>
            is proportionate. But mathematicians call this kind <note type="chapter">6. </note> <lb/>
            of proportion geometrical, for in geometrical propor­ <lb/>
            tionit comes to pass that the whole hasthe same ratio <lb/>
            to the whole which each of the parts has to the other; <lb/>
            but this proportion is not continuous, for the person <note type="margin">The pro­ <lb/>
            portions <lb/>
            not con­ <lb/>
            tinuous. </note> <lb/>
            and the thing are not one term numerically. But the <lb/>
            unjust is that which is contrary to proportion; there <lb/>
            is one kind, therefore, on the side of excess, and one <lb/>
            on the side of defect; and this is the case in acts, <lb/>
            for he who acts unjustly has too much, and the man <lb/>
            who is treated unjustly too little good. But in the <note type="chapter"> 7. </note> <lb/>
            case of evil, the same thing happens inversely, for <lb/>
            the less evil compared with the greater becomes a <lb/>
            good; for the less evil is more eligible than the <lb/>
            greater, and the eligible is good, and the more <lb/>
            eligible a greater good. This, therefore, is one <lb/>
            species of the just.</p>

              other; and the unjust which is opposed to this just is <lb/>
              contrary to the proportionate. But the just which <lb/>
              exists in transactions is something equal, and the <lb/>
              unjust something unequal, but not according to <lb/>
              geometrical but arithmetical proportion; for it mat­ <lb/>
              ters not whether a good man has robbed a bad man, <note type="chapter">2. </note> <lb/>
              or a bad man a good man, nor whether a good or a <lb/>
              bad man has committed adultery; the law looks to <lb/>
              the difference of the hurt alone, and treats the per­ <lb/>
              sons, if one commits and the other suffers injury, as <lb/>
              equal, and also if one has done and the other suf- <note type="chapter">3. </note> <lb/>
              fered hurt. So that the judge endeavours to make <lb/>
              this unjust, which is unequal, equal; for when one <lb/>
              man is struck and the other strikes, or even when <lb/>
              one kills • and the other dies, the suffering and the <lb/>
              doing are divided into unequal parts ; but then he <lb/>
              endeavours by means of punishment to equalize <lb/>
              them, by taking somewhat away from the gain. For <lb/>
              the term " gain" is used (to speak once for all) in <lb/>
              such cases, although in some it may not be the exact <lb/>
              word, as in the case of the man who strikes a blow, <lb/>
              and the term " loss" in the case of the man who <lb/>
              suffers it; but when the suffering is measured, the <lb/>
              expressions gain and loss are used.</p>
          <p><note type="chapter">4. </note> So that the equal is the mean between the more <lb/>
            and the less. But gain and loss are one more, and <lb/>
            the other less, in contrary ways ; that is, the more <lb/>
            of good and the less of evil is a gain, and the <note type="margin">Correc­ <lb/>

            contrary is a loss. Between which the mean is <lb/>
            the equal, which we call the just. So that the <lb/>

            the judge is going to the just; for the meaning <lb/>
            of the word judge is a living personification of the <lb/>
            just; and they seek a judge as a mean ; some call <lb/>
            them mediators, under the idea that if they hit <pb n="127"/>

            the mean, they will hit the just; the just, therefore, <lb/>
            is a kind of mean, because the judge is.</p>
          <p>But the judge equalizes, and, just as if a line <note type="margin">G. <lb/>

            away from the greater part that quantity by which <lb/>
            it exceeds the real half, and adds it to the lesser <lb/>
            part; but when the whole is divided into two <lb/>
            equal parts, then they say that the parties have <lb/>
            their own when they have got an equal share. <lb/>
            But the equal is the mean between greater and <note type="chapter">7. </note> <lb/>
            less, according to arithmetical proportion. For <lb/>
            this reason also it is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκαιον</foreign>, because it is <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίχα</foreign> (in two parts, just as if a person should call <note type="margin">Etymology <lb/>

            when two things are equal, and from the one <lb/>
            something is taken away and added to the other, <lb/>
            this other exceeds by twice this quantity ; for if it <lb/>
            had been taken away from the one, and not added <lb/>
            to the other, it would have exceeded by once this <lb/>
            quantity only; it would therefore have exceeded the <lb/>
            mean by once this quantity, and the mean would <lb/>
            have exceeded that part from which it was taken <lb/>
            by once this quantity. By this means, therefore, <note type="chapter">8. </note> <lb/>
            we shall know both what it is right to take away <lb/>
            from him who has too much, and what to add <lb/>
            to him who has too little. For the quantity by <lb/>
            which the mean exceeds the loss must be added to <lb/>
            him who has the loss, and the quantity by which <lb/>
            the mean is exceeded by the greater must be taken <lb/>
            away from the greatest.</p>

            defined justice as retaliation to another. But reta­ <lb/>
            liation does not fit in either with the idea of distri­ <lb/>
            butive or corrective justice ; and yet they would <lb/>
            have that this is the meaning of the Rhadamanthian <lb/>
            rule, " If a man suffers what he has done, straight- <lb/>
            forward justice would take place:" for in many <lb/>
            points it is at variance; as for example, if a man <lb/>
            in authority has struck another, it is not right that <lb/>
            he should be struck in return; and if a man has <lb/>
            struck a person in authority, it is right that he <lb/>
            should not only be struck, but punished besides. <note type="footnote"> a The law of retaliation, " lex talionis," or commutative <lb/>
            . justice, differs in the following respect from distributive and <lb/>
            corrective justice. As we have seen, distributive justice pro­ <lb/>
            ceeds on the principle of geometrical proportions-corrective <lb/>
            justice on that of arithmetical; commutative justice, on both. <lb/>
            For instance, we first compare the commodities and the per­ <lb/>
            sons geometrically; as the builder is to the shoemaker, so is <lb/>
            the number of shoes to the house. Next we give the shoe­ <lb/>
            maker a house, which renders the parties unequal. We then <lb/>
            restore the equality arithmetically, by taking away from the <lb/>
            shoemaker the equivalent to the house reckone 1 in shoes, and <lb/>
            restoring it to the builder. </note> <pb n="129"/>

            liation, if it be according to proportion and not <lb/>

              therefore, must be equalized; and this is true in <lb/>

              and generally between persons who are different, <lb/>
              and unequal; but it is necessary that these be made <lb/>
              equal. Therefore it is necessary that all things, of <lb/>
              which there is interchange, should be in some <note type="chapter">5. </note> <lb/>
              manner commensurable. And for this purpose <lb/>
              money came into use; and it is in some sense a <lb/>
              medium, for it measures everything; so that it <lb/>
              measures excess and defect; for example, it measures <lb/>

              some manner equal. It is therefore necessary that <lb/>

            tion has taken place. As, therefore, the agriculturist <lb/>
            to the shoemaker, so is the work of the shoemaker <lb/>
            to that of the agriculturist. But when they make <lb/>

            form of a proportion, for otherwise one extreme will <lb/>
            have both excesses of the mean. But when they <lb/>
            have their own rights they are equal, and able to deal <lb/>
            with one another, because this equality is able to <lb/>
            take place between them. Let the agriculturist be A, <note type="chapter">9. </note> <lb/>
            the food C, the shoemaker B, and his work made <lb/>
            equal to the agriculturist's work D. But if it had <lb/>
            been impossible for them to have made this mutual <lb/>

            as it were one thing, is the bond which, in <lb/>
            such circumstances, holds men together, is proved <lb/>
            by the fact that when two men have no need of one <lb/>
            another (nor one has need of the other) they do not <lb/>
            have commercial dealings together : as they do when <lb/>
            one is in need of what another has (wine, for in­ <lb/>
            stance), giving in return corn for exportation. They <lb/>
            must, therefore, be made equal.</p>
          <p>But with a view to future exchange, if we have <note type="margin">10. <lb/>
            Money a <lb/>
            pledge that <lb/>
            we may <lb/>
            make the <lb/>
            exchange <lb/>
            when we <lb/>
            want it. </note> <lb/>
            at present no need of it, money is, as it were, our <lb/>
            surety, that when we are in need we shall be able <lb/>
            to make it; for it is necessary that a man who <lb/>
            brings money should be able to get what he requires. <lb/>
            But even money is liable to the same objection as <lb/>
            other commodities, for it is not always of equal <lb/>
            value ; but, nevertheless, it is more likely to re­ <lb/>
            main firm. Therefore all things ought to have a <lb/>
            measure of value; for thus there will always be <lb/>
            exchange, and if there is this, there will be com­ <lb/>
            merce. Money, therefore, as a measure, by making <lb/>
            things commensurable, equalizes them; for there <lb/>
            could be no commerce without exchange, no ex­ <lb/>
            change without equality, and no equality without <lb/>
            the possibility of being commensurate. Now, in <note type="chapter">11. </note> <lb/>
            reality, it is impossible that things so widely dif­ <lb/>
            ferent should become commensurable, but it is suSS- <note type="footnote"> K 2 </note> <pb n="132"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK V."/> <lb/>
            ciently possible as far as demand requires. It is <lb/>
            necessary, therefore, that there be some one thing; <lb/>
            and this must be decided by agreement. Where­ <lb/>
            fore it is called money (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμισμα</foreign>) ; for this makes <lb/>
            all things commensurable, for all things are mea- <note type="margin">12. <lb/>

            sured by money. Let a house be A, ten minæ B,q <lb/>
            a bed C. Now, A is half B (supposing a house <lb/>
            to be worth or equal to five minæ), and the bed <lb/>
            C a tenth part of B, it is clear, therefore, how <lb/>
            many beds are equal to a house, namely, five. But <lb/>
            it is clear that this was the method of exchange <lb/>
            before the introduction of money ; for it makes no <lb/>
            difference whether five beds, or the price of five <note type="chapter">13. </note> <lb/>
            beds, be given for a house. Now we have said <lb/>
            what the just and what the. unjust are. But this <lb/>
            being decided, it is clear that just acting is a mean <lb/>
            between acting and suffering injustice ; for one is <note type="margin">J ustice and <lb/>
            the other <lb/>
            virtues <lb/>
            differ, in <lb/>
            that <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκαιν</foreign> <lb/>
            is itself a <lb/>
            mean. </note> <lb/>
            having too much, and the other too little. But <lb/>
            justice is a mean state, but not in the same manner <lb/>
            as the before-mentioned virtues, but because it is of <lb/>
            a mean, and injustice of the extremes.r And jus­ <lb/>
            tice is that habit, according to which the just man <lb/>
            is said to be disposed to practise the just in accord­ <lb/>
            ance with deliberate preference, and to distribute <lb/>
            justly, between himself and another, and between <lb/>
            two other persons; not so as to take more of the <lb/>
            good himself, and give less of it to the other, and <lb/>
            inversely in the case of evil; but to take an equal <lb/>
            share according to proportion; and in like manner <note type="margin">14. <lb/>
            Injustice <lb/>
            defined. </note> <lb/>
            between two other persons. But injustice, on the <lb/>
            contrary, is all this with respect to the unjust; and <lb/>
            this is the excess and defect of what is useful and <lb/>
            hurtful, contrary to the proportionate. Wherefore <lb/>
            injustice is both excess and defect, because it is pro­ <lb/>
            ductive of excess and defect; that is, in a man's <note type="footnote"> q On the subject of Greek money, see the articles and <lb/>

            she is, and yet not at all from deliberate preference, <lb/>
            but from passion. He therefore commits an unjust <note type="chapter">2. </note> <lb/>
            act, but is not unjust; just as he is not a thief, but <lb/>

            other cases. Now, the relation which retaliation <note type="chapter">3. </note> <lb/>
            bears to justice has been already stated. But it <lb/>
            ought not to escape our notice, that the abstract <lb/>
            and political just is the just of which we are in <lb/>

            who are not in this condition have not the political <lb/>
            just in relation to one another, but only a kind of <lb/>
            just, so called from its resemblance. For the term <lb/>
            just implies the case of those who have laws to <lb/>
            which they are subject: and law implies cases of <lb/>
            injustice; for the administration of law is the de­ <lb/>
            cision of the just and the unjust. Now, injustice <lb/>
            always implies an unjust act, but an unjust act does <lb/>
            not always imply injustice. Now, to act unjustly <lb/>
            means to give to one's self too great a share of abso­ <lb/>
            lute goods, and too small a share of absolute evils.</p>

            We do not <lb/>

            govern us. </note> This is the reason why we do not suffer a man <lb/>
            to rule, but reason; because a man rules for him­ <lb/>
            self, and becomes a tyrant. But a ruler is the <lb/>
            guardian of the just; ;ss and if of the just, of equality <lb/>
            also. But since a man seems to get no advantage <lb/>
            himself if he is just (for he does not award too <lb/>
            much absolute good to himself, except it be propor­ <lb/>
            tionately his due), for this reason he acts for others; <lb/>
            and hence they say, as was before also observed, <note type="chapter">6. </note> <lb/>
            that justice is another man s good. Some compen­ <lb/>

            and prerogative : but all those who are not content <lb/>
            with theirs become tyrants. But the just in the <lb/>
            case of master and slave, and father and child, is not <lb/>
            the same as these, but similar to them; for there is <lb/>
            not injustice, abstractedly, towards one's own; a <lb/>
            possession and a child, as long as he be of a certain <lb/>
            age, and be not separated from his father, being as <lb/>
            it were a part of him; and no man deliberately <lb/>
            chooses to hurt himself ; and therefore there is no <lb/>
            injustice towards one's self; therefore there is <lb/>
            neither the political just nor unjust; for political <lb/>
            justice was stated to be according to law, and in the <lb/>
            case of those between whom laws naturally exist; <lb/>
            and these were said to be persons to whom there <lb/>
            belongs equality of governing and being governed. <note type="footnote"> <unclear/> For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the <lb/>

            Natural. <lb/>
            Legal. </note> <lb/>
            the other legal. The natural is that which every­ <lb/>
            where is equally valid, and depends not upon being <lb/>
            or not being received. But the legal is that which <lb/>
            originally was a matter of indifference, but which, <lb/>
            when enacted, is so no longer ; as the price of <lb/>
            ransom v being fixed at a mina, or the sacrificing a <lb/>
            goat, and not two sheep ;w and further, all parti­ <lb/>
            cular acts of legislation ; as the sacrificing to Bra­ <lb/>
            sidas,x and all those matters which are the subjects <lb/>
            of decrees.? But to some persons all just things <note type="chapter">2, </note> <note type="footnote">* It is frequently Aristotle's practice to examine different <lb/>
            existing theories, and to show how far his own coincides with <lb/>
            them. Hence, as justice was divided into political and econo­ <lb/>
            mic, his object is to show that the justice which he has <lb/>
            treated of comes under the division of political justice. It <lb/>
            cannot belong to the economic, as it assumes the existence of <lb/>
            two persons; whereas a man's wife or children, or servants, <lb/>
            are considered as parts of himself. </note><note type="footnote"> u See the Rhetoric, Book I. xiii., in which he quotes Anti­ <lb/>
            gone's defence of her determination to bury Polynices, as an <lb/>
            example of natural justice. Legal justice is that which is <lb/>
            established by the law of the land, or arbitrarily and conven­ <lb/>
            tionally ; e. g. killing a man is naturally unjust,-killing a <lb/>
            hare, conventionally or legally. </note><note type="footnote"> v The price of redemption was different at different periods. <lb/>

            appear to be matters of law, because that which is <lb/>

            everywhere, just as fire burns both here and in <lb/>
            Persia ;z but they see that just things are subject to <lb/>
            change. This is not really the case, but only in some <lb/>
            sense; and yet with the gods perhaps it is by no <lb/>
            means so; but with us there is something which ex­ <lb/>

            does not <lb/>

            with us is subject to change, yet nevertheless there <lb/>
            is that which is by nature and that which is not.aa <lb/>
            Of things contingent, what is natural, and what is <lb/>
            not natural, but legal, and settled by agreement <lb/>
            (even granting that both are alike subject to change), <lb/>
            is evident; and the same distinction will apply to <lb/>
            all other cases; for, naturally, the right hand is <lb/>
            stronger than the left; and yet it is possible for <note type="chapter">4. </note> <lb/>
            some people to use both equally. But that justice <lb/>
            which depends upon agreement and expediency, <lb/>
            resembles the case of measures; for measures of <lb/>
            wine and corn are not everywhere equal; but where <lb/>
            men buy they are larger, and where they sell again <lb/>
            smaller.bb And in like manner, that justice which <note type="footnote"> for a temporary purpose, whereas a law (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμος</foreign>) is perpetual.- <lb/>

            But the same thing, as soon as it is done, becomes <lb/>
            an unjust act; but before it was done it was not yet <lb/>
            an unjust act, but unjust; and the same may be <lb/>
            said of a just act. The common term for a just <lb/>
            act is more correctly <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικαιοάγημα</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικαίωμα</foreign> is <lb/>
            the correction of an unjust act. But of each of <lb/>

            with what subjects they are conversant, must be <lb/>

          <p>Now, since the abstract just and unjust are what <lb/>

            neither acts unjustly nor justly, except accidentally; <lb/>
            for he does acts which accidentally happen to be <lb/>
            just or unjust. But an unjust act and a just act <note type="chapter"><unclear>2</unclear>. </note> <lb/>

            which is not yet an unjust act, except the condi­ <lb/>

            voluntary, as also has been said before, which (being <lb/>
            in his own power) a man does knowingly, and <lb/>
            not from ignorance of the person, the instrument, <lb/>
            or the motive ; as of the person he strikes, the <lb/>

            of those particulars, not accidentally, nor by com­ <lb/>

            hand, and strike a third person ; in this case he did <lb/>
            it not voluntarily, for the act was not in his own <note type="margin">4. <lb/>
            Also by the <lb/>

            the company, and yet not know him to be his own <lb/>

            Accident. </note> But the being done accidentally may occur in the <lb/>
            case of the unjust as well as of the just; for a man <lb/>
            might return a deposit involuntarily, and through <lb/>
            fear, and yet we must not say that he does a just <lb/>
            act, or acts justly, except accidentally. And in <lb/>
            like manner we must say that that man accidentally <lb/>
            does an unjust act, and acts unjustly, who upon com­ <lb/>
            pulsion, and against his own will, refuses to return a <note type="chapter">7. </note> <lb/>
            deposit. But of voluntary Acts, some we do from <lb/>
            deliberate preference, and others not. We do those <lb/>
            from deliberate preference which we do after pre­ <lb/>

            done in ignorance are mistakes, i. e. whenever a <lb/>
            man does the mischief to a different person, in a <lb/>
            different manner, with a different instrument, or <lb/>
            from a different motive from what he intended; for <lb/>
            perhaps he did not intend to strike, or not with <lb/>
            this instrument, or not this person, or not for this <lb/>
            purpose, but something different to his purpose <lb/>
            happened; as, for example, he did not intend to <lb/>
            wound, but merely to prick; or he did not mean <lb/>
            to wound this person, or not in this manner.</p>

            knowingly, but without previous deliberation, it is ' <lb/>

            through anger, and the other passions, which are <lb/>
            necessary or natural; for by such hurts and such <lb/>
            mistakes they act unjustly, and the actions are un­ <lb/>
            just ; still the doers are not yet on this account <lb/>
            unjust or wicked; for the hurt did not arise from <lb/>
            depravity. But when any one acts from deliberate <note type="margin">11. <lb/>

            or unjust. <lb/>
            12. </note> <lb/>
            preference, he is then unjust and wicked. Hence, <lb/>
            very properly, acts done through anger are de­ <lb/>
            cided not to proceed from premeditation; for he <lb/>
            who acts through anger is not the originator, but <lb/>
            he who angered him. Again, even the question is <lb/>
            not one of fact, but of justice ; for anger is felt at <lb/>
            apparent injustice.dd For there is no dispute, as in <lb/>
            the case of contracts, respecting the fact (in which <lb/>

          <p>And the same question arises in the case of being <note type="chapter">2. </note> <lb/>
            justly dealt with; for all just acting is voluntary, <lb/>
            so that it is reasonable to suppose that the receiving <lb/>
            of unjust or just treatment should be similarly op­ <lb/>
            posed with respect to the question of voluntariness <lb/>

            the following question might be raised, whether he <lb/>

            whether the case is not the same in suffering as in <lb/>

            is the same in unjust actions; for doing unjust <lb/>
            actions is not synonymous with being unjust, and <lb/>
            suffering unjust actions is therefore not the same <lb/>
            with being injured; and in the case of acting justly <lb/>
            and being justly dealt by, the case is similar, for it <lb/>
            is impossible to be unjustly dealt by when nobody <lb/>
            acts unjustly, or to be justly dealt by when nobody <lb/>

          <p>Moreover, it is clear that the distributor, and not <note type="margin">11. <lb/>

            he who gets too much, acts unjustly; for he does not <lb/>
            act unjustly to whom the abstract unjust attaches, <lb/>
            but he to whom attaches the acting voluntarily; and <lb/>
            the voluntariness attaches to him in whom is the <lb/>
            origin of the act, which in this case is in the dis­ <lb/>
            tributor, and not in the receiver. Again, since the <note type="chapter">12. </note> <lb/>
            expression “ to do a thing" is used in many senses, <lb/>
            and in one sense inanimate things, and the hand, <lb/>
            and a slave at his master's bidding, may kill; the <lb/>
            doer in these cases does not act unjustly, but does <lb/>
            unjust things. Again, if a man decided through <note type="chapter">13. </note> <lb/>
            ignorance, he is not unjust according to the legal <lb/>
            idea, nor is his decision unjust; but it is in some <lb/>
            sense unjust, for there is a difference between legal <lb/>
            and abstract justice. But if he has knowingly made <lb/>
            an unjust decision, he himself gets some advantage, <lb/>
            either in the way of favour or of revenge. The case <note type="chapter">14. </note> <lb/>
            is just the same if a man participates in an act of <lb/>
            injustice, and he who from such participation passes <lb/>
            an unjust judgment is considered to be a gainer; <lb/>
            for, even in the other cases, he who adjudged the <lb/>
            field did not get the field, but money.</p>
          <p>But men suppose, that to act unjustly is in their <note type="margin">15. Whe­ <lb/>
            ther it ba <lb/>
            easy to <lb/>

            </note>own power, and for this reason they think that to <lb/>
            act justly is also easy. But this is not the case; <lb/>
            for to have connection with a neighbour's wife, and <lb/>
            to assault a neighbour, and to give away money with <lb/>
            one's hand, is easy, and in one's own power; but to <lb/>
            do this with a particular disposition is neither easy <lb/>
            nor in one's own power. In like manner, men think <note type="chapter">16. </note> <lb/>
            that there is no wisdom in knowing things just and <lb/>
            things unjust, because it is not difficult to com­ <lb/>
            prehend the cases of which the laws speak ; but <lb/>
            these are not just acts except accidentally—when, <lb/>
            indeed, they are done in a certain manner, and <lb/>
            distributed in a certain manner, they become just. <lb/>
            But this is a more laborious thing than to know <lb/>
            what things are wholesome, since even in that <pb n="144"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK V."/> <lb/>
            sort of knowledge it is easy to know honey, wine, <lb/>
            and hellebore, and burning and cutting; but to know <lb/>
            how to apply them for the purposes of health, and <lb/>
            to whom, and at what time, is as difficult as to be <lb/>
            a physician.</p>
          <p><note type="margin">17. <lb/>
            Erroneous <lb/>
            views. </note> For this very same reason it is supposed that <lb/>
            acting unjustly belongs to the just man as much <lb/>
            as acting justly, because the just man would be <lb/>
            no less, or rather more able to do each of these <lb/>
            things ; for he might have connection with a woman, <lb/>
            and commit an assault, and the brave man might <lb/>
            tlirow away his shield and turn and run away. <note type="chapter">is. </note> <lb/>
            But it is not merely doing these things (except <lb/>
            accidentally), but doing them with a particular dis­ <lb/>
            position, that constitutes the being a coward or an <lb/>
            unjust man ; just as it is not performing or not per­ <lb/>
            forming an operation, nor giving or not giving <lb/>
            medicine, that constitutes medical treatment or <lb/>
            healing, but doing it in this particular way. But <lb/>
            just acts are conversant with the case of those who <lb/>
            participate in things absolutely good,ii and who can <lb/>
            have of these too much or too little; for some <lb/>
            beings perhaps cannot possibly have too much, as, <lb/>
            for example, the gods perhaps; to others, again, no <lb/>
            part of them is useful, but all injurious, as to those <lb/>
            who are incurably wicked; others, again, are bene­ <lb/>
            fited to a certain extent; for which reason justice is <lb/>
            conversant with man.</p>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. X.]"/> <lb/>
            equitable bears to the just, and equity to justice; <lb/>
            for when we examine the subject, they do not seem <lb/>
            to be absolutely the same, nor yet generally different. <lb/>
            And we sometimes praise “ the equitable," and the <lb/>
            man of that character ; so that we even transfer the <lb/>
            expression, for the purpose of praise, to other cases, <lb/>
            showing by the use of the term “equitable” instead <lb/>
            of " good," that equity is better. Sometimes, again, if <note type="chapter">2. </note> <lb/>
            we attend to the definition, it appears absurd that <lb/>
            equity should be praiseworthy, when it is something <lb/>
            different from justice , for either justice must be not <lb/>
            good, or equity must be not just, that is, if it is <lb/>
            different from justice; or, if they are both good, <lb/>
            they must be both the same.</p>
          <p>From these considerations, then, almost entirely <note type="margin">3. <lb/>
            They are not <lb/>
            opposed, <lb/>
            although <lb/>
            they differ. </note> <lb/>
            arises the difficulty on the subject of the equitable. <lb/>
            But all of them are in one sense true and not incon­ <lb/>
            sistent with each other ; for “ the equitable " is just, <lb/>
            being better than a certain kind of “ just;” and it is <lb/>
            not better than “ the just," as though it were of a <lb/>
            different genus. Just and equitable, therefore, are <note type="chapter">1. </note> <lb/>
            identical; and both being good, “ the equitable is <lb/>
            the better. The cause of the ambiguity is this, that <lb/>
            " the equitable " is just, but not that justice which is <lb/>
            according to law, but the correction of the legally <lb/>
            just. And the reason of this is, that law is in all <lb/>
            cases universal, and on some subjects it is not pos­ <lb/>
            sible to speak universally with correctness. In those <note type="chapter">5. </note> <lb/>
            cases where it is necessary to speak universally, but <lb/>
            impossible to do so correctly, the law takes the most <lb/>
            general case, though it is well aware of the incor­ <lb/>
            rectness of it. And the law is not, therefore, less <lb/>
            right; for the fault is not in the law, nor in the <lb/>
            legislator, but in the nature of the thing; for the <lb/>
            subject-matter of human actions is altogether of this <lb/>
            description.</p>
          <p>When, therefore, the law speaks universally, and <note type="chapter">6. </note> <lb/>
            something happens different from the generality of <lb/>
            cases, then it is proper where the legislator falls <lb/>
            short, and has erred, from speaking generally, to <lb/>
            correct the defect, as the legislator would himself <note type="footnote"> L </note> <pb n="146"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK v."/> <lb/>
            direct if he were then present, or as he would have <lb/>
            legislated if he had been aware of the case. There­ <lb/>
            fore the equitable is just, and better than some kind <lb/>
            of “just;” not indeed better than the absolute <lb/>
            just," but better than the error which arises from <lb/>
            universal enactments.</p>
          <p><note type="margin">7. <lb/>
            The use of <lb/>
            equity. </note> And this is the nature of “ the equitable," that <lb/>
            it is a correction of law, wherever it is defective <lb/>
            owing to its universality. This is the reason why <lb/>
            all things are not according to law, because on some <lb/>
            subjects it is impossible to make a law. So that <lb/>
            there is need of a special decree : for the rule of <lb/>
            what is indeterminate, is itself indeterminate also ; <lb/>
            like the leaden rule in Lesbian building;ll for <lb/>
            the rule is altered to suit the shape of the stone, <lb/>
            and does not remain the same ; so do decrees differ <note type="chapter">8. </note> <lb/>
            according to the circumstances. It is clear, there­ <lb/>
            fore, what “ the equitable " is, and that it is just, <note type="margin">’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Επιεικὴς</foreign> <lb/>
            defined. </note> <lb/>
            and also to what "just it is superior. And from <lb/>
            this it is clear what is the character of the equitable <lb/>
            man ; for he who is apt to do these things and to <lb/>
            do them from deliberate preference, who does not <lb/>
            push the letter of the law to the furthest on the <lb/>
            worst side,mm but is disposed to make allowances, <lb/>
            even although he has the law in his favour, is <lb/>
            equitable ; and this habit is equity, being a kind of <lb/>
            justice, and not a different habit from justice.</p>

            is that which is enjcined by law, according to virtue, <lb/>
            in the universal acceptation of the term; as, for <lb/>
            example, it does not command a man to kill him­ <lb/>
            self ; and whatever it does not command, it forbids.- <lb/>
            Again, whenever a man does hurt contrary to law, <note type="chapter">2. </note> <lb/>
            provided it be not in retaliation, he voluntarily <lb/>
            injures: and he acts voluntarily who knows the <lb/>
            person, the instrument, and the manner. But he who <note type="margin">An ob­ <lb/>
            jection <lb/>
            answered. </note> <lb/>
            kills himself through rage voluntarily does a thing; <lb/>
            contrary to right reason, which the law does not: <lb/>
            allow. He therefore commits injustice, but against <lb/>
            whom? is it against the state, and not against <lb/>
            himself? for he suffers voluntarily; and a person <lb/>
            cannot be injured with his own consent. Therefore, <lb/>
            also, the state punishes him, and there is a kind of <lb/>
            disgrace attached to the suicide, as acting unjustly <lb/>
            towards the state. Again, in that kind of injustice <note type="margin">3. <lb/>
            Why a men <lb/>
            cannot in­ <lb/>
            jure him­ <lb/>
            self in <lb/>
            particular <lb/>
            justice. </note> <lb/>
            according to which he who only acts unjustly, and <lb/>
            not he who is entirely wicked, is called unjust, it <lb/>
            is impossible for a man to injure himself ; for this <lb/>
            kind is different from the other ; for he who is <lb/>
            in this sense unjust, is in some sort wicked, like <lb/>
            the coward; not as being wicked in the fullest <lb/>
            sense of the term. So that he does not injure him­ <lb/>
            self even in this way; for if he did, it would be <lb/>
            possible that the same thing should be taken from <lb/>
            and given to the same person ; but this is impossi­ <lb/>
            ble : but the just and the unjust must always imply <lb/>
            the existence of more persons than one. Again, an <note type="chapter">4. </note> <lb/>
            injury must be voluntary, proceeding from delibe­ <lb/>
            rate preference, and the first of two hurts; for he <note type="footnote"> nn The Greeks recognized the principle that it was the duty <lb/>
            of their state to support the sanctions of virtue by legislative <lb/>
            enactments; the moral education of the people formed part of <lb/>
            the legislative system. Hence the rule which Aristotle states, <unclear/> <lb/>
            Quae lex non jubet vetat." The principles of our law, on <lb/>
            the contrary, are derived from the Roman law, which confines <lb/>
            itself in all cases to forbidding wrongs done to society. Hence <lb/>
            the rule with us is exactly the contrary, " Quæ lex non vetat <lb/>
            permittit.”—See Michelet's Notes, p. 195. </note> <pb n="148"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK V."/> <lb/>
            who retaliates because ho has suffered, and inflicts <lb/>
            the very same hurt which he suffered, does not seem <lb/>
            to act unjustly; but he who injures himself is at <lb/>
            once and in the same matter both agent and patient. <note type="chapter">5. </note> <lb/>
            Again, if this were the case, it would be possible to <lb/>
            be voluntarily injured. And besides, no one acts <lb/>
            unjustly without committing particular acts of in­ <lb/>
            justice ; but no man commits adultery with his own <lb/>
            wife, nor breaks into his own house, nor steals his <lb/>
            own property. But the question of injuring one'a <lb/>
            self is finally settled, by the decision we made on <lb/>
            the subject of being voluntarily injured.</p>
          <p><note type="margin">6. <lb/>
            Whether <lb/>
            it be worse <lb/>
            to commit <lb/>
            or to re­ <lb/>
            ceive an <lb/>
            injury. </note> It is also plain, that both to be injured and to <lb/>
            injure are bad; for one implies having less, the <lb/>
            other having more, than the mean ; and the case is <lb/>
            like that of the wholesome in the science of medi­ <lb/>
            cine, and that which is productive of a good habit <lb/>
            of body in gymnastics. But yet to injure is the <note type="chapter">7. </note> <lb/>
            worse of the two ; for to injure involves depravity, <lb/>
            and is culpable ; and either perfect and absolute <lb/>
            depravity, or something like it ; for not every volun­ <lb/>
            tary act is necessarily joined with injustice; but <lb/>
            to suffer injustice is unconnected with depravity and <lb/>
            injustice. Absolutely, then, to suffer injustice is <lb/>
            less bad, but there is no reason why it should not <note type="chapter">8. </note> <lb/>
            accidentally be worse. But science cannot take <lb/>
            notice of this ; for science calls a pleurisy a worse <lb/>
            disorder than a bruise from a fall; and yet the <lb/>
            contrary might accidentally be the case, if it should <lb/>
            happen that the man bruised was, owing to his <lb/>
            fall, taken prisoner by the enemy, and put to <lb/>
            death. But, metaphorically speaking, and accord­ <lb/>
            ing to some resemblance, there is a lord of "just," <lb/>
            not, indeed, between a man and himself, but be­ <lb/>
            tween certain parts of himself: but it is not "just" <lb/>
            in the universal acceptation of the term, but such <lb/>
            as belongs to a master or head of a family; for <lb/>
            the rational part of the soul has this relation to <note type="chapter"><unclear>B</unclear>. </note> <lb/>
            the irrational part. Now. looking to these points, <lb/>
            it seems that there is some injustice towards one's <pb n="149"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. XI.]"/> <lb/>
            self, because it is possible, in these cases, to suffer <lb/>
            something contrary to one's own desires. Precisely, <lb/>
            therefore, as there is some kind of "just" between <lb/>
            the governor and the governed, so there is between <lb/>
            these parts of the soul also. With respect to jus­ <lb/>
            tice, therefore, and the rest of the moral virtues, <lb/>
            let the distinctions drawn be considered sufficient.</p><pb n="150"/>

            a certain mark which he who possesses reason looks at, <lb/>
            sometimes slackening, at others making more intense <lb/>
            his gaze; and there is a definite boundary of the mean <lb/>

            soul,-the rational and the irrational; but now we <lb/>
            must make the same kind of division in the case of <lb/>
            the rational part; and let it first be laid down, that <lb/>
            there are two divisions of the rational part; one, <lb/>
            by which we contemplate those existing things, the <lb/>
            principles of which are in necessary matter; the <lb/>
            other, by which we contemplate those, the principles of <lb/>
            which are contingent. For for the contemplation of <lb/>
            objects which differ in kind there are corresponding <lb/>
            parts of the soul differing in kind also, and naturally <lb/>
            adapted to each; if it is from a kind of resemblance <lb/>
            and affinity that they obtain the knowledge of <lb/>
            them. Let one of these be called the scientific, <lb/>
            and the other the reasoning part ;c for deliberating <note type="footnote"> e In this division of the rational soul ( Xoyov <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔχονκυρίως <lb/>

            and reasoning (<foreign xml:lang="grc">λογιστικὸν</foreign>), it must not be forgotten that <lb/>
            " reason " is used in its limited sense; namely, that it is re­ <lb/>
            stricted to the faculty which takes cognizance of moral truth, <lb/>
            and is synonymous with deliberation.–Sec Book I. xiii. ; also <lb/>

            part must be one division of the rational part. We <lb/>
            must therefore ascertain which habit is the best of <lb/>
            each of these two parts; for this is the virtue of <lb/>
            each; but the virtue has reference to its peculiar <lb/>

            the thing practised; for excellence of action is the <lb/>
            end, and appetite is for this. Wherefore deliberate <note type="chapter">6. </note> <lb/>
            preference is either intellect influenced by appetite, <lb/>

            and the knowledge that he ought to choose and <lb/>
            to do everything for the sake and on account of this; <lb/>
            for vice has a tendency to destroy the principle. <lb/>
            So that it necessarily follows that prudence is a true <lb/>

            inevitably and certainly destroy the moral judgment, and make <lb/>
            us think evil good, and good evil. As in the case of revealed <lb/>

            said, therefore, it is clear that wisdom is science and <lb/>
            intuition united, upon subjects the most honourable <lb/>
            by nature. <note type="footnote"> <unclear>1</unclear> As Socrates held the virtues to be sciences, and Plato <lb/>
            taught that <foreign xml:lang="grc">φρόνησις</foreign> was the contemplation of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ίδέα</foreign>, it <lb/>
            became necessary that Aristotle should carefully distinguish <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">σοφία</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">φρὀνησις</foreign>. He therefore tells us that the end of <lb/>
            the latter is practical truth, of the former theoretical truth; <lb/>
            that the latter is conversant with particulars as well as univer. <lb/>
            sals, because in all moral action the important part is the <lb/>
            practical application ; whereas the former is conversant with <lb/>
            universals only. The practical application he calls afterwards <lb/>
            (c. viii.) the extreme (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἕσχατον</foreign>), and (c. xi.) the minor <lb/>
            premiss. It has often been observed with truth, that the syl­ <lb/>
            logistic process is confined to the conviction of the intellect, <lb/>
            but that in whatever cases we act as moral and rational beings, <lb/>
            we act upon a syllogism. In this we are distinguished from <lb/>
            the inferior animals, who act from instinct. </note> <note type="footnote"> <unclear>M</unclear> </note> <pb n="162"/>

            and wonderful, and difficult, and divine, but yet use­ <lb/>
            less, because they do not study the subject of human <lb/>
            good. But prudence is concerned with human <lb/>
            affairs, and those subjects about which it is pos­ <lb/>
            sible to deliberate. For this, that is, to deliberate <lb/>
            well, we say is the work of the prudent man espe­ <lb/>
            cially.</p>
          <p><note type="chapter">7.</note>But no one deliberates about things which cannot <lb/>
            be otherwise than they are, nor about those of <lb/>
            which there is not some end, and this end a good <lb/>
            capable of being the subject of moral action. But <lb/>
            absolutely the good deliberator is he, who is skilful <lb/>
            in aiming at the best of the objects of human <lb/>
            action. Nor yet is prudence limited to universals <lb/>
            only, but it is necessary to have a knowledge of <lb/>
            particulars also : for prudence is practical, and prac­ <lb/>
            tice turns upon particulars. Therefore some who <lb/>
            have no theoretical knowledge, are more practical <lb/>
            than others who have it; those, for example, who <note type="chapter">a. </note> <lb/>
            derive their skill from experience. For if a man <lb/>
            should know that light meats are easy of digestion, <lb/>
            and are wholesome, without knowing what meats <lb/>
            are light, he will never produce health; but he who <lb/>
            knows nothing more than that the flesh of birds is <lb/>
            light and wholesome, will be more likely to produce <lb/>
            it. But prudence is practical, so that it is good <lb/>
            to have both, or if not both, it is better to have <lb/>
            this. But there must be in prudence also some <lb/>
            master virtue.</p><pb n="163"/>

            division, which is, as it were, a kind of master- <lb/>
            prudence, is legislative ; a second, which is parti­ <lb/>
            cular, is called by the common name political; but, <lb/>
            this is practical; for a decree, as being the last <lb/>
            thing, is the subject of action. Hence men say <lb/>
            that practical statesmen alone regulate the state; <lb/>
            for these alone act, like artificers.u But the pru- <note type="margin">2. <lb/>

            appears to be most properly prudence : and this <lb/>
            bears the common name of prudence. But of those <lb/>

              and employs himself in them, is thought to be pru­ <lb/>
              dent, but politicians appear busy-bodies. Therefore <lb/>
              Euripides says, “ How can I be prudent, I who had <lb/>

              among the multitude of the army, to share alike ? <lb/>
              For Zeus hates those who are busy-bodies, and do <note type="chapter">4. </note> <lb/>
              too much."w For men seek what is good to them­ <lb/>
              selves, and think that this is what they ought to, <lb/>
              do : from this opinion, therefore, arose the idea that <lb/>
              such people as these are prudent; and yet perhaps <lb/>
              it is not impossible to attain one's own good without <lb/>
              economical, nor without political prudence. But <lb/>
              still, it is an obscure subject, and one which requires <lb/>
              investigation, how one ought to manage one's own <lb/>

            but it is thought that a young man cannot become <lb/>
            prudent. The reason of this is, that prudence is <lb/>
            conversant with particulars, and the knowledge of <lb/>
            particulars is acquired by experience alone ; but a <lb/>
            young man is not experienced ; for length of time <note type="chapter">6. </note> <lb/>
            causes experience. One might study this question <lb/>
            also, why a child can become a mathematician, but <lb/>
            not wise, i.e. a natural philosopher ?x Is it because <lb/>
            the former subjects are derived from abstraction, <lb/>
            whilst the principles of the latter are learnt from <lb/>
            experience ? And the latter subjects young men <lb/>
            enunciate, though they are not persuaded of their <lb/>
            truth; but the reality of the former is evident. <lb/>
            Again, errors in deliberation are either in the <lb/>
            universal, or the particular; for the error is, not <lb/>
            knowing, either that all heavy waters are bal, <lb/>
            or that this water is heavy. <note type="footnote"> <unclear>wThese</unclear> lines are said to be taken from a lost tragedy of <lb/>

            prudence, as has been said, is of the extreme ; for <lb/>

            ture, or what not. Now it certainly is not <lb/>
            science ; for men do not investigate subjects which <lb/>
            they know; but good deliberation is a kind of <lb/>
            deliberation; and he who deliberates investigates <lb/>
            and reasons. Nor yet is it happy conjecture; for <note type="margin">2. <lb/>

            this is something unconnected with reason, and <note type="footnote"> <unclear>yPrudence</unclear> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">φρόνησις</foreign>) is not science (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπιστήμη</foreign>), because <lb/>
            science is conversant with universals, whereas prudence is <lb/>
            conversant with particulars. These particulars are extremes <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἕσχατα</foreign>), since they are the last results at which we arrive <lb/>
            before we begin to act. The faculty which takes cognizance <lb/>
            of them is perception (<foreign xml:lang="grc">αἵσθησις</foreign>) ; not the perception of the <lb/>
            five external senses, but that internal perception which is <lb/>
            analogous to them, and which is popularly called common sense. <lb/>
            Hence we can see the difference between prudence and intuition <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νου̃ς</foreign>) ; for the extremes of which intuition takes cognizance, <lb/>
            are the first undemonstrable principles (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχαὶ, πρω̃τοι ὅροι</foreign>), <lb/>
            such as the axioms, definitions, &amp;c. in mathematical science. <lb/>
            The intuition (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νου̃ς</foreign>), therefore, here spoken of, is the pure <lb/>
            intellectual intuition, not practical or moral intuition. </note> <pb n="166"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK VI"/> <lb/>
            quick ; but we deliberate for a long time, and <lb/>
            say, that it is right to execute quickly what we <lb/>
            have resolved upon, but to deliberate slowly.2 <lb/>
            Again, sagacityaa is a different thing from good deli­ <lb/>
            beration; and sagacity is a kind of happiness of <note type="margin">3. <lb/>
            It is an <lb/>

            Nor of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δόξα</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
            conjecture. Therefore no kind of good deliberation <lb/>
            is opinion. Now since he who deliberates badly, <lb/>
            errs, but he who deliberates well, deliberates cor­ <lb/>
            rectly, it is plain, that good deliberation is a kind <lb/>
            of correctness. It is not correctness either of science <lb/>
            or of opinion ;bb (for there is no correctness of <lb/>
            science, because there is no error:) and truth is <lb/>
            the correctness of opinion; besides, everything of <lb/>
            which there is opinion has been already defined. <note type="chapter">4. </note> <lb/>
            Still, however, good deliberation cannot be without <lb/>
            reason. It remains, therefore, that it is the correct­ <lb/>
            ness of the intellect, moving onwards in the inves­ <lb/>
            tigation of truth, i. e. <foreign xml:lang="grc">διάνοια</foreign>, for it is not yet an <lb/>
            assertion; but opinion is not investigation, but is <lb/>
            at once an assertion.cc But he who deliberates, <lb/>
            whether he does it well or ill, investigates something <note type="margin">But of <lb/>

            and reasons. But good deliberation is a sort of cor­ <lb/>
            rectness of deliberation ; therefore we must inquire <lb/>

            great evil Whereas good deliberation seems to be <lb/>
            a good thing; for good deliberation is only such a <lb/>
            correctness of deliberation as is likely to arrive at <lb/>
            good. But it is possible to arrive at even this by <note type="chapter">6. </note> <lb/>
            a false syllogism; and to be right as to what one <lb/>
            ought to do, but wrong as to the means, because <lb/>
            the middle term is false. So that even this kind of <lb/>
            deliberation, by which one arrives at a proper con­ <lb/>
            clusion, but by improper means, is not quite good <lb/>
            deliberation. Again, it is possible for one man to <note type="chapter">7. </note> <lb/>
            be right after deliberating for a long time, and <lb/>
            another man very soon. So that even this is not <lb/>
            quite good deliberation ; but good deliberation is <lb/>
            that correctness of deliberation, which is in accord­ <lb/>
            ance with the principle of utility, which has a <lb/>
            proper object, employs proper means, and is in <lb/>
            operation during a proper length of time.</p>
          <p>Again it is possible to deliberate well both abso- <note type="chapter">8 </note> <lb/>

            is absolutely good deliberation which is correct with <lb/>

          <p>INTELLIGENCE, and the want of intelligence, according <note type="margin">I. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σύνεσις</foreign> is <lb/>
            neither <lb/>

            not <foreign xml:lang="grc">δόξα</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
            to which we call men intelligent, and wanting in in­ <lb/>
            telligence, are neither universally the same as science <lb/>
            or opinion, for then all men would be intelligent; <lb/>
            nor is intelligence any one of the particular sciences, <lb/>
            as medicine is the science of things wholesome ; or <pb n="168"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK VI."/> <note type="chapter">2. </note> <lb/>
            as geometry is the science of magnitudes. Nor is <lb/>
            intelligence conversant with things eternal and im­ <lb/>
            mutable, nor with everything indiscriminately which <lb/>
            comes to pass ; but it is conversant with those <lb/>
            things about which a man would doubt and delibe- <note type="margin">3. <lb/>
            Its object- <lb/>
            matter. </note> <lb/>
            rate. Wherefore it is conversant with the same <lb/>
            subjects as prudence, yet prudence and intelligence <lb/>
            are not the same; for the province of prudence is <lb/>
            to order (for its end is what it is right to do, or <lb/>
            not to do) ; but the province of intelligence is only <lb/>
            to decide; for intelligence, and good intelligence, <lb/>
            are the same thing; for intelligent people, and <note type="chapter">4. </note> <lb/>
            people of good intelligence, are the same. But <lb/>
            intelligence is neither the possessing, nor yet the <lb/>
            obtaining, of prudence ; but just as learning, when <lb/>
            it makes use of scientific knowledge, is called intel­ <lb/>
            ligence, thus the word intelligence is also used when <lb/>
            a person makes use of opinion, for the purpose of <lb/>
            making a decision, and making a proper decision, <lb/>
            on the subjects of prudence, when another person <lb/>
            is speaking; for the terms well and properly are <note type="margin">5. <lb/>
            Whence <lb/>
            the term <lb/>
            derived. </note> <lb/>
            identical. And hence the name of intelligence, by <lb/>
            which we call intelligent people, was derived, namely, <lb/>
            from that intelligence which is displayed in learning; <lb/>
            since for the expression “ to learn," we often use the <lb/>
            expression “ to understand."</p>

            Different <lb/>
            habits <lb/>
            tending to <lb/>
            the same <lb/>
            point. </note> <lb/>
            same point; for we speak of candour, intelligence, <lb/>
            prudence, and perception, referring to the same <lb/>
            characters the possession of candour, of perception, <lb/>
            of prudence, and of intelligence; for all these facul­ <lb/>
            ties are of the extremes, and of particulars. And <lb/>
            it is in being apt to decide on points on which the <lb/>
            prudent man decides, that intelligence, kind feel­ <lb/>
            ing, and candour, are displayed. For equitable con- <note type="chapter">3. </note> <lb/>
            siderations are common to all good men in their <lb/>
            intercourse with others. But all matters of moral <lb/>
            conduct are particulars and extremes; for the <lb/>
            prudent man ought to know them, and intelli­ <lb/>
            gence and candour are concerned with matters of <lb/>
            moral conduct, and these are extremes.</p>
          <p>Intuition is of the extremes on both sides ;ee for <note type="chapter">4. </note> <lb/>
            intuition, and not reason, takes cognizance of the <lb/>
            first principles, and of the last results: that intu­ <lb/>
            ition which belongs to demonstration takes cogni­ <lb/>
            zance of the immutable and first principles; that <lb/>
            which belongs to practical subjects takes cognizance <note type="footnote"> ee Intuition (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νου̃ς</foreign>), as we have seen above, properly signi­ <lb/>
            fies the faculty which takes cognizance of the first principles <lb/>
            of science. Aristotle here, whether analogically or considering <lb/>
            it a division of the same faculty, it is difficult to say, applies <lb/>
            the term to that power which we possess of apprehending the <lb/>
            principles of morals, of seeing what is right and wrong by an <lb/>
            intuitive process, without the intervention of any reasoning <lb/>
            process. It is what Bishop Butler calls “ our sense of dis­ <lb/>
            cernment of actions as morally good or evil." In this two • <lb/>
            fold use of the term <foreign xml:lang="grc">νου̃ς</foreign> there is no real inconsistency, because <lb/>
            it is evidently, as Mr. Brewer says, p. 247, note, “ the same <lb/>
            faculty, whether employed upon the first principles of science <lb/>
            or of morals." Every moral agent acts upon a motive (<foreign xml:lang="grc">οὗ <lb/>
            ἕνεκα</foreign>), whether good or bad. This motive is, in other words, <lb/>
            the. principle upon which we act, and is the major premiss of <lb/>
            the practical syllogism (<foreign xml:lang="grc">συλλόγισμος τω̃ν πρακτω̃ν</foreign>). But <lb/>
            the minor premiss of the practical syllogism bears relation tc <lb/>
            the major, of a particular to a universal; therefore as univer. <lb/>
            sals are made up of particulars, it follows that the origin <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρχὴ</foreign>) of the motive or principle is the minor premiss. </note> <pb n="170"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK VI."/> <lb/>
            of the last result of contingent matters, and of the <note type="margin">Two kinds <lb/>
            of intuition. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Αἲσθησις</foreign>. <lb/>
            5. </note> <lb/>
            minor premiss; for these (i. e. minor premisses) are <lb/>
            the origin of the motive ; for universals are made <lb/>
            up of particulars. Of these, therefore, it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary to have perception ; and perception is intu­ <lb/>
            ition. Therefore these habits have been thought <lb/>
            to be natural; and although no man is naturally <lb/>
            wise (<unclear>σoφὸς)</unclear>, he is thought to have candour, intelli­ <lb/>
            gence, and intuition, naturally. A sign of this is, <lb/>
            that we think that these qualities naturally accom­ <lb/>
            pany certain ages; and that one particular age <lb/>
            possesses perception and candour, as though nature <lb/>
            were the cause of it.ff</p>
          <p><note type="margin">6. <lb/>
            Attention <lb/>
            to autho­ <lb/>
            rity. </note> Therefore intuition is at once the beginning and <lb/>
            the end; for demonstrations have extremes both <lb/>
            for their origin and their subjects.gg So that we <lb/>
            ought to pay attention to the undemonstrated <lb/>
            sayings and opinions of persons who are experi­ <lb/>
            enced, older than we are, and prudent, no less than <lb/>
            to their demonstrations ; for because they have ob­ <lb/>
            tained from their experience an acuteness of moral <lb/>
            vision, they see correctly. What, therefore, is the <lb/>
            nature of wisdom and of prudence, what the ob­ <lb/>
            jects of both, and the fact that each is the virtue <lb/>
            of a different part of the soul, has been stated. <note type="footnote"> <unclear>ff</unclear> The meaning of this passage is as follows: It has been <lb/>
            held that a disposition to form a candid judgment of men and <lb/>
            things, an ability to comprehend and grasp the suggestions of <lb/>
            other minds, independently of the power of reasoning out con­ <lb/>
            clusions for ourselves ; and, lastly, a moral sense of right and <lb/>
            wrong, by which we have a perception of the principles of <lb/>
            moral action, are natural gifts; as a sign or evidence of <lb/>
            this, it has been observed that these faculties are more espe­ <lb/>
            cially developed at particular periods of life, in the same <lb/>
            way that physical properties are. But coot'a, i.e. scientific <lb/>
            knowledge, which is based upon demonstration, and is in fact <lb/>
            a demonstrative habit, must for this reason be the result of an <lb/>
            active exercise of the perceptive and reasoning powers, and <lb/>
            therefore cannot be natural, but must be acquired. </note><note type="footnote"> gg That is, demonstrations have for their origin and foun­ <lb/>
            dation first principles, of which intuition takes cognizance, and <lb/>
            the object of demonstration is to arrive at conclusions which <lb/>
            come under the province of intuition likewise. </note> <pb n="171"/>

            First. </note> <lb/>
            useful ? for wisdom does not contemplate any of <lb/>
            the means by which a man will-become happy ; for <lb/>
            it relates to no production. Prudence, indeed, has <lb/>
            this property; yet with a view to what is there <lb/>
            any need of it, if it is the knowledge of the things <lb/>
            which are just, and honourable, and advantageous <lb/>
            to man, and these are what the good man practises ? <lb/>
            But we are not at all the more apt to practise them <note type="chapter">2. </note> <lb/>
            because we know them, that is, if the virtues are <lb/>
            habits; just as we are not more apt to be healthy <lb/>
            from the knowledge of wholesome things, nor of <lb/>
            things likely to cause a good habit of body (that <lb/>
            is, the things which are so called not because they <lb/>
            cause the habit, but because they result from it) ;hh <lb/>
            for we are not at all more apt to put in practice <lb/>
            the arts of medicine or gymnastics, merely because <lb/>
            we know them.</p>
          <p>But it may be said, if we must not call a man <note type="margin">3. <lb/>
            Second. </note> <lb/>
            prudent on these grounds, but only for becoming <lb/>
            virtuous, it would not be at all useful to those who <lb/>
            are already good ; again, it would not be useful to <lb/>
            those who do not possess prudence; for it will make <lb/>
            no difference to them whether they possess it them­ <lb/>
            selves, or obey others who possess it; for it would <lb/>
            be quite sufficient for us, just as in the case of <note type="footnote"> hh This sentence which I have enclosed in a parenthesis is <lb/>

              it would appear absurd, if, though it is inferior <lb/>

              it; for that which produces, always rules and <lb/>
              directs in each particular case. On these subjects, <lb/>
              therefore, we must speak, for hitherto we have only <lb/>
              raised questions about them.</p>
          <p><note type="margin">4. <lb/>
            Answers to <lb/>
            these objec­ <lb/>
            tions. </note> First, then, let us assert, that wisdom and pru­ <lb/>
            dence must be eligible for their own sakes, since <lb/>
            they are the virtues, one of each part of the <lb/>
            soul, even if neither of them produces any effect. <lb/>
            Secondly, they do really produce an effect, although <lb/>
            not in the same way as medicine produces health, <lb/>
            but as health is the efficient cause of healthiness, <lb/>
            so is wisdom the efficient cause of happiness; for <lb/>
            being part of virtue in the most comprehensive sense <lb/>
            of the term, it causes, by being possessed, and by <note type="chapter">5. </note> <lb/>
            energizing, a man to be happy. Again, its work <lb/>
            will be accomplished by prudence and moral virtue ; <lb/>
            for virtue makes the end and aim correct, and pru- <note type="margin">The use­ <lb/>
            fulness of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">φρόνησις</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
            dence the means. But of the fourth part of the <lb/>
            soul, that is, the nutritive, there is no such virtue; <lb/>
            for the performance or non-performance of moral <lb/>
            action is not in any case in its power.</p>
          <p>To answer the objection, that we are not at all <lb/>
            more likely to practise honour and justice on <lb/>
            account of prudence, we must begin a little further <note type="chapter"> 6. </note> <lb/>
            back, making this our commencement. Just as we <lb/>
            say that some who do just actions, are not yet <lb/>
            just; those, for instance, who do what is enjoined <lb/>
            by the laws involuntarily, or ignorantly, or for <lb/>
            some other cause, and not for its own sake, though <lb/>
            nevertheless they do what they ought and what a <lb/>
            good man ought to do ; in the same manner, it <lb/>
            seems, that a man must do all these things, being <lb/>
            at the same time of a certain disposition, in order <lb/>
            to be good; I mean, for instance, from deliberate <lb/>
            preference, and for the sake of the acts themselves <note type="chapter">7. </note> <lb/>
            Virtue, therefore, makes the deliberate preference <lb/>
            correct; but it is not the part of virtue, but of <pb n="173"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. XII.]"/> <lb/>
            some other faculty, to direct aright those things <lb/>
            which must be done with a view to that principle. <lb/>
            But we must stop and speak On these subjects with <lb/>
            more clearness.</p>
          <p>Now, there is a certain faculty which is called <note type="margin">8. <unclear/><lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δεινότης</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
            cleverness; ii the nature of which is to be able to <lb/>
            do, and to attain, those things which conduce to <lb/>
            the aim proposed. If, therefore, the aim be good, <lb/>
            the cleverness is praiseworthy ; but if it be bad, it <lb/>
            becomes craft :jj therefore we call prudent men clever, <lb/>
            and not crafty. Now prudence is not the same <note type="margin">9. <lb/>
            It is not <lb/>
            identical <lb/>
            with <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">φρόνησις</foreign>, <lb/>
            although <lb/>
            not <unclear>without</unclear> <lb/>
            it. </note> <lb/>
            as this faculty, nor is it without this faculty. But <lb/>
            the habit is produced upon this eye, as it were, <lb/>
            of the soul, not without virtue, as we have already <lb/>
            stated, and as is manifest. For the syllogisms of <note type="footnote"> ii Cleverness (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δεινότης</foreign>) is, according to Aristotle, a natural <lb/>
            faculty, or aptness, which, in itself, is neither good nor bad ; <lb/>
            it may be either used or abused,-if abused, it is craft (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παν</foreign>­ <lb/>
            ovpyia). It is capable of being cultivated and improved, <lb/>
            and when perfected it becomes <foreign xml:lang="grc">φρόνησις</foreign>. As cleverness thus <lb/>
            perfected by the addition of moral virtue becomes prudence, <lb/>
            so natural virtue, with Aristotle, who believes that man is <lb/>
            endowed, becomes perfect virtue by the addition of prudence. <lb/>
            Not that Aristotle believed that man was capable of actually <lb/>
            attaining such a height of perfection: he evidently believed <lb/>
            that it was beyond human power. It is the theoretical standard <lb/>

            the preface to them “Our nature is adapted to virtue as <lb/>

            virtue to <lb/>
            virtue <lb/>
            proper. </note> WE must again investigate the subject of virtue. For <lb/>
            virtue admits of relation of the same kind as that <lb/>
            which prudence bears to cleverness; that is, the <lb/>
            two kinds of virtue are not identically the same, but <lb/>
            similar ; such is the relation which exists between <lb/>
            natural virtue and virtue proper. For all men <lb/>
            think that each of the points of moral character <lb/>
            exists in us in some manner naturally; for we possess <lb/>
            justice, temperance, valour, and the other virtues, <note type="chapter">2. </note> <lb/>
            immediately from our birth. But yet we are in <lb/>
            search of something different, namely, to be pro­ <lb/>
            perly virtuous, and that these virtues should exist <note type="margin">Difference <lb/>
            between <lb/>
            natural <lb/>
            virtue and <lb/>
            virtue <lb/>
            proper. </note> <lb/>
            in us in a different manner; for natural habits <lb/>
            exist in children and brutes, but without intellect <lb/>
            they are evidently hurtful. Yet so much as this is <lb/>
            evident to the senses, that as a strong body which <lb/>
            moves without sight meets with great falls, from <lb/>
            the want of sight, so it is in the present instance : <lb/>
            but if it gets the addition of intellect, it acts much <lb/>
            better. Now the case of the habit is similar, and <lb/>
            under similar circumstances will be properly virtue. <lb/>
            So that, as in the case of the faculty which forms <lb/>
            opinions, there are two forms, cleverness and pru­ <lb/>
            dence; so in the moral there are likewise two, <lb/>
            natural virtue and virtue proper; and of these, <lb/>
            virtue proper is not produced without prudence.</p><pb n="175"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. XIII.]"/> Therefore it has been said that all the virtues <note type="chapter">3. </note> <lb/>
            are prudences. And Socrates, in one part was right <lb/>
            in his inquiry, but in the other wrong. For in <lb/>
            that he thought that all the virtues are prudences, <lb/>
            he was wrong; but in that he said that they are <lb/>
            not without prudence, he was right. And this is <lb/>
            a sign ; for now all men, when they define virtue, <lb/>
            add also that it is a habit, according to right reason, <lb/>
            stating also to what things it has reference ; now <lb/>
            that is right reason which is according to prudence. <lb/>
            All men, therefore, seem in some way to testify <note type="chapter">4. </note> <lb/>
            that such a habit as is according to prudence, is <lb/>
            virtue. But it is necessary to make a slight change ; <note type="margin">Virtue,n3t <lb/>

            opinion. </note> <lb/>
            for virtue is not only the habit according to, but in <lb/>
            conjunction with, right reason; and prudence is the <lb/>
            same as right reason on these subjects. Socrates, <lb/>
            therefore, thought that the virtues were " reasons," <lb/>
            i. e. reasoning processes ; for he thought them all <lb/>
            sciences : but we think them joined with reason.</p>
          <p>It is clear, therefore, from what has been said, <note type="margin">5. <lb/>
            Prudence <lb/>
            and moral <lb/>
            virtue in­ <lb/>

            This is true <lb/>
            of virtue <lb/>
            proper, but <lb/>
            not of na­ <lb/>
            tural virtue. </note> <lb/>
            that it is impossible to be properly virtuous with­ <lb/>
            out prudence, or prudent without moral virtue. <lb/>
            Moreover, the argument by which it might be <lb/>
            urged that the virtues are separate from each <lb/>
            other, may in this way be refuted, for (they say) <lb/>
            the same man is not in the highest degree naturally <lb/>
            adapted for all: so that he will have got one al­ <lb/>
            ready, and another not yet. Now this is possible in <lb/>
            the case of the natural virtues ; but in the case of <lb/>
            those from the possession of which a man is called <lb/>
            absolutely good, it is impossible; for with prudence, <lb/>
            which is one, they will all exist together.kk It is <note type="chapter">G. </note> <note type="footnote"> kk This view of the practical nature of <foreign xml:lang="grc">φρόνησις</foreign>, and of its <lb/>

            another beginning,a and state, that there are three <lb/>
            forms of things to be avoided in morals--vice, in­ <lb/>
            continence, brutality. The contraries of two of <lb/>
            these are self-evident: for we call one virtue, the <lb/>
            other continence : but, as an opposite to brutality, <lb/>
            it would be most suitable to name the virtue which <lb/>
            is above human nature, a sort of heroic and divine <lb/>
            virtue, such as Homer has made Priam attribute t<unclear>o</unclear> <lb/>

            ———— "Nor did be seem <lb/>
            The son of mortal man, but of a god." b <note type="footnote"> a It is not very easy to see at first the connection between <lb/>
            the four remaining books and the preceding six. The follow­ <lb/>
            ing is the explanation given by Muretus. In the commence­ <lb/>
            ment of the sixth book Aristotle has taught that two conditions <lb/>
            are requisite to the perfection of moral virtue: first, that the <lb/>
            moral sense (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ νου̃ς</foreign> <unclear>ὀ</unclear> <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρακτικός</foreign>) should judge correctly; <lb/>
            next, that the appetites and passions should be obedient to its <lb/>
            decisions. But though the moral judgment should be correct, <lb/>
            the will is generally in opposition to it. If in this conflict <lb/>
            reason is victorious, and compels the will, though reluctant, to <lb/>
            obey, this moral state is continence ; if, on the contrary, the <lb/>
            will overcomes the reason, the result is incontinence. It was <lb/>
            essential to a practical treatise to treat of this imperfect or in­ <lb/>
            choate virtue, as well as to discuss the theory of moral perfec­ <lb/>
            tion. The case is somewhat analogous to that of physical <lb/>
            science, in which we first lay down theoretically the natural <lb/>
            laws without reference to the existence of any impediments, <lb/>
            and then modify our theory by calculating and allowing for <lb/>
            the effects of perturbations and resistances. <unclear/> <lb/>

            So that if, as is commonly said, men become gods <lb/>
            because of excess of virtue, the habit, which is op­ <lb/>
            posed to brutality, would evidently be something of <lb/>
            that kind : for just as there is no vice or virtue in <lb/>
            a brute, so also there is not in a god :c but in the <lb/>
            one case there is something more precious than <lb/>
            virtue; and in the other something different in <lb/>
            kind from vice.</p>
          <p><note type="chapter">3. </note> But. since the existence of a godlike man is a <lb/>

            amongst men, and is mostly found amongst barba­ <lb/>

            mutilations: and those who go beyond the rest of <lb/>

            the incontinent man, knowing that things are bad, <lb/>
            does them at the instigation of passion; but the <lb/>
            continent man, knowing that the desires are bad, <lb/>
            refuses to follow them in obedience to reason. That <lb/>

            some think that every one who is both continent <lb/>

            assert that they are different. As to the prudent <lb/>

            considered. </note> <lb/>
            right conception is incontinent. Some say, that if <lb/>
            he has a scientific knowledge, it is impossible : for <lb/>
            it is strange, as Socrates thought,e if science exists <lb/>
            in the man, that anything else should have the <lb/>
            mastery, and drag him about like a slave. So- <note type="margin">The opi­ <lb/>
            nion of <lb/>
            Socrates. </note> <lb/>
            crates, indeed, resisted the argument altogether, as <lb/>
            if incontinence did not exist: for that no one form­ <lb/>
            ing a right conception acted contrary to what is <note type="footnote"> e Aristotle (Magna Moral.) says, that in the opinion of <lb/>
            Socrates no one would choose evil, knowing that it was evil: <lb/>
            but the incontinent man does so, being influenced by passion, <lb/>
            therefore he thought there was no such thing as incontinence. <lb/>
            This doctrine of Socrates doubtless originated, firstly, from his <lb/>
            belief that man's natural bias and inclination was towards <lb/>
            virtue, and that therefore it was absurd to suppose he would <lb/>
            pursue vice except involuntarily or ignorantly. Secondly, <lb/>
            from his doctrine that the knowledge of the principles and <lb/>
            laws of morality was as capable of certainty and accuracy <unclear>as</unclear> <lb/>
            those of mathematical science. </note> <note type="footnote"> <unclear>N</unclear> 2 </note> <pb n="180"/>

            best, but only through ignorance. Now, this ac­ <lb/>
            count is at variance with the phenomena; and we <lb/>
            must inquire concerning this passion, if it proceeds <lb/>
            from ignorance, what manner of ignorance it is; <lb/>
            for that the incontinent man, before he is actually <lb/>
            under the influence of passion, thinks that he ought <note type="chapter">2. </note> <lb/>
            not to yield, is evident. There are some who con­ <lb/>
            cede one point, but not the rest; for that nothing <lb/>
            is superior to science they allow : but that no one <lb/>
            acts contrary to what they think best they do not <lb/>
            allow : and for this reason they say, that the incon­ <lb/>
            tinent man is overcome -by pleasures, not having <lb/>
            science, but opinion. But still, if it is opinion, and <lb/>
            not science,-nor a strong conception, which opposes, <lb/>
            but a weak one, as in persons who are doubting, the <lb/>
            not persisting in this in opposition to strong de­ <lb/>
            sires is pardonable : but vice is not pardonable, nor <lb/>
            anything else which is reprehensible.</p>
          <p><note type="margin">3. <unclear/> <lb/>
            5th point. </note> Perhaps, then, it may be said that it is pru­ <lb/>
            dence which opposes, for this is the strongest. But <lb/>
            this is absurd ; for then the same man will at once <lb/>
            be prudent and incontinent: but not a single indi­ <lb/>
            vidual would assert that it is the character of the <lb/>
            prudent man willingly to do the most vicious things. <lb/>
            Besides this, it has been shown before that the pru­ <lb/>
            dent man is a practical man ; for he has to do with <lb/>
            the practical extremes, and possesses all the other <lb/>
            virtues.</p>
          <p><note type="margin">4. <unclear/> <lb/>
            th point. </note> Again, if the continent character consists in hav­ <lb/>
            ing strong and bad desires, the temperate man will <lb/>
            not be continent, nor the continent temperate ; for <lb/>
            excess does not belong to the temperate man, nor <lb/>
            the possession of bad desires. But, nevertheless, <lb/>
            the continent man must have bad desires; for if <lb/>
            the desires are good, the habit, which forbids him <lb/>
            to follow them, is bad: so that continence would <lb/>
            not be in all cases good ; and if they are weak and <lb/>
            not bad, there is nothing grand in overcoming <lb/>
            them ; and if they are both bad and weak, there is <lb/>
            nothing great in doing so.</p>
          <p><note type="chapter"><unclear/>. </note> Again, if continence makes a man inclined to <pb n="181"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. II.]"/> <lb/>
            adhere to every opinion, it is bad; as, for instance, <note type="margin">2nd point. </note> <lb/>
            if it makes him inclined to adhere to a false one : <lb/>
            and if incontinence makes him depart from every <lb/>
            opinion, some species of incontinence will be good; <lb/>
            as, lor instance, the case of Neoptolemus in the <lb/>
            Philoctetes of Sophocles ; for he is praiseworthy <lb/>
            for not adhering to what Ulysses persuaded him <lb/>
            to do, because he felt pain in telling a lie. Again, <note type="chapter">6 </note> <lb/>
            the sophistical argument, called “ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ψευδόμενος</foreign>, causes <lb/>
            a difficulty :f for because they wish to prove para­ <lb/>
            doxes, in order that they may appear clever when <lb/>
            they succeed, the syllogism, which is framed, be­ <lb/>
            comes a difficulty: for the intellect is as it were <lb/>
            in bonds, inasmuch it does not wish to stop, because <lb/>
            it is not satisfied with the conclusion ; but it can­ <lb/>
            not advance, because it cannot solve the argument. <lb/>
            And from one mode of reasoning it comes to pass <note type="chapter">7. </note> <lb/>
            that folly, together with incontinence, becomes vir­ <lb/>
            tue ; for it acts contrary to its conceptions through <lb/>
            incontinence; but the conception which it found <lb/>
            was, that good was evil, and that it ought not to <lb/>
            be done : so that it will practise what is good, and <lb/>
            not what is evil.</p>
          <p>Again, he who practises and pursues what is <note type="margin">8. <lb/>

            the intern- <lb/>

            than the man who does so not from deliberation, <lb/>
            but from incontinence ; for he is more easily cured, <lb/>
            because he may be persuaded to change ; whereas <lb/>
            to the incontinent man the proverbial expression <lb/>

            Three <lb/>
            questions <lb/>
            proposed. </note> FIRST, then, we must consider whether men are <lb/>
            incontinent, having knowledge or not, and in what <lb/>
            way having knowledge. Next, with what sort of <lb/>
            objects we must say that the continent and incon­ <lb/>
            tinent have to do ; I mean, whether it is every <lb/>
            pleasure and pain, or some particular ones. Thirdly, <unclear/> <lb/>
            whether the continent and patient are the same <lb/>
            or different. And in like manner we must con­ <lb/>

          <p><note type="margin">2. <lb/>
            The object- <lb/>
            matter and <lb/>
            manner <lb/>
            considered. </note> The beginning of the discussion is, whether the <lb/>
            continent and incontinent differ in the object, or <lb/>
            in the manner : I mean, whether the incontinent <lb/>
            man is incontinent merely from being employed in <lb/>
            this particular thing; or whether it is not that, <lb/>
            but in the manner; or whether it is not that, <note type="chapter">3. </note> <lb/>
            but the result of both. Next, whether inconti­ <note type="footnote"> <unclear>ing</unclear> way. Water is the most natural remedy for choking; but <lb/>
            if water itself chokes, what further remedy can be applied. So <lb/>
            reason is the best remedy for vice; but the incontinent man <lb/>
            acts in defiance of reason,-be has the remedy, but it dots not <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. 111.]"/> <lb/>
            nence and continence are on every object-matter <lb/>
            or not: for he that is called simply incontinent, is <lb/>
            not so in everything, but in the same things with <lb/>
            which the intemperate is concerned : nor is he so <lb/>
            from having reference to these things absolutely <lb/>
            (for then it would be the same as intemperance), <lb/>
            but from having reference to them in a particular <lb/>
            manner : for the intemperate is led on by deliberate <lb/>
            choice, thinking that he ought always to pursue <lb/>
            present pleasure: the incontinent does not think <lb/>
            so, but nevertheless pursues it.</p>
          <p>Now as to the question whether it be a true <note type="margin">4. <lb/>
            It matters <lb/>
            not whether <lb/>

            opinion, and not science, in opposition to which <lb/>
            men are incontinent, makes no difference as to <lb/>
            the argument : for some who hold opinions, do <lb/>
            not feel any doubt, but think that they know for <lb/>
            certain. If then those, who hold opinions, be­ <lb/>
            cause their convictions are weak, will act contrary <lb/>
            to their conception, more than those who have <lb/>
            knowledge, then knowledge will in nowise differ <lb/>
            from opinion : for some are convinced of what they <lb/>
            think, no less than others are of what they know : <lb/>
            Heraclitus is an instance of this.h But since we <note type="margin">5. <lb/>
            How the <lb/>

            acts con­ <lb/>

            First way. </note> <lb/>
            speak of knowing in two ways (for he that pos­ <lb/>
            sesses, but does not use his knowledge, as well as <lb/>
            he that uses it, is said to have knowledge), there: <lb/>
            will be a difference between the having it, but not <lb/>
            using it, so as to see what we ought not to do, and <lb/>
            the having it and using it.</p>
          <p>Again, since there are two kinds of propositions, <note type="margin">6. <lb/>
            Second <lb/>
            way. </note> <lb/>
            universal and particular, there is nothing to hinder <lb/>
            one who possesses both from acting contrary to <lb/>
            knowledge, using indeed the universal, but not the <lb/>
            particular ; for particulars are the subjects of moral <lb/>
            action. There are also two different applications of <note type="chapter"> 7. </note> <lb/>
            the universal—one to the person and one to the <note type="footnote"> h Heraclitus, although he said that all his conclusions rested <lb/>
            on opinion, not on knowledge, still defended them as perti­ <unclear/> <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK VII."/> <lb/>
            thing ;1 as, for instance, a person knows that dry <lb/>
            food is good for every man, and that this is a man <lb/>
            or that such and such a thing is dry; but as to <lb/>
            whether this is such and such a thing, either he <lb/>
            does not possess the knowledge or does not use it <lb/>
            In these two cases the difference will be inconceivably <lb/>
            great, so much so, that in one case knowledge involves <lb/>
            no absurdity, but in the other a very great one.</p>
          <p><note type="margin">8, <unclear/> <lb/>
            Third way. </note> Again, it is possible to possess knowledge in a <lb/>
            different manner from those above mentioned; for <lb/>
            we see the habit differing in the possessing but not <lb/>
            using knowledge, so that in a manner he has it and <lb/>
            has it not; such as the person who is asleep, or mad, <lb/>
            or drunk. Now, those who are under the influence <lb/>
            of passion are affected in the same way ; for anger, <lb/>
            and sensual desires, and so forth, evidently alter <lb/>
            the bodily state, and in some they even cause <lb/>
            madness. It is evident, therefore, that we must <lb/>
            say, that the incontinent are in a similar condition <note type="chapter">9.</note><lb/>
            to these. But the fact of their uttering sentiments <lb/>
            which must have proceeded from knowledge is no <lb/>
            proof to the contrary, for those who are under the <lb/>
            influence of these passions recite demonstrations and <lb/>
            verses of Empedocles;j and those who have learnt <note type="footnote"> I The great difficulty which commentators have found in <lb/>
            explaining this confessedly obscure passage appears to me to <lb/>
            arise from this ; they have not observed that the expressions <lb/>
            rb <foreign xml:lang="grc">καθόλου ἐφ</foreign>’ <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑαυτου̃</foreign>, and TO <foreign xml:lang="grc">καθόλου ἐπὶ του̃</foreign> <unclear>πράγματoς</unclear> <lb/>
            do not describe two different kinds of universals, but the ur... <lb/>
            versal as related to two different kinds of particulars ; e.g., to <lb/>
            the major premiss, " All dry meats are good for man," may <lb/>
            be attached two different kinds of minors; either, " This is a <lb/>
            man," or " Such and such a thing is dry." The relation of <lb/>
            the major to the minor in the first case is <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ καθόλου ἐφ</foreign>’ <unclear/> <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">αυτου̃</foreign>, and it would appear absurd to conceive that any one <lb/>
            could go wrong. In the second case the relation is <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὸ καθόλου <lb/>
            ἐπὶ του̃ πράγματος</foreign>, and here there is no absurdity. We <lb/>
            cannot help knowing that this is a man,—we may not know <lb/>
            that such and such a thing is dry. </note><note type="footnote"> As rational beings, we all act on a syllogistic process. It is <lb/>
            generally found that even in the case of lunatics the reasoning <lb/>
            is correct, though the premisses are false,—the premisses being <lb/>
            influenced by the delusions under which they labour. </note><note type="footnote"> How often do we find that the giving utterance to good </note> <pb n="185"/>

            not yet understand them, for they must grow with <lb/>
            their growth, and this requires time; so that we <lb/>
            must suppose the incontinent utter these sentiments <lb/>
            in the same manner in which actors do.</p>
          <p>Again, one might consider the cause physically <note type="margin">10. <lb/>
            Fourth way. </note> <lb/>
            in the following manner:- There is one opinion <lb/>
            upon universals, and another upon those particulars <lb/>
            which are immediately under the dominion of sensa­ <lb/>
            tion ; and when one opinion is formed out of the <lb/>
            two, the soul must necessarily assert the conclusion, <lb/>
            and if it is a practical matterl must immediately act <lb/>
            upon it: for instance, if it is right to taste every­ <lb/>
            thing sweet, and this is sweet, as being an individual <lb/>
            belonging to this class, then he who has the power <lb/>
            and is not prevented, when he puts these two to­ <lb/>
            gether, must necessarily act. When, therefore, one <note type="chapter">11. </note> <lb/>
            universal opinion exists in us, which forbids us to <lb/>
            taste; and another that everything sweet is pleasant, <lb/>
            and this particular thing is sweet; and the last <lb/>
            universal energizes, and desire happens to be pre­ <lb/>
            sent ; the first universal tells us to avoid this par­ <lb/>
            ticular thing, but desire leads us to pursue it; for <lb/>
            it is able to act as a motive to each of the parts of <lb/>
            man's nature. So that it comes to pass that he in <note type="margin">12. <lb/>
            Why <unclear>beater</unclear> <lb/>
            cannot be <lb/>

            a manner acts incontinently from reason and from <lb/>
            opinion : not that the latter is opposed to the <lb/>
            former naturally, but accidentally ; for it is the de­ <lb/>
            sire, and not the opinion, which is opposed to right <lb/>
            reason. So that for this reason brutes are not in­ <note type="footnote"> moral sentiments is quite consistent with hypocrisy ; and that <lb/>

            knowledge. </note> But as to how the ignorance is put an end to, <lb/>
            and the incontinent man again becomes possessed <lb/>
            of knowledge, the account to be given is the same <lb/>
            as that of a man drunk or asleep, and is not pecu­ <lb/>
            liar to this passion; and this account we must hear <lb/>
            from physiologists. But since the last [i. e. the <lb/>
            particular] proposition is an opinion formed by the <lb/>
            perceptive faculties, and influences the actions, he, <lb/>
            who is under the influence of passion, either does <lb/>
            not possess this, or possesses it not as though he had <lb/>
            knowledge, but merely as though he repeated, like <lb/>
            a drunken man, the verses of Empedocles. And <lb/>
            this is the case, because the last proposition is not <lb/>
            universal, and does not appear to be of a scientific <lb/>
            character in the same way that the universal does. <note type="margin">14. <lb/>
            Socrates’ <lb/>
            opinion. </note> <lb/>
            And that which Socrates sought seems to result: <lb/>
            for the passion does not arise when that, which <lb/>
            appears properly to be knowledge, is present; nor <lb/>
            is this dragged about by the passion; but it is, <lb/>
            when that opinion is present which is the result of <lb/>
            sensation. On the question, therefore, of acting <lb/>
            incontinently with knowledge, or without, and how <lb/>
            it is possible to do so with knowledge, let what has <lb/>
            been said be considered sufficient.</p>

            enced in addition by youthful desire, and excessive <note type="chapter">7. </note> <lb/>
            pain at the want of things necessary ? But since <lb/>
            some desires and pleasures belong to the class of <lb/>
            those which are honourable and good (for of things <lb/>
            pleasant, some are eligible by nature, some the con­ <lb/>

            in all such pleasures, and in those which are indif­ <lb/>

            anxious about them, are praised) ; but, nevertheless, <lb/>
            there may be excess even in the case of these, if <lb/>
            any one, like Niobe, were to fight against the gods, <lb/>
            or were to act like Satyrus surnamed Philopater, with <lb/>

            continence is not only to be avoided, but it belongs <lb/>
            also to the class of things blameable. But from the <lb/>
            similarity of the affection, we use the term incon­ <lb/>
            tinence, with the addition of the idea of relation: <lb/>
            just as we call a man a bad physician and a bad <lb/>

            therefore, in these instances we would not call them <lb/>
            so absolutely, because each is not really a vice, but <lb/>
            we call them so from analogy ; so in the other case <note type="margin">Object- <lb/>

            the limits of vice, as also is brutality. But when <lb/>
            one has them, to conquer them or to be con­ <lb/>
            quered by them is not absolutely [continence or] <lb/>
            incontinence, but only that which is called so from <lb/>

            anger, that he is incontinent of anger, not simply <lb/>
            incontinent: for as to every instance of excessive <lb/>

            disease ; for he, whose natural constitution is such, <lb/>
            as to fear everything, even if a mouse squeaks, is <lb/>
            cowardly with a brutish cowardice; as he who was <note type="chapter">6. </note> <lb/>

            in the case of depravity, that which is human, is <lb/>

          <p>LET us now consider the fact, that incontinence of <note type="margin">1. <lb/>
            Inconti­ <lb/>
            nence of <lb/>
            desire worse <lb/>

            continence <lb/>
            of anger. </note> <lb/>
            anger is less disgraceful than incontinence of desire. <lb/>
            For anger seems to listen somewhat to reason, <lb/>
            but to listen imperfectly; as hasty servants, who <lb/>
            before they have heard the whole message, run <lb/>
            away, and then misunderstand the order; and dogs, <lb/>
            before they have considered whether it is a friend, <lb/>
            if they only hear a noise, bark : thus anger, from a <lb/>
            natural warmth and quickness, having listened, but <lb/>
            not understood the order, rushes to vengeance. For <note type="chapter">2. </note> <lb/>
            reason or imagination has declared, that the slight <lb/>
            is an insult; and anger, as if it had drawn the in­ <lb/>
            ference that it ought to quarrel with such a person, <lb/>
            is therefore immediately exasperated. But desire, <lb/>
            if reason or sense should only say that the thing is <note type="footnote"> q Compare with this chapter, Arist. Rhet. II. ii. ; and Bishop <lb/>

            not; it is therefore more disgraceful; for he that <lb/>

            is like the case of the man who defended himself <lb/>
            for beating his father, because, said he, my father <lb/>
            beat his father, and he again beat his; and he, <lb/>
            also (pointing to his child) will beat me, when he <lb/>
            becomes a man; for it runs in our family. And he <lb/>
            that was dragged by his son, bid him stop at the <lb/>
            door, for that he himself had dragged his father so <note type="margin">6. <lb/>
            Less in­ <lb/>
            sidious. </note> <lb/>
            far. Again, those who are more insidious, are <lb/>
            more unjust. Now the passionate man is not in­ <lb/>
            sidious, nor is anger, but is open ; whereas desire is <lb/>
            so, as they say of Venus, <lb/>
            " Cyprian goddess, weaver of deceit. <lb/>
            And Homer says of the Cestus, <lb/>
            " Allurement cheats the senses of the wise.” r <lb/>
            So that if this incontinence is more unjust, it is <lb/>
            also more disgraceful than incontinence in anger, <lb/>
            and is absolute incontinence, and in some sense vice. <note type="margin">7. <lb/>
            Does not <lb/>
            imply <lb/>
            wanton <lb/>
            insolence. </note> <lb/>
            Again, no one commits a rape under a feeling of <lb/>
            pain ; but every one, who acts from anger, acts <lb/>
            under a feeling of pain; whereas he that commits <lb/>
            a rape, does it with pleasure. If, then, those things <lb/>
            are more unjust with which it is most just to be <lb/>
            angry, then incontinence in desire is more unjust ; <note type="chapter">8 </note> <lb/>
            for there is no wanton insolence in anger. Conse­ <lb/>
            quently, it is plain, that incontinence of desire is <lb/>
            more disgraceful than that of anger, and that con­ <lb/>
            tinence and incontinence are conversant with bodily <lb/>
            desires and pleasures. But we must understand <note type="footnote"> r Horn n. xiv. 214; Pope's transl. line 243—252. </note> <pb n="193"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. 711.]"/> <lb/>
            the different forms of these; for, as has been said at <lb/>
            the beginning, some are human and natural, both in <lb/>
            kind and in degree ; others are brutal; and others <lb/>
            arise from bodily injuries and disease ; but tem­ <lb/>
            perance and intemperance are only conversant with <lb/>
            the first of these. For this reason we never call <lb/>
            beasts temperate or intemperate, except metapho­ <lb/>
            rically, or if any kind of animals differ in some <lb/>
            respect entirely from another kind in wantonness <lb/>
            and mischief, and voracity; for they have no deli­ <lb/>
            berate choice, nor reason; but are out of their <lb/>
            nature, like human beings who are out of their <lb/>
            mind.</p>
          <p>But brutality is a less evil than vice, though more <note type="margin">3. <lb/>
            Brutality, <lb/>
            a less evil <lb/>
            than vice. </note> <lb/>
            formidable; for the best principle has not been <lb/>
            destroyed, as in the human being, but it has never <lb/>
            existed. It is just the same, therefore, as to com­ <lb/>
            pare the inanimate with the animate, in order to <lb/>
            see which is worse ; for the viciousness of that which <lb/>
            is without principle is always the less mischievous ; <lb/>
            but intellect is the principle. It is therefore almost <lb/>
            the same as to compare injustice with an unjust <lb/>
            man; for it is possible that either may be the <lb/>
            worse ; for a vicious man can do ten thousand times <lb/>
            as much harm as a beast.</p>

          <p>WITH respect to the pleasures and pains, the <note type="margin">1. <lb/>

            desires and aversions which arise from touch and <lb/>
            taste (with which intemperance and temperance <lb/>
            have already been defined as being conversant), it <lb/>
            is possible to be affected in such a manner, as to <lb/>
            give way to those which the generality overcome ; <lb/>
            and it is possible to overcome those to which the <lb/>
            generality give way. Whoever, then, is so affected <lb/>
            as regards pleasure, is either incontinent or conti- <note type="footnote"> O </note> <pb n="194"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK VII."/> <lb/>
            nent ; and as regards pain, either effeminate or <lb/>
            patient. But the habits of the generality are be­ <lb/>
            tween the two, although they incline rather to <note type="margin">2. <lb/>
            Intempe­ <lb/>
            ranee. </note> <lb/>
            the worse. Now since some pleasures are necessary, <lb/>
            while others are not so, or only up to a certain <lb/>
            point, whilst their excesses and defects are not <lb/>
            necessary; the same holds good with desires and <lb/>
            pains.; he who pursues those pleasures which are in <lb/>
            excess, or pursues them to excess, or from delibe­ <lb/>
            rate preference, and for their own sakes, and not <lb/>
            for the sake of any further result, is intemperate ; <lb/>
            for this man must necessarily be disinclined to re­ <lb/>
            pentance, so that he is incurable; for the impeni­ <lb/>
            tent is incurable. He that is in the defect, is the <lb/>
            opposite ; he that is in the mean, is temperate. <lb/>
            The case is similar with him who shuns bodily <lb/>
            pains, not from being overcome, but from delibe­ <lb/>
            rate preference.</p>
          <p><note type="chapter">3. </note> Of those who act without deliberate preference, <lb/>
            one is led by pleasure ; another by the motive of <lb/>
            avoiding the pain which arises from desire ; so that <lb/>
            they differ from each other. But every one would <lb/>
            think a man worse, if he did anything disgraceful <lb/>
            when he felt no desire, or only a slight one, than if <lb/>
            he felt very strong desires; and if he struck <lb/>
            another without being angry, than if he had been <lb/>
            angry ; for what would he have done, had he been <lb/>
            under the influence of passion ? Therefore, the in- <note type="margin">4. <lb/>

            i nconti­ <lb/>
            nence. </note> <lb/>
            temperate is worse than the incontinent. Of those <lb/>
            then that have been mentioned, one is rather a <lb/>
            species of effeminacy, the other is incontinent. The <lb/>
            continent is opposed to the incontinent, and the <lb/>
            patient to the effeminate; for patience consists in <lb/>
            resisting, continence in having the mastery; but <lb/>
            to resist and to have the mastery differ in the same <note type="margin">Continence <lb/>
            better than <lb/>
            patience. </note> <lb/>
            way as not being defeated differs from gaining i <lb/>
            victory. Therefore, also, continence is more eligi­ <lb/>

            him, that he may not be annoyed with the pain of <lb/>
            carrying it; and who, imitating an invalid, does not <lb/>
            think himself a wretched creature, although he <lb/>
            resembles one who is. The case is the same with <note type="chapter">6. </note> <lb/>
            continence and incontinence; for it is not to be <lb/>
            wondered at, if a man is overcome by violent and <lb/>
            excessive pleasures or- pains ; but it is pardonable, <lb/>
            if he struggles against them (like the Philoctetes <lb/>
            of Theodectes, when he had been bitten by the <lb/>
            viper, or the Cercyon of Carcinus in the Alope ; <lb/>
            and like those, who, though they endeavour to <lb/>
            stifle their laughter, burst out, as happened to <lb/>
            Xenophantus); but it is astonishing, if any one. is <lb/>
            overcome by and cannot resist those which the <lb/>
            generality are able to resist, and this not because of <lb/>
            their natural constitution, or disease, as for exam­ <lb/>

          <p>He, too, who is excessively fond of sport, is <note type="chapter"> 7. </note> <lb/>
            thought intemperate; but in reality he is effemi­ <lb/>

            former is incurable, and the latter curable; for de­ <lb/>

            others are : for the incontinent resembles those <lb/>
            who are intoxicated quickly, and with a little wine, <lb/>
            and with less than the majority. Consequently <lb/>
            that incontinence is not vice, is evident: but per- <note type="margin">Inconti­ <lb/>
            nence is <lb/>
            not ab­ <lb/>
            solutely <lb/>
            vice. </note> <lb/>
            haps it is so to a certain extent: for the one <lb/>
            is contrary, the other according to deliberate pre­ <lb/>
            ference. Not but that they are similar in their <lb/>
            acts : as Demodocus said of the Milesians ; “ the <lb/>
            Milesians are not fools, but they act like fools :” <lb/>
            and so the incontinent are not unjust, but they act <lb/>
            unjustly. But since the one is such, as to follow <note type="margin">Inconti­ <lb/>
            nence is <lb/>
            curable. </note> <lb/>
            those bodily pleasures, which are in excess, and <lb/>
            contrary to right reason, not from being persuaded <lb/>
            to do so; but the other is persuaded to it, because <lb/>
            his character is such, as inclines him to pursue them ; <lb/>
            therefore, the former is easily persuaded to change, <lb/>
            but the latter is not. For as to virtue and de- <note type="chapter">4. </note> <lb/>
            pravity, one destroys, and the other preserves the <lb/>
            principle: but in moral action the motive is the <lb/>
            principle, just as the hypotheses are in mathematics. <lb/>
            Neither in mathematics does reason teach the prin­ <lb/>
            ciples, nor in morals, but virtue, either natural or <lb/>
            acquired by habit, teaches to think rightly respect­ <lb/>
            in,-, the principle. Such a character, therefore, is <lb/>
            temperate, and the contrary character is intem­ <lb/>
            perate.</p>
          <p>But there is a character, who from passion is pre- <note type="chapter">5. <lb/>
            </note>captate contrary to right reason, which passion so <lb/>
            far masters, as to prevent him from acting accord­ <lb/>
            ing to right reason ; but it does not master him so <lb/>
            far, as to make him one who would be persuaded that <lb/>
            he ought to follow such pleasures without restraint. <lb/>
            This is the incontinent man; better than the in­ <lb/>
            temperate, and not vicious absolutely ; for the best <lb/>
            thing, i. e. the principle, is preserved. But there is <lb/>
            another character opposite to this; he that abides <lb/>
            by his opinions, and is not precipitate, at least not <pb n="198"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK VI,!,"/> <lb/>
            through passion. It is evident, then, from the above <lb/>

            of another, he pursues and chooses the latter for its <lb/>
            own sake, but the former accidentally. By the <lb/>
            expression “ for its own sake" we mean “ abso­ <lb/>
            lutely." So that it is possible that the one adheres <lb/>
            to, and the other departs from, any opinion what­ <lb/>

            since many feel desires, and are led by pleasures. <lb/>

            So that they resemble the incontinent more than <lb/>
            the continent.</p>
          <p>There are some who do not abide by their <note type="chapter">4. </note> <lb/>
            opinions, but not from incontinence ; for instance, <lb/>
            Neoptolemus in the Philoctetes of Sophocles ; it <lb/>
            was on account of pleasure that he did not abide, <lb/>
            by it; still it was. an honourable pleasure ; for to <lb/>
            speak truth was honourable to him, and the had, <lb/>
            been persuaded by Ulysses to speak falsely : for <lb/>
            not every one that does anything from pleasure is <lb/>
            intemperate, or vicious, or incontinent, but he who <lb/>
            does it for the sake of disgraceful pleasure.</p>
          <p>Since there is such a character as takes less <note type="margin">5. <lb/>
            Extreme on <lb/>
            the side <lb/>
            of defect <lb/>
            nameless. </note> <lb/>
            delight than he ought in bodily pleasures, and <lb/>
            does not abide by reason, he who is in the mean <lb/>
            between that and the incontinent is the conti­ <lb/>
            nent: for the incontinent, in consequence of some <lb/>
            excess, does not abide by reason ; and the other, <lb/>
            in consequence of some defect; but the continent <lb/>
            abides by it, and does not change from either cause. <lb/>
            Now if continence is good, both the opposite habits <lb/>
            must be bad, as they appear to be : but because the <lb/>
            one is seen in few cases and rarely, in the same manner <lb/>
            as temperance is thought to be the. only opposite to <lb/>
            intemperance, so is continence to incontinence. But <note type="margin">6. <lb/>
            The mutual <lb/>
            relation of <lb/>
            these habits </note> <lb/>
            since many expressions are used from resemblance, <lb/>
            this is the reason for the expression “ the continence <lb/>

            who would do nothing contrary to. reason for the <lb/>

            contrary to reason, but the former is one to feel <lb/>
            pleasure, though not to be led by it. The case is <lb/>
            the same with the incontinents and intemperate ; <lb/>
            they are different, but both pursue bodily plea­ <lb/>

            prudent and incontinent: for it has been shown <lb/>
            that a prudent man is at the same time good in <lb/>
            moral character. Again, a man is not prudent <lb/>
            from merely knowing, but from being also disposed <note type="chapter">2. </note> <lb/>
            to act; but the incontinent is not disposed to act. <lb/>
            There is nothing to hinder the clever man from <lb/>
            being incontinent: and therefore some men now <lb/>
            and then are thought to be prudent, and yet incon­ <lb/>
            tinent, because cleverness differs from prudence in <lb/>
            the manner which has been mentioned in the earlier <lb/>
            part of this treatise (Book VI. c. xii.), and resembles <lb/>
            it with respect to the definition, but differs with <lb/>
            respect to deliberate preference.</p>
          <p><note type="chapter">3. </note> The incontinent therefore is not like one who has <lb/>
            knowledge and uses it, but like one asleep or drunk ; <lb/>

            he is not wicked; for his deliberate preference is <lb/>
            good ; so that he is half-wicked, and not unjust, for <lb/>
            he is not insidious. For one of them is not disposed <lb/>

            not disposed to deliberate at all. Therefore, the in­ <lb/>

            the enactments which it ought, and has good laws, <lb/>
            but uses none of them, according to the jest of <lb/>

            The rela­ <lb/>
            tion of </note> IT would follow next after this to treat of friend <lb/>
            ship; for it is a kind of virtue, or joined with <lb/>
            virtue. Besides, it is most necessary for life : for <lb/>
            without friends no one would choose to live, even <lb/>
            if he had all other goods.b For to the rich, and to <note type="footnote"> a Friendship, although, strictly speaking, it is not a virtue, <lb/>
            is, nevertheless, closely connected with virtue. The amiable <lb/>
            feelings and affections of'our nature, which are the foundation <lb/>
            of friendship, if cultivated and rightly directed, lead to the dis­ <lb/>
            charge of our moral and social duties. It is also almost indis­ <lb/>
            pensable to the highest notions which we can form of human <lb/>
            happiness. On these accounts the subject is appropriated <lb/>
            introduced in a treatise on Ethics. But friendship acquires <lb/>
            additional importance from the place which it occupied in <lb/>
            the Greek political system. As, owing to the public duties <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">λειτουργίαι</foreign>) which devolved upon the richer citizens, <lb/>
            magnificence (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μεγαλοπρέπεια</foreign>) was nearly allied to patriotism ; <lb/>
            as, again, to make provision for the moral education of the <lb/>
            people was considered one of the highest duties of a states­ <lb/>
            man, so friendships, under which term were included all the <lb/>
            principles of association and bonds of union between indivi­ <lb/>
            duals, involved great public interests. “ The Greeks," says <lb/>
            Mr. Brewer, “ had been accustomed to look upon the friend­ <lb/>
            ships of individuals, and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑταιρε</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">αι</foreign> which existed in <lb/>
            different forms among them, as the organs, not only of great <lb/>
            political changes and revolutions in the state, but as influ­ <lb/>
            encing the minds and morale of the people to an almost in­ <lb/>

            amongst us, did these political and individual unions exert <lb/>
            amongst them." Many occasions will of course occur of <lb/>

            matters if it were known what the object of love is: <lb/>
            for it is thought to be not everything which is loved, <lb/>
            but only that which is an object of love ; and this <lb/>
            is the good, the pleasant, or the useful. That would <lb/>
            be thought to be useful, by means of which some <lb/>
            good or some pleasure is produced : so that the good <lb/>
            and pleasant would be objects of love, considered <lb/>
            as ends. Do men, then, love the good, or that which <lb/>
            is good to themselves ? for these sometimes are at <lb/>
            variance. The case is the same with the pleasant. <lb/>
            Each is thought to love that which is good to him- <note type="footnote"> 1 Compare what Cicero says of Empedocles, in the Lading, <lb/>

            to himself, but that which appears so ; but -his will <lb/>
            make no difference; for the object of love will be <lb/>
            that which appears to be good. But since there <lb/>
            are three motives on account of which men love, the <lb/>
            term friendship cannot be used to express a fond­ <lb/>
            ness for things inanimate: for there is no return <lb/>
            of fondness, nor any wishing of good to them.n For <lb/>
            it is perhaps ridiculous to wish good to wine ; but if <lb/>
            a man does so, he wishes for its preservation, in order <note type="chapter">3. </note> <lb/>
            that he himself may have it. But we say that <lb/>
            men should wish good to a friend for his sake; and <lb/>
            those who wish good to him thus, we call well-dis­ <lb/>
            posed, unless there is also the same feeling enter­ <lb/>
            tained by the other party; for good-will mutually <lb/>
            felt is friendship; or must we add the condition, <lb/>
            that this mutual good-will must not be unknown <note type="chapter">1. </note> <lb/>
            to both parties ? For many feel good-will towards <lb/>
            those whom they have never seen, but who they <lb/>
            suppose are good or useful to them; and this same <lb/>
            feeling may be reciprocated. These, then, do in­ <lb/>
            deed appear well-disposed towards one another; <lb/>
            but how can one call them friends, when neither <note type="margin">Definition. </note> <lb/>
            knows how the other is disposed to him ? They <lb/>
            ought, therefore, to have good-will towards each <lb/>
            other, and wish each other what is good, not with­ <lb/>

            friendships ; consequently there are three species of <lb/>
            friendship, equal in number to the objects of love, <lb/>
            since in each there is a return of affection, and both <lb/>
            parties are aware of it. But those who love one <lb/>
            another wish what is good to one another, according <lb/>
            to the motive on account of which they love. Now, <note type="chapter">2. </note> <lb/>
            those who love one another for the sake of the use­ <lb/>

            so far forth as there results some good to themselves <lb/>
            from one another. The case is the same with those <lb/>
            who love for the sake of pleasure, for they do not <lb/>
            love the witty from their being of such a character, <lb/>
            but because they are pleasant to them;; and, there­ <lb/>
            fore, those who love for the sake of the useful love <lb/>
            for the sake of what is good to themselves, and <lb/>
            those who love for the sake of pleasure love for the <lb/>
            sake of what is pleasant to themselves, and not so <lb/>
            far forth as the person loved exists, but so far forth <lb/>
            as he is useful or pleasant.</p>
          <p>These friendships, therefore, are accidental; for <note type="margin">3. <lb/>

            the person loved is not loved for being who he is, but <lb/>
            for providing something either good or pleasant; con­ <lb/>
            sequently such friendships are easily dissolved, if the <lb/>
            parties do not continue in similar circumstances; for <lb/>
            if they are no longer pleasant or useful, they cease <lb/>
            to love. Now the useful is not permanent, but be­ <lb/>
            comes different at different times ; therefore, when <lb/>
            that is done away for the sake of which they be­ <lb/>
            came friends, the friendship also is dissolved; which <lb/>
            clearly shows that the friendship was for those mo­ <lb/>
            tives. Such friendship is thought mostly to be formed <note type="margin">4. <lb/>
            The former <lb/>
            is found <lb/>

            amongst those in the prime of life and in youth <lb/>
            who pursue the useful.</p>
          <p>But such persons do not generally even associate <lb/>
            with one another, for sometimes they are not plea­ <lb/>

            to themselves and present; but as they grow older, <lb/>
            their idea of what is pleasant also becomes different; <lb/>
            therefore they quickly become friends and quickly <lb/>
            cease to be so; for their friendship changes together <lb/>
            with what is pleasant; and of such pleasure as this <note type="chapter">6. </note> <lb/>
            the change is rapid. Young men also are given to <lb/>
            sexual love; for the principal part of sexual love is <lb/>
            from passion and for the sake of pleasure; there­ <lb/>
            fore they love and quickly cease to love, changing <lb/>
            often in the same day; but they wish to pass their <lb/>

            not generally both; for they do not seek for friends <lb/>
            who are pleasant and good as well, nor such as <lb/>
            are useful for honourable purposes: but they wish <lb/>
            for men of wit, when they desire the pleasant, and <lb/>
            they wish for clever men to execute their com­ <lb/>
            mands : and these qualities are not generally <lb/>
            united in the same person. But we have said <lb/>
            that the good man is at once pleasant and useful ; <lb/>
            but such a character does not become the friend of <lb/>
            a superior, unless the latter is surpassed by the <lb/>

          <p><note type="chapter"> 7. </note> All the friendships, therefore, which have been <lb/>
            mentioned consist in equality : for the same things <lb/>
            result from both parties, and they wish the same <lb/>
            things to each other; or else they exchange one thing <lb/>
            for another, such as pleasure for profit. But that <lb/>
            these friendships are less strong and less permanent <lb/>

          <p>THERE is another species of friendship, where one <note type="margin">1. <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φιλια καθ <lb/>
            ὑπεροχήν</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
            of the parties is superior; as that of a father for <lb/>
            his son, and generally an older for a younger per­ <lb/>
            son, and a husband for his wife, and a governor for <lb/>
            the governed. But these differ from one another ; <lb/>
            for the case is not the same between parents and <lb/>
            children, as between governors and the governed ; <lb/>
            nor is the feeling of a father for his son the same <lb/>
            as that of a son for his father, nor of a husband for <lb/>
            his wife, as of a wife for her husband ; for the per­ <lb/>
            fection and office of each of these is different; there­ <lb/>
            fore the motives of their friendship are different. <lb/>
            Consequently their affections and their friendships <lb/>
            themselves are different; hence the same offices are <lb/>
            not performed by each to the other, nor ought they <lb/>
            to be required. But when children pay to their <note type="chapter">2. </note> <lb/>
            parents what is due to those who begat them, and <lb/>
            parents to their children what is due to them, the <lb/>
            friendship in such cases is lasting and sincere. But <lb/>
            in all friendships, where one party is superior, the <lb/>
            affection also ought to be proportionate; as, for <lb/>
            example, that the better person should be loved in <lb/>
            a greater degree than he loves, so also the more use- <note type="margin">There will <lb/>

            ful person, and in like manner in every other case. <lb/>
            For when the affection is proportional, then there <lb/>
            is in a manner an equality; which seems to be the <lb/>
            property of friendship.</p>
          <p>The equal does not seem to be the same in justice <pb n="216"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK VIII."/> <lb/>
            as in friendship, for equality in proportion to merit <lb/>
            holds the first place in justice, and equality as tc <lb/>
            quantity the second ; but in friendship, that which <lb/>
            relates to quantity is first, and that which relates <lb/>
            to merit is second. This is evident, if there is a <lb/>
            great distance between the parties in virtue, or <lb/>
            vice or wealth, or anything else : for they are then <lb/>
            no longer friends, and they do not even expect it. <note type="chapter">4. </note> <lb/>
            This is most evident in the case of the gods ; for <lb/>
            they are most superior in all goods: it is also evident <lb/>
            in the case of kings; for they who are very infe­ <lb/>
            rior do not presume to be friends with them ; nor <lb/>
            do the worthless presume to be so with the best or <lb/>
            wisest men. In the case of such persons as these, <lb/>
            there can be no exact definition how far they may <lb/>
            be friends ; for though we may take away much from <lb/>
            one party, still the friendship continues; but when <lb/>
            one is very far removed from the other, as from a <note type="margin">5. <lb/>
            Whether <lb/>
            men wish <lb/>
            theirfriends <lb/>
            all goods. </note> <lb/>
            god, it continues no longer. Hence also a question <lb/>
            arises whether friends wish their friends the greatest <lb/>
            goods, for instance, that they should become gods : <lb/>
            for then they would no longer be their friends ; and <lb/>
            therefore they would not be goods to them : for <lb/>
            friends are goods. If, therefore, it has been rightly <lb/>
            said, that a friend wishes his friend good for that <lb/>
            friend's sake, he ought to continue, relatively to <lb/>
            that friend, the same as he was before. He will, <lb/>
            therefore, wish him to have the greatest goods which <lb/>
            he can have being a man : though perhaps not <lb/>
            every good ; for each wishes goods for himself more <lb/>
            than to any one else.w <note type="footnote"> w Great difference of opinion exists amongst commentators <lb/>
            as to the way in which this passage ought to be translated; <lb/>
            the following paraphrase will explain that translation which <lb/>
            appears to me the only one consistent with the argument, <lb/>
            and at the same time grammatical. If a friend wished his <lb/>
            friend to become a god, he would be wishing him to be so far <lb/>
            removed as that lie would cease to be a friend. Consequently, <lb/>
            as friends are goods, in wishing such change of circumstances <lb/>
            as would deprive him of his friendship, he is really wishing to <lb/>
            deprive his friend of a good. Now, if a friend wishes good to <lb/>
            his friend for that friend's sake, of course he will not wish their <lb/>
            relative position to be altered in such a way as to put an end to </note> <pb n="217"/>

            love of <lb/>
            honour, <lb/>
            wish to <lb/>
            be loved <lb/>
            rather than <lb/>
            to love. </note> <lb/>
            wish to be loved, rather than to love ; therefore the <lb/>
            generality are fond of flattery; for the flatterer is <lb/>
            an inferior friend, or pretends to be so, and to love <lb/>
            rather than to be loved: and being loved seems <lb/>
            to bear a close resemblance to being honoured, of <lb/>
            which most men are desirous. They do not, how­ <lb/>
            ever, seem to choose honour for its own sake, but <lb/>
            accidentally; for the generality delight in being <lb/>
            honoured by those in power, because of hope ; for <lb/>
            they think that they shall obtain from them what­ <lb/>
            ever they want. Thus they delight in honour, as a <lb/>
            sign of future favours. But those who are desirous <note type="chapter">3. </note> <lb/>
            of receiving honour from good men and men who <lb/>
            know their worth, are anxious to confirm their own <lb/>
            opinion of themselves: thus they delight in the idea <lb/>
            that they are good, trusting to the judgment of those <lb/>
            who say so. But they delight in being loved for its <lb/>
            own sake ; therefore to be loved might seem to be <lb/>
            better than to be honoured, and friendship might <lb/>
            seem eligible for its own sake.</p>
          <p>But it really seems to consist in loving, rather <note type="margin">4. <lb/>

            than being loved. A proof of this is, that mothers <lb/>
            delight in loving; for some give their children to be <lb/>
            nursed, and, knowing that they are their children, <lb/>
            love them, though they do not seek to be loved in <lb/>
            return, if both cannot be ; but it seems sufficient to <lb/>
            them if they see them doing well: and they love their <lb/>
            children, even if the latter, from ignorance, cannot <lb/>
            repay to their mother what is due. But since friend­ <lb/>
            ship consists more in loving, and those who love their <lb/>
            friends are praised, to love seems to be the excel- <note type="footnote"> their friendship. He would, therefore, only wish his friend <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK VII."/> <lb/>
            ence of friends. So that the parties between whom <lb/>
            this takes place proportionately are lasting friends, <lb/>
            and the friendship of such is lasting. In this <lb/>
            manner those who are unequal, may also be the <lb/>
            greatest friends ; for they may be equalized. But <lb/>
            equality and similarity constitute friendship, and <lb/>
            particularly the similarity of those who are alike <lb/>
            with respect to virtue ; for as they possess stability <lb/>
            in themselves, they also possess the same towards <lb/>
            each other, and neither ask nor render base services, <lb/>
            but, so to speak, they even prevent it: for it is tho <lb/>
            characteristic of the good neither to commit faults <lb/>
            themselves, nor to suffer their friends to commit <note type="chapter">6. </note> <lb/>
            them. The wicked have no stability; for they <lb/>
            do not continue consistent even with themselves ; <lb/>
            but they become friends for a short time, taking <lb/>
            delight in each other's wickedness. The useful and <lb/>
            the pleasant continue friends longer than these ; for <lb/>
            they continue as long as they furnish pleasure and <lb/>

            for whatever a needy person wants, being desirous <lb/>
            of that, he gives something else in return. Under <lb/>
            this head one might bring the lover and the beloved, <lb/>
            the beautiful and the ugly. Hence, also, lovers some­ <lb/>
            times appear ridiculous if they expect to be loved as <lb/>
            much as they love : when they are equally suitable <lb/>
            objects of love, they may perhaps expect it; but when <lb/>
            they possess no qualification of the kind, it is ridi- <note type="chapter">9. </note> <lb/>
            culous. But perhaps the opposite never desires its <lb/>
            opposite for its own sake, but accidentally; and the <lb/>
            desire is for the mean, for that is a good : for exam­ <lb/>

            arrive at the mean ; so also what is warm, and <lb/>

          <p>FRIENDSHIP and the just appear, as was said at first, : <note type="margin">1. <lb/>
            In every <lb/>
            community <lb/>
            there is a <lb/>
            friendship. </note> <lb/>
            to be conversant with the same things, and between <lb/>
            the same persons; for in every community there <lb/>
            seems to exist some kind of just and some kind of <lb/>
            friendship. Thus soldiers and sailors call their com­ <lb/>
            rades friends, and so likewise those who are asso­ <lb/>
            ciated in any other way. But as far as they have <lb/>
            anything in common, so far there is friendship ; for <lb/>
            so far also there is the just And the proverb, that <lb/>
            the property of friends is common, is correct; for <lb/>
            friendship consists in community : and to brothers <lb/>
            and companions all things are common ;x but to <lb/>
            others, certain definite things, to some more, to <lb/>
            others less; for some friendships are stronger, and <lb/>
            others weaker.</p>
          <p>There is also a difference in the just; for, it is <note type="margin">2. <lb/>
            The just is <lb/>
            not in all <lb/>
            cases the <lb/>
            same. </note> <lb/>
            not the same between parents and children as <lb/>
            between brothers ; nor between companions as be­ <lb/>
            tween citizens; and so on in every other friend­ <lb/>
            ship. Acts of injustice, therefore, are different be­ <lb/>
            tween each of these, and are aggravated by being <lb/>
            committed against greater friends ; for instance, it <lb/>
            is more shameful to rob a companion of money than <lb/>
            a fellow-citizen, and not to assist a brother than a <lb/>
            stranger, and to strike one's father than any one <lb/>
            else. It is the nature of the just to increase together <lb/>
            with friendship, as they are between the same par­ <lb/>
            ties, and of equal extent. All communities seem <note type="margin">3. <lb/>
            All com­ <lb/>
            munities are <lb/>
            part of the <lb/>

            like parts of the political community; for men unite <lb/>
            together for some advantage, and to provide them­ <lb/>
            selves with some of the things needful, for life. Po­ <lb/>
            litical community seems also originally to have been <note type="footnote"> x In the same way the early Christian brotherhood had all <lb/>

            formea, and still to continue, for the sake of ad­ <lb/>
            vantage ; for legislators aim at this, and say that <lb/>
            what is expedient to the community is just.</p>
          <p><note type="chapter">4. </note> Now all other communities desire advantage in <lb/>
            particular cases ; as, for example, sailors desire that <lb/>
            for which they make their voyage,-money, for in­ <lb/>
            stance, or something of that kind; soldiers that <lb/>
            which belongs to war,—either money, or victory, or <lb/>
            the taking of a city ; and in like manner people of <lb/>
            the same tribe and borough seek each their own <lb/>
            advantage. Some communities seem to have been <lb/>
            formed for the sake of pleasure; such as bacchanalian <lb/>
            revels and clubs : for these were formed for the <note type="chapter">5. </note> <lb/>
            sake of sacrifice and associating together.y All these <lb/>
            seem to be included under the social community; <lb/>
            for this does not aim at mere present expediency, but <lb/>
            at that which influences the whole of life ; hence <lb/>
            sacrifices are instituted and honours paid to the gods <lb/>
            in such assemblies, and men are themselves furnished <lb/>
            with opportunities of pleasant relaxation ; for the <lb/>
            ancient sacrifices and general meetings seem to have <lb/>
            been held as first-fruits after the gathering in of <lb/>
            harvest; for the people had most leisure at that time. <lb/>
            All communities, therefore, seem to be parts of the <lb/>
            political community ; and similar friendships will <lb/>
            accompany such communities.</p>

            Tyranny. </note> <lb/>
            monarchy is tyranny; for both are monarchies : <lb/>
            but there is the greatest difference between them; <lb/>
            for the tyrant looks to his own benefit, the king to <lb/>
            that of his subjects ; for he is not a king who is not <lb/>
            independent, and who does not abound in all goods; <lb/>
            but such an one as this wants nothing else; and <lb/>
            consequently he would not be considering what is <lb/>
            beneficial to himself, but to his subjects; for he <lb/>
            that does not act so, must be a mere king chosen <lb/>
            by lot.aa But tyranny is the opposite to this ; for a <lb/>
            tyrant pursues his own peculiar good. And it is <note type="chapter">3. </note> <lb/>
            more evident on this ground, that it is the worst <lb/>
            form of all; for that is worst, which is opposite to <lb/>
            the best. But the transition from kingly power <lb/>
            is to tyranny; for tyranny is a corruption of mo­ <lb/>
            narchy, and a bad king becomes a tyrant.</p>
          <p>The transition from aristocracy is to oligarchy, <note type="margin">4. <lb/>
            Oligarchy. </note> <lb/>
            through the wickedness of those in power, who dis­ <lb/>
            tribute the offices of the state without reference to <lb/>
            merit, give all or most good things to themselves, <lb/>
            and the offices of state constantly to the same people, <lb/>
            setting the highest value upon wealth : conse­ <lb/>
            quently a few only are in power, and the bad instead <lb/>
            of the best. The transition from timocracy is to <note type="margin">5. <lb/>
            Democracy, <lb/>

            The authority of a master over his slaves is also <lb/>

            of the Persians is wrong; for the power of those <lb/>
            who are in different circumstances ought to be <lb/>
            different. The relation of a man to his wife <lb/>
            seems to be aristocratical; for the husband go­ <lb/>
            verns because it is his due, and in those things <lb/>
            which a husband ought; and whatever is suitable <lb/>
            for the wife he gives up to her. When the husband <lb/>
            lords it over everything, it changes into an oli­ <lb/>

            Such also is paternal friendship ; but it exceeds the <lb/>
            former in the greatness of the. benefits which it <lb/>
            confers ; for the father is the cause of the son's <lb/>
            existence, which is esteemed the greatest thing, <lb/>
            and also of food and of education. The same things <note type="chapter">2 </note> <lb/>
            are also ascribed to ancestors; tor a father is by <lb/>
            nature the governor of his sons, and ancestors of <lb/>
            their descendants, and a king of his subjects. These <lb/>
            friendships imply superiority; whence also parents <lb/>
            receive honour; therefore also the just is not the <lb/>
            same between the two parties, but according to <lb/>
            proportion ; for thus also must the friendship be.</p>
          <p>Between husband and wife there is the same <note type="chapter">3. </note> <lb/>
            friendship as in an aristocracy;;, for their relation is <lb/>
            according to merit, and the greater is given to the <lb/>
            better person, and to each that which is suitable. <lb/>
            The just also subsists between them in the same <lb/>
            way. The friendship of brothers is like the friend­ <lb/>
            ship of companions ; for they are equal and of the <lb/>
            same age; and such persons generally have the <note type="footnote"> cc Wherever the expression " the just" occurs, it must be <lb/>
            remembered that its signification is " the abstract principle of <lb/>

            same feelings and the same moral character. The <lb/>
            friendship of a timocracy is therefore like this, <lb/>
            for citizens think themselves equal and equitable ; <lb/>
            consequently, the government is held by all in <note type="margin">5. <lb/>

            there is no <lb/>
            friendship. </note> <lb/>
            turn, and equally. The friendship also in a time­ <lb/>
            cracy is of the same kind. But in the deflections, <lb/>
            as there is but little of " the just," so also there is <lb/>
            but little friendship, and least of all in the worst. <lb/>
            For in a tyranny there is no friendship, or very <lb/>
            little; for between those parties, where the ruler <lb/>
            and the ruled have nothing in common, there is no <note type="chapter">6. </note> <lb/>
            friendship; for there is no principle of justice. The <lb/>
            case, in fact, is the same as between a workman and <lb/>
            his tool, the soul and the body, a master and his <lb/>
            slave; for all these are benefited by the users. But <lb/>
            there is no friendship nor justice towards inani­ <lb/>
            mate things, neither is there towards a horse or an <lb/>
            ox, nor towards a slave, so far forth as he is a slave; <lb/>
            for there is nothing in common; since a slave is an <lb/>
            animated tool, and a tool is an inanimate slave. <note type="chapter">7. </note> <lb/>
            So far forth, therefore, as he is a slave, there is <lb/>
            no friendship towards him, but only so far forth <lb/>
            as he is a man; for it is thought that there is <lb/>
            some sort of justice between every man, and every <lb/>
            one who is able to participate in a law and a con­ <lb/>
            tract ; and therefore that there is some sort of <note type="margin">In demo­ <lb/>

            often found. </note> <lb/>
            friendship so far forth as he is a man. Hence friend­ <lb/>
            ship and the just exist but to a small extent in <lb/>
            despotic governments; but in democracies they are <lb/>
            found to a considerable extent; for there are many <lb/>
            things in common to those who are equal.</p>

            between relations and of that between companions. <lb/>
            The friendships between citizens and fellow-tribes­ <lb/>
            men, and fellow-sailors, and such like, more resemble <lb/>
            those which depend upon community; for they <lb/>
            seem as it were to exist in accordance with some <lb/>
            agreement. Amongst these also one might classify <lb/>
            the friendship of hospitality. That also between <lb/>
            relations seems to have many forms, and to depend <lb/>
            .entirely upon the paternal friendship. Parents love <note type="margin">2. <lb/>
            The love cr <lb/>
            parents. </note> <lb/>
            their children as being a part of themselves ; chil­ <lb/>
            dren love their parents as being themselves some­ <lb/>
            thing which owes its existence to them. Now, <lb/>
            parents know their offspring better than the off­ <lb/>
            spring knows that it comes from them; and the <lb/>
            original cause is more intimately connected with <lb/>
            the thing produced, than the thing produced is <lb/>
            with that which produced it; for that which pro­ <lb/>
            ceeds from a thing, belongs to the thing from which <lb/>
            it proceeded, as a tooth, or hair, or anything what­ <lb/>
            soever, belongs to the possessor of it; but the origi­ <lb/>
            nal cause does not at all belong to what proceeds <lb/>
            from it, or, at least, it belongs in a less degree. <lb/>
            On account of its duration, also, the love of parents <note type="chapter">3. </note> <lb/>
            exceeds that of children ; for the former love them <lb/>
            as soon as ever they are born; but the latter <lb/>
            love their parents in process of time, when they <lb/>
            have acquired intelligence or perception : from this, <lb/>
            also, it is evident why mothers feel greater love <lb/>
            than fathers.</p>
          <p>Parents then love their children as themselves; <note type="chapter">4. </note> <lb/>
            for that which proceeds from them, becomes by the <lb/>
            separation like another self; but children love <lb/>
            their parents, as being sprung from them. Bro- <note type="margin">5. <lb/>
            Of bro­ <lb/>
            thers. </note> <lb/>
            thers love one another, owing to their being sprung <lb/>
            from the same parents; for identity with the <lb/>
            latter produces identity with each other. Whence <lb/>
            the expressions, “ the same blood," “ the same <lb/>
            root," and so on. They are, therefore, in some sense <lb/>
            the same, even though the individuals are distinct. <lb/>
            The being educated together, and being of the same <lb/>
            age, greatly contributes to friendship ; for men like <note type="footnote"> Q </note> <pb n="226"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK. VIlI."/> <lb/>
            those of their own age, and those of the same charac­ <lb/>
            ter are companions. Hence also the friendship of <lb/>
            brothers resembles that of companions. The friend­ <lb/>
            ship between cousins and other relations is cwing to <lb/>
            the same cause ; for it is owing to their being sprung <lb/>
            from the same stock ; some are more, others less <lb/>
            warmly attached, according as the parent stock is <note type="margin">G. <lb/>

            wards the <lb/>
            gods. </note> <lb/>
            nearer or further off. The friendship which chil­ <lb/>
            dren feel towards parents, and men towards gods, is <lb/>
            as it were towards something good and superior; <lb/>
            for they have conferred on them the greatest bene­ <lb/>
            fits ; since they are the cause of existence and of <lb/>
            support, and of education when brought into exist­ <lb/>
            ence. Such a friendship as this involves pleasure and <lb/>
            profit, more than that between strangers, inasmuch <lb/>
            as they live more together. There is contained also in <lb/>
            the friendship between brothers, all that is in that <lb/>
            between companions; and more so between the <lb/>
            good, and in general between those who are alike, <lb/>
            inasmuch as they are more connected, and love one <lb/>
            another immediately from their birth; and inas­ <lb/>
            much as those are more similar in disposition, who <lb/>
            come from the same stock, and have been nurtured <lb/>
            together, and educated similarly; and the trial, <lb/>
            which is the result of time, is here the longest and <lb/>
            most certain.</p>

            Of husband <lb/>
            and wife. </note> The duties of friendship are analogous in all other <lb/>
            relationships. Between husband and wife, friend­ <lb/>
            ship is thought to exist by nature ; for man is by <lb/>
            nature a being inclined to live in pairs rather than in <lb/>
            societies, inasmuch as a family is prior in point of <lb/>
            time and more necessary than a state, and procrea­ <lb/>
            tion is more common to him, together with animals. cc <note type="footnote"> « Nam quum sit hoc naturâ commune animantium, ut <lb/>
            habeant libidmem procreandi, prima societas in ipso conjugio <lb/>

            —Cic. de Off. I. From this chapter, as well as from what <lb/>
            Aristotle afterwards says of self-love, we may see how clear an <lb/>
            idea he entertained of the progressive and gradually expansive <lb/>
            nature of human sympathies. Their source he held to be a <lb/>
            reasonable self-love, their simlest and earliest development <unclear/> <lb/>
            sonjugal affection; they next embrace within their sphere </note> <pb n="227"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. XIII.]"/> <lb/>
            To other animals, therefore, community proceeds <lb/>
            thus far only ; but human beings associate not only <lb/>
            for the sake of procreation, but for the affairs of <lb/>
            life ; for the duties of husband and wife are distinct <lb/>
            from the very first, and different. They, therefore, <lb/>
            assist one another, throwing into the common stock <lb/>
            their private resources. For this reason, also, the <lb/>
            useful and the pleasant are thought to exist in this <lb/>
            friendship : it may also be formed for virtue's sake, <lb/>
            if they are good ; for there is a virtue of each, and <lb/>
            they may take delight in this. But children are <note type="margin">8. <lb/>
            Children a <lb/>
            bond of <lb/>
            union. </note><lb/>
            thought to be a bond; and therefore those who have <lb/>
            no children sooner separate ; for children are a <lb/>
            common good to both and that which is common <lb/>
            is a bond of union. But the inquiry how a man <lb/>
            is to live with his wife, and, in short, a friend with <lb/>
            his friend, is plainly in no respect different from <lb/>
            the inquiry, how it is just that they should : for the <lb/>
            case'is evidently not the same between friends, <lb/>
            as between strangers, companions, and fellow-tra­ <lb/>
            vellers.</p>

          <p>SINCE there are three kinds of friendship, as was <lb/>
             <lb/>
            said at the beginning of the book, and since in each <lb/>
            of them some are friends on an equality, and others <lb/>
            are in the relation of superiors to inferiors; (for <note type="footnote"> parents, children, kindred, and the whole circle of our domes­ <lb/>
            tic relations ; and, still extending, include all who are natives <lb/>
            of the same country with ourselves. And when we find that <lb/>
            he considered that even a slave, so far forth as he is a man, is <lb/>
            not without the pale of friendly regards, it is not improbable <lb/>
            that, though the men of his age were not capable of such <lb/>
            liberal philanthropy, still the philosopher could imagine the <lb/>
            existence of a brotherly kindness and affection wide enough to <lb/>
            comprehend the whole society of the human race. </note> <note type="footnote"> a 2 </note> <pb n="228"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK VIlI."/> <lb/>
            the good become friends, and the better become <lb/>
            friends with the worse : as also do the pleasant, and <lb/>
            those who are friends for the sake of the useful, <lb/>
            forming an equality by mutual benefits, although <lb/>
            they differ:) those who are equal ought to main­ <lb/>
            tain their equality, by equality in their love and <lb/>

            by one making a return proportionate to the supe­ <lb/>
            riority of the other party. Accusations and com­ <lb/>
            plaints arise in the friendship for the sake of the <lb/>
            useful, and in that only, or mostly so, as might be <lb/>
            expected ; for those who are friends for virtue's <lb/>
            sake, are anxious to benefit each other; for such is <lb/>
            the property of virtue and friendship ; and when <lb/>
            they are struggling for this, there are no com­ <lb/>
            plaints or quarrels; for no one dislikes one who <lb/>
            loves and benefits him ; but if he is a man of <lb/>
            refinement, he returns the kindness. And he who <lb/>
            is superior to the other, since he obtains what he <lb/>
            wants, cannot complain of his friend; for each is <lb/>
            aiming at the good.</p>
          <p><note type="chapter">3. </note> Nor do they arise at all in friendships formed <lb/>
            for the sake of pleasure ; for both parties obtain at <lb/>
            once what they want, if they take pleasure in <lb/>
            living together; and he would appear ridiculous, <lb/>
            who complained of another not giving him plea­ <lb/>
            sure, when it is in his power to cease to live with <note type="chapter">4. </note> <lb/>
            him. But the friendship for the sake of the useful <lb/>
            is fruitful in complaints; for since each makes use <lb/>
            of the other for his own benefit, they are con­ <lb/>
            stantly wanting the greater share, and think that <lb/>
            they have less than their due, and complain that <lb/>
            they do not receive as much as they want, although <lb/>
            they deserve it; and those who confer benefits can­ <lb/>
            not assist them as much as the receivers require.</p>

            useful, is partly moral and partly legal. Now com­ <lb/>
            plaints arise chiefly when men do not make a return <lb/>
            iu the same kind of friendship which they formed <pb n="229"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. XIII.]"/> <lb/>
            at first; now legal friendship is upon settled terms, <lb/>
            one kind of it altogether mercenary, from hand to <lb/>
            hand ; the other kind more liberal, as it allows time, <lb/>
            put it is still settled by mutual consent what return <lb/>
            is to be made : in this kind the obligation is evi­ <lb/>
            dent, and does not admit of dispute, but it allows a <lb/>
            friendly delay in the payment; hence in some <lb/>
            countries there are no actions at law allowed in <lb/>
            these cases, but it is thought that those who have <lb/>
            made any contract upon the faith of another, should <lb/>
            be satisfied with that.</p>
          <p>Moral friendship is not upon settled terms, but <note type="margin">6. <lb/>

            each party gives, or does anything else to the other <lb/>
            as to a friend. But he expects to receive what is <lb/>
            equal, or more, as if he had not given, but lent; <lb/>
            and if the contract is not fulfilled on the terms or <lb/>
            in the manner in which he made it, he will com­ <lb/>
            plain. This happens because all, or the greatest <lb/>
            number, wish what is honourable ; but upon deli­ <lb/>
            beration they choose what is profitable : now it is <lb/>
            honourable to confer benefits, not with the inten­ <lb/>

            received a kindness from one, from whom we <lb/>
            ought not; for we have not received it from a <lb/>
            friend, nor from one who conferred it for the sake <lb/>

            terms; and a man would be ready, if he had the <lb/>
            means, to repay the kindness ; and if he had not, <lb/>
            the giver would not even expect it. So that if he <lb/>
            is able, he must repay it : but he should consider <lb/>
            at first by whom he is benefited, and upon what <lb/>
            terms, in order that he may or not submit to the <lb/>
            obligation on these terms.</p>

            say that they have received such things from those <lb/>

            which they might have received from others, thus <lb/>
            depreciating the favour : the others, on the contrary, <lb/>
            say that they were the greatest favours they had to <lb/>
            bestow, and favours which could not have been re­ <lb/>
            ceived from any others, and that they were conferred <note type="chapter">9. </note> <lb/>
            in time of danger, or such like exigencies. Is not, <lb/>
            therefore, the benefit of the receiver the measure in <lb/>
            friendship for the sake of the useful? for he is <lb/>
            the person in want, and the other assists him, as if <lb/>
            hereafter to receive an equivalent: the assistance <lb/>
            therefore is as great as the benefit which the other <lb/>
            receives : and consequently he must repay as much <lb/>
            as the fruit which he has reaped from it, or more; <note type="margin">In friend­ <lb/>

            nerships those who contribute more, receive more, <lb/>
            so also it ought to be in friendship.</p>
          <p>But the needy and the worse character argue <note type="chapter">2 </note> <lb/>
            the contrary way ; for they say, that it is the duty <lb/>
            of a good friend to assist the needy; for what ad­ <lb/>
            vantage is there, they say, in being the friend of a <lb/>
            good or powerful man, if we are to reap no advan­ <lb/>
            tage from it ? Now, the. claim of each party seems <lb/>
            to be right, and it seems that each ought to give <lb/>
            to each a greater share out of the friendship, but <lb/>
            not of the same thing : but the superior should <lb/>
            receive a greater share of honour, the needy <lb/>
            greater share of gain; for honour is the reward cf <lb/>
            virtue and kindness, and gain is an assistance to <lb/>
            indigence. The case also is evidently the same in <note type="margin">3. <lb/>
            The rule <lb/>
            observed is <lb/>
            states. </note> <lb/>
            political communities; for he who confers no be­ <lb/>
            nefit on the community, is not honoured ; for that | <lb/>
            which is public property is given to the public <lb/>
            benefactor, and honour is public property. Now <lb/>
            we cannot receive both money and honour from <lb/>
            the public stock; for no one submits to a less <lb/>
            share of everything.gg Consequently to him who <lb/>
            is content with less money, the state gives honour; <lb/>
            and to him who prefers gifts, money; for propor­ <lb/>
            tion equalizes and preserves friendship, as has been <lb/>
            said.</p>
          <p>On these terms, then, must the unequal asso- <note type="margin">4. <lb/>

            consequently a father has. At the same time per­ <lb/>
            haps it would be thought that no father would <lb/>
            separate himself, unless the son were excessively <lb/>
            depraved ; for independently of the natural feeling <lb/>
            of affection, it is natural to man not to reject the <lb/>
            assistance which a son might afford; nevertheless, <lb/>
            if the son is depraved, he would avoid assisting <lb/>
            his father, or at least would not be anxious to do <lb/>
            so. For most men wish to receive benefits, and <lb/>

            shoemaker receives a return for his shoes according <lb/>
            to their value, and the weaver, and every one else. <lb/>
            In these instances a common measure is provided, <lb/>
            namely, money ; everything therefore is referred to <lb/>
            tIlls, and is measured by it. In the friendship of <note type="margin">2. <lb/>
            Complaints <lb/>
            may arise <lb/>
            from three <lb/>
            causes. </note> <lb/>
            love, the lover sometimes complains, that ahough <lb/>
            he loves exceedingly, he is not loved in return, <lb/>
            when it may happen that he possesses nothing <lb/>
            which can be the object of love : and frequently <lb/>
            the person loved complains, that the other having <lb/>
            promised everything at first, now performs nothing. <lb/>
            Such cases as this occur, when the lover loves the <lb/>
            beloved object for pleasure's sake, and the latter <lb/>
            loves the former for the sake of the useful, and <lb/>
            these qualifications do not exist in both. For as <note type="chapter">3. </note> <lb/>
            the friendship was formed on these motives, a sepa­ <lb/>
            ration takes place, as soon as ever they do not obtain <lb/>
            that for which they loved ; for it was not the per­ <lb/>
            sons that they loved, but something belonging to <lb/>
            them, which is not permanent; and therefore the <lb/>
            friendships are not permanent. But a friendship <lb/>
            founded upon moral character, as it is felt for its <lb/>
            own sake, continues, as has been stated.</p>
          <p>Differences also arise, when the parties receive <note type="chapter">4.</note><lb/>
            some other thing than that of which they were de­ <note type="footnote"> * In the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνομοειδέσι</foreign>, dissimilar in species, that is, <lb/>
            when two parties become friends. each from a different motive. </note> <pb n="234"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK IX."/> <unclear/><lb/>
            circus; for it is the same as getting nothing, when <lb/>
            they do not get what they desired. The case is like <lb/>
            that of him who made promises to the harper, and <lb/>
            the better he performed the more he promised; and <lb/>
            when in the morning he claimed the performance <lb/>
            of these promises, he said he had repaid him <lb/>
            pleasure for pleasure.b Now if each party had <lb/>
            wished this, it would have been sufficient; but if <lb/>
            the one wishes entertainment, the other gain, and <lb/>
            the one received what he wished, the other not,­ <lb/>
            the exchange cannot be fair. For each fixes his <lb/>
            mind on that which he happens to want, and for <note type="margin">5. <lb/>
            Who is to <lb/>
            fixthevalue. </note> <lb/>
            the sake of that will give what he does give. But <lb/>
            who is to fix the value ? the person who first <lb/>
            gives ? or he who first receives ? for he who gives, <lb/>
            seems to leave it to the other to fix the value : <lb/>
            which they say is what Protagoras did; for when <lb/>
            he gave any lessons, he ordered the learner to fix <lb/>
            how much he thought the knowledge was worth, <lb/>
            and so much he received. In such transactions, <lb/>
            some persons approve of the principle, "Let a <lb/>
            friend be content with a promised payment."—Hes. <note type="chapter">6. </note> <lb/>
            Op. et Di. v. 368. But those who receive the <lb/>
            money beforehand, and then perform none of their <lb/>
            promises, because they were so extravagant, are <lb/>
            with justice complained of; for they do not fulfil <lb/>
            their agreements. And this, perhaps, the So­ <lb/>
            phists are obliged to do, because no one would <lb/>
            give a piece of silver for what they know. These, <lb/>
            therefore, because they do not perform that for <lb/>
            which they received pay, are justly complained of.</p>
          <p><note type="chapter">7. </note> Whenever there is no agreement made about <lb/>
            the service performed, as has been stated, those <lb/>

            those who have intercourse with one another in, <lb/>

            measured by money, and no equivalent price can be <lb/>
            paid. But perhaps, as in the case of our duty to the <lb/>
            gods and our parents, that which is in our power is <lb/>
            sufficient.</p>
          <p>Where the act of giving is not of this kind, <note type="chapter">8. </note> <lb/>
            but for the sake of something, perhaps it is best <lb/>
            that a return should be made, which seems to <lb/>
            both parties to be proportionate. If this cannot <lb/>
            be, it would seem not only necessary that he who <lb/>
            first receives should settle it, but also just: for in <lb/>
            proportion to the benefit which one received, or to <lb/>
            the cost at which he would have purchased the <lb/>
            pleasure, will be the equivalent which the other <lb/>
            ought to receive in return ; for in things bought <lb/>
            and sold this seems to be done : and in some places <lb/>
            there are laws forbidding suits upon voluntary coil­ <lb/>
            tracts ; as if it was right, when we have trusted any <lb/>
            one, to settle with him, as we dealt with him ori­ <lb/>
            ginally : for they think that it is more just for him <lb/>
            to fix the value who was trusted, than for him <lb/>
            to do so who trusted him; for men do not in <lb/>
            general put the same value upon things which <lb/>
            they have received, as they did when they were <lb/>
            wishing to receive them ; for what belongs to us, <lb/>
            and what we give away, seems to each of us to <lb/>
            be very valuable. But, nevertheless, the return is <note type="margin">How the <lb/>

            though he has not been taken prisoner, but demands <lb/>
            payment as a debt ? or should he ransom his father <lb/>
            rather than the other ? for it would be thought that <lb/>
            lie ought to lansom his father even in preference <lb/>

            consideration ; for sometimes the making a return <lb/>

            when, for instance, the other conferred it, knowing <lb/>
            thai the person was good : but the latter has to <lb/>
            repay it to one whom he thinks wicked. For some- <note type="chapter">5. </note> <lb/>
            times a man must not lend in return to him who <lb/>
            lent to him ; for the latter, thinking that he should <lb/>
            be repaid, lent to him being a good man: but he <lb/>
            cannot hope to be repaid by a wicked man. If, then, <lb/>
            the circumstances are really such as I have stated, <lb/>
            the claim is not equal; or if they are not so really, <lb/>
            but the parties think that they are, it would not be <lb/>
            thought that they acted strangely. Therefore, as <lb/>
            we have frequently stated, assertions respecting <lb/>
            feelings and actions admit of exact definition only in <lb/>
            proportion to the object-matter.</p>
          <p>Now that we must not perform the same service <note type="chapter">G. </note> <lb/>
            to everybody, nay, even not to our father, in <lb/>
            the same manner that we do not sacrifice every­ <lb/>

            services are due to parents, and brothers, and com­ <lb/>
            panions, and benefactors, we must give to each their <lb/>
            own, and that which is suitable to them. In fact, <lb/>
            men seem to act in this way ; for they invite rela­ <lb/>
            tions to marriages, since the family to which they <lb/>
            belong is common to them, and consequently acts <lb/>
            which have to do with the family : and, for the <lb/>
            same reason, they think that it is more suitable for <lb/>
            relations than other persons to meet at funerals. <lb/>
            And it would seem that we ought to assist our <note type="chapter">7. </note> <lb/>
            parents, in preference to all other persons, in sup­ <lb/>
            porting them; being, as it were, their debtors; and <lb/>
            that it is more honourable to assist the authors of <lb/>
            our existence in'that respect than ourselves. We <lb/>
            should also give honour to our parents, as to the <lb/>
            gods ; but not every kind of honour; for we do not <lb/>
            give the same to father and mother : nor, again, <lb/>
            do we give a father the honour of the man of science, <lb/>
            or the general, but the honour of a father, and we <lb/>
            act in the same way in the case of a mother. We <note type="chapter">8. </note> <lb/>

            marks of respect. To companions and brothers we <lb/>

            every one else, we should always endeavour to <lb/>

            claims of each with respect to relationship, or virtue, <lb/>
            or acquaintance. Now, between relations the de­ <lb/>
            cision is easy; but between different people it is <lb/>
            more difficult: we should not, however, for that <lb/>

            only for those qualities, upon the failure of which it <note type="chapter">2. </note> <lb/>
            is natural to cease to feel friendship. But a man <lb/>
            might fairly complain if another, who loved him <lb/>
            really for the sake of the useful or the pleasant, pre­ <lb/>
            tended that it was on account of his character ; for, <lb/>
            as we stated at first, most differences in friendships <lb/>
            arise when the parties are not friends on the ground <lb/>
            on which they think they are. When, therefore, a <lb/>
            man is deceived, and has fancied that he was loved <lb/>
            for his character when the other did not at all act <lb/>
            as if it was so, he has himself to blame. But when <lb/>
            he is deceived by the profession of the other, he has <lb/>

            but only the good ? We are not obliged, then, to <lb/>
            love a wicked man, nor ought we; for we must <lb/>

            admit of improvement in character than in property, <lb/>
            inasmuch as it is better, and belongs more peculiarly <lb/>

            friendship would not be thought to do anything <lb/>
            extraordinary; for it was not such an one as he, <lb/>

            or, one who sympathizes in joy and sorrow with <lb/>

            How the <lb/>

            is affected <lb/>
            towards <lb/>
            himself. </note> <lb/>
            towards himself; and in all others, so far forth as <lb/>
            they fancy themselves to be good ; for virtue and <lb/>
            the virtuous man seem, as has been stated, to be <lb/>
            a standard to each ; since he agrees in opinion <lb/>
            with himself, and desires the same things with all <lb/>
            his soul. Hence, he wishes for himself what is <lb/>
            good, or what appears so, and practises it; for <lb/>
            it is characteristic of the good man to labour for <lb/>
            what is good, and for his own sake; for it is <lb/>
            for the sake of his intellectual part, which is <lb/>
            thought to constitute each man's self.i Again, he <note type="chapter">3. </note> <lb/>
            wishes himself to live and be preserved, and parti­ <lb/>
            cularly that part by which he thinks : for existence <lb/>
            is a good to the virtuous man: and each one wishes <lb/>
            good to himself; and no one, were he to become <lb/>
            another person, would wish his former self to possess <lb/>
            everything : for the Deity now possesses the chief <lb/>
            good; but he possesses it because he is what he <lb/>
            is. And the thinking principle-or at least that <lb/>
            rather than any other principle-must be taken to <lb/>
            be each man's self. Again, such a man wishes to <note type="chapter">A. </note> <lb/>
            pass his life with himself; for he docs this pleasantly <lb/>
            to himself; since the recollection of the past is <lb/>
            pleasant, and the hopes of the future are good ; but <lb/>
            such recollections and hopes are pleasant. More­ <lb/>
            over, he has abundant subjects for his intellect to <lb/>

            the good man having all these feelings towards <lb/>
            himself, and feeling towards his friend as he does <lb/>
            towards himself (for Ills friend is another self), <lb/>
            friendship also is thought to consist in some one ot <lb/>

            whom they reside.</p>
          <p><note type="chapter">6. </note> But as to the question whether there is or is not <lb/>
            friendship towards one's self, let it be dismissed for <lb/>
            the present. But friendship may be thought to <lb/>
            exist in this case, inasmuch as it is one in which <lb/>
            there are two or more of the above-mentioned qua­ <lb/>

            feelings spoken of, however, plainly exist in many, <lb/>
            although they are bad men. Do they, then, partake <lb/>

            and suppose themselves to be good ? for assuredly <lb/>

            again, from cowardice and indolence, abstain from <lb/>
            doing what they think best for themselves. As for <lb/>
            those who have committed many atrocious crimes <lb/>

            forget them; and since they possess no amiable qua­ <lb/>
            lities, they have no friendly feeling towards them­ <lb/>
            selves. Therefore, such men do not sympathize <note type="chapter">v. </note> <lb/>
            with themselves in joy or sorrow ; for their soul is <lb/>
            divided, as it were, by faction, and one part from <lb/>
            depravity feels pain, because it abstains from some­ <lb/>
            thing, while the other part feels pleasure; and one <lb/>
            draws him this way, another that, just as if they <lb/>
            were dragging him asunder. But though it is im­ <lb/>
            possible to feel pain and pleasure at the same time, <lb/>
            yet after a little time he feels pain at having been <lb/>
            pleased, and wishes that these things had not been <lb/>
            pleasant to him; for bad men are full of repent­ <lb/>
            ance. It is plain, then, -that the bad man has no <lb/>
            friendly disposition even to himself, because he has <lb/>
            in him nothing amiable. If, then, such' n condition <lb/>
            as this is excessively wretched, he should anxiously <lb/>
            flee from wickedness, and strive to be good; for <lb/>
            by this means a man may have friendly feelings <lb/>
            towards himself, and become a friend of another.</p>

            we do not know, and without their being aware of <lb/>
            it; but friendship is not: all this has been said <lb/>
            before. Nor yet is it affection ; for good-will has <lb/>
            no intensity, nor desire : but both of these accom­ <lb/>

            but good-will may be sudden; as comes to pass in <lb/>
            the case of antagonists; for we wish them well, and <lb/>
            partake in their wishes, but we would not assist <lb/>
            them at all; for, as we have stated, we feel good­ <lb/>

            then, to be the beginning of friendship : in the same <lb/>
            manner as the pleasure derived from sight is too <note type="footnote"> n 3 </note> <pb n="244"/>

            not necessarily in love, except he longs for the <lb/>
            object when absent, and desires its presence. In <lb/>
            the same manner, then, it is impossible to be friends <lb/>
            without good-will. But those who have it are not <lb/>
            necessarily friends; for they only wish good to those­ <lb/>
            for whom they have good-will; but they would not <lb/>

            becomes friendship, but not that for the sake of the <lb/>
            useful or the agreeable: for good-will is not pro­ <lb/>
            duced by those motives. For he who has received <lb/>
            a benefit, returns good-will for what he has received, <lb/>
            therein acting justly : but he who wishes any one to <lb/>

            his means, appears to be well-disposed, not to that <lb/>

            manner as he is not a friend, if he pays attention <note type="chapter">5. </note> <lb/>
            to him for the sake of some advantage. Upon the <lb/>
            whole, good-will arises on account of virtue, or some <lb/>
            goodness, when any one is seen to be honourable, <lb/>
            or manly, or something of that kind : as we have <lb/>

          <p>Consequently, men have unanimity upon practical <note type="chapter">2. </note> <lb/>
            matters; and amongst these, upon those which are <lb/>
            important, and which are of mutual or common <lb/>
            interest; for instance, states are unanimous when <lb/>
            all agree that the magistrates should be elected, <lb/>
            or that alliance should be made with Sparta, or <lb/>
            that Pittacus should be Archon, when he wished <lb/>

            that each party should conceive the same idea, <lb/>
            whatever it may be, but that their conceptions <lb/>
            should fix upon the same object: for instance, when <lb/>
            both the people and the better part agree for an <lb/>
            aristocracy ; for thus all obtain what they desire.</p>
          <p>Unanimity then is plainly political friendship, as <note type="margin">4. <lb/>

            for these are of one mind both with themselves and <lb/>

            the public interest, it is sacrificed. The result, <lb/>
            therefore, is that they quarrel, using force to one <lb/>

            as though this were contrary to what we might <lb/>
            expect, it is made a subject of inquiry. Now, the <lb/>
            opinion of the generality is, that the one party are <lb/>
            debtors, and the other creditors; consequently, in <lb/>
            the same manner as in the case of debts, the debtors <lb/>
            wish their creditors not to live, but those who have <lb/>
            lent are careful for the health of their debtors; so <lb/>
            also they think that those who have conferred <lb/>

            though in that case they would receive them back <lb/>
            again, while the other party does not care about <lb/>
            repaying them.</p>
          <p><note type="chapter">3. </note> Now, Epicharmus perhaps would say that they <lb/>
            hold this language, because they look to the bad <lb/>

            nature; for the generality are forgetful, and are <lb/>
            more desirous of receiving than conferring benefits. <lb/>
            But the real reason it would appear is more natural, <lb/>
            and the case does not resemble that of lenders; for <pb n="247"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. VII.]"/> <lb/>
            they have no fondness towards the other party, <lb/>
            but only a wish for their preservation, for the sake <lb/>
            of receiving a return.</p>
          <p>Those who have conferred favours, are fond of <note type="margin">4. <lb/>
            Why bene­ <lb/>
            factors love <lb/>
            more than <lb/>
            those who <lb/>
            receive. </note> <lb/>
            and love those who have received them, even if they <lb/>
            neither are, nor are likely to be, useful to them: <lb/>
            which also is the case with workmen; for every one <lb/>
            loves his own work, more than he could be loved <lb/>
            by the work, were it to become animated. This <lb/>
            perhaps is most the case with poets ; for they love <lb/>
            their own poems above measure, having a parental <lb/>
            affection for them. Such then seems to be the case <note type="chapter">5. </note> <lb/>
            of benefactors; for he who has received a kindness <lb/>
            is a work of theirs; consequently they love him <lb/>
            more than the work loves the producer of it. The <lb/>
            reason of this is, that existence is an object of <lb/>
            choice and love to all; but we exist by energy; for <lb/>
            we exist by living and acting. He then who has <lb/>
            produced a work, in a certain sense exists by the <lb/>
            energy ; hence he loves the work, because he loves <lb/>
            his own existence. But this is natural; for the <lb/>
            work shows by energy that which existed only in <lb/>
            power.</p>
          <p>At the same time, also, the result of the action is <note type="chapter">6 </note> <lb/>
            honourable to the benefactor, so that he takes plea­ <lb/>
            sure in the person in whom that exists : but to the <lb/>
            receiver there is nothing honourable in relation to­ <lb/>
            lus benefactor; but if there is anything, it is ad­ <lb/>
            vantage : and this is less agreeable, and less an <lb/>
            object of love. In the case of a present act, the <lb/>
            energy is pleasant; in that of a future act, the <lb/>
            hope ; in that of a past act, the memory : but the <lb/>
            pleasure resulting from the energy is the greatest, <lb/>
            and most an object of love, To the benefactor, <note type="chapter">7. </note> <lb/>
            therefore, the work continues; for that which is <lb/>
            honourable, is permanent : but as regards the re­ <lb/>
            ceiver, the useful soon passes away. The recollection <lb/>
            also of honourable things is pleasant; but of useful <lb/>
            things, Dot generally so, or in a less degree. The <lb/>
            expectation, however, of advantage seems to be the <lb/>
            contrary of this.</p><pb n="248"/>
            
          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK IX."/> <note type="chapter">8. </note> The feeling of affection also resembles produc­ <lb/>
            tion ; but the being loved is like something <lb/>
            passive; those, therefore, who are superior in the <lb/>
            active conferring of a kindness, love, and all the <lb/>
            feelings of friendship accompany. Again, all feel <lb/>
            greater love for what they have acquired with <lb/>
            labour; as those who have earned their money: <lb/>
            love it more than those who have inherited it. <lb/>
            Now, to receive favours seems to be without labour; <lb/>
            but to confer them is laborious. For this reason <lb/>
            also mothers are more fond of their children than <lb/>
            fathers are; for the bringing them forth is more <lb/>
            painful, and they feel more convinced that they are <lb/>
            their own.n The same also would seem peculiarly to <lb/>
            belong to benefactors.</p>

            "The mother loves her child more than the father ; <lb/>
            For she knows it is hers, he only thinks so." </note><note type="footnote"> ° The preface to Bishop Butler's Sermons, as well as the <lb/>
            first and eleventh sermons, furnish a valuable commentary on <lb/>
            the place which a reasonable self-love occupies amongst moral <lb/>
            duties, its relation to benevolence or the love of others, and <lb/>
            the difference between it and selfishness, which are often con­ <lb/>
            fused one with the other. " Self-love," says Bishop Butler, <lb/>
            " in its due degree, is as just and morally good, as any <lb/>
            affection whatever." " Benevolence is so perfectly coincident <lb/>
            with it, that the greatest satisfaction to ourselves depends upon <lb/>
            our having benevolence in a due degree : and self-love is one <lb/>
            chief security of our right behaviour towards society." How <lb/>
            consistent is this view with HIS doctrines, who has made re­ <lb/>
            gard to ourselves the standard by which to measure our love <lb/>
            to others, and has said. " Thou shalt love thy neighbour as <lb/>

            it were disgraceful, we call them selfish. The bad <lb/>
            man also seems to do everything for his own sake, <lb/>
            and the more so the more wicked he is. They <lb/>
            therefore complain of him, as doing nothing without <lb/>

            he acts from honourable motives, and for his friend's <lb/>
            sake; and he passes over his own interest. But <lb/>
            facts are at variance with these remarks, and that. <lb/>
            not unreasonably : for it is a common saying, that <lb/>
            a man should love his greatest friend best. Now <lb/>
            he is the best friend, who wishes another good <lb/>
            for that person's sake, even if nobody knows it; <lb/>
            but this and every other feeling which enters <lb/>
            into the definition of a friend, exists most of <lb/>
            all in a man with regard to himself; for we have <lb/>
            stated, that from himself proceed all the feelings <lb/>

            the shin : " for all these feelings exist mostly with <lb/>
            reference to a man's self; for he is the best friend <lb/>
            to himself; and therefore he must love himself <lb/>
            best.</p>
          <p>But the question is reasonably asked, which of <note type="chapter">4. </note> <lb/>
            these two must we follow, since both seem worthy <lb/>
            of credit ? Perhaps, then, we should divide and dis­ <lb/>
            tinguish such conclusions as these, and show how <lb/>
            far, and in what respect (ach is true. If, then, we <lb/>
            can understand in what. sense each uses the word <lb/>

            therefore, who use it as a reproach, call those men <lb/>
            self-lovers, who give tothemselves the greater share of <lb/>
            money, or honour, or bodily pleasures ; for the gene­ <lb/>

            anxious about them, as if they were the best <lb/>
            things; whence, also, they are objects of con­ <lb/>
            tention. Those, therefore, who are covetous of these <lb/>
            things, gratify their desires, and, in short, their <pb n="250"/>

            the generality are of this kind : whence, also, the <lb/>
            appellation has arisen, from the generality, which <lb/>
            are bad. Consequently reproach is justly cast upon <lb/>
            those who are selfish in this sense. But that the <lb/>
            generality are accustomed to call those self-lovers, <lb/>
            who give such things as these to themselves, is <note type="margin">The self- <lb/>

            motives. </note> <lb/>
            quite plain. For if any one is constantly anxious <lb/>

            accordance with virtue, and in short is always for <lb/>

            would call such a man a self-lover, nor blame him.</p>
          <p><note type="margin">7. <lb/>
            Why the <lb/>
            good man <lb/>

            be more than any other a self-lover; for he gives <lb/>
            to himself what is most honourable, and the <lb/>
            greatest goods, and gratifies the authoritative part <lb/>
            of himself, and obeys it in everything. And as <lb/>
            that part, which has most authority, seems especially <lb/>
            to constitute the state, and every other system, so <lb/>
            it constitutes a man ; and therefore he who loves <lb/>
            this part and gratifies it, is especially a self-lover. <note type="chapter">8. </note> <lb/>
            So also a man is called continent or incontinent. <lb/>
            according as the intellect has authority or not, as if <lb/>
            this constituted each individual. And men think <lb/>
            that what they do with reason, they do themselves, <lb/>
            and voluntarily, more than any other things. That <lb/>
            this, therefore, especially constitutes the individual, <lb/>
            is quite plain, and that the good man especially <lb/>
            loves this. Therefore he must be especially a <lb/>
            self-lover, after a different manner from the person <lb/>
            who is reproached for it, and differing in as great a <lb/>
            degree, as living in obedience to reason differs from <lb/>
            living in obedience to passion, and as desiring the <lb/>
            honourable differs from desiring what seems to be <lb/>
            advantageous.</p>

            Why the <lb/>
            good man <lb/>
            ought to <lb/>
            have self- <lb/>
            love. </note> Now, all approve of and praise those who are <lb/>
            particularly earnest about performing honourable <lb/>
            actions : and if all contended for what is honour­ <lb/>
            able, and strove to perform the most honourable <lb/>
            acts, there would be to every one generally what is <pb n="251"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. VIII.]"/> <lb/>
            right and proper, and to each individually the <lb/>
            greatest goods ;at least if virtue is such as we have <lb/>
            described it. So that the good man must neces- <note type="chapter">10. </note> <lb/>
            sarily be a self-lover ; for he will be delighted in <lb/>
            performing honourable acts himself, and will benefit <lb/>
            others. But the wicked man ought to be so : for <lb/>
            he injures both himself and his neighbours, by fol­ <lb/>
            lowing evil passions. To the wicked man, therefore, <lb/>
            what he ought to do, and what he does, are at <lb/>
            variance; but the good man does what he ought to <lb/>
            do : for all intellect chooses what is best for itself; <lb/>
            and the good man obeys his intellect. It is true <note type="chapter">II. </note> <lb/>
            also of the good man, that he performs many acts tor <lb/>
            his friends and his country, nay, even if it is his duty <lb/>
            to die for them : for he will give up money and <lb/>
            honours, and, in short, all the good things which <lb/>
            others contend for, if he can secure to himself that <lb/>
            which is honourable. For he would prefer being <lb/>
            pleased for a short time exceedingly, than for a long <lb/>
            time slightly; and to live one year honourably, <lb/>
            than many years in the ordinary manner; and to <lb/>
            perform one honourable and great act, rather than <lb/>
            many small ones. Those who die for their coun- <note type="chapter">12. </note> <lb/>
            try, this perhaps actually befalls: they choose <lb/>
            something highly honourable for themselves, and <lb/>
            they would give up money on condition that <lb/>
            their friends should receive more of it: for the <lb/>
            friend receives the money, and he himself the <lb/>
            honour; so he gives the greater good to himself <lb/>
            The same rule holds good with respect to honour­ <lb/>
            able distinctions and offices; for he gives up all <lb/>
            these to his friend; since this is honourable to <lb/>
            himself and praiseworthy. With reason, then, he <lb/>
            is thought to be a good man, for choosing what <lb/>
            is honourable in preference to everything else. It <lb/>
            is possible, also, that he may give up the perform­ <lb/>
            ance of these actions to his friend, and that it may <lb/>
            be more honourable for him to be the cause of a <lb/>
            friend's doing a thing, than to do it himself. In all <note type="chapter">is. </note> <lb/>

          <p><note type="chapter">1. </note> BUT a question also arises about the happy man, <lb/>
            whether he will need friends or no : for it is com­ <lb/>
            monly said that those who are prosperous and inde­ <lb/>
            pendent, do not need friends, since they have all <lb/>
            goods already, and therefore that, being indepen- <note type="margin">Why the <lb/>
            happy man <lb/>
            needs <lb/>
            friends. </note> <lb/>
            dent, they require nothing more ; but that a friend, <lb/>
            being another self, provides what a man is unable <lb/>
            to provide of himself. Hence comes the saying,— <lb/>
            When fortune gives us good, what need of friends ? <note type="chapter">2. </note> <lb/>
            And yet it seems an absurdity to attribute all goods <lb/>
            to the happy man, and yet not to give him friends, <lb/>
            which are thought to be the greatest of all external <lb/>
            goods. And it it is more the part of a friend to <lb/>
            confer than to receive favours, and to do good is <lb/>
            characteristic of a good man and of virtue, and it is <lb/>
            more honourable to benefit friends than strangers, <lb/>
            the good man will want some persons to be bene- <note type="chapter">3. </note> <lb/>
            fited. Hence it has also been asked, whether there <lb/>
            is a greater need of friends in adversity or pros­ <lb/>
            perity : as in adversity we want persons to benefit <lb/>
            us, so in prosperity we want persons whom we <note type="chapter">4. </note> <lb/>
            may benefit. And it is perhaps absurd to make <lb/>
            the happy man a solitary being; for no one <lb/>
            would choose to possess all goods by himself; <lb/>
            since man is a social being, and formed by nature <lb/>
            to associate : this, therefore, is the case with the <lb/>
            happy man; for he possesses whatever is by nature <lb/>
            a good. But it is evident that it is better to pass <lb/>
            our time , with friends and good men, than with <lb/>
            strangers and anybody indiscriminately. The happy <lb/>
            men. therefore, wants friends.</p><pb n="253"/>

            The happy <lb/>
            man does <lb/>
            not need <lb/>

            friends. </note> <lb/>
            and how far do they speak truth ? is it not that <lb/>
            the generality consider those only to be friends <lb/>
            who are useful ? The happy man will have no <lb/>
            need of such friends as these, since he is in posses­ <lb/>
            sion of all goods; nor, consequently, of those who <lb/>
            are friends for the sake of the pleasant, or only in a <lb/>
            small degree; for his life being pleasant, does not <lb/>
            require any adventitious pleasure. But since he <note type="margin">Nor plea­ <lb/>

            does not require such friends a 3 these, he has been <lb/>
            thought not to require friends at alL This per­ <lb/>
            haps is not true ; for it was stated at the begin­ <lb/>
            ning that happiness is a kind of energy : and an <lb/>
            energy is evidently produced, not merely possessed, <lb/>
            like property. And if happiness consists in living <note type="margin">but virtuous <lb/>
            friends. </note> <lb/>
            and energizing, and the energy of the good man is <lb/>
            good and pleasant in itself, as was stated at the <lb/>
            beginning; and if that which peculiarly belongs to <lb/>
            us is of the number of pleasant things, and we can <lb/>
            contemplate others better than we can ourselves, and <lb/>
            their actions better than our own, then the actions <lb/>
            of good men, when they are their friends, are pleasant <lb/>
            to the good; for both possess what is naturally <note type="margin">Why so. </note> <lb/>
            pleasant; and consequently the happy man will <lb/>
            want such friends as these, if he deliberately prefers <lb/>
            to contemplate virtuous actions, and those which <lb/>
            are peculiarly his own. And the actions of the <note type="chapter">7- </note> <lb/>
            good man are such, when he is his friend. But it <lb/>
            is thought that the happy man ought to live plea­ <lb/>
            santly. Now, to a solitary person life is burthen­ <lb/>
            some : for it is not easy to energize constantly by <lb/>
            one's self, but with and in relation to others it is <lb/>
            easy. The energy, therefore, will be more conti­ <lb/>
            nuous when it is pleasant in itself, which ought to <lb/>
            be the case with the happy man; for the good man, <lb/>
            so far forth as he is good, takes delight in actions <lb/>
            according to girtue, and feels pain at those which <lb/>
            are according to vice: just as the musician is <lb/>
            pleased with beautiful melodies, but feels pain <lb/>
            at bad ones. And -there may be a kind of prac- <pb n="254"/>

            it appears probable that the. good friend is by <lb/>
            nature an object of choice to the good man ; for it <lb/>
            has been stated, that what is good by nature, is in <lb/>
            itself good and pleasant to the good man. But <lb/>
            life is defined to consist, in animals, in the faculty <lb/>
            of sensation, and in men, of sensation and intelli­ <lb/>
            gence and the faculty is referred to the energy, <note type="chapter">9. </note> <lb/>
            and properly consists in the energy. Life, then, <lb/>
            seems to be properly the exercise of sensation or <lb/>
            intellect; and life is one of the things which are <lb/>
            good and pleasant absolutely; for it is something <lb/>
            definite ; and that which is definite partakes of <lb/>
            the nature of the good ;r and that which is a <lb/>
            good by nature, is a good also to the good man: <lb/>
            and therefore it seems to be pleasant to all.</p>
          <p><note type="chapter">10. </note> But we must not take a depraved and corrupt <lb/>
            life, nor one passed in sorrow; for such a life as <lb/>
            this is indefinite, just as the circumstances belong­ <lb/>
            in,-,, to it are ; which will be more evident in what <lb/>
            is to follow upon the subject of pain. But if life <note type="margin">Conscious­ <lb/>

            some faculty which perceives that we are energizing; <lb/>
            so that we perceive that we are perceiving, and <lb/>
            understand that we are understanding. But this is <lb/>
            the same as saying that we perceive or understand <lb/>
            that we exist: for existence was defined to be per­ <lb/>
            ceiving, or understanding. Now, to perceive that one <note type="chapter">12 <lb/>
            </note>is alive, is of the number of those things which are <lb/>
            pleasant in themselves: for life is a good by nature: <lb/>
            and to perceive the good which is inherent in one's <lb/>
            self is pleasant. But life is eligible, and particu­ <lb/>
            larly to the good, because existence is to them good <lb/>
            and pleasant; for by the consciousness of that <lb/>
            which is absolutely a -rood they are pleased.</p>
          <p>Now, the good man has the same relation to his <note type="chapter">13. </note> <lb/>
            friend as he has to himself; for a friend is another <lb/>
            self , in the same manner, therefore, as to exist one's <lb/>
            self is eligible to every. one, so also is it for one's <lb/>
            friend to exist, or nearly so. But existence was said <lb/>
            to be eligible on account of the perception of that <lb/>
            which is a good : and such a perception is pleasant <lb/>

            tween a man and his friend is the same as that between him <lb/>
            and another self. He is to love his friend as himself. The <lb/>
            enjoyments of friendship are derived from as clear a conscious­ <lb/>
            ness of our friend's existence as we have of our own. The <lb/>
            nourishment and support of friendship are intercourse, asso­ <lb/>
            ciation, communion. Carry these principles a little further to <lb/>
            their legitimate conclusion, and to what important results do <lb/>
            they lead! Self-knowledge and the satisfaction of an approv­ <lb/>
            in.- conscience are the result of self-communion. Friendship, <lb/>
            or, to speak more properly, love to God, is kept up by that <lb/>
            intimate and close communion which the Christian is en­ <lb/>

            and pleasant, and if the existence of a friend is <lb/>
            nearly the same, then a friend must also be of the <lb/>
            number of eligible things. But that which is <lb/>
            eligible to a man, he ought to possess; or else he <lb/>
            is deficient in that respect; he, therefore, that is to <lb/>

            have too many. The saying would seem to be <lb/>
            suitable altogether to those who are friends for the <lb/>
            sake of the useful: for it is troublesome to make a <lb/>
            return of favours to a great many, and life is not <lb/>
            long enough to do it. Consequently, more than <lb/>
            what are sufficient for each particular kind of life, <lb/>
            are superfluous, and an impediment to living well, <note type="margin">3. <lb/>

            Virtuous <lb/>

            a few friends for pleasure's sake are enough ; like <lb/>

            good, should we have as great a number as possible? <lb/>
            or is there some limit to number in friendship, as <lb/>
            there is in a political community ; for neither can <lb/>
            there be a political community composed of ten <lb/>
            people, nor is it any longer a political community <lb/>
            when composed of a hundred thousand :t but the <note type="footnote"> t This limitation of the number of persons constituting a <lb/>
            political community may at first appear strange to us, who are <lb/>
            accustomed to the large and populous communities of modern <lb/>
            times; but we must remember how very small was the num. </note> <pb n="257"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. X.J"/> <lb/>
            quantity is not perhaps some particular number. <lb/>
            but only one between certain fixed limits. In the <note type="chapter">4 </note> <lb/>
            case of friends, therefore, there is also some definite <lb/>
            number; and perhaps it is the greatest number with <lb/>
            whom one can associate ; for this was thought to be <lb/>
            the greatest sign of friendship. But that it is not <lb/>
            possible for the same person to associate and con­ <lb/>
            tinue in friendship with many, is plain. Besides, <lb/>
            these must also be friends to each other, if all <lb/>
            intend to pass their time with each other ; and <lb/>
            this is difficult in the case of a great number. It <lb/>
            is also difficult to sympathize in pleasures and pains <lb/>
            with many people ; for it is likely to happen at the <lb/>
            same time, that a man may be rejoicing with one <lb/>
            friend, and grieving with another.</p>
          <p>Perhaps, then, it is as well not to seek to have as <note type="chapter">5. </note> <lb/>
            many friends as possible, but only as many as are <lb/>
            sufficient for society ; for it would seem impossible <lb/>
            to be a very strong friend to many; Hence, also, <lb/>
            it is impossible to be in love with many ; for love <lb/>
            is a kind of excess in friendship : and it is felt <lb/>
            towards one object ; and therefore excess in it can <lb/>
            only be felt towards a few. So it seems to be in <note type="chapter">6. </note> <lb/>
            real tact: tor in friendship between companions, <lb/>
            many do not become friends; and those friend­ <lb/>

            only.u Those who have many friends, and are <lb/>

            be friends, except in a political sense ;v and these <lb/>
            are called men-pleasers. In the above sense, then, <lb/>
            a man may be a friend to many, even without being <lb/>
            a man-pleaser, but really as a good man : but for <note type="footnote"> her of enfranchised citizens, in even the largest of the Grecian <lb/>

            want persons to live with and to benefit; for they <lb/>
            wish to do good. It is more necessary to have <lb/>
            them in adversity; whence in adversity there is <lb/>
            need of useful friends; but it is more honourable <lb/>
            to have them in prosperity ; whence also the pros­ <lb/>
            perous seek for good friends ; since it is more <lb/>
            desirable to benefit the good, and to live with them. <lb/>
            Besides, the very presence of friends is pleasant <note type="chapter">2. </note> <lb/>
            both in prosperity and adversity ; for those who are <lb/>
            in pain feel relieved when their friends sympathize <lb/>
            with them. ' Hence one might' ask the question, <lb/>
            whether they as it were share the burthen ; or <lb/>
            whether perhaps it is not that, but that their pre­ <lb/>
            sence being pleasant, and the idea -of sympathy, <lb/>
            make the pain less. Whether they feel relieved <lb/>
            from this or any other cause, let us dismiss from <lb/>
            our consideration ; but what we stated is evidently <lb/>
            the fact.</p>
          <p><note type="chapter">5. </note> The presence of friends seems in a manner to <lb/>
            cause a mixed feeling ; for the fact of seeing friends <lb/>
            is pleasant, and particularly to one in misfortune, <lb/>
            and it'becomes a kind of assistance, so'as to prevent <lb/>
            pain : since the sight and conversation of a friend <lb/>
            is able to comfort us, if he has tact; for he knows the <lb/>
            character of his friend, and what things give him <lb/>
            pleasure and pain. But to perceive one's friend <lb/>
            feeling pain at one's own misfortunes, is painful; <pb n="259"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. XI.]"/> <lb/>
            for every one avoids being the cause of pain to his <lb/>
            friends. Therefore, those who are of a manly <note type="chapter"> 4. </note> <lb/>
            disposition are cautious how they let their friends <lb/>
            share their pain ; and unless a person is himself <lb/>
            without sensibility, he cannot endure that his friends <lb/>
            should feel pain on his account: nor does he at all <lb/>
            call in fellow-mourners, because he is not given to <lb/>
            mourning himself But women and effeminate men <lb/>
            delight in having people to mourn with them, and <lb/>
            love them as friends and partners in affliction. But <lb/>
            in every case we ought of course to imitate the <lb/>
            best.</p>
          <p>The presence of friends in prosperity makes us <note type="chapter">5. </note> <lb/>
            pass our time pleasantly, and makes us conscious <lb/>
            that our friends are feeling pleasure at our good. <lb/>
            Therefore, it would seem that we ought to invite <note type="margin">In pros <lb/>

            should be <lb/>

            but to share our adversity, we should invite them with <lb/>
            reluctance, for we ought to share our misfortunes as <lb/>
            little as possible : whence the saying,- <lb/>
            It is enough that I myself am unfortunate.</p>
          <p>We should call them in especially, when they. <note type="chapter">G. </note> <lb/>
            may render us great assistance, with a little trouble. <lb/>
            We should perhaps, on the contrary, go to those <lb/>
            who are in misfortune, without being called in, and <lb/>
            with alacrity.. For it becomes a friend to confer <lb/>
            benefits, and particularly upon those who are in <lb/>
            need, and did not ask it as a right: for in both <lb/>
            cases it is more bonourablé and pleasant: but to <lb/>
            those who are in prosperity, if it is to co-operato <lb/>
            with them, we should go willingly ; for this is the <lb/>
            use of a friend: but if it is to enjoy their'good <lb/>
            fortune, we should go reluctantly; for it is not <lb/>
            honourable to be anxious to receive assistance. <lb/>
            But perhaps we must guard against appearing un­ <lb/>
            gracious in our refusal; for this sometimes takes <lb/>
            place. The presence of friends, then, is necessary <lb/>
            under all circumstances. <note type="footnote"> S2 </note> <pb n="260"/>

            origin, so also society is most desirable to friends ? <lb/>
            for friendship is communion. And as we feel <lb/>
            towards ourselves, so do we towards our friends; <lb/>
            and with respect to ourselves, the perception of <lb/>
            existence is desirable ; it is the same, therefore, <note type="chapter">2. </note> <lb/>
            with respect to our friends. But the energy of <lb/>
            friendship consists in society; so that it is with <lb/>
            reason that friends are desirous of it. And in <lb/>
            whatever each thinks that existence consists, or <lb/>
            on whate ver account they choose life, in this they <note type="chapter">3. </note> <lb/>
            wish to I ass their time with their friends. Hence, <lb/>
            some drink together, some dice together, others <lb/>

            the friendship of bad men becomes depraved: for <lb/>
            they partake of what is bad, being unstable ; and <lb/>

            is pleasure ; for it seems above everything else to <lb/>

            we educate the young, steering them, as it were, by <lb/>
            pleasure and pain. It seems also to be of the <lb/>
            greatest consequence towards laying the foundation <lb/>
            of the moral character, that men should take <lb/>
            delight in what they ought, and hate what they <lb/>
            ought; for these feelings continue throughout life, <lb/>
            carrying with them great weight and influence <lb/>
            on the side of virtue and a happy life; for men <lb/>
            deliberately choose what is pleasant, and avoid <lb/>
            what is painful.</p>
          <p>It would seem, then, that we ought by no means <note type="chapter">3. </note> <lb/>

            censures pleasure is ever seen to be desiring it, he <lb/>
            appears to have a leaning towards it, as if all plea­ <lb/>
            sure were of the same nature ; for to draw nice <lb/>
            distinctions is not the character of the multitude. b <lb/>
            True statements, therefore, seem not only to be the <lb/>
            most useful for obtaining knowledge; but also for <lb/>
            the regulation of life ; for when they agree with <lb/>
            facts, they are believed. Hence, men exhort those <lb/>
            who understand them to live according to them. <lb/>
            Enough, then, of such matters : let us now ename­ <lb/>
            rate the doctrines which have been held on the <lb/>
            subject of pleasure.</p>

            The argu­ <lb/>

            Eudoxus to </note> EUDOXUS c thought that pleasure was the chief <lb/>

            the pursuit of pleasure, even of an innocent kind, his argu­ <lb/>
            ments are ineffectual, aud his warnings are unheeded, because <lb/>
            the mass of mankind are unable to draw nice distinctions, and <lb/>
            to distinguish between lawful and unlawful pleasures. </note><note type="footnote"> c Eudoxus was a native of Cnidus, who flourished about <lb/>
            01. c. iui. (B. C. 366). He was a disciple of the geometrician <lb/>
            Archytas, and subsequently of Plato, by whom he was accom­ <lb/>
            panied in his travels to Egypt: He was the author of a work <lb/>

            pleasure <lb/>
            was the <lb/>

            First <lb/>
            argument. </note> <lb/>
            so is the gr eatest good ; consequently, he considered <lb/>
            that the fact of all having a bias towards the same <lb/>
            object proved that object to be the best for all; <lb/>
            because each finds what is good for himself, as he <lb/>
            does food ; he argued, therefore, that what is good <lb/>
            to all, and what all aim at; was the chief good.</p>
          <p>And his words were believed, more from the <note type="margin">2. <lb/>
            His cha­ <lb/>
            racter. </note> <lb/>
            excellence of his moral character than for their <lb/>
            own sake; for he had the reputation of being <lb/>
            eminently temperate : it was therefore thought <lb/>
            that he did not use, this language as being a friend <lb/>
            to pleasure, but that the case really was so. But <note type="margin">3. <lb/>
            Second <lb/>
            argument. </note> <lb/>
            he considered this doctrine to be no less evident <lb/>
            from considering the contrary of pleasure; for pain <lb/>
            is in itself an object shunned by all, and its contrary <lb/>
            is, in the same manner, an object chosen by all; <lb/>
            and that is especially an object of choice, which we <note type="margin">Third <lb/>
            argument. </note> <lb/>
            choose, not on account of anything else ; but plea­ <lb/>
            sure is confessedly of this nature ; for no one asks <lb/>
            for the sake of what he is pleased, as though he <lb/>
            knew-that pleasure was eligible on its own account ; <lb/>
            and pleasure, if added to any good whatsoever, <note type="margin">Fourth <lb/>
            argument. </note> <lb/>
            makes it more eligible; for instance, if added to <lb/>
            the act of justice, or temperance ;, and good can <lb/>
            only be increased by the addition of itself.</p>
          <p>This argument certainly seems to prove it to be <note type="chapter">4. </note> <lb/>
            amongst goods,, but not more so than anything else; <lb/>
            for everything is more eligible when in conjunction <lb/>
            with another good,. than when -left, alone. By a <note type="margin">5. <lb/>

            and Aris­ <lb/>
            totle's <lb/>
            answers. </note> <lb/>
            similar argument, indeed, Plato overthrows the idea <lb/>
            of pleasure being the chief good; because a plea­ <lb/>
            sant life is more eligible when joined with prudence <lb/>
            than without; but if the union of the two is <lb/>
            better, pleasure simply cannot be the chief, good ; <lb/>
            for you can add nothing to the chief good which <lb/>
            will make it more eligible : and it is plain that <lb/>
            nothing else can be the chief good, which becomes <lb/>
            mure eligible when joined to any of those things <lb/>
            which are eligible on their own account. What <lb/>
            is there, then, of this nature in which we can parti­ <lb/>

            for if it had been said that irrational beings only <lb/>
            sought pleasure, there might be something in the <lb/>
            objection ; but if rational beings also seek it, how <lb/>
            can there be anything in what they say ? And per­ <lb/>
            haps even in the inferior beings there is some <lb/>
            natural good principle, superior to their general <lb/>
            instincts, which aims at that good which is pecu­ <lb/>

            efuted. </note> Neither does what is said respecting the argu­ <lb/>
            ment from the contrary appear to have any weight: <lb/>
            for it is said that although pain be an evil, it does <lb/>
            not follow that pleasure is a good; for evil is <lb/>
            opposed to evil, and both are opposed to that which <lb/>
            is neither good nor evil; in which they say what <lb/>
            is by no means wrong in itself, but they do not <lb/>
            happen to speak the truth in the case before us: <lb/>
            for if both were evils, both must be objects of <lb/>
            aversion ; or if neither of them were, then neither <lb/>
            would be; at least, they would be circumstanced <lb/>
            alike : but now it is evident that men avoid the one <lb/>
            as an evil, and choose the other as a good : they <lb/>
            are therefore opposed in the manner stated. cc <note type="footnote"> cc The object of this chapter is as follows :-Aristotle is <lb/>
            quite ready to allow that pleasure is a good, but not that it is <lb/>
            the greatest good. Whilst, therefore, he is opposing Eudoxus, <lb/>
            who held the latter opinion, he does not disagree with Plato, <lb/>
            so far as he also is an opponent of Eudoxus, and denies that <lb/>
            pleasure is the chief good. This, however, does not prevent <lb/>
            him in the next chapter from objecting to and answering the <lb/>
            arguments which Plato adduces to prove that pleasure is <lb/>
            literally not a good, but an absolute evil. That it is an evil, is <lb/>
            proved by Plato in the following syllogism :— <lb/>
            Whatever admits of more and less is indefinite- <lb/>
            Pleasure admits of more and less-- <lb/>
            Therefore pleasure is indefinite. <lb/>
            Whatever is indefinite is an evil- <lb/>
            Pleasure is indefinite- <lb/>
            Therefore pleasure is an evil. <lb/>

          <p>NOR yet, because pleasure is not of the class of <note type="margin">1. <lb/>
            Plato's <lb/>
            first argu­ <lb/>

            qualities, is it for that reason not a good; for the <lb/>
            energies of virtue are not qualities, nor is happi­ <lb/>
            ness. d But it is said that good is definite, but <lb/>
            pleasure indefinite, because it admits of degrees. <lb/>
            Now, if this opinion is derived from the act of <lb/>
            being pleased, the same thing will apply to justice <lb/>
            and the other moral virtues (according to which it <lb/>
            is evidently allowed that men become of a certain <lb/>
            quality in each several virtue) ; for some men are <lb/>
            just and brave in a greater degree : it is possible <lb/>
            also to perform the acts of justice and temperance <lb/>
            in a greater or less degree. But if what they say <note type="chapter">3. </note> <lb/>
            applies to pleasure abstractedly, there is reason to <lb/>
            fear that they do not state the cause, if pleasures <lb/>
            are some unmixed, some mixed. But what reason <lb/>
            is there why, as health, which is definite, admits of <lb/>
            degrees, pleasure should not be definite and do so <lb/>
            likewise? for there is not the same symmetrical <lb/>
            arrangement in all men, nor in the same person <note type="footnote"> d The arguments here refuted by Aristotle may be thus <lb/>
            briefly stated :—(1.) All goods are qualities ; pleasure is not a <lb/>
            quality, therefore it is not a good. (2.) Pleasure admits of <lb/>
            degrees, therefore it is indefinite : now the Pythagoreans placed <lb/>
            the indefinite (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άόριστον, ἅπειρον</foreign>) in their catalogue of evils. <lb/>
            (3.) All motions are imperfect, and consequently all generation, <lb/>
            which is a species of motion, is imperfect. But "good" is <lb/>
            perfect; if, therefore, pleasure is a <foreign xml:lang="grc">κίνησις</foreign>, it is not a good. <lb/>
            (4.) The same argument applies to <foreign xml:lang="grc">άναπλήρωσις</foreign>, which is a <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">γενεσις</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> The following are the subdivisions of <foreign xml:lang="grc">κίνησις</foreign> given in the <lb/>

            is there always the same. but although relaxed, still <lb/>
            health continues up to a certain point, and differs <lb/>
            in degree. It is possible, then, that the case of <lb/>
            pleasure may be the same.</p>
          <p><note type="margin">4. <lb/>
            His third. </note> Assuming the chief good to be perfect, and motions <lb/>
            and generations to be imperfect, they attempt to <lb/>
            prove pleasure to be a motion and a generation. <lb/>
            But it seems that what they say is not correct, and <lb/>
            that it is not a motion: for quickness and slowness <lb/>
            appear to belong to every motion ; if not absolutely, <lb/>
            as in the motion of the universe, yet relatively. <note type="chapter">'5. </note> <lb/>
            Now, neither of these conditions belongs to pleasure; <lb/>
            for it is possible to become pleased quickly, as it is <lb/>
            to become angry; but not to feel pleasure quickly, <lb/>
            not even relatively ; but it is possible to walk, or to <note type="chapter">6. </note> <lb/>
            grow, and so forth, quickly or slowly. It is possi­ <lb/>
            ble, therefore, to change into a state. of pleasure <lb/>
            quickly or slowly; but to energize according to it <lb/>
            quickly is not possible (by which expression I mean, <lb/>
            " to be pleased ").</p>
          <p><note type="margin">7. <lb/>
            His fourth. </note> How also can it be a generation ? for it appears <lb/>
            that not anything is generated from anything ; but <lb/>
            from whatever it is generated, into that it is dis­ <lb/>
            solved ; and yet that which pleasure generates, pain <lb/>
            destroys. e And again, it is said that pain is a want <lb/>
            of that which is according to nature, and that plea- <note type="chapter">8. </note> <lb/>
            sure is the supplying of that want. But these are <lb/>
            bodily affections; consequently, if pleasure is the <lb/>
            supplying of that which nature requires, that must <lb/>
            feel the pleasure in which the supply takes place ; <lb/>
            that is, the body must feel it. This does not seem <lb/>
            to be the case; therefore, pleasure is not the sup­ <lb/>
            plying of a want; but when the supply has taken <lb/>
            place, then a man will feel pleasure ; and when the <lb/>
            supply is cut off, he will feel pain. This opinion <note type="footnote"> e Everything which is generated is dissolved into the <lb/>
            elements out of which it was originally produced. This pro­ <lb/>
            cess, which is opposite to <foreign xml:lang="grc">γἑνεσις</foreign>, is termed <foreign xml:lang="grc">φθορά</foreign>. Pleasure <lb/>
            cannot therefore be a <foreign xml:lang="grc">γἑνεσις</foreign>, because it produces nothing <lb/>
            which can be dissolved into its original elements. In fact, on <lb/>
            tne contrary, the sensations which pleasure generate, pain, and <lb/>
            not pleasure, destroys. </note> <pb n="267"/>

            seems to have originated in the pains and pleasures <note type="margin">9. <lb/>

            these views <lb/>
            originated. </note> <lb/>
            connected with, food: for when men are in want, <lb/>
            and have previously felt pain, they feel pleasure at <lb/>
            having the want supplied.</p>
          <p>This does not happen in all pleasures: for the <note type="chapter">10. </note> <lb/>
            pleasures of mathematical studies are without pain; <lb/>
            and of the pleasures of the senses, those which come <lb/>
            by smelling are so : and so are sounds, and sights, <lb/>
            and many recollections also, and hopes. Of what, <lb/>
            then, will these be generations ? for there have been <lb/>
            no wants of anything to be supplied.</p>

            pleasant in themselves, except to these particular <lb/>

            are so to the sick : nor those white, which appear <lb/>

            this be said, that pleasures are eligible, but not <lb/>
            from these sources; just as wealth is eligible, but <lb/>
            not to one who gets it by treason ; or health, but not <lb/>
            to one who gets it by eating all kinds of things ? <lb/>
            Or may it be said that pleasures differ in kind ? for <note type="chapter">13. </note> <lb/>
            those which proceed from honourable sources differ <lb/>
            from those which proceed from disgraceful ones; <lb/>
            and it is impossible to feel the pleasure of the just <lb/>

            even if pleasure did not result from them. Conse­ <lb/>
            quently, that pleasure is not the chief good, nor <lb/>
            every pleasure eligible, seems to be evident : and <lb/>
            that some are eligible for their own sakes, differing <lb/>
            either in kind, or in the source from whence they <lb/>
            are derived. Let this, then, be sufficient as to the <lb/>
            opinions which have been entertained upon the <lb/>
            subject of pleasure and pain.</p>

            come more evident if we resume the subject from <lb/>
            the beginning. For vision seems to be perfect at any <lb/>

            which by coming afterwards will make its species <lb/>

            fected if it lasted a longer time. Therefore it is <lb/>
            not a motion ; for every motion takes place in time, <lb/>
            and has some end in view; as, for instance, the <lb/>
            motion of building : and it is perfect, when it has <lb/>
            produced what it aims at; or in the whole tina of <lb/>
            its being built.g But in separate portions of the <note type="footnote"> f See Addison's beautiful paper on the perfection of sight, <lb/>

            it is the only reading which conveys any sense. The argumen <lb/>
            is as follows : -Pleasure is perfect at any moment; whereas </note> <pb n="269"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. IV.]"/> <lb/>
            whole time, all the motions are imperfect, and differ <note type="margin">Time. </note> <lb/>
            in species from the whole motion, and from one <lb/>
            another; for the putting of the stones together is <lb/>
            different from the fluting of the column, and these <lb/>
            again differ from the building of the whole temple. <lb/>
            And the building of the temple is perfect : because <note type="chapter">4. </note> <lb/>
            it wants nothing towards the end proposed : but <lb/>
            the construction of the foundation and the triglyph <lb/>
            is imperfect: for each belongs only to a part. Con­ <lb/>
            sequently they differ in species; and it is not pos­ <lb/>
            sible at any particular time to take a motion which <lb/>
            is perfect in its species; but if ever we can, it must <lb/>
            be in the whole time.</p>
          <p>It is the same in walking, and every other mo- <note type="margin">5. <lb/>
            Place. </note> <lb/>
            tion. For if motion be the moving from one part <lb/>
            of space to another, there must be also specific <lb/>
            differences of motion; as flying, walking, leaping, <lb/>
            and so on. And not only thus, but even in walk­ <lb/>
            ing itself; for the whence and the whither are not <lb/>
            the same in the whole stadium, and in part of the <lb/>
            stadium, or in one part of it and the other. Nor is <note type="chapter">6. </note> <lb/>
            it the same thing to cross this line or that; for a <lb/>
            person not only crosses a line, but a line in a parti­ <lb/>
            cular place; and this is in a different place from <lb/>
            that. We have treated accurately of motion in <lb/>
            another place.h</p>
          <p>It seems, however, not to be perfect in every part <note type="margin">7. <lb/>
            Recapitula­ <lb/>
            tion </note> <lb/>
            of time, but that the greater number of motions <lb/>
            are imperfect and different in species, if the whence I <lb/>
            and the whither constitute species. But the spe­ <lb/>
            cies of pleasure is perfect at any time whatsoever. <lb/>
            It is plain, therefore, that pleasure and motion <note type="chapter">8. </note> <lb/>
            must be different from each other, and that plea­ <note type="footnote"> any motion, e. g. the act of building, is imperfect at the end of <lb/>
            any portion of time, and not perfect until the whole time at <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK X."/> <lb/>
            cure is, of the number of things entire and perfect. <lb/>
            This also. would appear from the fact of its being <lb/>
            Impossible to move except in. time, but we may feel <lb/>
            pleasure without reference to time ; for that which <lb/>
            is felt at any particular moment is something <lb/>
            entire.</p>
          <p><note type="chapter">9. </note> But from all this it is clear, that it is incorrectly <lb/>
            said that pleasure is a motion or generation; foi <lb/>
            these terms are not applied to everything, but only <lb/>
            to those things which are divisible and not entire : <lb/>
            for there is no generation of vision, nor of a point, <lb/>
            nor of a unit: nor is any one of these a motion or <lb/>
            generation, nor consequently is there a motion or <lb/>

            reference to the best of all the objects which fall <lb/>
            under it): this must be the most perfect and the <lb/>
            most pleasant: for pleasure is attendant upon <lb/>
            every sense, as it is also upon every act of intellect <lb/>
            and contemplation; but.. the. most perfect is the <lb/>
            most. pleasant, and the most perfect is the <lb/>

            Pleasure,. therefore, perfects the energy: but plea­ <lb/>
            sure does not perfect it in the same manner that <lb/>
            the object and the perceptive faculty do if they are <lb/>
            good ; just as health and the physician are not in <lb/>

            But that there is a pleasure in every act of the per­ <note type="footnote"> i The physician is what the logicians call the efficient cause, <lb/>
            whilst health is the formal cause, of our being healthy. In <lb/>

            ceptive faculty is evident : for we say that sights <lb/>
            and sounds are pleasant : and it is also evident <lb/>
            that this is most so, when the perceptive faculty <lb/>
            is the best, and energizes upon the best object. <lb/>
            When the object perceived, and the faculty which <lb/>
            perceives it, are of this nature, there will always be <lb/>
            pleasure as long as there are an agent and a patient. <lb/>
            Again, pleasure makes the energy complete, not as <note type="margin">13. <lb/>
            Pleasure <lb/>
            perfects the <lb/>
            energy, not <lb/>
            as an inhe­ <lb/>
            rent halit, <lb/>
            but as an <lb/>
            end added <lb/>
            to it. It is <lb/>
            not con­ <lb/>
            tinuous.. </note> <lb/>
            the inherent habit would, but as some end added <lb/>
            to it; it is just what the freshness of youth is to <lb/>
            those in the prime of life.</p>
          <p>As long, therefore, as the object of perception or <lb/>
            intellect be such as it ought to be, as ' also the <lb/>
            faculty which judges or Contemplates, there willbe <lb/>
            pleasure in the energy : for when the patient and <lb/>
            the agent are similar, ,and correspond to one <lb/>
            another, the same effect is naturally produced. <lb/>
            Why, then, is no one continually pleased ? is it <lb/>
            that he becomes fatigued ? for no human faculties <lb/>
            have the power of energizing continually. Pleasure, <lb/>
            therefore, cannot 'result, for it follows the energy.</p>
          <p>But some things cause delight when they are <note type="chapter">14. </note> <lb/>
            new, and for the same reason they do not ;cause it <lb/>
            in the same degree afterwards; for at first the in­ <lb/>
            tellect is awakened, and energizes intensely in them, <lb/>
            as, in the case of sight, those do, who look' stead­ <lb/>
            fastly ; but afterwards the energy is not'of the same <lb/>
            kind, but relaxed; and therefore the pleasure also <lb/>
            becomes dulled. But one might imagine that all <note type="margin">15. <lb/>
            Do men <lb/>
            from the <lb/>
            desire of <lb/>
            life love <lb/>
            pleasure or <lb/>
            the reversel </note> <lb/>
            men seek pleasure, because all are desirous of life; <lb/>
            and life is a kind of energy; and everyone ener­ <lb/>
            gizes upon and with" those things which lie loves <lb/>
            best; as, for example, the musician, with his hear­ <lb/>
            ing, upon music; the studious man, with his in­ <lb/>
            tellect, upon matters of speculation; and- so on <lb/>
            with the rest. But pleasure makes the energy <lb/>
            perfect, and therefore it makes life perfect, which <lb/>
            men desire. It is with reason, therefore, that they <note type="chapter">16. </note> <lb/>
            also desire pleasure; for it makes life, which is <lb/>
            eligible, perfect to each one. But let the question, <lb/>
            whether we choose life for the sake of pleasure, or <pb n="272"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="[BOOK X."/> <lb/>
            pleasure for the sake of life, be dismissed for the <lb/>
            present, for these seem to be intimately connected, <lb/>
            and not to admit of separation; for without an <lb/>
            energy pleasure is not produced, and pleasure per­ <lb/>
            fects every energy.</p>

            and houses and furniture. And also we think that <lb/>
            energies, which differ in species, are made perfect <lb/>
            by things which differ in species. But the energies <lb/>
            of the intellect differ from the energies of the <lb/>
            senses, and each of these differ from one another in <lb/>

            persons who energize with pleasure judge of every­ <lb/>
            thing and perform everything with a higher degree <lb/>
            of accuracy; as those who take pleasure in geo­ <lb/>

          <p><note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. V.J"/> Again, this would appear still more plainly from <note type="margin">5. <lb/>
            Because <lb/>
            pleasures <lb/>
            from othci <lb/>

            destroy <lb/>
            energies. </note> <lb/>
            the fact that pleasures arising from other sources <lb/>
            are impediments to energies; for those who love <lb/>
            music cannot pay attention to conversation if <lb/>
            they hear any one playing, because they take <lb/>
            more pleasure in music than in the energy in <lb/>
            which they are engaged. The pleasure, therefore, <lb/>
            which is attendant upon music, destroys the energy <lb/>
            which was employed in conversation. It is the <note type="chapter">6. </note> <lb/>
            same in every other case, when a man is employed <lb/>
            upon two subjects at once: for the pleasanter <lb/>
            energy d rives out the other; and if there is a <lb/>
            great difference as to the pleasure, so much the <lb/>
            more, so that he cannot energize at all upon the <lb/>
            other. When, therefore, we take very great delight <note type="chapter">7. </note> <lb/>
            in anything, we cannot do anything else at all; <lb/>
            and it is only when we are but moderately pleased <lb/>
            with one thing, that we employ ourselves in another; <lb/>
            just as persons who eat sweetmeats in the theatre <lb/>
            do so most when the actors are bad. But since the <lb/>
            pleasure properly belonging to them makes the <lb/>
            energies accurate, and more lasting, and better, but ' <lb/>
            the pleasures arising from anything else spoil them, <lb/>
            it is evident that they are very distinct. For plea- <note type="margin">Opposite <lb/>

            act like <lb/>
            pains. </note> <lb/>
            sures arising from something else produce nearly <lb/>
            the same effect as pains arising from the thing <lb/>
            itself; for energies are destroyed by the pains <lb/>
            which belong to them; for instance, if writing or <lb/>
            reasoning is unpleasant and painful to any one, he <lb/>
            does not write or reason, because the energy is. <lb/>
            painful. The contrary effect, therefore, is produced <note type="chapter">8. </note> <lb/>
            on energies by the pleasures and pains which pro­ <lb/>
            perly belong to them : but those properly belong to <lb/>
            the energy, which follow upon it independently of <lb/>
            anything else. It has been said also, that pleasures <lb/>
            arising from other objects produce nearly the same <lb/>
            effect as pain ; for they destroy the energy, but not <lb/>
            in the same way.</p>

            same way ; for there is a pleasure properly belonging <lb/>
            to every energy. That, therefore, which is proper <lb/>
            to the good energy is good, and that which is proper <lb/>
            to the bad energy is bad ; for the desires of honour­ <lb/>
            able things are praiseworthy, the desires of dis- <note type="chapter">10. </note> <lb/>
            graceful ones to be blamed. But the pleasures, <lb/>
            which are contained in the energies, more properly <lb/>
            belong to them than the desires; for the latter <lb/>
            are distinct both as to time and nature; but the <lb/>
            former follow closely upon the energies, and are so <lb/>
            inseparable from them, that: it is questionable whe­ <lb/>
            ther the energy is not the same as the pleasure. It <lb/>
            appears, however, that pleasure -is not an operation <lb/>
            of intellect or of the senses; for that would be <lb/>
            absurd; but because' they are not separated, they <lb/>
            appear to some'to be identical</p>

            Pleasures <lb/>
            differ in <lb/>
            purity </note> As, therefore, the energies are different, so are <lb/>
            the pleasures. Now sight differs from touch in <lb/>
            purity, and hearing and smelling differ from taste; <lb/>
            their pleasures, 'therefore, differ in the same way ; <lb/>
            and the pleasures of the intellect differ from these, <note type="margin">12. <lb/>
            Pleasures <lb/>
            differ in <lb/>
            men and <lb/>
            animals, <lb/>
            because <lb/>
            their ener­ <lb/>
            gies differ. </note> <lb/>
            and each differs from the, other. There seems to <lb/>
            be a pleasure properly belonging to every animal, <lb/>
            as'there is to each its proper work; for it is that <lb/>
            which is according to its energy. And if we exa­ <lb/>
            mine each case separately by itself, this would seem <lb/>
            to be the case; for the pleasures of a horse, of a <lb/>
            do,,,,, and of a man differ: as Heraclitus says, that <lb/>
            an ass would prefer litter to gold ; for food is <note type="chapter">13. </note> <lb/>
            pleasanter than gold to asses. The pleasures, there­ <lb/>
            fore, of things which differ in kind are different <lb/>
            also; but it is reasonable to expect that the plea­ <lb/>
            sures of the same things should not differ. But <lb/>
            they differ in no slight degree, at least in the case <lb/>
            of men; for the same things give pain to some, <lb/>
            and pleasure to others ; and to some they are pain­ <lb/>
            ful and objects of hate, to others pleasant and <lb/>
            objects of love. The case is also the same in sweet <lb/>
            things ; for the same things are not thought sweet <lb/>
            by a man in a fever, and a man in health ; nor is <lb/>
            the same thing thought warm by an invalid and bv <pb n="275"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. VI.]"/> <lb/>
            a man in a good state of body : the same also is the <lb/>
            case with, everything else. But in all such in­ <lb/>
            stances, that is thought to be the truth which <lb/>
            appears so to the good man.</p>
          <p>If this is well said, as it appears to be, and if <note type="margin">14. <lb/>
            True plea­ <lb/>
            sure is that <lb/>
            which is so <lb/>
            to the good <lb/>
            man. </note> <lb/>
            excellence, and the good man, so far forth as. he is <lb/>
            good, are the measure of everything : those must <lb/>
            be pleasures which appear so to him, and those, <lb/>
            things pleasant in which he delights. But if what <lb/>
            is disagreeable to him seems pleasant to any one, it <lb/>
            is no wonder ; for there are many things which de­ <lb/>
            prave and injure men.; but such things are not <lb/>
            pleasant, except to those men, and to others who <lb/>
            are so disposed. r With respect, to those pleasures <note type="chapter">15. </note> <lb/>
            which are confessedly disgraceful, it is, evident that <lb/>
            we must not call them pleasures except to the <lb/>
            depraved. But of those pleasures which, seem to <lb/>
            be good, what particular one. or what. kind must <lb/>
            we say is the pleasure of man ? or is not this plain <lb/>
            from the energies ? for pleasures follow upon them. <lb/>
            Whether, then, there be one or more energies of <note type="chapter">16. </note> <lb/>
            the perfect and perfectly happy man, the pleasures <lb/>
            which perfect them must properly be said to, be <lb/>
            the pleasures of man ; and the rest must be so in a <lb/>
            secondary or even very inferior degree,k just as the <lb/>

            were, it might exist in a man who slept throughout <lb/>
            his life, living the life of a plant, and suffering <lb/>
            the greatest misfortunes. If, then, this does not <note type="chapter">3. </note> <lb/>
            please us, but if we must rather bring it under <lb/>
            a kind of energy, as was said before; and if, of <lb/>
            energies, some are necessary1 and eligible for the <lb/>
            sake of something else, others are eligible for their <lb/>
            own sakes; it is plain that we must consider <lb/>
            happiness as one of those which are eligible for <lb/>
            their own sakes, and not one of those which are <lb/>
            eligible for the sake of something else ; for happi­ <lb/>
            ness is in want of nothing, but is self-sufficient. <note type="chapter">4. </note> <lb/>
            Now those energies are eligible for their own sakes, <lb/>
            from which nothing more is sought for beyond the <lb/>
            energy. But of this kind, actions done according <lb/>
            to virtue seem to be : for the performance of ho­ <lb/>

            ment. </note> <lb/>
            for their own sakes. And of amusements, those <lb/>
            are eligible for their own sakes which are plea­ <lb/>
            sant : for men do not choose these for the sake of <lb/>
            anything else : for they are rather injured by them <lb/>
            than benefited, since they neglect their persons and <note type="chapter">5. </note> <lb/>
            property. But the majority of those who are <lb/>
            called happy fly to such pastimes as these ; and, <lb/>
            therefore, those who have a happy turn for such <lb/>
            pastimes as these are in favour with tyrants; for <lb/>
            they make themselves agreeable in those things <lb/>
            which tyrants desire; and such are the men they <lb/>
            want.</p>
          <p><note type="chapter">6. </note> These things are thought to belong to happiness, <lb/>
            because those who are in power pass their leisure in <lb/>
            them. But such men are perhaps no proof; for <lb/>
            neither virtue nor intellect consists in having power. <lb/>
            and from these two good energies proceed; nor if <note type="footnote"> Necessary does not here imply necessary per Be (innere <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. VI.]"/> <lb/>
            those, who have never tasted pure and liberal plea­ <lb/>
            sure, fly to bodily pleasures, must we therefore <lb/>
            think that these pleasures are more eligible; for <lb/>
            children think those things which are esteemed by <lb/>
            them the best. It is reasonable, therefore, to sup- <note type="chapter">7 </note> <lb/>
            pose, that as the things which appear honourable to <lb/>
            children and men differ, so also those which appear <lb/>
            so to the bad and the good will differ likewise, and <lb/>
            therefore, as we have very often said, those things <lb/>
            are honourable and pleasant which are so to the <lb/>
            good man. But to every man that energy is most <lb/>
            eligible which is according to his proper habit; and, <lb/>
            therefore, to the good man. that is most eligible <lb/>
            which is according to virtue.</p>
          <p>Consequently happiness does not consist in <note type="chapter"> 8 </note> <lb/>
            amusement ; for it is absurd that the end should <lb/>
            be amusement; and that men should toil and suffer <lb/>
            inconvenience all their life long for the sake of <lb/>
            amusement; for we choose everything, as we might <lb/>
            say, for the sake of something else, except happi­ <lb/>
            ness ; for that is an end. But to be serious and <note type="chapter">9. </note> <lb/>
            to labour for the sake of amusement appears foolish <lb/>
            and very childish. But to amuse ourselves in order <note type="margin">Saying of <unclear/> <lb/>
            Anacharsis. </note> <lb/>
            that we may be serious, as Anacharsis said, seems <lb/>
            to be right: for amusement resembles relaxation. <lb/>
            Relaxation, therefore, is not the end, for we have <lb/>
            recourse to it for the sake of the energy. But the <lb/>
            happy life seems to be according to virtue; and <lb/>
            this is serious, and does not consist in amusement. <lb/>
            We say also that serious things are better than <note type="chapter">10. </note> <lb/>
            those which are ridiculous and joined with amuse­ <lb/>
            ment ; and that the energy of the better part and <lb/>
            of the better man is more serious; and the energy <lb/>
            of the better man is at once superior, and more <lb/>
            tending to happiness. Besides, any person what- <note type="chapter">11. </note> <lb/>
            ever, even a slave, may enjoy bodily pleasures no <lb/>
            less than the best man ; but no one allows that a <lb/>
            slave partakes of happiness except so far as that <lb/>
            he partakes of life : for happiness does not consist in <lb/>
            such modes of passing life, but in energies accord­ <lb/>

            dom is confessedly the most pleasant: at any rate, <lb/>
            wisdom seems to contain pleasures worthy of admi­ <lb/>
            ration, both in point of purity and stability : and it <lb/>
            is reasonable to suppose that this mode of life should <lb/>
            be pleasanter to those who know it than to those who <note type="chapter">4. </note> <lb/>
            are only seeking it. Again, that which is called self- <lb/>
            sufficiency must be most concerned with contem­ <lb/>
            plative happiness; for both the wise man and the <lb/>
            just, and all others, need the necessaries of life ; but <lb/>
            supposing them to be sufficiently supplied with <lb/>
            such goods, the just man requires persons towards <note type="chapter">5 </note> <lb/>
            whom and with whom he may act justly; and in <lb/>
            like manner the temperate man, and the brave <pb n="279"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. VII.]"/> <lb/>
            man, and so on. with all the rest, But the wise <lb/>
            man, if even by himself, is able to contemplate ; <lb/>
            and the more so the wiser he is ; perhaps he will <lb/>
            energize better, if he has co-operators, but neverthe- <note type="chapter">6. </note> <lb/>
            less he is most self-sufficient. This would seem also to <lb/>
            be the only energy which is loved for its own sake; <lb/>
            . or it has no result beyond the act of contemplation; <lb/>
            but from the active energies, we gain more or less <lb/>
            beyond the performance of the action.</p>
          <p>Happiness seems also to consist in leisure, for <note type="margin">7. <lb/>
            It implies <lb/>
            leisure. </note> <lb/>
            we are busy in order that we may have leisure; <lb/>
            and we go to war in order that we may be at peace. <lb/>
            Now the energies of the active virtuesare exerted <lb/>
            in political or military affairs ; and the actions with <lb/>
            respect to these are thought to allow of no leisure. <lb/>
            Certainly military actions altogether exclude I it; <lb/>
            for no one chooses war, nor makes preparations for <lb/>
            war for the sake of war; for a, man would be <lb/>
            thought perfectly defiled with blood, if he made <lb/>
            his friends enemies in order that there might be <lb/>
            battles and massacres; The energy of the states- <note type="chapter">8 </note> <lb/>
            man is also without leisure ; and besides the actual <lb/>
            administration of the state, the statesman seeks to <lb/>
            gain power and honours, or at least happiness for <lb/>
            himself and his fellow-citizens, different from the <lb/>
            happiness of the state, which we are in search of, <lb/>

            these have no leisure, and aim at some end, and <lb/>
            are not chosen for their own sakes; but the energy <lb/>
            of the intellect is thought to be superior in inten­ <lb/>

            Such a life <lb/>
            approaches <lb/>
            nearest to <lb/>
            the divine. </note> But such a life would be better than man could <lb/>
            attain to; for he would live thus, not so far forth as <lb/>
            he is man, but as there is in him something divine.m <lb/>
            But so far as this divine part surpasses the whole <lb/>
            compound nature, so far does its energy surpass the <note type="chapter">11. </note> <lb/>
            energy which is according to all other virtue. If, <lb/>
            then, the intellect be divine when compared with <lb/>
            man, the life also, which is in obedience to that, <lb/>
            will be divine when compared with human life. <note type="chapter">12. </note> <lb/>
            But a man ought not to entertain human thoughts, <lb/>
            as some would advise, because he is human, nor <lb/>
            mortal thoughts, because he is mortal :n but as far <lb/>
            as it is possible he should make himself immortal, <lb/>
            and do everything with a view to living in accord­ <lb/>
            ance with the best principle in him ; although it <lb/>
            be small in size, yet in power and value it is far <note type="chapter">13. </note> <lb/>
            more excellent than all. Besides, this would seem <lb/>
            to be each man's " self," if it really is the ruling <lb/>
            and the better part. It would be absurd, there­ <lb/>
            fore, if a man were to choose not his own life, but <note type="chapter">14. </note> <lb/>
            the life of some other thing. And what was said <lb/>
            before will apply now; for that which peculiarly <lb/>
            belongs to each by nature, is best and most pleasant <lb/>
            to every one ; and consequently to man, the life <lb/>
            according to intellect is most pleasant, if intellect <lb/>
            especially constitutes Man. This life, therefore, is <lb/>
            the most happy. <note type="footnote"> m Compare what Cicero says respecting the Stoics (de <lb/>

            tellectual <lb/>
            happiness <lb/>
            is superiot <lb/>
            to moral <lb/>
            happiness. </note> <lb/>
            of virtue, occupies the second place in respect to <lb/>
            happiness; for the energies according to it are be­ <lb/>
            longing to human nature; for we do what is just <lb/>
            and brave, and everything else which is in accord­ <lb/>
            ance with the virtues, one towards another, in our <lb/>
            dealings and our needs, and in actions and passions <lb/>
            of every kind, observing what is becoming to each. <lb/>
            But all these appear to belong to human nature; <note type="chapter">2. </note> <lb/>
            in some points moral virtue even seems to be the <lb/>
            consequence of our corporeal nature, and, in many, <lb/>
            to be intimately connected with the passions. Pru- <note type="chapter">3. </note> <lb/>
            dence also is closely united to moral virtue, and <lb/>
            moral virtue to prudence; if the principles of pru­ <lb/>
            dence are in accordance with the moral virtues, and <lb/>
            the correctness of the moral virtues in accordance <lb/>
            with prudence.0 But these are knit together with <lb/>
            the passions, and must relate to the whole compound <lb/>
            nature of man; and the virtues of the compound <lb/>
            nature are human; and therefore the life according <lb/>
            to them, and the happiness according to them, are <lb/>
            human. But the happiness of the intellect is sepa- <note type="chapter">4 </note> <lb/>
            rate ; and let it be enough to have said thus much <lb/>
            about it, since extreme exactness is beyond the <lb/>
            subject proposed.</p>
          <p>Intellectual happiness also would seem to require <note type="margin">5. <lb/>
            It is ind :­ <lb/>

            external good in a small degree, or in a less degree <lb/>
            than moral happiness. For let it be granted that <lb/>

            (even though he who is engaged in social duties <note type="footnote"> ° Moral virtue chooses the right end ; prudence directs us <lb/>

            ence), yet with respect to the energies there will <lb/>
            be a great difference; for the liberal man will want <lb/>
            money in order to perform liberal acts, and the <lb/>
            just man will want means to makereturns, for <lb/>
            wishes are uncertain, and even the unjust pretend <lb/>
            that they wish to. act justly; the brave man also <lb/>
            will want power, if he is to perform anything <lb/>
            according to his virtue; and the temperate man <lb/>
            will-want an opportunity to show his temperance. <lb/>
            For, otherwise, how will he or any other character <lb/>

          <p><note type="chapter">6. </note> . A question has arisen, whether the deliberate <lb/>
            preference, or the actions themselves, have the <lb/>
            greater influence over virtue, since it consists in <lb/>
            both : now it is evident that its perfection must <lb/>
            reside in both; but for the perfection of actions, <lb/>
            many things are needed ; and the more so, the <note type="chapter"> 7 . </note> <lb/>
            greater and nobler the actions are. But the coil­ <lb/>
            templative man requires no such things, at least, to <lb/>
            perform his energy ; but- they are, so to speak, im­ <lb/>
            pediments, at least they arc so to his contempla­ <lb/>
            tion. So far forth as he is man, and associates with <lb/>
            many, he chooses to perform acts of moral virtue ; <lb/>
            he will therefore require such things in order to <lb/>
            maintain his character as a man.</p>

            It is the <lb/>
            happiness <lb/>
            which we <lb/>
            may sup­ <lb/>
            pose that <lb/>
            the gods <lb/>
            enjoy. </note> That perfect happiness is a kind of contemplative <lb/>
            energy, might be shown, also from the following <lb/>
            considerations; that we suppose the gods to be pre­ <lb/>
            eminently blessed and happy. But what moral ac­ <lb/>
            tions can we attribute to them? shall'they be just <lb/>
            actions ; or, will it not appear ridiculous to represent <lb/>
            them as making bargains, and restoring deposits, <note type="chapter">9. </note> <lb/>
            and so forth ? Shall we, then, attribute to them <lb/>
            courageous acts, making them undergo formidable <lb/>
            things, and meet danger, because it is honourable ? <lb/>
            or liberal acts ? But to whom wiil they give ? and it <lb/>
            is absurd to suppose that they have money, or. any­ <lb/>
            thing of that sort. But if we say that they are <lb/>
            temperate, what would that mean? is not the praise <pb n="283"/>
            <note type="correspondsTo" n="CHAP. VIII.]"/> <lb/>
            absurd, because they have not bad desires ? p And it <note type="margin">10. <lb/>
            We cannot <lb/>
            attribute to <lb/>
            them moral <lb/>
            actions. </note> <lb/>
            we went through every case, moral actions would­ <lb/>
            seem insignificant, and unworthy of gods. But yet <lb/>
            all suppose that they live, and therefore- energize; <lb/>
            for we do not imagine that they sleep like Endy <lb/>
            mion.q To him, therefore, who lives, if we take <lb/>
            away moral action, and still more SO,! production, <lb/>
            what is, left besides contemplation ? So that the <note type="margin">11. <lb/>

            of human energies, that which is nearest allied to <lb/>
            this must be the happiest.</p>
          <p>A proof of this also is, that other animals do not <note type="chapter">12. </note> <lb/>
            partake of happiness which are deprived altogether <lb/>
            of such an energy. For to the gods,, their whole <lb/>
            life is blessed; and to men, as far as, there belongs <lb/>
            to them some resemblance to such an energy : but <lb/>
            no other animal is happy, because they in no way <lb/>
            partake of contemplation. As far, therefore, as <note type="margin">13. <lb/>
            No animal <lb/>
            but man is <lb/>
            capable of <lb/>
            it. </note> <lb/>
            contemplation extends, so far does happiness; and <lb/>
            whoever have more capacity for contemplation, <lb/>
            have more happiness, note accidentally, but in the <lb/>
            way of contemplation itself, for it is of itself valu­ <lb/>
            able. So that happiness must be a kind of contem­ <lb/>
            plation. <note type="footnote"> p How much more philosophical are the following observa­ <lb/>
            tions of Bishop Butler on the happiness of heaven (Anal. <lb/>
            Part I. c. v.) :—" Nor is our ignorance, what will be the em­ <lb/>

            of it with regard to each other, any proof that there will be <lb/>
            no sphere of exercise for Loose virtues. Much less, if that <lb/>
            were possible, is our ignorance any proof that there will be no <lb/>
            occasion for that frame of mind, or character which is formed <lb/>
            by the daily practice of those virtues here, and which is a result <lb/>
            from it. This at least must be owned in general, that, as the <lb/>
            government established in the universe is moral, the character <lb/>
            of virtue and piety must, in some way or. other, be the condi­ <lb/>

            should do what they ought. Anaxagoras also seems <lb/>

            the truth is, that they seem to have power to urge <lb/>

            to make a character that is generous and truly fond <lb/>

            that they have no power to persuade the multitude <note type="margin">4. <lb/>

            led by fear. </note> <lb/>
            to what is virtuous and honourable. For it is not <lb/>
            the nature of the masses to obey a sense of shame, <lb/>
            but fear: nor; to abstain from vicious things because <lb/>
            it is disgraceful,'but for fear of punishments ; for <lb/>
            they live according to the dictates of passion, and <lb/>
            pursue their own peculiar pleasures, and the means <lb/>
            of gratifying them; they fly also from the contrary <lb/>
            pains, but of what is honourable and truly pleasant, <lb/>
            they have no idea, inasmuch as they never had a <note type="margin">5. <lb/>

            change in such men as these ? for it is not possible, <lb/>
            or at least not easy, to alter what has been for a <lb/>
            long time impressed upon the moral character; but <lb/>
            it is perhaps a great thing, if, when everything is <lb/>
            present by which we are thought to become good, <lb/>
            we can partake of virtue.</p>

            Ways of <lb/>

            Now it is plain that whatever belongs to nature is <lb/>
            not in ,our own power, but exists by some divine <lb/>

            be previously cultivated by habits to feel pleasure <lb/>
            and aversion properly, just as the soil must, which <lb/>
            nourishes the seed. For he who lives in obedience <lb/>

            convictions of such a man as this? On the whole, <lb/>
            it appears that passion does not submit to reasoning, <lb/>

            than to reason, and to punishments rather than to <lb/>
            the principle of honour; -Therefore, some think <note type="chapter">10. </note> <lb/>
            that legislators ought to exhort to virtue, and to <lb/>

            good which are made by good laws. But whether <lb/>
            these laws be written or unwritten would seem tc <lb/>
            make no difference ; nor whether they are those by <lb/>
            which one or many persons are to be educated, as <lb/>
            it makes no difference in music, in gymnastics, and <lb/>

            that legal enactments and customs have authority <lb/>
            in states, so also the words of a father, and customs, <lb/>
            have authority in private families; and still greater <lb/>
            authority on account of the relationship, and the <lb/>
            benefits conferred: for children have a natural affec­ <lb/>
            tion for their parents, and are naturally disposed <lb/>
            to obey. Moreover, private education differs from <lb/>
            public; as is the case in medicine; for universally <lb/>
            abstinence and rest are good for a man in a fever; <lb/>
            but to a particular individual perhaps they are not; <lb/>
            and the pugilist perhaps does not use the same style <note type="margin">17. <lb/>

            education <lb/>

            of fighting with all. It would seem, therefore, that <note type="chapter">18. </note> <lb/>
            the case of the individual might be studied with <lb/>
            greater accuracy, if the education was private ; for <lb/>
            then each is more likely to meet with what suits <lb/>
            him. But still a physician, or a gymnastic master, <lb/>
            or any other master, would take the best care of the <lb/>
            individual, if he knew the general rule, namely, <lb/>
            what is good for all men, or for all of a certain <lb/>
            class : for the sciences are said, and with truth, to <lb/>
            have to do with general rules.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, perhaps, there is nothing to hinder <note type="chapter">19. </note> <lb/>
            one from taking good care of an individual, even if <lb/>
            one has no scientific knowledge, but only accurately <lb/>
            examines by experience what happens to each <lb/>
            individual; as some physicians seem to be the best <lb/>
            physicians to themselves, although they are not <lb/>
            at all able to assist another. Perhaps it may be <note type="chapter">20 </note> <lb/>
            thought that he who wishes to become skilled in <lb/>

            best; as if this selection were not a work requiring <lb/>
            intelligence; and as if a correct discrimination <lb/>

            write on the <lb/>
            subject. </note> <lb/>
            subject of legislation, it would perhaps be better <lb/>
            for us to examine it ourselves, and, in short, the <lb/>
            whole subject of politics, in order that the philo­ <lb/>
            sophy of human nature may, as far as is in our <lb/>
            power, be completed. First, x then, if anything <lb/>
            has been well said by our predecessors on any par­ <lb/>
            ticular point, let us endeavour to explain it: then <lb/>
            from a comparison of the different forms of govern- <note type="chapter">31. </note> <lb/>
            ment, let us examine what kind of qualities pre­ <lb/>
            serve and destroy commonwealths, and each par­ <lb/>
            ticular form of government, and for what reasons <lb/>
            some are administered well, and others the contrary: <lb/>
            for when these points are considered, we shall <lb/>
            perhaps be better able to have a comprehensive <lb/>
            view of what form of government is best, and how <lb/>
            each is regulated, and what are its laws and insti­ <lb/>
            tutions. Let us then make a commencement. <note type="footnote"> x Aristotle here prepares the reader for the three parts into <lb/>

          <p>What idea is commonly entertained respecting the need <lb/>
            of friends to a happy man ? <lb/>
            What absurdity is involved in this opinion ? <lb/>

            What question arises out of this consideration as to the <lb/>
            comparative need of friends in prosperity and adversity ? <lb/>
            How does the nature of man contradict this commonly <lb/>
            received opinion ? <lb/>
            Account for the existence of this opinion, and show how <lb/>
            far it is correct. <lb/>
            Show from the definition and nature of happiness itself, <lb/>
            that the happy man needs friends. <lb/>
            Show that they are necessary on the hypothesis that <lb/>
            happiness implies pleasure. <lb/>
            Show that, if good, they improve virtue. <lb/>
            Prove the same fact from the pleasure which is derived <lb/>
            from the consciousness and perception of existence.</p>

          <p>What precept respecting hospitality may perhaps be coil, <lb/>

            Why so ? <lb/>
            Is any limit to be put to the number of virtuous friends <lb/>
            How is this illustrated by referring to political commu­ <lb/>

            Why is it difficult to sympathize with many ? <lb/>
            What lesson do all the well-known examples of friendship <lb/>

            By what name do we designate those who seem intimate <lb/>

            Does Aristotle pursue the investigation of this question to <lb/>

            Is not the effect produced by the presence of a friend <lb/>

            Under such circumstances, what is the conduct of the <lb/>

            What objection is first made to his theory ? <lb/>

          <p>How many objections are made to his second position ?— <lb/>
            What are they ? <lb/>
            Answer the first by a counter objection, and the second, <lb/>
            by drawing a distinction between pleasures. <lb/>
            What is the objection on the ground that pleasure is a <lb/>
            motion and a generation ? <lb/>
            How many kinds of motion are there, according to Aris­ <lb/>

            Prove that pleasure is not a supplying a deficiency. <lb/>
            Suppose base pleasures are brought forward, how would <lb/>

            Show that for this reason it differs from a motion or a <lb/>

            Give an illustration derived from arcliitecture. <lb/>
            Give another, taken from the different kinds of motions. <lb/>
            In order to get at Aristotle's theory of pleasure, describe <lb/>
            what he means by the best energy. <lb/>
            Prove that pleasure makes the energy perfect, and state <lb/>
            the way in which it does so. <lb/>
            Explain how it is that we cannot feel pleasure continuously. <lb/>
            Prove that the love of pleasure is the consequence of the <lb/>
            love of life. <lb/>
            Does Aristotle here enter upon the question whether we <lb/>

          <p>In proving, that pleasures differ in species, show</p>
          <p>(1.) That they perfect different productions and different <lb/>

          <p>(2.) That each energy is increased by its proper plea­ <lb/>

          <p>(3.) That the pleasures resulting from one kind of <lb/>
            energy are a hinderance to other energies.</p>
          <p>If we are engaged in two different energies at the same <lb/>
            time, what becomes of the least pleasant ? <lb/>
            When are we inclined to engage in two occupations at <lb/>
            once ? <lb/>
            Compare the effect of pleasures which are foreign to any <lb/>
            energy with the pains proper to it; and give an example in <lb/>
            illustration. <lb/>
            How are we to estimate the qualities of pleasures ? <lb/>
            Which are most closely connected with the energies, the <lb/>
            pleasures which attend thereon, or the desires which originate <lb/>
            them ? <lb/>
            Compare in point of purity the various pleasures of the <lb/>

            Show that different men, and the same men under dif­ <lb/>
            ferent circumstances entertain different ideas of pleasure. <lb/>
