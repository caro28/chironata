            <title type="main">PREFACE.</title>
          </head>
          <p>IT has often been said that Horace is untranslateable. <lb/>
            With that opinion I thoroughly agree, in one sense. A <lb/>
            born poet may found on Horace's Lyrics a series of pretty <lb/>
            sonnets or odes; but to transfer Horace in soul, in subtlety, <lb/>
            and in metre, from the Latin of the last half century before <lb/>
            Christ to the English of the year of grace eighteen <lb/>
            hundred and ninety-six, is simply impossible. It would be <lb/>
            as difficult adequately to represent the Odes of Horace in <lb/>
            English, as to reproduce Burns in Latin. With the Satires <lb/>
            and Epistles the case is somewhat different, and the task <lb/>
            an easier one. But if Horace cannot be rendered to <lb/>
            perfection, that is no reason why an attempt should not <lb/>
            be made by British scholars to give in English, prose or <lb/>
            verse, as good a representation of the genius, the versatility, <lb/>
            the humour, and the wisdom of the Roman poet, as is <lb/>
            possible in the circumstances.</p>
          <p>In the following Translation of the Odes I have gone on <lb/>
            somewhat new lines. I have endeavoured to produce a <lb/>
            version having a pleasant run in the words, and a rhythmical <lb/>
            cadence in the clauses and sentences. In doing this I <lb/>
            have frequently fallen, inadvertently in the first instance, <lb/>
            into a sort of blank-verse in individual lines, with which <lb/>
            rigid critics may perhaps find fault. Be that as it may, it <lb/>
            appears to me that in most cases the effect on the readers <lb/>
            ear will be rather pleasing than otherwise-a result which <lb/>
            I have steadily kept in view.</p>
          <p>I have at the same time tried to avoid that rugged, and <lb/>
             <pb n="VI"/>
            uncouth, and unmusical character which marks and mars <lb/>
            very many of the prose translations of the Greek and the <lb/>
            Latin classics.</p>
          <p>In my wish to bring out the true meaning and spirit of <lb/>
            Horace's poems, I have not adhered to the closely literal <lb/>
            style, but have taken the liberty of altering phrases and <lb/>
            constructions to suit my main purpose, in such a way, <lb/>
            however, that even a tiro may easily follow the connection, <lb/>
            and make for himself a more literal version with the aid of <lb/>
            the light thrown on the text. My desire has been to render <lb/>
            Horace more enjoyable to the English reader, and with <lb/>
            this object in view, to offer him a smooth and easy running <lb/>
            version. How far I have succeeded in my attempt I leave <lb/>
            to others to judge.</p>
          <p>I have studied once again the works of the best com­ <lb/>
            mentators—Orelli, Ritter, Dillenburger, Dacier, and others, <lb/>
            among foreigners; and of British scholars, Bentley, Mac­ <lb/>
            leane, Wickham, Munro and King, and a few of less note. <lb/>
            I have weighed the arguments of each of them in regard to <lb/>
            doubtful interpretations, and have adopted that explanation <lb/>
            which commended itself to my judgment, and which seemed <lb/>
            most consistent with common sense. I have generally <lb/>
            followed Mr Wickham's text, because he seems to me to <lb/>
            have made, in most cases, a very judicious choice from <lb/>
            among the various readings. His notes, too, show practical <lb/>
            good sense and wise and scholarly discrimination.</p>
          <p>I have to express my best thanks to my friends, Mr John <lb/>
            Clarke, M.A., Classical Master in the Aberdeen Grammar <lb/>
            School; and Mr Hugh Campbell, LL.D., Rector of the High <lb/>
            School, Falkirk, and Classical Examiner in the University <lb/>
            of St Andrews, for the trouble they have taken in revising <lb/>
            the proof sheets, and giving me many valuable suggestions.</p>

            <title type="main">LIFE OF HORACE.</title>
          </head>
          <p>No ancient author has given in his writings more facts than <lb/>
            Horace has done, from which a biographer can construct the <lb/>
            story of his life. These notices are introduced incidentally <lb/>
            and in no ostentatious manner. They come in quite natur­ <lb/>
            ally, and without offence to good taste.</p>
          <p>From them we learn that Horace's father was a libertinus, <lb/>
            or freed slave, a member of the Horatia tribus in Apulia, <lb/>
            as is supposed-hence the name. The future poet was <lb/>
            born in 65 B.C. at Venusia, now Venosa, in Apulia, on the <lb/>
            confines of Lucania, and so he says of himself " Lucanus <lb/>
            an Appulus anceps." Why he was called Flaccus is not <lb/>
            known. As his father gained his freedom before the boy's <lb/>
            birth, young Horace was an ingenuus, or freeborn Roman <lb/>
            citizen.</p>
          <p>His father was a coactor, that is, either a collector of <lb/>
            taxes for the state, or one who took the payments at auction <lb/>
            sales. Whatever his occupation may have been, he seems <lb/>
            to have early laid past a little money, which enabled him to <lb/>
            buy a small property at Venusia, and to give his son the <lb/>
            education of a Roman gentleman.1 We know nothing of his <lb/>
            mother individually. She had probably died when he was <lb/>
            very young. At all events he makes no reference to her, <lb/>
            except as one of his parents, with whom he was quite <lb/>
            content, and whom he would not have changed for greater <lb/>
            and richer ones if he had had the choice.2 She may have <lb/>
            been to him the type of that Apulian woman whom he <lb/>
            praises in Epode ii. 39, sqq. <note type="footnote"> 1 On this point read the son's beautiful tribute to his father's good <lb/>
            sense and kindly care in SatA, I. vi., lines 65 to 92. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See Sat., Bk. I. vi. 93, sqq. </note> <pb n="X"/>
             </p>
          <p>Horace's early education was conducted at Rome under <lb/>
            Orbilius Pupillus of "thrashing notoriety," with whom he <lb/>
            studied grammar and some of the old Latin authors. He <lb/>
            also read Homer with the same master, and acquired with <lb/>
            various teachers some of the modern accomplishments" <lb/>
            of those days, such as music and rhetoric.</p>
          <p>But Horace's father was not content that his son should <lb/>
            finish his education under Orbilius. Athens was in those <lb/>
            days the University of the world, and to Athens accord­ <lb/>
            ingly the lad was sent, when he was about twenty years <lb/>
            of age, to study philosophy and literature, and to improve <lb/>
            himself in Greek. There he met many young men belonging <lb/>
            to the best families in Rome, pursuing their higher education <lb/>
            as he was, and with some of them he formed a lifelong <lb/>
            friendship. There, also, the tenor of his life was suddenly <lb/>
            changed by the events that followed on the assassination of <lb/>
            Julius Cæsar.</p>
          <p>Brutus and Cassius called at Athens on their way to <lb/>
            the Eastern Provinces which had been assigned them, and <lb/>
            while Cassius went on to Syria, Brutus loitered for a time <lb/>
            in the city ostensibly to hear the lectures of some of the <lb/>
            philosophers, but really, it would seem, to enlist on the re­ <lb/>
            publican side as many as possible of the " young bloods" <lb/>
            of Rome then "in residence." It was here that Horace <lb/>
            received his appointment as Military Tribune, for which <lb/>
            he was by no means fit. But his soldier life was of short <lb/>
            duration. The battle of Philippi took place in 42 B.C., <lb/>
            and there he was obliged to run for his life, like others, <lb/>
            and leave his shield behind, as he tells us in apparent <lb/>
            soberness, though it may be a mere joke against himself. <lb/>
            He is the only authority for the occurrence of the un­ <lb/>
            soldierly act. Before he was called off with Brutus to the <lb/>
            war he is said to have visited many parts of Greece, to which <lb/>
            he has made some passing references in his writings.</p>
          <p>When Brutus and Cassius were defeated by Octavianus <lb/>
            and Antony, and the Republican party were thoroughly <lb/>
            discredited, and the men of law and order came into power, <lb/>
            an amnesty was proclaimed, and under its kindly leave <lb/>
            Horace among many others returned to Rome. But he came <lb/>
            back penniless and fatherless, as his property at Venusia <lb/>
             <pb n="XI"/>
            had been confiscated, and his good old father had passed <lb/>
            away, probably during his absence. But curiously enough <lb/>
            he does not refer to the sad event, as we should have expected.</p>
          <p>For some time after his return to Rome he seems to have <lb/>
            supported himself by " writing, for the booksellers," pieces <lb/>
            of a satirical kind which made him many enemies. But <lb/>
            ere long he gained the post of Scribe or Quæstor's clerk, <lb/>
            either by purchase or by the interest of friends. Greater <lb/>
            prosperity, however, was in store for him. He was intro­ <lb/>
            duced to Maecenas by Virgil and Varius, probably about <lb/>
            40 B.C.1 It was nine months, he tells us, before Maecenas <lb/>
            invited him to his house, but when he once became a guest, <lb/>
            he made his way to the heart of the Minister almost imme­ <lb/>
            diately, and from that time forth the friends were all in all <lb/>
            to each other till death separated them. During the next <lb/>
            year after this he formed one of the party which made the <lb/>
            famous "Journey to Brundusium," the events of which are <lb/>
            duly recorded in Sat., I. v.</p>
          <p>Horace had a house in Rome, and a moderate 11 establish­ <lb/>
            ment " in which he could receive friends, even Maecenas, <lb/>
            with suitable appointments. But he much preferred a <lb/>
            country life, and so spent a large part of the year away <lb/>
            from the city. To this change of residence we owe his <lb/>
            beautiful and touching descriptions of scenery, and of <lb/>
            honest country people and their simple ways (Epode ii., <lb/>
            &amp;c.).</p>
          <p>On the other hand, he takes no pains to conceal his dislike <lb/>
            of the din and bustle of mighty Rome, and of the vice and <lb/>
            frivolity of life in the city as compared with the purity of <lb/>
            morals and staidness of character of the peasantry (Ode iii. 6). <lb/>
            The passages in which he treats of the worries of town life <lb/>
            and the joys of the country are among the most charming in <lb/>
            his writings.</p>
          <p>It was about 33 or 32 B.C. that Maecenas gave Horace a <lb/>
            present of the small Sabine estate, or farm, to which he <lb/>
            so often makes reference. It lay mostly in the valley of <lb/>
            Ustica, about 30 miles from Rome, 12 from Tibur, and 4 <lb/>
            from Varia, the nearest small town or village. Its quiet <lb/>
            seclusion had a great attraction for the poet, whom it always <note type="footnote"> 1 See Sat., I. vi. 54, sqq. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="XII"/>
            if set up " again when wearied with society in Rome, and with <lb/>
            all the turmoils and interruptions of the busy town. There <lb/>
            he seems to have spent the happiest days of his life.1 On <lb/>
            the farm he had a steward, eight slaves, and five resident <lb/>
            families.</p>
          <p>His style of living both in Rome and at his Sabine farm <lb/>
            was simple, frugal, and temperate. In the country he <lb/>
            employed his time in reading, writing, strolling about and <lb/>
            enjoying the hills, the streams, the woods, and doing a little <lb/>
            on his farm or in his garden. He revels in the pleasures of <lb/>
            the place, and speaks with deep affection of the fountain of <lb/>
            Bandusia, the stream Digentia, the rocks, the glens, the <lb/>
            lowing oxen, and the browsing goats. He was a lover of <lb/>
            nature in all her aspects, and he had a kindly heart for man <lb/>
            and for beast. Praeneste, Tibur, and Baiæ were favourite <lb/>
            places with him for a temporary residence. See his own <lb/>
            description of his life in the city in Sat., I. vi. 112, sqq.</p>
          <p>In one of his touching Odes (Bk. II. xvii.) he declares <lb/>
            that when Maecenas dies he will not remain behind­ <lb/>
            they will take the last journey together; and so it came <lb/>
            to pass that Horace died only a few weeks after his faithful <lb/>
            friend and patron, to whom he delighted to address ode <lb/>
            after ode. They were buried near one another on the <lb/>
            Esquiline Hill. Maecenas introduced Horace to Augustus, <lb/>
            and with him also the poet became a favourite. It was <lb/>
            at the request of the Emperor that Horace composed the <lb/>
            Carmen Saeculare for the celebration of the games of 17 B.C. <lb/>
            Of this duty he was,, no doubt, justly proud. Augustus <lb/>
            wished him to become his private secretary, but he declined <lb/>
            on the ground of health.</p>
          <p>In person he was small of size, and in advancing years <lb/>
            rather stout. In youth his hair was black, but he became <lb/>
            early grey: his eyes were weak and liable to inflammation. <lb/>
            As a young man he was attentive to his appearance, <lb/>
            Quern tenues decuere togæ nitidique capilli, <lb/>
            but grew rather careless as life advanced. His temper, by <lb/>
            his own account, was hasty, but he was easily appeased. <note type="footnote"> 1 See Sat. II. vi. 60, sqq., and Epistles, I. xvi. 5, sqq. </note> <lb/>

            He had his faults and failings, but even these still leaned to <lb/>
            virtue's side. In some of the Odes he seems to represent <lb/>
            himself as a libertine, but these are thought to be mere <lb/>
            imitations of his Greek models, and not applicable to his own <lb/>
            life. He never married.</p>
          <p>Horace does not pose as a man superior to his neigh­ <lb/>
            bours, though he says 11 Odi profanum vulgus," in a special <lb/>
            application : nor does he bore us with his own affairs, but <lb/>
            gives us only so much that we should like to hear more. <lb/>
            He often refers to his humble origin, and also to his being <lb/>
            the friend of the rich and great, but never in such a way as <lb/>
            that we should be inclined to dub him either a " bully of <lb/>
            humility," on the one hand, or a tuft-hunter and a snob, on <lb/>
            the other. He is a plain, unsophisticated, sensible man, <lb/>
            who gains our confidence by the simple, quiet way in <lb/>
            which he refers to himself, his life, and his friends.</p>
          <p>The two or three occasions on which he speaks of him­ <lb/>
            self somewhat egotistically, as in Ode xx. Book II., and <lb/>
            Ode xxx. Book III., do not outweigh the general and <lb/>
            consistent character which he maintains for modest humility. <lb/>
            The former Ode seems to have been a mock heroic reply to <lb/>
            an invitation from Maecenas; and the latter a humorous <lb/>
            imitation of similar self-laudations by Sappho and Ennius.</p><pb n="xiv"/>

            <title type="sub">INTRODUCTION.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>It has been stated in the Life of Horace that after his <lb/>
            schoolboy days were over he went to Athens to pursue <lb/>
            higher studies in philosophy, and to cultivate a more <lb/>
            thorough knowledge of Greek Literature. In following out <lb/>
            the latter object, he seems to have read much of that Lyric <lb/>
            poetry of which Alcæus and Sappho were leading repre­ <lb/>
            sentatives, and which, it would appear, had a special charm <lb/>
            for him. This, as it turned out, gained him his lasting fame.</p>
          <p>When the desire took hold of him to adapt the strains of <lb/>
            Italy to the Æolian Muse we know not, as he has not told <lb/>
            us; but it would seem that he had written much after his <lb/>
            return to Rome before he began to transfer the metres and <lb/>
            subjects of the Greek Lyricists into Latin Odes. The <lb/>
            improvement in his style of writing, which arose from his <lb/>
            great practice in satiric composition, induced him, it is said, <lb/>
            to put forth all his powers in Lyric poetry, as suiting his taste, <lb/>
            and as being a novelty in Rome. This he did for seven <lb/>
            years. In the first six he sent forth the first three books of <lb/>
            the Odes. A fourth followed soon afterwards. These Odes, <lb/>
            being the product of his riper years, are generally considered <lb/>
            to be the most perfect and most polished of his writings, in <lb/>
            the matter of form at least. They give proof of maturity of <lb/>
            mind and judgment, of a keen insight into life and its <lb/>
            important conditions and relationships, rather than of poetic <lb/>
            inspiration of the highest type, or of exuberant imagination. <note type="footnote"> b </note> <pb n="XVIII"/>
             </p>
          <p>In the Odes the language is generally polished, the <lb/>
            thoughts lucid in conception, the diction terse, and the <lb/>
            metres remarkable for beauty and harmony. But occasion­ <lb/>
            ally we meet with phrases and sentences of a prosaic kind, <lb/>
            and with extravagances inconsistent with Horace's usual <lb/>
            good taste. When Horace speaks from the heart and with <lb/>
            his natural fire, as he does in Odes of a national and patriotic <lb/>
            kind, such as the second of the First Book, he rises to real <lb/>
            beauty and even to grandeur; but if his subject has been <lb/>
            proposed to him, and he is expected to write " to order," the <lb/>
            result is very different:—and naturally so, as common sense <lb/>
            and experience will readily admit it must be.</p>
          <p>Horace's first attempts would necessarily be translations, <lb/>
            or at least mere imitations, of his Greek models. Others <lb/>
            are independent compositions in Greek fashion, and others <lb/>
            again original subjects from the public life of Rome and <lb/>
            Italy, or on the private affairs of his friends.</p>
          <p>The Odes may be classified as follows: (i) national and <lb/>
            patriotic; (2) friendly; (3) amatory. There are many others <lb/>
            of a miscellaneous kind, dealing with the beauties of the <lb/>
            country; with virtues, personal and social, with old Roman <lb/>
            character and heroism, and with ancient legends of gods and <lb/>
            men. It is in the first of these that Horace appears to most <lb/>
            advantage. In them he breathes forth in words of fire his <lb/>
            ardent love of fatherland and home; he proclaims with <lb/>
            honest pride the past glories of the state; and with un­ <lb/>
            bounded admiration he recalls the uprightness and the <lb/>
            honesty of the good old days. On the other hand, he <lb/>
            deprecates in sad and warning tones the defection from <lb/>
            ancient standards which he sees is taking place, the decay <lb/>
            in morals and in military spirit, and the deterioration of his <lb/>
            fellow-citizens in all those qualities which went in olden <lb/>
            times to form a Roman of the highest type.</p>
          <p>But he is little less happy when he dwells on the charms <lb/>
            of rural life and scenes, as in the second Epode, of modera­ <lb/>
             <pb n="XIX"/>
            tion, of contentment, of the shortness and uncertainty of <lb/>
            life, and the inevitable foot of Death, " which knocks alike <lb/>
            at poor man's hut and prince's hall." He felt what he <lb/>
            said, and the genuine feeling of a right-thinking man must <lb/>
            always show itself to advantage in what he writes. The <lb/>
            teaching and the practice of his excellent father had much to <lb/>
            do with the creation in the poet of that respect for goodness <lb/>
            and that contempt for tinsel and sham which Horace so <lb/>
            powerfully expresses. His love for the country, his inter­ <lb/>
            course with the simple-minded, self-reliant, and pure-living <lb/>
            peasantry of the Sabine hills, fostered and intensified in him <lb/>
            that spirit of sturdy independence and of admiration for <lb/>
            the good and noble which characterises his best poems. <lb/>
            On the other hand, the tendency which that spirit has always <lb/>
            shown to degenerate into vulgarity, rudeness, and bluster, <lb/>
            was kept down in him by his kindly nature, by his rational <lb/>
            common sense, and by the refined society of that literary <lb/>
            circle in which he moved at Rome.</p>
          <p>His amatory verses, though pretty and graceful, and <lb/>
            sometimes exquisite in thought and expression, are wanting <lb/>
            in depth of fervour, of devotion, and of high moral feeling. <lb/>
            This is no doubt largely owing to the fact that they are, for <lb/>
            the most part, mere adaptations of Greek poems, and did <lb/>
            not spontaneously flow out from his own head or heart to <lb/>
            any real person towards whom he had the honourable and <lb/>
            sincere feeling of love. A few (a very few) of them, again, <lb/>
            are offensive, both in tone and wording.</p>
          <p>In Odes to friends, however, Horace is more at home <lb/>
            than in those just referred to. These have the true ring of <lb/>
            genuine affection and heartiness of feeling. As an example <lb/>
            of this, the Ode to Varus (II. vii.) may be instanced. In it <lb/>
            there is no reserve in his joyous welcome, no halting in his <lb/>
            words of friendly greeting, and no stint or grudge in the <lb/>
            offer of his cask of wine. His whole soul is filled with the <lb/>
            earnest desire to receive his old companion in arms with the <lb/>
             <pb n="XX"/>
            warmest hospitality, and to do him every honour. He is <lb/>
            even prepared " to play the fool a bit" at this happy meeting. <lb/>
            His Odes to Maecenas, Virgil, Varius, and others of his <lb/>
            intimate friends, are equally hearty and sincere. In such <lb/>
            as these his lovable nature shines brightly out in every line.</p>
          <p>No less apparent is the master hand when he descants on <lb/>
            Nature in her soft and gentle form, or in her wilder moods <lb/>
            of storm by land or sea. He speaks with rapture of <lb/>
            Bandusia and its icy draughts; of brooks that hurry down <lb/>
            their tortuous course with babbling noise; of meadows with <lb/>
            their velvet sward and new-blown flowers; of cool and <lb/>
            winding glens where goats have shelter from the Dog-Star <lb/>
            heat; of lovely Tibur with its woods and wimpling rills; of <lb/>
            soft Tarentum and its climate's charms; and of Galæsus' <lb/>
            peaceful stream, "dear to the coated sheep." He speaks, <lb/>
            too, of Garganus' oaks lashed by the eastern gale ; of restless <lb/>
            Hadria and its mountain waves to fury roused by tyrant <lb/>
            Auster and his boisterous squalls; of the torrent river with <lb/>
            destructive flood; of Mount Soracte and its snow-clad <lb/>
            peak; and of Caucasus, whose cliffs and frosts and snows <lb/>
            repel the foot of man. Whatever be his subject, Horace is <lb/>
            natural, moderate in tone, graphic in description.</p>
          <p>It is little to be wondered at that Horace is a favourite <lb/>
            with all his readers, and that his memory is cherished as <lb/>
            that of one whom we have intimately known, and whom we <lb/>
            still fondly love. His works are a storehouse of maxims <lb/>
            for everyday life, and of quotations fitted for use in almost <lb/>
            every department and every phase of human action. <pb n="-"/>

            spring and zephyrs, and now the rollers draw to sea the <lb/>
            dried-up hulls, and neither do the kine delight in stalls nor <lb/>
            ploughmen in the fire: nor are the meadows white with <lb/>
            hoary frost. Now Venus of Cythera freely trains her choirs, <lb/>
            the silver moon overhead, and lovely Graces, hand in hand <lb/>
            with Nymphs, beat earth in time with rhythmic feet, while <lb/>
            Vulcan, in his eager zeal, makes all the heavy forges1 <lb/>

            leafy myrtle, or with the flowers which loosened earth <lb/>
            supplies. Now is it meet within the shady groves to offer <lb/>
            gifts to Faunus, whether he demand a lamb or rather choose <lb/>
            a kid.</p>
          <p>Pale Death, with foot that favours not, knocks equally at <lb/>
            poor man's hut and prince's hall. 0 Sestius, blessed in your <lb/>
            lot, life's brief and fleeting span forbids the hope of long <lb/>
            delay. Soon darkness shall overcome you, and the shadowy <lb/>
            Manes and Pluto's bare and narrow home: and when you <lb/>
            once go there, no more shall you obtain by dice the lordship <lb/>
            of the feast, nor with rapt gaze admire the youthful Lycidas, <lb/>
            with whom already every man is charmed, and whom the <lb/>
            maidens too will ere long fondly love. <note type="footnote"> 1 " Heavy forges." " Heavy " as applied to a forge or smith's shop, <lb/>
            is a very inappropriate epithet. It seems to me that Horace has taken <lb/>
            this idea from Virgil, Æneid, viii., 451, gemit impositis incudibus <lb/>
            antrum, the cave groans under the anvils placed (on their blocks);" <lb/>
            and that he means not the forges, but the " anvils," using the " whole <lb/>
            for a part," the anvil being the most important item of the smith's <lb/>
            utensils. " Urit officinas,"—" makes the anvils blaze" will not seem <lb/>
            strange to one who has ever seen a bar of red-hot iron laid on an anvil <lb/>
            and hammered by sledges. </note></p><pb n="6"/>

            either by fire or in the waves of Hadria. Nor Cybele, nor <lb/>

            over now. Henceforth I will forego my bitter grudge, and <lb/>
            will forgive, for sake of Mars, my hated grandson, whom <lb/>
            Trojan priestess bore : him will I allow to reach these realms <lb/>
            of light, to drink the juice of nectar, and to be enrolled <lb/>
            among the peaceful ranks of gods. So long as wide and <lb/>
            stormy seas shall roll 'twixt Ilium and Rome let exiled sons <lb/>
            of Troy reign prosperous where'er they please: so long as <lb/>
            cattle tread on Priam's and on Paris' tomb, and wild beasts <lb/>
            there in safety hide their young, let the proud Capitol stand <lb/>
            forth in glittering pomp, and let the martial Rome give laws <lb/>
            to conquered Medes. Let her, a dreaded power, extend her <lb/>
            fame to those far-distant coasts, where the dividing flood parts <lb/>
            Europe from the Afric shore, where swollen Nile o'erflows <lb/>
            the plains; braver in scorning gold un-mined-so is it <lb/>
            better placed when hid in Earth-than in turning it to <lb/>
            human needs with sacrilegious hands that nothing sacred <lb/>
            spare. Whatever bounds have to the world been set, these <lb/>
            shall she reach in arms, eager to see those parts where <lb/>
            blazing heat revels unchecked, where clouds prevail, and <lb/>
            soaking rains. But to Quirites, famed in war, their fate I <lb/>
            tell on these my terms, that in excess of love, and over­ <lb/>
            confident in strength, they seek not to rebuild th' ancestral <lb/>
            walls of Troy. Troy's fortunes, born again with evil omen, <lb/>
            shall be repeated in disaster bitter as before, I, sister and <lb/>
            spouse of Jove heading my conquering bands. Thrice were <lb/>
            a wall of brass to rise by Phoebus' aid, thrice should it fall, <lb/>
            by Argives levelled to the ground; thrice should the captive <lb/>

            rather, with clear and tuneful voice, or on the strings of <lb/>

            worn out by play, and overcome by sleep, the woodland <lb/>
            doves of storied fame covered with leaves on Voltur's slope, <lb/>

            slew with descending bolt the Titans and the giant host. <lb/>
            That band of youths of horrid form had caused to Jove great <lb/>
            dread, relying on their strength of arm, and the fell brothers <lb/>
            too, who sought to place Mount Pelion on Olympus with its <lb/>
            shady woods. But what could bold Typhœus do, and <lb/>
            sturdy Mimas ? or what, Porphyrion in attitude of fight? what <lb/>
            could Rhcetus, and Enceladus,—a daring spearman with <lb/>
            whole trunks up-torn,-avail against the sounding shield <lb/>
            of Pallas ? Here Vulcan stood, for battle keen : there <lb/>

            Hadria's Gulf is when the sky is black, and how deceitful <lb/>
            is Iapyx when serene. Let wives and children of our <lb/>

            see the deep swarming with monsters, and dangers all <lb/>

            weaving for the nymphs a promised wreath, now in a dusky <lb/>
            night she nothing saw but stars and waves. Then soon as <lb/>
            she arrived in Crete, in countless cities strong : 11 Father," <lb/>
            she said, " 0 name of daughter left behind, and filial love <lb/>

            mock me still free from stain of guilt? Was it a more <lb/>

            amongst lions ! Before some wasting blight should seize <lb/>
            my comely cheeks, and ere the sap should from the tender <lb/>
            prey descend,1 I seek while blooming still for tigers to be <lb/>
            food. And thus my father in his distant home urges his <lb/>
            wish: 0 base Europa, why do you delay to die ? With <lb/>
            maiden's belt, so luckily brought forth, you may disjoint <lb/>
            your neck hung from this very ash. Or if the rocks and <lb/>
            cliffs, all edged for death, delight you more, come, to the <lb/>

          <p>Here Venus, with a roguish smile, stood by the wailing <lb/>
            maid, and Cupid too, with bow unstrung. Then, when of <lb/>

            in air on waxen wings secured by art of Daedalus, destined <lb/>
            ere long to give the glassy deep a noted name. Just as a <lb/>

            above its wonted banks, even so doth Pindar boil and onward <lb/>
            rush with vast, unfathomable tide of song, worthy to be gifted <lb/>
            with Apollo's bays, whether in daring dithyrambs he tumbles <lb/>

            bears Jove's bolts-to whom the King of Gods has given <lb/>

            winds of spring (the winter storms now past) have taught, <lb/>
            though timid still, unwonted efforts of the wing, and whom a <lb/>
            lightning swoop soon hurls on sheepfolds as a deadly foe, but <lb/>
            whom again the love of feast and fight has now against the <lb/>
            wriggling serpents forced: or as a lion, fresh from the udder <lb/>
            of his tawny dam and of his milk deprived, whom the goat on <lb/>
            joyous herbage bent has just caught sight of when on the <lb/>
            point of falling victim to his virgin tooth : such as him, the <lb/>
            Rhaetian Vindelici saw Drusus as he warred beneath the <lb/>
            Alpine heights; whose custom-whence it came I failed to <lb/>
            ask, nor is it right that all things we should know-equips <lb/>
            their hands against the foe through every age with Amazonian <lb/>

            tellect could do, what talents fostered in a happy home, what <lb/>
            Caesar's love, warm as a father's to the Neros, could effect. <lb/>
            From brave and good the brave and good are sprung : the <lb/>

            culture nerves the heart. As soon as public morals fail <lb/>
            vices degrade fair nature's worth. What debt you, Romans, <lb/>
            to the Neros owe, Metaurus river testifies, and Hasdrubal <lb/>
            o'erthrown, and that great day for Latium bright, the gloom <lb/>
            dispelled, which was the first to smile with blessed victory, <lb/>
            ever since the dreaded African rushed through Italian <lb/>
            towns as fire through pines, or Eurus o'er Sicilian waves. <lb/>
            Thereafter Roman youth grew more successful in their bold <lb/>
            exploits, and temples wasted by impious Punic raids, again <lb/>
            received their gods erect, and then at length the faithless <lb/>
            Hannibal thus spoke; as stags, the prey of ravening wolves, <lb/>
            we needlessly pursue the men whom to elude by flight is <lb/>
            triumph rare. That race which tossed on Tuscan seas bore <lb/>
            bravely on to Italy from flaming Troy their gods, their sons, <lb/>
            and aged sires, like oak lopped by the sturdy axe in Algidus <lb/>
            where dusky leaves abound, through losses and through <lb/>
            wounds derives new strength and spirit from the very steel. <lb/>
            Not sounder did the Hydra, cut in twain, grow ever and <lb/>
            anon 'gainst Hercules, who brooked not to be foiled, nor <lb/>
            did the Colchians, or Echion's Thebes produce a greater <lb/>
            wonder. Plunge it in the depths, it comes forth brighter <lb/>
            than before; strive with it, amidst great applause it will <lb/>
            overthrow the victor, fresh and strong, and will wage wars, <lb/>
            for wives to speak of. No more, now, shall I send to <lb/>
            Carthage boastful news; fallen, fallen, are all the hope and <lb/>
            fortune of our name with fall of Hasdrubal.</p>
          <p>There's nothing that the Claudian line cannot effect, <lb/>
            which Jupiter himself with power benign defends, and <lb/>

            die, which I, born on the banks of roaring Aufidus, adapt to <lb/>
            music of the lyre by arts unknown before ;-though Homer <lb/>
            of Maeonian stock obtains the foremost place, yet the <lb/>
            Pindaric and the Cean Muse, and strains of bold Alcaeus, <lb/>
            which threatened tyrant kings, and stately lines of old <lb/>
            Stesichorus retain their fame: nor has Time destroyed <lb/>
            Anacreon's sportive lays of long ago :-love still breathes <lb/>
            fresh, and passions live still warm, confided to the lyre of <lb/>
            the Aeolian maid. To love not Argive Helen only was <lb/>
            inflamed by gallant's well-trimmed locks, and gold be­ <lb/>
            spangled robes, and by array of royal pomp; nor was <lb/>
            Teucer first to aim his arrows from Cydonian bow; nor <lb/>
            was a Troy but once besieged.</p>
          <p>Idomeneus, in battle strong, and Sthenelus the brave, were <lb/>
            not the only chiefs who fought great battles worthy to be <lb/>
            sung; nor was the fearless Hector or Deiphobus of mettle <lb/>
            keen, the first to feel a fatal wound for children and for <lb/>
            faithful wife. Before King Agamemnon's day brave men <lb/>
            were found in plenty, but all are whelmed in endless night, <lb/>
            unwept, unknown, because they lacked a sacred bard. <lb/>

            <title type="sub">I. THE SECULAR HYMN</title>
          </ab>
          <p>The Ludi Seculares were not held at the end of each <lb/>
            century, as the name would imply, but at irregular in­ <lb/>
            tervals, on the occurrence of some great event, or for the <lb/>
            purpose of marking an extraordinary epoch. The hymn <lb/>
            sung on such occasions was called the " Carmen Seculare." <lb/>
            Horace was chosen by Augustus as the " Poet Laureate " <lb/>
            at the celebration of the Ludi in B.C. 17 : and his poem <lb/>
            is not unworthy of the great Lyrist, or of the choice made <lb/>
            by the Emperor.</p>
          <p>These games seem to have been called the Ludi Taren­ <lb/>
            tini, or Terentini, or Taurii, in republican times, but <lb/>
            during the Empire the name was changed to Ludi <lb/>
            Seculares, or " Century Games." Their origin is by some <lb/>
            ascribed to Valerius Publicola, in 509-8 B.C. It is said <lb/>
            that they were instituted to avert a plague, and that they <lb/>
            were held in honour of Dis and Proserpina. From the <lb/>
            time of Valerius Publicola down to Augustus they were <lb/>
            held only three times, but there are no data to prove in <lb/>
            what year or on what occasion these celebrations took <lb/>
            place. No doubt they were held at this time to give eclat <lb/>
            and a sort of national sanction to the move which Caesar <lb/>
            had recently made in assuming supreme power, for a <lb/>
            second period.</p>
          <p>But this celebration by Augustus was very different <lb/>
             <pb n="92"/>
            from those of republican times. Dis and Proserpine who <lb/>
            in former days were the chief Deities were now relegated <lb/>
            to the very end of the list of those to whom sacrifices were <lb/>
            offered. The festival was held in summer and continued <lb/>
            for three days and three nights. On the first day, games <lb/>
            were held in the Tarentum, a part of the Campus Martius, <lb/>
            which, as it was said, had belonged to Tarquinius Superbus, <lb/>
            and sacrifices were offered to many of the gods. The <lb/>
            Emperor himself began the solemn part of the proceedings <lb/>
            at the second hour of the night by offering three lambs to <lb/>
            the Parcae, on three altars specially erected. The blood <lb/>
            of the victims was sprinkled on these and the carcases <lb/>
            were burned.</p>
          <p>A sort of theatre was constructed in the Tarentum in <lb/>
            which festive hymns were sung, and other ceremonies <lb/>
            performed, including theatrical pieces. " During the morn­ <lb/>
            ing of the first day the people went to the Capitol to offer <lb/>
            sacrifices to Jupiter; thence they returned to the Tarentum <lb/>
            to sing choruses in honour of Diana and Apollo. On the <lb/>
            second day the noblest matrons assembled on the Capitol, <lb/>
            performed supplications, sang hymns to the gods, and visited <lb/>
            the altar of Juno. The Emperor, and the Quindecemviri <lb/>
            (who kept the Sibylline books, and who had ordered this <lb/>
            celebration) offered sacrifices, which had been before <lb/>
            vowed, to the great Divinities. On the third day Greek <lb/>
            and Latin choruses were sung in the sanctuary of Apollo, <lb/>
            by three times nine boys and as many maidens of great <lb/>
            beauty whose parents were still alive." These hymns <lb/>
            implored the favour of the gods for all the interests of <lb/>
            the empire. One of these at the games of 17 B.C. was <lb/>
            the Carmen Seculare of Horace.</p>
          <p>In later times there were celebrations in the reigns of <lb/>
            Claudius and of Domitian. The last was that of Philippus, <lb/>
            A.D. 248. <pb n="93"/>

            <title type="sub">II. THE EPODES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>The term Epode designated, in later times, a poem in <lb/>
            which a shorter verse followed a longer one; strictly it <lb/>
            meant the shorter line only, which was a sort of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπῳδός</foreign> <lb/>
            or echo of the longer one. It is thus applied to any of <lb/>
            the odes included in this " Liber Epodon," or Liber v. <lb/>
            of the Odes. Horace himself calls these Odes not Epodes <lb/>
            but Iambi.</p>
          <p>The Epodes seem to have been written when Horace <lb/>
            was comparatively young, and about the same time as his <lb/>
            earliest Satires. They have certain characteristics in <lb/>
            common with the Satires, such as acerbity and animosity ; <lb/>
            but they do not deal in generalities like the Satires, they <lb/>
            delight rather in personalities, as in X. against Maevius, and <lb/>
            in IV. against some man of low birth and upbringing who <lb/>
            gave himself airs: and against Canidia and horrid rites. <lb/>
            No. XI. in praise of country life, and XVI. deploring the <lb/>
            misfortune and the sin of civil war, are of a totally different <lb/>
            type. Most of them would seem to have been written <lb/>
            between the battle of Philippi and that off Actium.</p><pb n="94"/>

            ornament of heaven, adored and still to be adored, 0 grant <lb/>
            what at this sacred time we ask, a time at which the Sibyl's <lb/>
            verses have advised that youths and maidens, choice and <lb/>
            pure, should sing a hymn in honour of the gods with whom <lb/>
            the Seven Hills have favour found.</p>
          <p>O bounteous Sun, who with thy glittering car dost usher <lb/>
            in the light and hide it too, and who from day to day com'st <lb/>
            forth afresh-another, yet the same, nought may'st thou ever <lb/>
            see more glorious than Rome. 0 Ilithyia, kind to make <lb/>
            way for timely births, preserve all mothers, whether thou <lb/>
            prefer'st Lucina as thy name, or wishest Genitalis. 0 God­ <lb/>
            dess, rear up for us a race of manly men, and with their aid <lb/>
            support the Senate's laws for female wedlock and for <lb/>
            marriage rites teeming with offspring, so that a perfect <lb/>
            cycle, ten times eleven years, may again bring round the <lb/>
            hymns, and again renew the sports with thronging crowds <lb/>
            for three bright days and three as pleasing nights. And <lb/>
            you, 0 Fates, truthful to tell what once has been decreed, <lb/>
            and what the changeless end confirms, join happy destinies <lb/>
            to those already past. Let Earth, which yields both fruits <lb/>
            and flocks, gift Ceres with a wreath of corn, and may refresh­ <lb/>
            ing rain and healthful breeze from upper air nourish the <lb/>
            produce of the fields.</p><pb n="95"/>
            
          <p>Apollo, mild and gentle with arrow laid aside, hear thou <lb/>
            the suppliant youths! 0 Moon, two-horned queen of stars, <lb/>
            the maidens hear! If Rome's your handiwork, and if the <lb/>
            bands of Troy gained footing on Etruscan shores-that <lb/>
            remnant bid to change, with safe career, their city and their <lb/>
            homes-for whom the good Æneas, saved from his country's <lb/>
            fall, secured an open way through burning Troy, unscathed <lb/>
            both he and they, to give them more than they had left <lb/>
            behind. Ye Gods, give upright morals to our willing youth, <lb/>
            give peace and quiet to their calm old age: give to the <lb/>
            race of Romulus prosperity, and offspring, and every honour. <lb/>
            And what the noble son of Venus and Anchises prays you <lb/>
            for to-day with snow-white bulls, let him obtain, in fight <lb/>
            superior, but gentle to the prostrate foe. The Parthian <lb/>
            now fears our armies powerful by land and sea, and to <lb/>
            our Alban fasces pays respect. And now the Scythian <lb/>
            and the Indian, lately proud, beg in humility to know our <lb/>
            sovereign will.</p>
          <p>Now Faith, and Peace, and Glory, and Purity of early <lb/>
            days, and Virtue, long in disrepute, dare to return, and <lb/>
            Plenty happy with her well-filled horn appears. May <lb/>
            Phœbus as our seer, decked with his glittering bow, by <lb/>
            the nine Muses loved, who by his healing art relieves <lb/>
            the body's wearied limbs, if with a kindly eye he views the <lb/>
            altars of the Palatine, prolong the Roman State and Latium's <lb/>
            weal for yet another lustrum and an ever happier age. And <lb/>
            may Diana hear, who in Mount Aventine and Algidus holds <lb/>
            sway, who heeds the Quindecemvirs' prayers, and to the <lb/>
            supplications of the young accords a friendly ear.</p>
          <p>We, the choir, taught to sing the praise of Phoebus and <lb/>
            Diana both, bear to our homes a sure and certain hope that <lb/>
            Jove and all the Gods with one consent approve our earnest <lb/>

          <p>O dear Maecenas, you mean to venture in Liburnian craft <lb/>
            among the towering Men-of-War, ready to face all Cæsar's <lb/>
            dangers at peril of your life. And what of me, to whom, <lb/>
            if you survive, existence is a joy,—if otherwise, a load? <lb/>
            Shall I, then, as you bid, pursue an easy life to give no <lb/>
            pleasure save with you—or shall I brave this toil with that <lb/>
            resolve which all but cowards ought ? I'll brave it, and with <lb/>
            a dauntless heart will follow you o'er Alpine heights; or over <lb/>
            savage Caucasus; or even to the farthest bay of western <lb/>
            shores. You well may ask how I can aid your labours by <lb/>
            my own, unwarlike as I am and void of strength? When <lb/>
            by your side I shall feel less the dread which haunts <lb/>
            the absent with more potent force : just as a bird when <lb/>
            waiting on her tiny brood fears more for them, when left, <lb/>
            the serpents' trail, not that were she near she present help <lb/>
            could lend. Right gladly will I serve in this and every <lb/>
            war for surer hope to gain your favour,-not that my plough <lb/>
            may strive and strain, when yoked to more and stronger <lb/>
            steers, or that my flocks before the Dog-Star heat may <lb/>
            change Apulian for Lucanian 11 runs ” nor that my country <lb/>

          <p>Happy is he, who far from business cares, like men in <lb/>
            early days, tills with his steers his fathers' fields, from every <lb/>
            usurer free: nor as a soldier is he startled by the brawling <lb/>
            trumpet note ; nor as a trader does he dread an angry sea; <lb/>
            he shuns the Courts of Law, and the proud portals of <lb/>
            citizens in power. And so he either weds the lofty poplar <lb/>
            to the saplings of the vine ; or in sequestered Vale surveys <lb/>
            his herds of cattle as they roam : or lopping with his knife <lb/>
            the useless boughs inserts more thriving grafts ; or in clean <lb/>
            jars he stores the honey from the combs withdrawn; or <lb/>
            shears the gentle sheep: or when the Autumn has from <lb/>
            the soil put forth its head with mellow fruit adorned, how <lb/>
            he delights to pluck the pears he grafted, and cull the grape <lb/>
            that rivals purple dye, with which your service to reward, <lb/>
            Priapus, and yours, father Silvanus, who the sacred land­ <lb/>
            marks guard. Sometimes he's pleased to lie beneath an <lb/>
            aged holm, sometimes upon the soft and matted grass.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile the water in deep channels flows: in the <lb/>
            woods the birds send forth their varied cries, and fountains <lb/>
            murmur with their welling rills, which light and gentle <lb/>
            slumber may invite.</p>
          <p>But when the winter time of thundering Jove collects <lb/>
            its snows and showers, either with many a dog on this side <lb/>
            and on that he drives the furious boars to the opposing <note type="footnote"> G </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="98"/>
            toils, or sets his wide-meshed nets with polished poles, <lb/>
            snares for the greedy thrush; or catches in his gin the <lb/>
            timid hare and cranes from over sea, a welcome prey. What <lb/>
            man is there who midst pursuits like these forgets not <lb/>
            worrying cares which love brings forth?</p>
          <p>But if a chaste and loving wife on her part keeps the <lb/>
            house and rears sweet children up, like Sabine dame or <lb/>
            sunburnt spouse of brisk Apulian, piling the sacred hearth <lb/>
            with seasoned wood against her wearied lord's return, <lb/>
            and shutting in the osier pen her healthy flock exhausts <lb/>
            their swelling teats: and drawing from the well-cleansed <lb/>
            cask the wine of this year's growth, prepares a homely meal: <lb/>
            no shell-fish from the Lucrine lake would please me more, <lb/>
            nor scar nor turbot, if a tempest howling over eastern waves <lb/>
            brings any to our sea: I would not eat with more delight <lb/>
            the guinea fowl, nor heathcock from Ionian moor, than <lb/>
            olives plucked from richest boughs or sorrel plant that loves <lb/>
            the meads, and mallows good for sickly frames, or lamb at <lb/>
            Terminalia slain, or kid just rescued from the ravening wolf.</p>
          <p>Amidst these feasts how nice it is to see the pastured <lb/>
            sheep all hurrying home: the wearied oxen dragging with <lb/>
            their languid necks th' inverted share, and the menials <lb/>
            seated round the glistening Lares, proof of a wealthy home ?</p>
          <p>When Alfius the usurer had spoken thus, intending all at <lb/>
            once to be a country squire, he called in all his money on <lb/>

            Apulia's arid plains: nor did the fatal gift more fiercely <lb/>

            from the woods their leafy honours since I gave o'er <lb/>
            my frenzied passion for Inachia dear. Ah me!—for I'm <lb/>

            ever on, and the olive boughs that never fail send forth their <lb/>
            buds, and the dusky fig adorns its native tree : from the <lb/>
            hollow oaks honey in plenty flows, and lightly the water from <lb/>
            the mountain heights descends with rippling stream. There <lb/>
            goats unbidden to the milking come, and the flocks for love <lb/>
            bring home their swollen teats: nor does the bear at even <lb/>

            rain, nor are the rich and fertile seeds burnt up by sapless <lb/>
            clods, for heaven's King checks each extreme. No ship with <lb/>

            toil: night treads on day, and day on night, nor have I <lb/>
            power by taking breath to ease my sore-strained lungs. <lb/>
            Then, to my grief, I'm forced to credit what I once denied, <lb/>
            that Sabine spells ring through the heart, and that the head <lb/>
            is split in twain by Marsian songs. What wish you more ? <lb/>

            unwelcome life must be spun out by you in misery, with <lb/>
            this intent, that to the end you may remain a fitting object <lb/>

            <title type="sub">INTRODUCTION.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Of the several derivations which have been suggested for <lb/>
            the term " Satira," the most feasible is that which refers it to <lb/>
            the adjective Satur, and especially to its use in the phrase <lb/>
            lanx satura, a dish filled with various first-fruits offered <lb/>
            to the gods. Hence, as applied to literary composition it <lb/>
            meant afarrago or medley-a gossipy talk on men and matters. <lb/>
            It is supposed to have had its origin in the humours of the <lb/>
            rude " Harvest Home " of the Italian peasants, at which they <lb/>
            indulged in off-hand jests and rough by-play, at the expense <lb/>
            of their neighbours. In course of time this rustic sport was <lb/>
            displaced by a regular poem, with singing and dialogue, and <lb/>
            so gradually developed into an After-Piece of a farcical kind, <lb/>
            called Exodium, acted in later years, as a separate perform­ <lb/>
            ance, after Tragedies.</p>
          <p>The Romans claimed Satire as " all their own." They had <lb/>
            no Greek model to go by, and no Greek Satiric Poems to <lb/>
            translate: but there is no doubt that the earliest writers of <lb/>
            Satire drew largely from the old Greek Comedy.</p>
          <p>Didactic Satire is said to be due to Ennius. Lucilius, how­ <lb/>
            ever, improved upon Ennius so much in every way that he <lb/>
            was called the "Inventor" of it. There were four chief <lb/>
            writers of Roman Satire—Lucilius and Horace, and their <lb/>
             <pb n="116"/>
            imitators, Juvenal and Persius, but it is with Horace only <lb/>
            that we have to deal.</p>
          <p>Horace was by nature and by choice a Satirist, and he <lb/>
            possessed many qualities which fitted him eminently for that <lb/>
            function. He had a wide knowledge of human nature in its <lb/>
            sober and also in its comic aspects: he was shrewd and <lb/>
            observant: he was possessed of strong common sense, great <lb/>
            penetration, clear discernment, and sound judgment. He <lb/>
            had a keen perception of the ludicrous and employed it most <lb/>
            effectively to ridicule the weaknesses of his fellow men, as <lb/>
            well as their faults and their follies. He took broad and <lb/>
            reasonable views of men and of things, and was free from <lb/>
            crotchets and prejudices. He saw even his own defects, <lb/>
            and did not shrink from bringing some of them, at least, <lb/>
            before his readers, through the mouth of his slave, Davus, <lb/>
            in the seventh Satire of the second Book,-one of the most <lb/>
            humorous and most amusing of the whole collection of these <lb/>
            “ Sermones," or " Satirae."</p>
          <p>It has been already stated1 that after the defeat of the <lb/>
            Republican Party at Philippi, Horace on his return to Rome <lb/>
            supported himself by writing, for the booksellers, pieces of a <lb/>
            Satirical kind, which unfortunately made him many enemies. <lb/>
            Following his great model, Lucilius, he began by being very <lb/>
            severe on his victims. But he soon had cause to feel that he <lb/>
            had taken a false step, and he was wise enough to change <lb/>
            his methods in time. He became more genial and more <lb/>
            humorous, and sketched men and their ways with a lighter <lb/>
            touch.</p>
          <p>His choice of Satiric Composition was a dangerous one <lb/>
            for a man who had belonged to the defeated Party of Brutus <lb/>
            and Cassius. Horace could not afford to speak with severity <lb/>
            of the leaders of the Imperialists; and thus no political Satire <lb/>
            is found in his writings. Social and literary topics are his only <note type="footnote"> 1 Life of Horace, p. ix. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="117"/>
            subjects. His Satiric powers were directed mainly against <lb/>
            the eccentricities and the vices of his countrymen, and the <lb/>
            corruptions of taste and of morals which crept in with the <lb/>
            increase of wealth. Avarice and money-grubbing, extrava­ <lb/>
            gance of living, profligacy, ostentation, pride, superstition, <lb/>
            witchcraft, legacy-hunting, and other phases of a degenerate <lb/>
            Age, as seen in a great and wealthy city, came freely under <lb/>
            his lash. But his lash is not too cutting and too personal. <lb/>
            His Satires are placed on an ethical basis : and he tries to <lb/>
            convince his readers, not by invective against the objects of <lb/>
            his censure, but rather by good-humoured raillery, and by <lb/>
            the ridicule of things stupid and perverse. Like his excellent <lb/>
            and prudent father he points out the true path of duty to all <lb/>
            by quoting examples of those who strayed from the right <lb/>
            track and came to ruin. His own gentle nature, together <lb/>
            with motives of policy, inclined him strongly to adopt a <lb/>
            moderate and even lenient tone in dealing with the blemishes <lb/>
            and the vices of his fellow-men. He is willing to look at <lb/>
            things in the best light and in the most indulgent spirit- <lb/>
            loath to wound, and willing to be pleased if possible. None <lb/>
            of the old Satirists were so genial and so measured in their <lb/>
            words as he. He was essentially kind-hearted and humane, <lb/>
            and did not wish to wound the feelings or the pride of any <lb/>
            living man. In this he was much assisted by the simple <lb/>
            method of not introducing the names of men known in <lb/>
            Rome in his own day, and of adopting, instead, those <lb/>
            already used by Lucilius. He also coined a few names <lb/>
            whose etymology might in some cases suggest the indi­ <lb/>
            vidual at whom his shafts were aimed, such as Porcius, the <lb/>
            "piggish feeder"; Philodemus the "People's Friend": <lb/>
            Pantolabus, the "Grab-all."</p>
          <p>In some of the so-called Satires there is no censure what­ <lb/>
            ever. The " Journey to Brundusium " indulges in no ridi­ <lb/>
            cule, unless it be in regard to the fussy Praetor of Fundi, <lb/>
             <pb n="118"/>
            and the superstition of the simple people of Egnatia. No. <lb/>
            IX. of Book I. is simply a jocular and cleverly told story of <lb/>
            the poet's sufferings from the intrusion of an intolerable <lb/>
            bore. This, in the opinion of most readers, is the gem of <lb/>
            the whole collection. Again Satire VI. of Book II. is a <lb/>
            laudation of the quiet and happiness of a country life as <lb/>
            contrasted with the rush and bustle and worries of a residence <lb/>
            in Rome. Hence the title of " Sermones " which Horace <lb/>
            applies to the Epistles as well as the Satires is certainly a <lb/>
            more appropriate one than Satires. It is equal to "Dis­ <lb/>
            courses," "Talk," "Prose Writings."</p>
          <p>The First Book of the " Sermones," or Satires, was given <lb/>
            to the public about 3 5 B.C., and seems to have brought <lb/>
            much undeserved odium on the poet. He started badly <lb/>
            with Satire II. of Book I., which is very bitter in tone. <lb/>
            Many men for whom it was not intended fancied that they <lb/>
            were aimed at. They felt that the cap fitted, and they put <lb/>
            it on, though the author had no intention of singling them <lb/>
            out for reproof. They, in turn, taunted him with his low <lb/>
            origin as a freedman's son. But this experience, as already <lb/>
            said, did him much good, and led to his after success.</p>
          <p>In Book I. Horace speaks mainly in his own person, but <lb/>
            in II. he expresses his views through selected characters, <lb/>
            such as Ulysses, Tiresias, Ofellus and others; a device <lb/>
            which gives more variety and more dramatic interest to the <lb/>
            several Pieces. For similar purposes he introduces fables, <lb/>
            stories, and other illustrative matter, which rest the mind <lb/>
            of the reader and relieve it from the strain of contemplat­ <lb/>
            ing without interruption, the childish follies and the insane <lb/>
            excesses of others : and which at the same time give point <lb/>
            and piquancy to the poet's criticisms. Thus to illustrate <lb/>
            his remarks on the respective merits of the city and the <lb/>
            country, he relates the well known fable of the Town <lb/>
            Mouse and the Country Mouse, with an elegance of ex­ <lb/>
             <pb n="119"/>
            pression and a choice of diction almost perfect. Again, <lb/>
            referring to his boyhood days, he pays a noble tribute to <lb/>
            his good old father for the unwearying care he took to <lb/>
            form his mind on right principles, and for the bold resolve <lb/>
            he made with regard to his education. Few things in <lb/>
            ancient literature are more grand or more touching than <lb/>
            this deserved acknowledgment by a grateful son to a far­ <lb/>
            seeing and unselfish parent.</p>
          <p>Book II., published probably about 30 B.C., shows more <lb/>
            of the work of a master hand than Book I. The judgment <lb/>
            is more mature, the tone more vivacious; the finish more <lb/>
            perfect, and clearness of statement more apparent. There <lb/>
            is also an air of greater dignity, and an evident conscious­ <lb/>
            ness of success, and of an assured position in literature.</p>
          <p>The moralist will find in Horace, and especially in the <lb/>
            " Sermones " a wondrous store of gems of practical wisdom <lb/>
            and maxims for the guidance of conduct: and the man of <lb/>
            the world may fill his capacious note-book with telling <lb/>
            quotations applicable to the affairs of everyday life in all <lb/>
            its phases. The works of Horace are a " possession for all <lb/>
            time," and will remain in favour with thoughtful and good <lb/>
            men through every age. A distinguished critic thus wrote <lb/>
            many years ago :—“ The Satires of Horace contain more <lb/>
            real good sense, sound morality, and true philosophy, than <lb/>
            perhaps any single work of heathen antiquity."</p><pb n="120"/>

          <p>Maecenas, how comes it, pray, that no one lives contented <lb/>
            with the lot which sober reason chose, or chance presented, <lb/>
            but each commends, instead, the men who follow other <lb/>
            paths ? 0 lucky trader! says the soldier, burdened with <lb/>
            years and broken down in body by his many toils. The <lb/>
            trader, when the south winds toss his bark, exclaims, War's <lb/>
            risks are better far. For why ? They close in battle-shock! <lb/>

            Cases like these, so many are they, would weary out long­ <lb/>

            what a test I'll bring the thing. If any god should say, <lb/>

            will never be so weak as lend their prayers an ear ?</p>
          <p>Besides, not to pass lightly on, as those who deal in <lb/>
            jest-though what prevents a man to speak the truth in <lb/>

            too who boldly scud o'er every sea, confess they hardships <lb/>
            bear with this intent, that in old age they may retire to ease <lb/>
            secure, when they have gained enough for life's support: <lb/>
            just as the tiny ant of mighty toil-for she's their model- <lb/>
            drags with her mouth whatever she can, and adds it to the <lb/>
            heap she piles, not unaware and not unmindful of the time <lb/>
            to come. Who, soon as Aquarius veils with his clouds <lb/>
            the year now turned, creeps nowhere forth, and wisely uses <lb/>
            former gains. But not so you, whom neither burning heat <lb/>
            can from your greedy earning move, nor winter's cold, nor <lb/>
            fire, nor sea, nor sword, nor aught in short withstands till <lb/>
            no one else is richer than yourself. What good is it to you, <lb/>
            thief like, to dig the earth and hide in it great hoards of silver <lb/>
            and of gold in trembling fear ? <note type="footnote"> 1 Others render, " I'll make you." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Nolint, " they wouldn't," is the apoaosis to "if any god should <lb/>

            than he who carried none. Or tell me, pray, in case of him <lb/>
            who guides his life by Nature's bounds, what matter is it if <lb/>
            he tills a thousand acres or five score ?</p>
          <p>Ah! but 'tis a pleasure in itself to draw from great <lb/>

          <p>While you consent that from my little heap I take as <lb/>
            much as you from yours, why do you laud your granaries <lb/>
            above my scanty store? As if you need a pail of water <lb/>
            only, or a glass, and were to say, Had I the choice, I'd <lb/>
            rather take the same amount from some great stream than <lb/>
            from this paltry well. And so it comes to pass, that those <lb/>
            who take delight in more than measure just, the rapid <lb/>
            Aufidus still carries down, swept with the bank away. But <lb/>
            whoso wishes merely what his little needs require, he is not <lb/>
            bound to draw the water mixed with mud, nor does he lose <lb/>
            his life among the waves.</p>
          <p>But the greater part of men, led by mistaken greed, <lb/>
            declare that Nothing is enough, because the more you <lb/>
            have the more you're prized." What can you do with such <lb/>
            a one? Wish him joy that he is wretched, since he is so <lb/>
            willingly: as at Athens once a mean and wealthy man was <lb/>
            wont to flout the people's talk—Men hiss me, but I applaud <lb/>
            myself at home when in the chest my coins I see. Tantalus <lb/>

            you do a painting! Know you not what money's for, what <lb/>
            purposes it serves ? It serves to buy your bread, your <lb/>
            cabbage and your pint of wine, and other things for want <lb/>
            of which man's nature sorely grieves. To lie awake half-dead <lb/>
            with fear, to live in terror of those horrid thieves by night <lb/>
            and day, of fires too, and of your slaves lest they rob you <lb/>

            my part I should like to be the poorest of the poor.</p>
          <p>But if your body, caught by chill, begins to ache in <lb/>
            every part, or if some other ailment keeps you to your bed, <lb/>
            you have a loving one to sit beside you, prepare your <lb/>

            neighbours and acquaintances, and even the boys and girls <lb/>
            in the streets, detest you. Do you wonder then, since you <lb/>
            give gold the foremost place, that no one shows affection <lb/>
            which you do not earn ? or that you lose your labour, <lb/>
            wretched man,—as one who trains a donkey for the race,­ <lb/>
            if you should wish to keep the love of kinsmen whom <lb/>
            Nature gives without your help, and to retain the other <lb/>
            friends1 you've made ? In a word, set limits to your gains, <lb/>
            and when you more have earned, fear poverty the less, and <lb/>
            having reached the sum you sought, begin to cease from <lb/>
            "toil and moil," lest that befall you which befell a man <lb/>
            Ummidius—the story is not long-so rich that by a measure <lb/>
            he would tell his gold, so mean that as a slave he dressed, <note type="footnote"> 1 The meaning is somewhat obscure. There are two classes of friends <lb/>
            referred to—(I) cognati, " relatives," uxor andfilius representing these, <lb/>
            (2) non rognati, i. e., vicini, pueri et puellae, denoting the rest. The <lb/>
            verb retinere seems to apply to cognati alone, and servare to the others. <lb/>
            If retinere and servare both apply to cognatos, what is the difference <lb/>
            in meaning ? Some MSS. have At si for An si. </note> <pb n="125"/>

            him. But him a female slave with axe-stroke cleft in <lb/>
            twain-the bravest she of the Tyndarid blood.</p>
          <p>What then do you advise? That I should live as <lb/>
            Maenius or as Nomentanus?</p>
          <p>There you go, placing side by side two things as fiercely <lb/>
            opposite as fighting bulls. When I dissuade you from a <lb/>
            misers life I do not ask you to become a sot or scamp. <lb/>
            There is a difference 'twixt Tanais and the father of Visel­ <lb/>
            lius' wife. There's a medium in all things : in fine, there <lb/>
            are due limits fixed, on this and that side which The Right <lb/>
            cannot find place.</p>
          <p>I now return to that from which I started-how comes it <lb/>
            that no one, as the miser does,1 approves his own pursuits, <lb/>
            but praises those who follow other paths, and pines through <lb/>
            envy that another's goat should bear a heavier udder than <lb/>
            does his, and fails to regard the throng of poorer men, but <lb/>
            strives to pass first one and then another? To one who <lb/>
            hastens thus a richer man still bars the way, just as when <lb/>
            the horses sweep from the post the started cars, the driver <lb/>
            presses on steeds before his own, despising him,2 that he <lb/>
            has passed, now going midst the ruck. Hence is it that <lb/>
            rarely do we find a man who says that he has spent a happy <lb/>
            life, and satisfied with years gone by, from the world retires, <lb/>
            like sated guest.</p>
          <p>Enough. I will not add another word, lest you should <lb/>
            think I've robbed the bookcase of blear-eyed Crispinus. <note type="footnote"> 1 On this disputed passage, see the commentators. The miser argues <lb/>

          <p>If of a third you ask why with ungrateful maw he wastes <lb/>

            he answers that he scorns to be a man of mean and niggard <lb/>
            mind. By some he's praised, by others blamed. Fufidius <lb/>
            dreads the names of sot and scamp, rich as he is in land, <lb/>
            rich in invested gold. Sixty per cent. he for his loan exacts, <lb/>
            and the deeper sunk the debtor is, the harder does he <lb/>
            press. The names of youths who've just assumed the <lb/>
            " manly gown," but still in rigid parents' care, he searches <lb/>
            out. Who, when he hears of this, does not exclaim, “Al­ <lb/>
            mighty Jove, oh! how is this ? But, just as he gains, <lb/>
            so on himself he spends. You scarce can credit the <lb/>

          <p>With singers 'tis a common fault that they never are <lb/>
            induced to sing, when asked, ’mongst friends-unasked, <lb/>
            they never cease. This was a way Tigellius had, who from <lb/>
            Sardinia came. Caesar, who could compel consent, would <lb/>
            not prevail the least if for his father's sake or for his own he <lb/>
            begged : but if his fancy bade, from egg to apple of the feast <lb/>
            he'd shout, 0 Bacchus, hail ! now in the deepest voice, <lb/>
            then in that note which sounds the shrillest of the tetra­ <lb/>
            chord. That fellow never had a particle of ballast: one time <lb/>
            he'd run as if he fled a foe; he'd often stalk as one who bore <lb/>
            gieat Juno's sacred trays ; he often kept two hundred slaves, <lb/>
            and often ten ; one time he'd talk of kings and tetrarchs as <lb/>
            his dearest friends, and speak of all things big: again he'd <lb/>
            say, Give me a three-legged table and a shell to hold my <lb/>
            salt and keep it clean, and a robe, however coarse, if it but <lb/>
            serve to drive away the cold. Though to this paragon of <lb/>
            thrift, pleased with a little, you gave ten thousand pounds,1 <lb/>
            within a week you would not find a copper in his chests. <lb/>
            Night upon night he'd lie awake till early dawn, then sleep <lb/>
            and snore the livelong day. Nothing on earth was ever so <lb/>
            at variance with itself.</p>
          <p>Some one now may say to me—What of yourself? Have <lb/>
            you no faults ? Yea verily, of different kind-less in degree <lb/>
            perhaps. When Maenius was reviling 2 absent Novius, Hark <lb/>
            you, says one, do you not know yourself, or do you think that, <lb/>
            as unknown, you can impose on us ? I for myself can <note type="footnote"> 1 " Ten thousand pounds," strictly about £8000, a definite sum put <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[SAT. III."/><lb/>
            find excuse, quoth Maenius. Self-love like this is silly, and <lb/>
            overweening, and worthy to be branded by the censor's <lb/>
            mark. When you with eyes inflamed and newly smeared <lb/>
            inspect your “beams with purblind look, why do you <lb/>
            scrutinise the “motes ” of friends, keen as an eagle or an <lb/>
            Argive snake ?1 But, on the other hand, it you befalls that <lb/>
            they in turn your sins and foibles closely scan. Some <lb/>
            friend is rather testy in his way, and little suited for the <lb/>
            cutting banter of our modern wits. He may provoke a smile <lb/>
            because his hair's ill trimmed, his toga hangs awry, his <lb/>
            shoes, by far too loose, scarce stick upon his feet. But yet <lb/>
            he is a worthy man—none better: he's your friend, and <lb/>
            under that exterior, rough as it is, a giant mind lies hid. In <lb/>
            fine, ransack your heart to find if Nature, long ago, or evil <lb/>
            habit, has implanted in you any seeds of vice: the fern, for <lb/>
            nought but burning fit, grows in neglected fields.</p>
          <p>Now let us first take heed to this, that dear ones' base <lb/>
            defects are hid from blinded lovers, or even these impart <lb/>
            delight, as Hagna's wen does to Balbinus. I could wish <lb/>
            that among friends we sinned like this, and that on errors <lb/>
            such as these good sense had stamped an honourable name. <lb/>
            But as a father does not loathe a son's defects, so ought <lb/>
            we not to loathe a friend's, if fault he has : the father says <lb/>
            his squinting son has got a " Venus cast of eye": the <lb/>
            boy who's very small, as dwarfish Sisyphus of old, he sur­ <lb/>
            names " Little Chick ": him with distorted legs he fondly <lb/>
            names " his Varus"; 11 his Scaurus " him whose weakly <lb/>
            ankles scarce support his weight. Say then a friend there <lb/>
            is who lives with niggard stint-let him be " frugal " called. <lb/>
            Another shows a want of tact and is to boasting rather <lb/>
            prone,-he wishes to appear to friends a witty man. But if <lb/>
            he's very gruff, and free beyond all bounds in speech, let <note type="footnote"> 1 "Argive snake," i.e., serpent of Epidaurus, in Argolis. </note> <pb n="129"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="24-79.]"/><lb/>
            him be deemed sincere and frank: he is hot-headed-­ <lb/>
            let him be ranked among the men of spirit. This kind <lb/>
            of thing, in my opinion, both links true friends and keeps <lb/>
            them linked. But even virtues we turn upside down, and <lb/>
            wish to foul a vessel clean and sweet. In our midst <lb/>
            there lives a man, upright and unassuming in his ways,­ <lb/>
            him we pronounce both dull and stupid. Another shuns <lb/>
            all snares, and to the ill-disposed ne'er shows an open flank, <lb/>
            since 'tis our lot to live in times when bitter envy reigns and <lb/>
            calumny is rife—him we dub hypocrite and cunning knave, <lb/>
            and not, a man of good sound sense and prudent caution. <lb/>
            One is rather artless, such as I have often shown myself to <lb/>
            you Mæcenas; and ne'er had cause to rue it,1 so that-the <lb/>
            bore—he’d worry with his random talk one reading, haply, <lb/>
            or deeply sunk in silent thought; of such we say, he <lb/>
            plainly wants the social sense !2 Alas ! how rashly we <lb/>
            approve a law that tells against ourselves. No man is <lb/>
            born without defects: he is the best who is beset <lb/>
            with least. Let pleasant friends weigh, as they ought, <lb/>
            my good points 'gainst the bad; to the former which <lb/>
            are most (if most indeed they are) let them incline, if they <lb/>
            themselves wish to be loved. On this condition they shall <lb/>
            be weighed in the same balance as myself. He who <lb/>
            expects not to disgust his friend by wens will readily <lb/>
            forgive the other's warts : 'tis only fair that he who seeks <lb/>
            indulgence should give it in return. In fine, since vice of <lb/>
            temper, like other faults in fools innate, cannot be wholly <lb/>
            rooted out, why does not Reason use true weights and <lb/>

            primal earth, a speechless and a grovelling herd, for acorns <lb/>
            and for lairs they fought with nails and fists, and then <lb/>
            with clubs, and later on with arms which need had forged, <note type="footnote"> 1 With neck exposed like that of a gladiator awaiting the sword of <lb/>

            till they invented words and names by which to voice their <lb/>
            sounds, and tell their thoughts: thereafter they began to <lb/>
            cease from war, to build their towns, and make their laws <lb/>
            -that no one thieve or rob or take his neighbour's wife. <lb/>
            For long ere Grecian Helen lived, lust was a vilest cause <lb/>
            of war, but those were carried off by deaths unknown, <lb/>
            whom, seizing lawless love like beasts, the man of greater <lb/>
            strength subdued, just as the bull does in the herd of kine. <lb/>
            We must confess that laws were made through fear of wrong, <lb/>
            if you unroll the dates and records of the world. Nor can <lb/>
            Nature separate unjust from just, as she divides good from <lb/>
            its opposite, things to be sought from those we ought to <lb/>
            shun : nor will Reason prove that he is guilty, in like man­ <lb/>
            ner and degree, who breaks his neighbour's colewort, and <lb/>
            he who steals by night the sacred vessels of the gods. Let <lb/>
            some fixed rule exist which shall assign fair punishments to <lb/>
            faults, so that you do not mangle with the horrid scourge him <lb/>
            who is only worthy of the " strap." I have no fear that you <lb/>
            will punish with the cane him who deserves a greater lash, <lb/>
            since you declare that thefts and robberies are on a par, and <lb/>
            threaten that with self-same knife you will cut down the <lb/>
            great faults and the small, if men will let you have your <lb/>
            way.</p>
          <p>If he who is wise is rich, and good at cobbling too, and <lb/>
            alone the handsome man, and king to boot, why do you <lb/>
            wish for what you have? You know not then what old <lb/>
            Chrysippus says—“The wise man never made his slippers or <lb/>
            his shoes, but yet the wise man is a cobbler." How so ? <lb/>
            Just as Hermogenes, though silent, is the best of singers, and <lb/>
            composers too: just as Alfenus, crafty wight, when he had <lb/>
            shut his shop and cast away his tools, remained a barber still; <lb/>
            so the wise man is alone the best artificer in every trade, <lb/>
            and so too is he king. <pb n="132"/>

          <p>Eupolis, Cratinus, Aristophanes, all poets true, and other <lb/>
            fearless men, who made the older Comedy their own, re­ <lb/>
            buked without restraint him who seemed worthy to be <lb/>
            branded villain, thief, adulterer, or cut-throat, or otherwise of <lb/>
            ill repute. From these Lucilius wholly draws his springs, <lb/>
            them he follows close, with nought but feet and metre <lb/>
            changed: witty he was, in penetration keen, but harsh <lb/>
            withal in form of verse. In this respect he was in fault <lb/>
            that as a feat he'd frequently dash off two hundred lines <lb/>
            an hour without an effort.1 As he flowed on in muddy <lb/>
            stream there was a something you could wish removed : <lb/>
            wordy he was, and loath to bear the strain of writing­ <lb/>
            that is, of writing well,-as to amount, I heed it not.</p>
          <p>But, lo ! Crispinus seeks a wager at the longest odds. <lb/>
            Take tablets, if you please, says he, and so shall I: let <lb/>
            place and time and umpires be arranged, and let us see <lb/>
            which of us two shall write the most.</p>
          <p>The gods did well in that they made me of a barren <lb/>
            and a timid mind, which seldom speaks and little says: <lb/>
            but you, as you prefer it so, be like the air that is in <lb/>

          <p>Fannius is happy, when at his own desire, his bust and <lb/>

            are those who care not for satiric verse, because the greater <lb/>
            part of men are open to its lash. Take any one at random <lb/>
            from a crowd-he suffers, be't from avarice or other wretched <lb/>
            aim. One dotes on matrons, one on youths : the sheen of <lb/>
            silver dazzles one : by works of art is Albius crazed : one <lb/>
            barters wares from east to west, all o'er the world : nay, he <lb/>
            is hurried on through risks as dust by whirlwind swept, in <lb/>
            fear that any of his hoard be lost, or that he fail to swell his <lb/>
            gains. All such fear verses, and detest the makers. A wisp <lb/>
            of hay is on his horn, they say-keep far aloof: if for himself <lb/>
            he only gains a laugh he will not spare a single friend, and <lb/>
            what he once has scribbled on his sheets he'll take delight <lb/>
            that all who come from bakery or bath shall know, both <lb/>
            boys and aged crones.</p>
          <p>Come then, a little in reply receive: and first of all I <lb/>
            will exclude myself from list of those to whom I'd give <lb/>
            the name of poet. 'Tis not enough, you'd say, to make a <lb/>
            verse with feet and metre right; nor if one wrote, as I, <lb/>
            what's nearer prose than verse, would you allow that he's a <lb/>
            poet true. To that man would you give the honoured name, <lb/>
            who shows the fire of genius, a soul that's nearer heaven's <lb/>
            mould, and a mouth that will with dignity give forth both <lb/>
            great and noble thoughts. On this account it is that some <lb/>
            have asked if Comedy be prose or verse; because the vivid <lb/>
            glow and force are felt neither in diction nor in thought. <lb/>
            'Tis merely prose save that it differs in stated metre and <lb/>
            in feet.</p>
          <p>But an excited father towers with rage because his vicious <lb/>
            son, madly fond of harlot friend, declines a wife with noble <lb/>
            dower, and drunken walks about with torches ere the night <lb/>
            falls down-a great disgrace indeed. Would Pomponius, <lb/>
            if his father lived, hear lighter words than these? 'Tis <lb/>
            not enough then to complete a verse with plain and simple <pb n="135"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="24-80.]"/><lb/>
            words, which disarrange, and then another may express <lb/>
            his wrath just as the father in the play. If from the verses <lb/>
            which I write, and those Lucilius wrote of old, you take <lb/>
            away fixed quantities and rhythm, and put behind what was <lb/>
            before, and what was last make first, you would not find <lb/>
            the limbs of the dismembered bard, as you would in this <lb/>
            even if you broke it up—</p>
          <p>" Postquam Discordia tetra <lb/>
            Belliferratos postes portasque refregit." 1</p>
          <p>So much for this: another time I shall enquire if Satire <lb/>
            is a poem, strictly called; but now this only will I ask if it <lb/>
            deserves, or not, suspicion in your eyes. Keen-scented <lb/>
            Sulcius walks about, and Caprius with evil croak, and with <lb/>
            their notes, each a great dread to robbers ; but whoso lives <lb/>
            an honest life, with hands unstained, may bid defiance to them <lb/>
            both. Suppose you're like the robbers Cælius and Birrius, <lb/>
            I need not be a Caprius or a Sulcius : why do you fear <lb/>
            me ? Let neither shop nor stall 2 possess my little books on <lb/>
            which Tigellius and the common herd may lay their clammy <lb/>
            hands. Nor do I read aloud to any but to friends, and <lb/>
            that when forced,-not everywhere, nor yet to every one. <lb/>
            Many there are who read aloud in middle of the Forum, <lb/>
            and many in the baths: a place enclosed gives pleasing <lb/>
            echo to the voice. This flatters empty heads, which never <lb/>
            ask themselves if they do this without a sense of fitness, or <lb/>
            at an adverse time. You love to wound, quoth one, and <lb/>
            this you do with right good will, crank as you are. Where <lb/>
            got you this, which in my face you fling ? In fine, have you <note type="footnote">1 “When battle's brazen door <lb/>
            Blood-battered Discord from its fastenings tore.”—Conington. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Stall-properly, " pillar," either one round which the books were <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[SAT. IV."/><lb/>
            authority for this from any one with whom I ever lived ? He <lb/>
            who maligns an absent friend: who fails to take his part <lb/>
            when others blame: who courts the silly laugh of men, and <lb/>
            would be called a “wit”; who speaks of things, as seen, he <lb/>
            never saw; who cannot secrets keep; that's a black-hearted <lb/>
            wretch : you, Roman true, beware him ! On the triclinium <lb/>
            you oft may see the guests arranged in fours, of whom <lb/>
            there's always one who takes delight to besmirch with <lb/>
            foul abuse all but the man who heads the feast: 1 and him <lb/>
            as well when, later on, he's drunk, when truthful Bacchus <lb/>
            tells aloud the secrets of the heart. To you who malice 2 <lb/>
            hate, he courtly seems, polite, and frank. Do I appear <lb/>
            to you a spiteful and a snarling man, if I have laughed <lb/>
            because Rufillus, silly fool, of comfits smells, Gorgonius of <lb/>
            the goat ? If in your presence any word be said of Petillius <lb/>
            and his thefts from Jove upon the Capitol, you'd thus <lb/>
            defend him as you're wont: 11 He of the Capitol has treated <lb/>
            me as guest and friend even from my boyhood days, and <lb/>
            many things has done for me, at my request; and I'm very <lb/>
            glad he's now allowed to live at Rome, free from arrest; but <lb/>
            yet I wonder how from that charge he managed to escape." <lb/>
            This is the essence of the blackest bile, this is envy, pure <lb/>
            and simple: a fault which from my books, and first from <lb/>
            my mind, I promise you, shall far be distant, if for myself I <lb/>
            anything can truly vouch.</p>
          <p>If aught I shall have said with too much freedom, too <lb/>
            broad mirth, you will grant the right, and pardon too. My <lb/>
            worthy father taught me this, in branding, by examples given, <lb/>
            the vices one by one, that I might shun them. When urging <note type="footnote"> 1 " Heads the feast”—literally, " who supplies the water." In <lb/>
            certain club-feasts all except the water was brought by the guests, the <lb/>

             <note type="correspondsTo" n="81-134.]"/><lb/>
            me to live with thrift and care, and satisfied with that which <lb/>
            he himself had made for me, (he'd say), " Do you not see <lb/>
            how wretchedly the son of Albius lives, and what a beggar <lb/>
            Baius is ? A weighty lesson this, that none should wish <lb/>
            to waste his fathers means." When he wished to keep me <lb/>
            free from harlots' baser love—“ Don't you be like Scetanus." <lb/>
            When he begged me no adultery to seek, when I might live <lb/>
            in wedlock chaste, he used to say, " 'Tis not a pretty name <lb/>
            Trebonius got, caught in the act. Philosophers will reason <lb/>
            give to prove what's best to seek, what to avoid: for me <lb/>
            it is enough if I preserve the morals by our fathers taught, <lb/>
            and keep your life and name unstained, while still <lb/>
            you need a guide. So soon as time has seasoned well <lb/>
            your body and your mind, you then will swim without the <lb/>
            aid of cork." Thus with his words he used to shape my <lb/>
            boyish heart: and whether he advised me to do a thing <lb/>
            he'd say—“ you have authority for doing this " :-then he'd <lb/>
            hold up to me one of the special Judges : or if he dissuaded <lb/>
            me, "Can you doubt that it is contrary to honour and <lb/>
            advantage so to do, when this and the other one have <lb/>
            honour blighted by some vile report?" A neighbour's <lb/>
            funeral alarms the sick who lack control in food and drink, <lb/>
            and forces them by fear of death to stint themselves: <lb/>
            so the disgrace of others oft withholds the young from <lb/>
            crime.</p>
          <p>In consequence of this,1 saved from those sins which <lb/>
            certain ruin bring, I am possessed by faults, moderate in <lb/>
            kind and in degree, and such as you can well forgive; and <lb/>
            even these, it may be, lapse of time, a candid friend, and <lb/>
            calm reflection, may have lessened much; for when the <lb/>
            lounging couch or portico receives me, I do not fail in duty <lb/>
            to myself: I say, " This is a better plan; by doing this I <note type="footnote"> 1 That is, as a consequence of my father's training. </note> <pb n="138"/>

          <p>When I had started on my way from mighty Rome, <lb/>
            Aricia gave me welcome in a humble inn; Heliodorus, for <lb/>
            rhetoric renowned, went with me, than all the Greeks <lb/>
            more learned by far. Next halt was Appii Forum, with <lb/>
            sailors and with cheating vintners filled. This stage <lb/>
            we took as two, in easy mood, though only one to <lb/>

          <p>And now pale Night prepared to draw her veil o'er <lb/>
            Earth, and spangle heaven with stars. And then the slaves <lb/>
            began to " chaff" the boatmen, and the boatmen chaffed <lb/>
            the slaves. "Shove her in here!" "You're putting hundreds <lb/>
            in : oh, that's enough." Whilst fares are paid and mules are <lb/>
            yoked an hour at least is spent. The vile mosquitoes and the <lb/>

            friend. Fundi we leave without a pang, Aufidius Luscus <lb/>
            being its proctor then, amused at the badges of the silly clerk 2 <lb/>
            -the purple robe, the laticlave, and censer with its coal.</p>
          <p>Wearied we stop and rest in famed Mamurra's town <lb/>
            Murena's guests for room, and Capito's for food. The next <lb/>
            day dawns, most welcome of them all, for at Sinuessa we <lb/>
            are joined by Plotius, Varius and Virgil—souls purer than <lb/>
            whom earth ne'er produced, nor ones to which can any man <lb/>
            be more attached than I. Oh, what embraces, and what <lb/>
            joy there was! Nought with a pleasant friend could I <lb/>
            compare, so long as sense is left me.</p>
          <p>The hamlet nearest the Campanian bridge afforded <lb/>
            shelter,-the purveyors sent us wood and salt, as they are <lb/>
            bound to do. Starting thence the mules lay down their <lb/>

          <p>Then next Cocceius' well-stocked-house, beyond the inns <lb/>
            of Caudium, receives us. And now, 0 Muse, I wish you <lb/>
            briefly to record the contest of buffoon Sarmentus with <lb/>
            Messius Cicirrhus, and from what father sprung each joined in <lb/>
            fight. The Osci are the noble sires of Messius: she who <lb/>
            owned Sarmentus as her slave is still alive. Of such dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished lineage come, to battle they went forth. And <lb/>
            first Sarmentus says : 11 I do declare, you're like a unicorn." <lb/>
            We laugh, and Messius replies, " Well, be it so,” and moves <lb/>
            his head.1 " But had your forehead not its horn cut out," <lb/>
            says he, " what would you do, when even now all reft of <lb/>
            horn you threaten so ? " For, you must know, that on the <lb/>
            left an ugly hole had marred the aspect of his shaggy brow. <lb/>
            When he had quizzed him much on his Campanian plague 2 <lb/>
            and on his face, he begged that he would dance the Shepherd <lb/>
            Cyclops—“ no need he'd have for mask or tragic boot."</p>
          <p>To taunts like these Cicirrhus many hits returned : he <lb/>
            begged to ask if to the Lares he had yet his chain given <lb/>
            o'er, as he had vowed : because he was a lawyer's clerk, his <lb/>
            owner's claim was none the less. He asked, in fine, why <lb/>
            he had run away for whom one pound 3 of corn sufficed, so <lb/>
            slender was he and so tiny formed.</p>
          <p>This supper we protract, with pleasure, longer than our wont.</p>
          <p>From this we go right on to Beneventum ; and there the <lb/>
            bustling host had almost burned his house whilst on the <lb/>
            coaly hearth he turns the thrushes small and lean ; for, <lb/>
            as the Fire-god stalks abroad throughout the kitchen, <lb/>
            old and frail, the flame was hastening on to catch the roof. <lb/>
            Then you could see the hungry guests, and slaves in fright, <lb/>
            rescue the supper, and all eager in haste to quench the fire. <note type="footnote"> 1 i.e., to imitate a Unicorn. Some think it means " bows " in mock <lb/>

          <p>Then next1 my own Apulia begins to show the hills I <lb/>
            knew so well, scorched by the dry Sirocco's blast, which we <lb/>
            should ne'er have climbed had not the villa near Trivicum <lb/>
            given as shelter, not without smoke that drew forth tears, for <lb/>
            the stove consumed green branches and their leaves.</p>
          <p>From this we bowl along in carriages for four and twenty <lb/>
            miles, meaning at a little town to spend the night, whose <lb/>
            name my verse will not admit: by certain marks it's easy <lb/>
            known 2 : here water is for sale, of all things cheapest: the <lb/>
            bread is very fine, so that the knowing ones convey it farther <lb/>
            on in shoulder loads, for at Canusium it's gritty, nor is the <lb/>

          <p>Next day brought clearer skies : the road was worse even <lb/>

            for jokes and mirth, as they would have us think that incense <lb/>

          <p>Mæcenas, although there's none more nobly born than <lb/>
            you, of all the Lydian race who ever dwelt in Tuscan <lb/>
            bounds, or because your ancient sires by father's and by <lb/>
            mother's side commanded mighty hosts,1 you don't despise <lb/>
            on that account, as many do, those lowly born, like me <lb/>
            myself, from freedman father sprung. When you declare it <lb/>
            matters not what parentage one has, provided he's himself <lb/>
            freeborn, you're clear on this, that long ere Tullius rose to <lb/>
            power and held plebeian sway, it often chanced that many <lb/>
            lived in good repute, and were advanced to highest place, <lb/>
            though come of sires obscure: but that Lævinus, of Valerius' <lb/>
            seed, by whom Proud Tarquin was to exile driven, was ne'er <lb/>
            esteemed at higher value than an as, the people, whom you <lb/>
            know, being judge, who oft, to the worthless office give and, <lb/>
            of wit devoid, bow down to names; who stand agape at <lb/>
            pedigrees and busts.</p>
          <p>Then what ought we2 to do, far and away removed from <lb/>
            feelings of the crowd ? For grant it that the people choose <lb/>
            their honours on Lævinus to bestow rather than on a Decius, <lb/>
            a self-made man, and that a censor Appius would from the <lb/>
            Senate's lists erase my name, were I not come of freeborn <lb/>
            sires, and justly too, because I had not been content with <lb/>
            my own proper skin.3 But Glory drags along, bound to her <lb/>

            any knight or senator would have his children taught. <lb/>
            Those who saw my dress and slaves behind me, as in a <lb/>
            great community was fit, would think that the expense was <lb/>
            drawn from means inherited of old. He attended me him­ <lb/>
            self to all my teachers, a guardian above distrust. But why <lb/>
            enlarge? He kept me pure, and this is virtue's highest <lb/>
            praise, not only from a taint of sin, but from all scandal too. <lb/>
            Nor did he fear that any one in days to come should lay it <lb/>
            to his charge if, as an auctioneer, or as Collector like <lb/>
            himself, I followed humble walks. Nor should I have <lb/>
            complained the least: but, as it is, the greater praise is due <lb/>
            to him, the greater thanks from me. While sense and <lb/>
            reason last I cannot feel ashamed of father such as this, <lb/>
            and so I'll not defend myself as many do, who say they're <lb/>
            not to blame because their sires were neither high born <lb/>
            nor renowned. My words and feelings differ far from that: <lb/>
            for if Nature gave us leave to live our lives again from any <lb/>
            date, and any other parents choose, each might elect to <lb/>
            please his pride, I, quite content with mine, would ne'er <lb/>
            consent to take those dignified by fasces and by curule <lb/>
            chairs,-a fool may be, in judgment of the mob, but wise, <lb/>
            perhaps, in yours,-because I should be loath to bear an <lb/>
            irksome load to which I ne'er was used. For forthwith I <lb/>
            must greater means provide, must larger levees hold, take <lb/>
            out with me a friend or two, so that I could never move <lb/>
            alone to country or abroad. More grooms and horses <lb/>
            must be kept, more four horse chariots led in train. Now <lb/>
            I can go, even to Tarentum if I wish, upon my little mule, <lb/>
            whose ribs the saddle bags may gall, the rider stress his <lb/>
            front. No man can taunt me with the meanness they <lb/>

            slaves attend you with commode and cellarette. In this <lb/>

            0 noble Senator! Where'er my fancy bids I walk alone : <lb/>
            I ask the price of cabbage and of corn : I often saunter <lb/>
            through the Circus, haunt of cheats, and through the <lb/>
            Forum, in the evening hours : I stand to hear Diviners' <lb/>
            tales: then I betake me home to sup on omelette with <lb/>
            leeks and pulse: three slaves wait on me at my meal: a <lb/>
            marble slab supports two beakers and a glass: close by <lb/>
            there stands an urchin-bowl, a saucer and a cruet, both of <lb/>
            Campanian ware. Then after that I go to sleep, not in a <lb/>
            fret that I must rise betimes to visit 1 Marsyas, who says <lb/>
            he cannot bear the sight of younger Novius. I lie abed2 <lb/>
            till ten o'clock 8: then after that I stroll abroad, or having <lb/>
            read or written4 to beguile my quiet hours, I rub myself <lb/>
            with oil, not of the kind which filthy Natta takes, cheating <lb/>
            the lamps. But when the hotter sun has warned me, <lb/>
            tired as I am, to go and bathe, I shun the Campus and <lb/>
            the game of ball. Having lunched, not heartily, but eating <lb/>
            just as much as that I go not fasting all the day, I stay at <lb/>
            home and take my ease.</p>
          <p>Such is the life of those free from the " pains and burden <lb/>

          <p>To all the eyesore and the barber class 'tis known, I think, <lb/>
            how mongrel Persius took revenge for gall and venom of <lb/>
            Rupilius, "that outlawed King." This Persius was rich, <lb/>
            and at Clazomenae he drove a thriving trade: he also had <lb/>
            with King a tedious plea; a stubborn man he was, and one <lb/>
            who in his hate could King surpass ; audacious and bluster­ <lb/>
            ing and in speech so cutting that " far and away ” 1 he could <lb/>
            outstrip all the Sisennae and the Barri in abuse.</p>
          <p>Now I come to King. When no agreement can be made <lb/>
            (for all, 'twixt whom an open war occurs, are bitter and un­ <lb/>
            yielding in proportion as they're brave : with Hector, Priam's <lb/>

            so that nought else but death could part the two-for this <lb/>
            and only this that highest valour dwelt in both. If a dispute <lb/>
            arise between two cowards, or if open war break forth, in <lb/>
            case of those ill-matched, as Diomede and Lycian Glaucus, <lb/>
            the weaker leaves the field and proffers gifts)—well, when <lb/>

            between Rupilius and Persius, a pair as fairly matched as <lb/>
            Bacchius with Bithus. Both rush into Court, keen for the <lb/>
            strife, and both a sight to see. Persius explains the case : <lb/>
            a laugh is raised by all in Court: he praises Brutus and he <lb/>
            lauds his Staff: Brutus he calls the Sun of Asia, and his <lb/>
            retinue, all healthful stars, excepting King : that Dog, he said <lb/>
            had come, a constellation which the farmers hate. He still <lb/>
            rushed on like winter stream, where woodman's axe but <note type="footnote"> 1 Literally, " on white horses," which were supposed, it would <lb/>

            rarely comes. Then upon him of cutting wit, and glib of <lb/>
            tongue, the Prænestine hurls his taunts, from language of <lb/>

            could beat at slang, to whom the passer-by had often given <lb/>

          <p>When with Italian vinegar he has been drenched from <lb/>

            the craftsman, doubting if he'd make me a Priapus or a <lb/>

            a god I am, the greatest dread of thieves and birds : for <lb/>
            them my hand restrains, and the red-painted pole which from <lb/>

            the greedy birds, and dares them to settle in the new-made <lb/>
            grounds. Hither in former days dead bodies of the slaves, <lb/>
            flung out from narrow cells, were borne for burial on wretched <lb/>
            biers, contracted for by fellow-slaves. This was the usual 1 <lb/>

            spirits that would answer give. An image, too, there was <lb/>
            of wool, and a second made of wax : the one of wool was <lb/>
            larger, that it might by punishment control the small: the <lb/>
            waxen one as suppliant stood, soon like a slave to die. <lb/>
            One Hecate invokes, the other dread Tisiphone: then <lb/>
            serpents you could see and hellhounds roving near, and <lb/>
            the blushing moon hiding behind huge tombs, that to such <lb/>
            horrid rites she might not witness be.</p>
          <p>But why give all details ? how the Shades, when answer­ <lb/>
            ing Sagana spoke in a mournful squeak, and how the hags <lb/>
            hid stealthily in earth the beard of wolf and teeth of spotted <lb/>
            snake, and how the fire burned greater from the wax; how <lb/>
            I, a witness, not un'venged, was terrified by those two <lb/>
            Furies' words and deeds : for I made a sound, loud as <lb/>
            bladder burst by sudden blow : but to the city off they <lb/>
            fled: with hearty laughter and with mirth you then <lb/>
            could see Canidia's teeth and Sagana's false hair drop <lb/>
            down; and herbs and enchanted love knots fall from <lb/>
            their hands and arms. <note type="footnote"> 1 “ Inde" may mean “thence,” i.e., from the track : it may also mean <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>One day it chanced I took a stroll along the Sacred Way, <lb/>
            as is my wont, conning o'er some trifling ode, and all ab­ <lb/>
            sorbed in that. A man runs up to me, unknown to me <lb/>
            except by name, and seizing my hand he says, " How are <lb/>
            you, dearest friend in all the world ? " 11 Pretty well, just <lb/>
            now," I say, "and always at your service." 1 When he kept <lb/>
            following me, before he could begin, I said " I can't do <lb/>
            more for you,2 now can I ? "</p>
          <p>But he replies "You surely know me,3 I'm a literary <lb/>
            man."</p>
          <p>" On that account," I say, " you will be more esteemed <lb/>
            by me." Painfully eager to get off, I sometimes walked <lb/>
            more quickly: again, I stopped, and whispered something to <lb/>
            my slave, while to my very ankle-bones the sweat flowed <lb/>
            down. " 0 Bolanus, happy in thy testy brain," I muttered <lb/>
            inwardly : while he still chattered on of anything and every­ <lb/>
            thing, and praised the city and its streets.</p>
          <p>When I made no reply he says, " You're very anxious to <lb/>
            be off, I've seen that long ago ; but it's no use : I'll stick to <lb/>
            you right on: wherever you are going now I will attend <lb/>
            you."</p>
          <p>11 There's no necessity at all for you to go the rounds with <lb/>
            me : I wish to see a friend not known to you: he's ill in <note type="footnote"> 1 “ At your service," literally, " I desire all things which you wish "— <lb/>
            u your will is my pleasure," as we say. This amounted to a polite <lb/>

            bed a long way 'cross the Tiber, close to Caesar's gardens." <lb/>
            " I've nought to do, and I am nowise lazy : I'll follow you <lb/>
            even there."</p>
          <p>I droop my ears, like an impatient ass when on his back <lb/>
            he feels too great a load.</p>
          <p>Then he begins " If I don't overrate myself, you will not <lb/>
            value Viscus more, or Varius, as friends : for who can write <lb/>
            more verses, or with greater speed than I ? What man can <lb/>
            move his limbs more gracefully ? I sing so well as even to <lb/>
            move Hermogenes to envy."</p>
          <p>Here was an opportunity of interrupting him : " Have <lb/>
            you a mother, have you friends who wish you well ? ”</p>
          <p>" I haven't one: I've laid them all to rest."</p>
          <p>" Happy they ! now I am left; despatch me too : for a sad <lb/>
            fate awaits me, which an old Sabellian hag with shake of <lb/>
            her divining urn, foretold me in boyhood: him nor poison <lb/>
            dread, nor sword of foe will carry off, nor pleurisy, nor <lb/>
            cough, nor crippling gout: some day a chatterbox will be <lb/>
            his death : if he be wise let him eschew all such, when he's <lb/>
            grown up."</p>
          <p>We now had come to Vesta's shrine, a quarter of the day <lb/>
            being gone, and as it chanced, he was obliged just then to <lb/>
            answer to a bail1; and if he failed appearance, he was bound <lb/>
            to lose his suit.</p>
          <p>"As you love me," says he, "come here a little."</p>
          <p>" May I die if I can stand 2 in Court, or if I know the civil <lb/>
            law : and I am hurrying on to where you know."</p>
          <p>" I'm doubtful what to do," says he, " whether to leave <lb/>
            the suit or you." <note type="footnote"> 1 “ A bail," i.e., to a man to whom he had given bail for his appear­ <lb/>

          <p>" Me I beseech you."</p>
          <p>" I won't," he says, and on he goes.</p>
          <p>I follow, as it's hard to fight against your victor.-Here­ <lb/>
            upon he starts afresh.</p>
          <p>" How does Maecenas stand with you ? ”</p>
          <p>" He is a man of few friends, and of very sound <lb/>
            judgment." 1</p>
          <p>" No one has turned his luck to better account than you. <lb/>
            You would have a powerful helper to back you up if you <lb/>
            cared to introduce me to him : may I die if you wouldn't <lb/>
            supplant them all."</p>
          <p>11 We don't live there as you suppose; no house is purer <lb/>
            nor more a stranger to such evil ways. It's no drawback to <lb/>
            me, I say, if one is richer or more learn'd : each one has his <lb/>
            proper place."</p>
          <p>" What you state is very strange-scarce credible, indeed."</p>
          <p>" And yet it's quite the case."</p>
          <p>“You fire my soul so that I'm still more eager to be his <lb/>
            nearest friend."</p>
          <p>" You've but to wish it: such is your merit, you will take <lb/>
            him by storm: and he is one who can be captured and <lb/>
            therefore he guards his outworks well." 3</p>
          <p>" I shall not fail in duty to myself : I'll bribe his slaves : <lb/>
            If I'm denied to-day, I'll not give up: I'll seek for fitting <note type="footnote"> 1 Some would apply this to Maecenas. I prefer with others, to take <lb/>
            it as referring to Horace. The preceding sentence says that Maecenas <lb/>
            has only a select circle of friends and that he is not fool enough (mentis <lb/>
            bene sanæ) to take such a bore into it. Then the bore with a knowing <lb/>
            wink, and perhaps a poke in the poet's chest, replies "ah, you have <lb/>
            played your cards well, none better." The Pron. tu which might be <lb/>
            expected, if the phrase applied to Horace, would thus be unnecessary. <lb/>
            This mode of distributing the sentence appears to me to give a much <lb/>
            more comic turn to the dialogue. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 " Me," literally " this man," pointing to himself. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 The metaphor is taken from a fortress. </note> <pb n="155"/>

            times : I'll meet him in the street, and see him home. To <lb/>
            mortals life has given nought without great toil"</p>
          <p>While he is thus going on Aristius Fuscus meets us, a <lb/>
            friend of mine, and one who knew him well: we stop. <lb/>
            “ Whence come you ? and where for ? " he asks and answers. <lb/>
            I began to pluck his toga, and with my hand to pinch his <lb/>
            most impassive arms, nodding, turning my eyes from side <lb/>
            to side, that he would relieve me. Smiling with malicious <lb/>
            fun he pretended not to take me up : anger set my liver all <lb/>
            ablaze.</p>
          <p>" You surely said you wished to talk with me of something <lb/>
            quite in private."</p>
          <p>" I remember well, but I'll tell you at some fitter time: <lb/>
            To-day's a thirtieth Sabbath : would you have me to insult <lb/>
            the circumcised Jews ? "</p>
          <p>" No superstition, I reply, affects my conscience there!"</p>
          <p>" But it does me : I am a little weaker in the mind: <lb/>
            one of the many: you'll forgive me; I'll talk to you some <lb/>
            other time."</p>
          <p>Oh! that this day has dawned so black to me! The <lb/>
            rogue makes off and leaves me to the knife.</p>
          <p>As it chanced the plaintiff meets him; and in loud voice <lb/>
            exclaims :—</p>
          <p>"Where are you off to, basest fellow?" and to me he <lb/>
            says, "Will you be witness?" I readily present my ear. <lb/>
            He hurries him to court: there's shouting on both sides and <lb/>
            a rush from every point. Thanks to Apollo, I got off.</p><pb n="156"/>

          </ab>
          <p>No doubt I said Lucilius' lines run on in halting rhythm. <lb/>
            And who so stupidly admires Lucilius as not to say so too ? <lb/>
            But in the self-same piece he's praised because he gave the <lb/>
            city many a rub with pungent wit. And yet though this I <lb/>
            grant I would not grant all else: for then I should admire <lb/>
            Laberius' mimes as works of high poetic art. And thus, you <lb/>
            see, 'tis not enough to cause an audience to laugh with open <lb/>
            mouth; though that has its merit too : there's need of <lb/>
            brevity, so that the stream of thought may flow on clear <lb/>
            and free, and may not mar its course by words that <lb/>
            load and tire the ear: we want a style, now grave, yet oft­ <lb/>
            times gay, that plays the part of orator and poet now, and <lb/>
            now of polished wit who spares his strength and " draws it <lb/>
            fine " on purpose. In great affairs the comic often cuts the <lb/>
            knot with edge more bold and keen than the severe. Those <lb/>
            sturdy men, who made Old Comedy their forte, on this their <lb/>
            footing gained-in this our imitation claim : whom Hermo­ <lb/>
            genes, the fop, ne'er reads, nor yet that ape who nought <lb/>
            can sing but Calvus and Catullus.</p>
          <p>But yet he did a wondrous feat in that he mixed up Greek <lb/>
            with Latin words. 0 laggard wits, who think—is’t really <lb/>
            so ?-that that is hard and strange which fell to Pitholeon, <lb/>
            him of Rhodes, to do. But verses happily made up of Greek <lb/>
            and Latin words are sweeter to the taste, you say, e'en as if a <lb/>
            cask of strong Falernian brand were mixed with wine of Chian <lb/>
            growth. Is it only then, I put it to yourself, when you your <lb/>
            verses write, or also when you're called to plead the thorny <lb/>
            cause of some accused Petilius ? When Pedius Publicola and <lb/>
            Corvinus with toilsome effort urge their pleas in Latin tongue, <pb n="157"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="1-57.]"/><lb/>
            would you, forsooth, forgetting fatherland and father, prefer <lb/>
            to interlard your native speech with foreign words like double- <lb/>
            tongued Canusian ?</p>
          <p>And so when I essayed Greek verselets to compose, <lb/>
            born as I was this side the sea, Quirinus in vision seen <lb/>
            past midnight, when all dreams are true, forbade me <lb/>
            thus: “’Twould not be more insane for you to carry <lb/>
            timber to the woods than if you wished to swell the <lb/>
            crowded bands of Grecian bards." When Alpinus in his <lb/>
            turgid style “murders” the hero Memnon and “gives his <lb/>
            Rhine a headpiece of brown mud," I amuse myself with <lb/>
            trifles such as these, not that they may echo in the temple, <lb/>
            competing for a prize, with Tarpa as the judge, nor to the <lb/>
            stage return to be again and yet again reviewed.</p>
          <p>Fundanius, you alone of living men are able to compose <lb/>
            with courtly grace in pleasing style, " light chatty plays of <lb/>
            easy talk," how Davus and a cunning wench deceive an <lb/>
            aged Chremes: Pollio sings the deeds of kings in trimeter <lb/>
            iambics : Varius " with a vigour none can reach " the manly <lb/>
            Epic moulds : the Muses who the country love have given <lb/>
            to Virgil smoothness and elegance of verse. Satire like this <lb/>
            it was which, tried in vain by Varro, on the Atax born, and <lb/>
            others too, I yet could write better than they, though not to <lb/>
            match the inventor: nor should I dare to tear away the <lb/>
            wreath which with great glory to his head adheres.</p>
          <p>But I alleged that he flows on in turbid vein, oft bearing <lb/>
            in his stream more to be removed than left: come now, pray <lb/>
            tell me, are you not learned enough to find a fault in mighty <lb/>
            Homer ? Does Lucilius, gracious as he is, suggest no change <lb/>
            on Tragic Accius ? Does he not deride old Ennius' lines <lb/>
            as wanting dignity, though speaking of himself not as a <lb/>
            greater man than those he blames. And as I read Lucilius' <lb/>
            words why should I not enquire if natural defect, or hard­ <pb n="158"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[SAT. X."/><lb/>
            ness of the theme denied him verses better formed or <lb/>
            flowing on more smoothly, than if a man content with this <lb/>
            alone, to finish something in six feet, should strive to write <lb/>
            two hundred verses ere he supped, as many when he'd done; <lb/>
            such was the talent of Cassius the Etruscan, more surging <lb/>
            than a torrent stream, who on his funeral pyre, as fame <lb/>
            records, by his own books and book-case was consumed.</p>
          <p>Be it allowed, I say, that Lucilius was in manner gracious <lb/>
            and in wit refined; that he was more polished than one <lb/>
            could hope for in the creator of this new kind of poetry, <lb/>
            untouched by the Greeks, and than the great mass of older <lb/>
            poets: still had he been reserved by fate for this our age, <lb/>
            he would now erase much that he wrote, would prune off all <lb/>
            that was spun out beyond what made a finished line, and as <lb/>
            he wrote would often scratch his head and to the very quick <lb/>
            would bite his nails. If you're to write what's worthy to be <lb/>
            read a second time, oft turn your stylus, and pleased with <lb/>
            readers, few and choice, do not be anxious that the mob <lb/>
            should praise you. Would you, like a fool, prefer your <lb/>
            poems to be read aloud in common schools ? Not I: <lb/>
            for me it is enough if Knights applaud, as, in contempt of <lb/>
            all besides, the bold Arbuscula declared, when forced by <lb/>
            hisses from the stage. Should that bug Pantilius stir <lb/>
            my wrath, or should it worry me that Demetrius should <lb/>
            revile me when my back is turned, or if the silly Fannius, <lb/>
            messmate of Hermogenes Tigellius, assail me. Let <lb/>
            Plotius and Varius, Mæcenas and Virgil, Valgius and <lb/>
            Octavius, and Fuscus, best of men, approve my works, <lb/>
            and both the Visci too. Mere love to please being far <lb/>

            cannot sleep.</p>
          <p>TREB. Let those who need deep sleep anoint with oil, and <lb/>
            swim the Tiber thrice, and towards night soak well their <lb/>
            frame with draughts of good strong wine; or if such a craze <lb/>
            for writing seize you, be bold and celebrate the deeds of <lb/>
            matchless Cæsar, and you will gain a meet reward for all <lb/>
            your toil.</p>
          <p>HOR. Good sir, that's what I long to do : but the power <lb/>
            fails me: it is not everyone who can depict the squadrons <lb/>
            bristling with darts, or Gauls expiring with the broken <lb/>
            lance, or wounds of Parthian falling from his horse.</p>
          <p>TREB. But yet you might describe him just and brave, as <lb/>
            Lucilius was wise enough to speak of Scipio.</p>
          <p>HOR. I shall not fail, when circumstances prompt: unless <pb n="161"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="1-50.]"/><lb/>
            at fitting time the words of Flaccus will not gain the ear of <lb/>
            Cæsar, who, if you unwisely pat him, kicks out at once, <lb/>
            guarded on every side (like wary steed).</p>
          <p>TREE. Much better this than to attack in bitter verse <lb/>
            Pantolabus, the clown, and roue Nomentanus, when each, <lb/>
            though unassailed, fears for himself and hates you.</p>
          <p>HOR. What am I to do ? Milonius dances, soon as excite­ <lb/>
            ment stirs his wine-touched head, and lamps seem double. <lb/>
            Castor in horses takes delight: he from the same egg hatched <lb/>
            in boxing joys; so many as the men who live, so many their <lb/>
            pursuits : my hobby is to range my words in feet, as old Luci­ <lb/>
            lius did-a better man than you or I. In ancient days he <lb/>
            would entrust his secrets to his books, as faithful friends, <lb/>
            and whether things went well with him or ill, to none besides <lb/>
            had he recourse; and so the life of him of olden days is <lb/>
            clear displayed to view, as if on votive tablet drawn.</p>
          <p>Him I follow, doubtful if I be Lucanian or Apulian : <lb/>
            for Venusia's hinds till fields on border line, for this one <lb/>
            purpose sent, when the Sabelli were deforced, as the old <lb/>
            story is, that through the empty space no enemy might raid <lb/>
            the Roman lands, should the Apulian or the wild Lucanian <lb/>
            a sudden inroad make. But this good pen of mine shall never, <lb/>
            if I'm not provoked, attack a living man, and will be my <lb/>
            defence, as sword in scabbard hid; and why from hostile <lb/>
            brigands safe should I attempt to draw it forth ? 0 Father <lb/>
            and Sovereign Jove, let my blade be laid aside and utterly <lb/>
            consumed by rust, and let no one harm me, eager for peace. <lb/>
            But he who rouses me (Hands off I cry) shall rue it, and <lb/>
            be lampooned till he's well known o'er all the town.</p>
          <p>Cervius, when in wrath, holds out as threats the laws and <lb/>
            urn; Canidia, the poison of Albucius to those she hates; <lb/>
            Turius a great calamity, if you have any case when he is <lb/>
            judge. To this conclusion come with me that each one <note type="footnote"> L </note> <pb n="162"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[SAT. I."/><lb/>
            scares his foes by means in which he's strong, and that <lb/>
            almighty Nature so directs : the wolf his tooth, the bull his <lb/>
            horn employs: how's this unless by instinct shown ? To <lb/>
            spendthrift Scaeva trust his long-lived mother; his dutiful <lb/>
            right hand will do no crime : strange, is it not, how neither <lb/>
            with his heels does wolf attack, nor with his teeth the ox! <lb/>
            but the deadly hemlock in the honeyed mead will take away <lb/>
            the crone.</p>
          <p>Not to be tedious-whether calm old age awaits me or <lb/>
            Death is hovering round with dismal wings-whether rich <lb/>
            or poor, at Rome, or, if chance so order, an exile-what­ <lb/>
            ever the complexion of my life may be, write I will and must.</p>
          <p>TREB. My son, I fear your life will not be long; and I <lb/>
            dread lest some of your greater friends may smite you with <lb/>
            a chilling blight.</p>
          <p>HOR. How so ? When Lucilius, as inventor, dared to write <lb/>
            in strains like this, and to tear off the skin in which each <lb/>
            forth in public walked, fair to the view, but foul within, was <lb/>
            Lælius, or he who gained an honoured name from fall of <lb/>
            Carthage, hurt by his wit, or were they sorry that Metellus <lb/>
            was attacked or Lupus overwhelmed by his lampoons? <lb/>
            Yet he arraigned the people's chiefs, the people, too, in <lb/>
            all their tribes, to nought but virtue kind and virtue's <lb/>
            friends. But when the valiant Scipio and wise and gentle <lb/>
            Laelius from the throng and show of public life withdrew, <lb/>
            they were wont to 11 fool" with him and playfully disport in <lb/>
            free and easy mood until the cabbage boiled.</p>
          <p>Whatever I am, though 'neath Lucilius both in rank and <lb/>
            wit, yet this much envy will allow, unwilling though she be, <lb/>
            that I have lived in converse with the great, and trying to <lb/>
            imprint her tooth in matter soft and frail, she'll bring it <lb/>
            sharply down on something hard and firm; unless, 0 learned <lb/>

            warned and carefully beware lest ignorance of our sacred <lb/>
            laws may plunge you into trouble: if one has made bad <lb/>
            verses on another, there is the court and right of action.</p>
          <p>HOR. No doubt, if bad: but if good, and he be praised <lb/>
            by Cæsar as his judge ? If one whose life is spotless has <lb/>
            snarled at him who obloquy deserves?</p>

          </ab>
          <p>What merit and how great it is, good friends, to live on little <lb/>
            (now these are not my words, but what Ofellus taught, a man <lb/>
            of simple life, a sage to no creed bound, but blessed with <lb/>
            homely mother-wit), learn, not among glittering plates and <lb/>
            polished boards, when eyes are dazed with senseless glare, <lb/>
            and when the mind, prone to be caught by hollow show, the <lb/>
            better part declines-but here, before we dine, discuss with <lb/>
            me. Why so ? I'll tell you, if I can.</p>
          <p>Every man whose judgment's warped is in bad case to <lb/>
            weigh the truth. Having hunted hares, or been worn out <lb/>
            by an unbroken horse-or if Roman sports fatigue you <lb/>
            accustomed to the Greek, whether the flying ball attracts you, <lb/>
            play at ball, your eagerness gently beguiling the arduous toil, <lb/>
            or if you prefer the quoit, smite with the quoit the yielding <lb/>
            air -when exercise has banished dainty qualms, when racked <lb/>
            with thirst and hunger, spurn if you can, plain wholesome food; <lb/>
            drink nought but honey of Hymettus mixed with Falernian <lb/>
            wine. The steward is from home and the dark stormy sea <lb/>
            protects the fish : bread with salt will do quite well to soothe <lb/>
            your howling appetite." Whence or how, do you think, is <lb/>
            this procured ? The height of pleasure is not in the smell of <lb/>
            costly cookery, but in yourself. Seek relishes by sweating <lb/>
            toil: the man who's bloated by excess, and pale, nor scar, <lb/>
            nor oyster, nor foreign bird will aid. Yet when a peacock is <lb/>
            served up, I scarcely shall restrain you, misled by empty show, <lb/>
            from the wish to gratify your throat with it in preference <lb/>
            to fowl, because the rarity costs gold to buy, and with its <lb/>
            gaudy tail displays to view a beauteous sight; as if that <lb/>
            can touch the matter in the least. Do you eat that plumage <pb n="165"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="1-55.]"/><lb/>
            which you praise? Has it an equal beauty when it's <lb/>
            cooked. Yet though they differ nought in flesh, you that <lb/>
            prefer to this, being led astray by changed exteriors ! Be it <lb/>
            so: but how do you come to know whether the pike, <lb/>
            with open mouth, was caught in Tiber, or at sea, whether <lb/>
            it was tossed between the bridges or at the mouth of <lb/>
            Tuscan Tiber? 0 senseless man, you praise a three-pound <lb/>
            mullet which you must serve in several helps. The appear­ <lb/>
            ance takes you, I perceive; what is the point, then, in <lb/>
            disliking monster pike? Because, no doubt, Nature has <lb/>
            given the one1 a larger size, the other lighter weight. <lb/>
            A stomach rarely hungry despises common food. I should <lb/>
            like to see a “great big" fish laid out at length upon a <lb/>
            " great big " plate, says the gullet worthy the greedy Harpies. <lb/>
            But come, ye South Winds, and with potent influence cook <lb/>
            their dainties for them,-although the fresh caught turbot <lb/>
            and the boar seem fetid when surfeit galls the sickly <lb/>
            stomach, when laden it longs for radishes and bitter herbs. <lb/>
            And yet all humble fare has not been banished from the <lb/>
            tables of the great: for nowadays a place is found for <lb/>
            common eggs and dusky olives of the poor.</p>
          <p>Not very long ago Gallonius, of auction fame, rendered <lb/>
            his board notorious by serving up a sturgeon to his guests. <lb/>
            What ? Did the seas at that time fewer turbots rear ? The <lb/>
            turbot then was safe, the stork, too, in her nest, till one with <lb/>
            Prætor’s rank improved your tastes. And thus if one <lb/>
            should now his edict give that divers broiled are sweet and <lb/>
            good, the Roman youth, too easy to be led, will yield <lb/>
            consent.</p>
          <p>A mean will from a frugal diet differ far, Ofellus thinks; <lb/>
            for vain it is one fault to shun if to another you perversely <lb/>
            turn. Avidienus, to whom the name of "Dog" adheres, <note type="footnote"> 1 “The one," that is, the pike. </note> <pb n="166"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[SAT. II."/><lb/>
            from real nature drawn, eats olives five years old and cornels <lb/>
            growing wild, and ne'er draws off his wine till it is sour; <lb/>
            and though, all clothed in white, he celebrates a marriage <lb/>
            feast, birthday or other fête, he from a two pound horn will <lb/>
            on his cabbage drop some oil the smell of which you could <lb/>
            not bear-not niggard of his long kept vinegar.</p>
          <p>What style of life, then, shall the wise man choose, and <lb/>
            which of these is he to follow ? This side the wolf besets, <lb/>
            that side the dog, as people say. The wise man will be <lb/>
            refined, so far as not to give offence by meanness, nor <lb/>
            weakly to lean to either style of living. He neither will to <lb/>
            slaves be harsh, like old Albucius, when he assigns their <lb/>
            tasks; nor will he, -as the heedless Nævius, give greasy <lb/>
            water to his guests: this also is a grievous fault.</p>
          <p>Hear now what blessings, and how great, a frugal diet <lb/>
            brings. And first of all you'll be in health : for you can see <lb/>
            how hurtful to a man variety will prove, when of that food <lb/>
            you think, which once, in simple form, agreed so well: but <lb/>
            soon as you have mingled roast with boiled, shell-fish with <lb/>
            fowl, the sweet will bile become, and the tough phlegm will <lb/>
            quite upset your stomach. See you how every one arises <lb/>
            pale from a distracting meal?1 Nay, the body too, by <lb/>
            yesterday's excess o'erladen, weighs down with it the soul as <lb/>
            well, and rivets to earth that " vital spark of heavenly flame." <lb/>
            The other, when sooner than said he has refreshed himself <lb/>
            and gone to sleep, rises all hale to his appointed tasks. But <lb/>
            yet he can at times to better fare resort, should the revolving <lb/>
            year bring round a festal day, or should he wish to invig­ <lb/>
            orate his wasted frame; or when his years advance and <lb/>
            feebleness demands more generous cheer: but should ill­ <lb/>
            health or crippling age fall to its lot, what can you add to <note type="footnote"> 1 94 Distracting meal," l.e., one which offers so many good things that <lb/>
            a guest does not know which to take first. </note> <pb n="167"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="56-116.]"/><lb/>
            that indulgence, which young and strong you take before <lb/>
            the time ?</p>
          <p>The ancients praised a rancid boar, not because they <lb/>
            failed in power of nose, but with this intent, I think, that <lb/>
            strangers coming late might eat it with more zest when <lb/>
            " high," than greedy host, when fresh. Would that the new- <lb/>
            made world had given me birth among those noble men !</p>
          <p>You make account of public talk, I hope, which sweeter <lb/>
            than poet's lays attracts the ears of men : great turbots and <lb/>
            great plates bring with them great disgrace and loss. Add to <lb/>
            this an angry uncle, your neighbours and yourself ill-pleased <lb/>
            with you : and though you long for death, 'tis vain, as not a <lb/>
            copper have you left to buy a rope. Trausius, one says, is <lb/>
            rightly chid by these your words; but I have lordly revenues, <lb/>
            and means enough to satisfy three kings. Is there then no <lb/>
            better way in which you can expend your extra wealth? <lb/>
            Why is there any one in need who ought not so to be, while <lb/>
            you are rich ? Why do the ancient temples of the gods to <lb/>
            ruin fall ? Why do you not, ungrateful man, mete out a part <lb/>
            of such a hoard to much-loved fatherland ? With you alone, <lb/>
            forsooth, things will go well for ever! oh, what a laughing- <lb/>
            stock to foes hereafter ! Which will on better grounds have <lb/>
            trust in self 'gainst troublous days ? he who accustoms pam­ <lb/>
            pered mind and frame to many lusts, or he who pleased <lb/>
            with little things and mindful of his future years, in times of <lb/>
            peace prepares, as wise men ought, things requisite for war ?</p>
          <p>To give more credence to my words, I testify that when <lb/>
            a little boy I knew Ofellus used his means, when unimpaired, <lb/>
            with no more freedom than now when scant. You may see <lb/>
            him in his scheduled1 farm, with cattle and with sons, a <lb/>
            sturdy tenant at a rent, discoursing thus :—I was not apt to <note type="footnote"> 1 “ Scheduled," i.e., marked off for division among the military <lb/>
            veterans. </note> <pb n="168"/>
             <note type="margin">[SAT. II.</note><lb/>
            eat on working days aught but my cabbage and smoked <lb/>
            ham. And whether a friend long absent, or a neigh­ <lb/>
            bour as a welcome guest had come upon me free from <lb/>
            labour on some rainy day, we made a hearty meal-not <lb/>
            upon fish brought from the town, but upon kid and chicken <lb/>
            of our own. Then nuts and raisins with split figs adorned <lb/>
            the second course. Thereafter 'twas our sport to drink, a <lb/>
            forfeit being our only check, and Ceres addressed with this <lb/>
            prayer, 11 so might she rise " with lofty stalk, smoothed off <lb/>
            by wine the careworn sadness of the wrinkled brow. Let <lb/>
            Fortune frown and new commotions raise: how much will <lb/>
            she from present comforts take ? How much less sleek and <lb/>
            healthy have we been, my lads, since this new settler came ? <lb/>
            For neither him, nor me, nor any one, has Nature made the <lb/>
            Master of the soil in proper right: us he has driven out: <lb/>
            him either lavish waste, or ignorance of subtle law, or last <lb/>
            of all an heir of longer life will certainly eject. The land <lb/>
            now in Umbrenus' name, but lately of Ofellus called, will <lb/>
            be the lasting right of none, but now will fall to me, to use, <lb/>
            now to another. Wherefore spend life, still stout of heart, <lb/>

            others' business only I take heed, from my own set loose. <lb/>
            For in former days I loved to seek some dish of bronze in <lb/>
            which the crafty Sisyphus had washed his feet; whatever <lb/>
            was rudely chiselled ; and what was stiffly cast; with all the <note type="footnote"> 1 "So bulky," referring to the vals. : tantos may also mean "so <lb/>

            skill of connoisseur I put a hundred thousand 1 on statues, <lb/>
            this or that: gardens and splendid mansions I alone could <lb/>
            buy at profitable rate : and hence the crowded streets nick­ <lb/>
            named me ' Mercury.'</p>
          <p>HOR. I know it all, and wonder how you're cured of that <lb/>
            disease.</p>
          <p>DAM. And yet the new one has dispelled the old in <lb/>
            manner strange, as when the pain of aching side, or head, <lb/>
            straight to the stomach flies, like yonder man when from his <lb/>
            drowsy sleep he starts and plies the doctor with his fists.</p>
          <p>HOR. So long as you don't treat me so, be it as you will.</p>
          <p>DAM. Good friend, that you may not deceive yourself, <lb/>
            you too are mad, and so, it may be said, is every fool, if <lb/>
            there's any truth in what Stertinius prates, from whom, I, apt <lb/>
            to learn, wrote down these wondrous precepts, when solacing <lb/>
            my grief he bid me grow the beard of a philosopher, and <lb/>
            from Fabricius' bridge return, my sadness gone : for when <lb/>
            having lost my all I was about to jump into the stream with <lb/>
            covered head, he stood beside me on the right 2 and said, <lb/>
            See you do nothing to disgrace yourself: false shame, I <lb/>
            see, afflicts you, who 'midst a world of madmen dread to be <lb/>
            reckoned mad. For first I shall inquire, what madness is: <lb/>
            if this is found in you alone I will not add a word to hinder <lb/>
            you from dying like a man. Him whom vicious folly, and <lb/>
            him too whom ignorance of truth drives blindly on, Chry­ <lb/>
            sippus' Porch and School denounce as mad. This formula <lb/>
            includes whole nations, mighty kings, the philosopher alone <lb/>
            exempt.</p>
          <p>Now, hear why all who call you mad are just as mad them­ <lb/>
            selves. As in the forest, where an error leads men to wander <note type="footnote"> 1 A hundred thousand, viz., sesterces. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 "On the right," a good omen, or taken adverbially, "oppor­ <lb/>

            from the proper path, one veers to left, and one to right: both <lb/>
            make the same mistake but it baffles them on different sides: <lb/>
            to this extent then think yourself insane, that he who laughs <lb/>
            at you, not one whit wiser, behind him draws a tail.2 One <lb/>
            kind of fool there is, who dreads things noways to be feared, <lb/>
            so that he cries that fires, and rocks and rivers confront <lb/>
            him in the plain: another kind of folly, and different from <lb/>
            this and nothing wiser, is that of him who rushes madly <lb/>
            through midst of fires and streams. Though mother, sister, <lb/>
            father, wife and all his kin call out—there’s a deep ditch, <lb/>
            there's a huge cliff, take care—he’d hear no more than <lb/>
            once did drunken Fufius, when acting Ilione, he sleeps all <lb/>
            through his part, though twelve hundred Catieni shouted <lb/>
            loud, " Mother, on you I call." I'll prove to you that most <lb/>
            of men a similar mania show.</p>
          <p>Damasippus has the craze to buy up statues, antique in <lb/>
            style; is that man sane in mind who lends to Damasippus ? <lb/>
            Grant it, for the present! If I should say, Here, take a <lb/>
            loan which you need ne'er repay, shall you be deemed in­ <lb/>
            sane if you accept? or rather, senseless, if you refuse <lb/>
            the boon which Mercury in kindness gives. Draw up ten <lb/>

            obligations, if you will; yet this accursed Proteus will wriggle <lb/>
            out from all your fetters. When you shall hurry him to <lb/>

            then a bird, again, a stone, and when he wills, a tree. If <lb/>
            to mismanage one's affairs proves him a fool; if on the other <lb/>
            hand to guide them well stamps him a man of sense; much <lb/>
            more addled, trust me, is Perellius' brain, who lends what <lb/>
            you can ne'er repay.</p>
          <p>I bid all those to listen and their robes adjust,1 who suffer <lb/>
            from depraved ambition or the love of wealth, who are <lb/>
            inflamed by luxury, superstition fell or other mental ill; <lb/>
            come nearer me in order, while I prove that all are mad.</p>
          <p>By far the largest dose of hellebore to misers must be <lb/>
            given: I rather think that common sense would grant to <lb/>
            them Anticyra and all its stores. Staberius' heirs wrote on <lb/>
            his tomb the total sum he left: bound, if they did it not, to <lb/>
            give, in public show, a hundred pairs of fencers, and a funeral <lb/>
            feast to suit the taste of Arrius, and corn as much as fertile <lb/>
            Africa reaps. Whether my wish be right or wrong, he said, <lb/>
            be not unkind2 to me. This,3 I believe, Staberius' wary <lb/>
            mind foresaw. What, think you, then, was his intent when <lb/>
            he desired his heirs to carve upon his tomb the total sum <lb/>
            he left ? Poverty he deemed a grievous sin his whole life <lb/>
            through, and nothing did he guard against more keenly; so <lb/>
            that had he chanced to die one farthing poorer, he would <lb/>
            have thought himself a more immoral man : for all things <lb/>
            human and divine, virtue, renown, and honour, to noble <lb/>
            riches bow : and who has these amassed shall be illustrious, <lb/>
            brave, and just. And wise, as well ? even so; and king and <lb/>
            whatsoe'er he wish. This, as if by virtue gained, he hoped <lb/>
            would bring him great and worthy praise. What did the <lb/>
            Grecian Aristippus do like this ? who in midst of Libya bid <lb/>
            his slaves fling down their gold, because they marched too <note type="footnote"> 1 11 Their robes adjust," i.e., to settle down for attentive hearing. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 " Unkind," literally, be not an uncle to me. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 " This," viz., that the heirs would not record the sum Staberius left. </note> <pb n="173"/>

            slowly, by their load kept back. Which of the two is more <lb/>
            insane? An instance nothing proves which by starting <lb/>
            a doubt a doubt resolves.</p>
          <p>If one buys lyres, and after buying stores them in a heap, <lb/>
            though given neither to the lyre nor any kind of song; if <lb/>
            one who's not a cobbler gathers knives and lasts ; if one <lb/>
            averse to merchants life invests in sails for ships : he would <lb/>
            on all hands be esteemed deranged and mad, and rightly so. <lb/>
            How differs he from these who hoards his silver and his gold <lb/>
            and cannot use them when they're stored, and dreads to <lb/>
            touch them, as if sacred things ? If any one stretched at <lb/>
            full length on a great heap of corn should always keep a <lb/>
            watch, long cudgel in his hands, nor should he, though <lb/>
            its owner, and hungry too, dare to touch a single grain, but <lb/>
            should rather, as a miser, live on bitter leaves ; if while a <lb/>
            thousand casks of old Falernian or of Chian wine lie in his <lb/>
            stores—that's nothing, three hundred thousand-he drinks <lb/>
            sharp vinegar; nay, if besides, he would lie on hard straw <lb/>
            pallet, when eighty years, save one, while rich and costly <lb/>
            coverlets waste in his chests, the food of grubs and moths : <lb/>
            no doubt he would seem mad to few, because the greater <lb/>
            part of men are troubled by the same disease.</p>
          <p>O god-forsaken dotard, do you guard these things, in order <lb/>
            that a son or freedman as your heir may squander all on <lb/>
            drink ? surely it cannot be lest you yourself should come to <lb/>
            want ? For what a trifle will each day from all your hoard <lb/>
            deduct, if you begin to pour on your cabbage better oil, and <lb/>
            to anoint your head, foul with unheeded scurf? If any­ <lb/>
            thing's enough, why do you swindle, and purloin, and rob, <lb/>
            and plunder everywhere ? Are you sane at such a time ? <lb/>
            If you began to pelt with stones the people as they pass, <lb/>
            and to abuse your slaves whom with your gold you bought, <lb/>
            the boys and girls every one would cry aloud that you were <pb n="174"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[SAT. III."/><lb/>
            mad: when with a rope you kill your wife, your mother <lb/>
            with a drug, are you then quite sound in mind ? 1 Why ? <lb/>
            Neither at Argos nor with the sword do you commit the <lb/>
            deed, as Orestes slew his mother when by madness roused. <lb/>
            Do you suppose that he grew mad after he slew his mother, <lb/>
            and that he was not driven so by " naughty Furies " before <lb/>
            that in a parent's throat he warmed his whetted blade ? But <lb/>
            from the time Orestes was esteemed unsound in mind, he <lb/>
            certainly did nothing which you could condemn. At <lb/>
            Pylades no stroke he aimed, nor sister Electra did he dare <lb/>
            to wound: he merely rated both, calling her a Fury, him <lb/>
            something else which lordly rage 2 called forth.</p>
          <p>A poor man was Opimius though gold and silver were in <lb/>
            store at home; he was wont to drink Veientine wine at festal <lb/>
            times from Capuan earthen ware, and vapid wine on common <lb/>
            days : he once by heavy lethargy was seized, so that his heir <lb/>
            bustled around his coffers and his keys, in buoyant joy. <lb/>
            Him the doctor, prompt in resource and faithful to his trust, <lb/>
            stirred up as follows :-he ordered that a table be set forth, <lb/>
            and on it emptied out some bags of gold, and bade some <lb/>
            men advance and count the coin : thus he roused the man; <lb/>
            this too he adds; unless you guard your property with care, <lb/>
            at once your eager heir will carry all away.</p>
          <p>While I still live ?</p>
          <p>That you may live then, keep awake: make this your <lb/>
            business.</p>
          <p>What do you mean ?</p>
          <p>Your strength will sink for want of nourishment, unless some <lb/>

          <p>Alas! what matters it, whether I perish by disease, or <lb/>
            by theft and vile extortion ?</p>
          <p>Who then is sane ? He who is not a fool. What of the <lb/>
            avaricious man ? He's fool and madman both. What ? if <lb/>
            any one is not a miser, is he then and there quite sound <lb/>
            in mind ? By no means. Why, 0 Stoic ? I will tell you. <lb/>
            Suppose that Craterus had said, this patient has no stomach­ <lb/>
            ill : is he therefore well, and shall he rise ? He will say, <lb/>
            No, because his lungs or kidneys are attacked by sharp <lb/>
            disease. He is not perjured, nor niggard in his ways : let <lb/>
            him sacrifice a hog to the propitious Lares: but he is ambi­ <lb/>
            tious, and bold in design ; let him sail for Anticyra right <lb/>
            off. For what is the difference, whether you fling in a pit <lb/>
            all you possess, or never use what you've acquired ?</p>
          <p>Servius Oppidius, a wealthy man, as things were reckoned <lb/>
            then, left to his sons, 'tis said, two farms hard by Canusium, <lb/>
            and thus spoke to the lads called to his dying bed. Aulus, <lb/>
            when I saw that in your toga's open folds, you carried dice and <lb/>
            nuts, gave them away and gambled: that you, Tiberius, <lb/>

            lest madness of different sorts might actuate your life,-that <lb/>

            to Ajax give, and why ?</p>
          <p>I am king.</p>
          <p>A common man, I ask no more.</p>
          <p>The thing that I command is fair: if to any I may <lb/>
            seem not just, I give him leave to speak his mind with <lb/>

          <p>Mightiest of kings ! Heaven grant that you may conquer <lb/>
            Troy and safely bring again your fleet! Then, am I free <lb/>
            to ask advice, and give it you, in turn.</p>
          <p>Yes, ask.</p>
          <p>Why do the bones of Ajax moulder above ground-a <lb/>
            hero, next to Achilles' self, and one so often famed for sons <lb/>
            of Greece preserved,-is it that Priam, and Priam's people too, <lb/>
            may glory o'er the unburied dead, through whom so many <lb/>
            youths ne'er joined their fathers in the grave ?</p>
          <p>In his maddened rage he did to death a thousand sheep, <lb/>

            salted grain, are you then right in mind, you wicked man ?</p>
          <p>What is the drift of this ?</p>
          <p>For what did " madman " Ajax do, when with his sword <lb/>
            he slew the flock? From wife and son he violence with­ <lb/>
            held: he heaped on the Atridae many curses, but neither <lb/>

          <p>He who shall take false views of what is real, what is <lb/>
            crime, which in the whirl of passion are confused, shall be <lb/>

            whether he err from lack of judgment or through anger's <lb/>
            heat.</p>
          <p>When Ajax slays the harmless lambs, he is insane : <lb/>
            when you knowingly commit a crime for vain renown, <lb/>
            are you of stable mind? And when your heart's puffed <lb/>
            up with pride, at such time, say is it free from taint of <lb/>
            madness ?</p>
          <p>If one should take delight to carry in his chair a clean <lb/>
            and dainty lamb, should buy it dress, as for a girl, should <lb/>
            get it maids, and trinkets rare, should call it Rufa or Posilla, <lb/>
            should mark it out as wife for gallant knight, from such a <lb/>
            one the Proctor would by decree withdraw all right of <lb/>
            property, and the charge of him would on sane friends <lb/>
            devolve. What ? If any one devote his daughter for a <lb/>
            speechless lamb, is he untouched in brain? Say not so. <lb/>
            And thus where sinful folly is, then there is the greatest <lb/>
            madness. He whom the glare of fame has caught, Bellona, <lb/>
            who in bloody deeds delights, has maddened by her thun­ <lb/>

            ever I or any here have at our homes, regard it yours, to-day <lb/>
            demand it or to-morrow. Hear the considerate youth's <lb/>
            reply: In Lucanian snow you sleep with leggings on, that I <lb/>
            may dine on boar: you from a wintry sea with sweep-net <lb/>
            drag my fish. I am an idler, unworthy to possess so much: <lb/>
            take it, here's a million 1 for your share : the same for you; <lb/>
            three times as much for you, whose wife at midnight hurries <lb/>
            to my call. The son of Æsop dissolved in vinegar a <lb/>
            famous pearl which he had taken from Metella's ear, that <lb/>
            he might quaff a million at a draught: how was he less <lb/>

          <p>The sons of Quintus Arrius, a pretty pair of brothers, <lb/>
            twins in debauchery and silly tastes, and love of all that's <lb/>
            bad, were wont to lunch on nightingales, bought at a fancy <lb/>
            price-into which class are they to go ? Marked with chalk <lb/>

          <p>If to a bearded man it gives delight to build toy-huts, to <lb/>
            yoke to a little cart mouse paired with mouse, to play at odd <lb/>
            and even, to gallop on a stick, madness must turn his head. <lb/>
            If sober reason proves that love's more childish still, and <lb/>
            that it matters not whether in the sand you play your game, <lb/>
            as when a three-year-old, or whine, tormented by some <lb/>

            long ago ? Would you remove the tokens of disease, the <lb/>
            stockings, elbow-rests, and scarfs, as he, when drunk, with <lb/>
            stealthy movement snatched from his neck the wreath, being <lb/>

          <p>If you offer apples to a boy when angry, he declines them. <lb/>

            whether he is to go or not where he was about to go <lb/>
            again without being called, and loiters still beside the hated <lb/>
            doors ? Shall I not, even now, approach when of her own <lb/>
            accord she calls? or rather resolve to put an end to all <lb/>
            my worry ? She shut me out: she calls me back: am I <lb/>
            to return ? No, not though she implore me. Here's what <lb/>
            the slave says, not a little wiser than his Master: Master, <lb/>
            things which have neither limit nor reason, by limit or <lb/>
            reason cannot be treated. In love there are these draw­ <lb/>
            backs, war, then peace again ; these things which chop and <lb/>
            change like storms, and come and go by blinded chance, if <lb/>
            any one should strive to render regular and fixed, he would <lb/>
            no more succeed 1 than if he tried to be insane on certain <lb/>
            principles and rules.</p>
          <p>What, are you sane in mind 2 when picking apple pips <lb/>
            you are rejoiced if perchance you hit the roof? What, when <lb/>
            with your aged mouth 3 you lisp your words of love how are <lb/>
            you more sane than he who builds his baby-huts ? Add <lb/>
            blood to folly, and poke the fire with a sword.4 Just now, <lb/>
            I say, when Marius, after slaying Hellas, jumped headlong <lb/>
            to his doom, was he crack-brained, or will you free him of <lb/>
            the charge of madness and condemn him of the crime, <lb/>
            applying kindred words to things, as nowadays is often <lb/>
            done?</p>
          <p>There was once a freedman, who when old was wont at <note type="footnote"> 1 " Succeed," literally "unfold," " disentangle," so as to reduce to <lb/>
            regularity. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 " Sane in ” mind, penes te, " within yourself," as opposed to " be. <lb/>

          <p>Such arms did Stertinius, eighth of the sages, give to me <lb/>

          <p>DAM. Hear: first of all, you build, that is, you ape the <lb/>

            not exceed a two-foot rule, and yet you ridicule the air and <lb/>
            gait of Turbo when equipped, as for his size of body far too <lb/>
            great: how are you less ridiculous than he ? Whatever <lb/>
            Maecenas does is't right that you, so different in position, <lb/>

            Young frogs, in absence of their dam, were trampled by <lb/>
            a calf, but one escaping tells his mother how a monster <lb/>

            blowing herself out, she said, it couldn't have been so <lb/>

            you are wonderful in both.</p>
          <p>CAT. Nay, that was just my thought, how I should retain <lb/>
            them all, since the points are subtle, and in subtle language <lb/>
            couched.</p>
          <p>HOR. Tell me the man's name, and if he be a Roman or a <lb/>

          <p>Remember that you serve up eggs of oblong shape, being <lb/>

          <p>Nor is't enough to sweep away the fish from an expen­ <lb/>

            the secret found.</p>
          <p>Some there are whose intellect invents new kinds of cakes <lb/>
            and nothing else. It's not enough by any means to use up <lb/>
            all your thoughts on one thing only : as if a man should care <lb/>
            for this alone that his wine be not below the mark, ne'er <lb/>
            thinking of the oil he pours upon his fish. If you expose <lb/>
            your Massic wine beneath a cloudless sky, all that is thick <lb/>
            in it will disappear beneath the breeze of night, and the <lb/>
            fumes hurtful to the nerves will pass away, but if it's strained <lb/>
            through linen cloth, its genuine flavour's lost. He who with <lb/>
            cunning skill mixes Surrentine wine with dregs of Falernian <lb/>
            casks, easily collects the sediment with pigeons' eggs, since <lb/>
            the yolk falls to the bottom, drawing with it foreign matter. <lb/>
            With roasted shrimps and Afric snails, you will recruit the <lb/>
            jaded drinker, for lettuce floats on the stomach, which when <lb/>
            acid after wine, seeks to be roused, when hunger-bitten, <lb/>
            rather by sausages and ham : nay, it would prefer whatever <lb/>
            comes piping-hot from filthy cook shops.</p>
          <p>It is worth your while fully to know the quality of double <lb/>
            sauce. The simple kind consists of sweet oil olive : and this <lb/>
            it will be right to mix with richer wine, and brine of which <lb/>
            Byzantine jars are wont to reek. When this, mixed up, has <lb/>
            boiled, the herbs being chopped, and has stood a while, <lb/>
            sprinkled with Corycian saffron, you will add besides, for <lb/>
            compound sauce, that which the berry of Venafrum yields <lb/>
            when pressed. The apples of Tibur must for flavour to <lb/>
            Picenum give the palm, for in appearance they excel. The <lb/>
            grape, Venucula, suits for preserves1: the Alban you had <lb/>
            better dry in smoke. You will find that I'm the first to <lb/>

            grape, with apples, lees, too, and brine, and white pepper <lb/>
            with black salt sifted in. It is a huge mistake to give <lb/>
            three thousand in the market and then coop up the roving <lb/>
            fish upon a narrow plate. It causes to the stomach great <lb/>
            offence, if a slave have touched a cup with hands made <lb/>
            greasy while he gobbled up the stolen scraps: or if thick <lb/>
            sediment still sticks to an ancient bowl. On napkin, sawdust, <lb/>
            and cheap broom, how little need be spent ? When they're <lb/>
            neglected 'tis a great disgrace. Would you propose to scrub <lb/>
            your inlaid floors with dirty brooms, and over Tyrian cushions <lb/>
            throw your covers all unwashed, forgetting that the less <lb/>
            these need expense and care, so much more justly may the <lb/>

            but always with my betters strove.</p>
          <p>TIRESIAS. Well, then, you'll be a pauper still.</p>
          <p>ULYSSES. I'll bid my valiant soul to brook even this : <lb/>
            besides, I suffered worse in olden days. 0 seer, tell me <lb/>

            <note type="correspondsTo" n="1-53.]"/>
          <p>TIRESIAS. I've told you, and tell you once again: with <lb/>
            cunning craft, at every turn fish for the wills of aged men; <lb/>
            and should a knowing one, or two, eat off the bait and 'scape <lb/>
            your snare, neither abandon hope, nor, baffled once, give up <lb/>
            the art. Should a lawsuit, great or less, be ever in the Forum <lb/>
            tried, whichever party of the two shall live in wealthy state, <lb/>
            without a child, be he unscrupulous enough boldly to summon <lb/>
            into court, without a ground for suit, one better than himself, <lb/>
            be you that man's defender: the citizen with better name <lb/>
            and case spurn with contempt, if there be at home a soil <lb/>
            or fruitful wife. " Quintus," suppose, or "Publius " (ears re­ <lb/>
            fined delight in surnames), " your worth has made me friend <lb/>
            indeed : I'm versed in subtle law, all causes I can plead : one <lb/>
            will sooner tear my eyes out than scorn and rob you of <lb/>
            an empty nut: this is my great concern that you no money <lb/>
            lose, nor be a butt for jests." Advise him to go home, and <lb/>
            nurse himself; take you his case in charge; persist and <lb/>
            persevere, whether the fiery dogstar rends the speechless <lb/>
            statues, or Furius, stuffed with juicy tripe, be-spits the wintry <lb/>
            Alps with hoary snow. Do you not see one nudging his <lb/>
            nearest mate, will say, how amiable he is, to friends obliging, <lb/>
            how keen and active ? More tunnies will swim in and your <lb/>
            preserves will fill.</p>
          <p>Moreover, if a sickly son is reared as heir to great estates, <lb/>
            lest barefaced court of childless men should show your aim, <lb/>
            by attentions, close but unmarked, creep slowly to the hope <lb/>
            that you may be inscribed as second heir, and if some <lb/>
            chance should send the youth to Orcus, that you may come <lb/>
            into his place: this hazard very seldom fails.</p>
          <p>When any one shall show his will for you to read, forget <lb/>
            not to refuse, and push the deed away, but so that by a side­ <lb/>
            long glance you find what the first page may mean upon its <lb/>
            second line : scan with a rapid eye, if you are heir alone or <pb n="188"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[SAT. V."/><lb/>
            a co-heir with many. A notary, from Quinquevir recast,1 <lb/>
            will, most times, mock the gaping crow, and Nasica as he <lb/>
            fortunes hunts will give Coranus many a laugh.</p>
          <p>ULYSSES. Are you frenzied, or do you mock me pur­ <lb/>
            posely by words obscure ?</p>
          <p>TIRESIAS. Son of Laertes, whatso'er I say will come to <lb/>
            pass, or else it won't: for great Apollo grants me the power <lb/>
            to divine.</p>
          <p>ULYSSES. Yet tell me, if you may, what means that tale <lb/>
            of yours ?</p>
          <p>TIRESIAS. What time a youth, the Parthians' dread, a <lb/>
            scion sprung from great Æneas, shall be a mighty prince by <lb/>
            land and sea, the stalwart daughter of Nasica, who wishes not <lb/>
            to pay his full amount, will join herself in wedlock to the <lb/>
            brave Coranus. The son-in-law will then do this : he'll <lb/>
            give his sire-in-law the will and beg that he would read it <lb/>
            through: Nasica will at last accept the tablets oft refused, <lb/>
            and silently will read, and then will find that nought is left <lb/>
            to him and his but to bewail their lot.</p>
          <p>This farther I advise: if perchance some crafty woman <lb/>
            or freed slave manage an oldish doting man, attach your­ <lb/>
            self to them as partner in the work: praise them to him <lb/>
            that you in absence may be praised. This also helps : but <lb/>
            it is better far to storm the citadel itself at first. If he is <lb/>
            mad enough to write vile poems, commend him to the full.</p>
          <p>In my old age what I'm about to tell took place : a horrid <lb/>
            crone was buried thus at Thebes, according to her will: the <lb/>
            heir on his naked shoulders bore the corpse besmeared with <lb/>
            oil in plenty, to try, forsooth, if even in death she could elude <lb/>
            his grasp; because, I fancy, he had been too insistent while <lb/>
            she lived. With caution make approaches : and neither fail <note type="footnote"> 1 The meaning is-a clerk who was formerly a quinquevir, or petty <lb/>
            commissioner, will be sharp enough to baffle the legacy-hunter. </note> <pb n="189"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="54-110.]"/><lb/>
            in duty, nor overdo your zeal. The man who talks too <lb/>
            much will give offence to peevish and to moody men; <lb/>
            still be not over-silent. Be Davus in the play, and stand <lb/>
            with head down-bent, and very like to one in awe. Make <lb/>
            your advances with a fawning care: if the breeze has <lb/>
            freshened, warn him to cover up his precious head for <lb/>
            caution's sake : relieve him from the crowd by shoving with <lb/>
            your shoulders; and if he's talkative lend him still a ready <lb/>
            ear.1 Has he an inordinate love of praise, ply him with it <lb/>
            till he shall lift his hands to heaven, and cry, hold, that's <lb/>
            enough : blow up the swelling bladder with your vaunting <lb/>
            words.</p>
          <p>When he has freed you by his death from tedious bondage <lb/>
            and from care, and wide awake you hear without a doubt, <lb/>
            " Let Ulysses have the fourth of my estate," now and then <lb/>
            let fall such words, "Ah, then, is Dama, dear companion, <lb/>
            now no more ? Where shall I find another friend so sted­ <lb/>
            fast and so true ? and if you can, shed a few tears : 'tis <lb/>
            easy to conceal your face, a tell-tale of your joy. His tomb, <lb/>
            if left to your discretion, erect with no mean stint: let the <lb/>
            neighbours praise a funeral, handsomely conducted.</p>
          <p>Should any of your older fellow-heirs be found to suffer <lb/>
            from a racking cough, say to him that if he wishes to be­ <lb/>
            come the buyer of a farm or of a house from your share of <lb/>
            the estate, you will gladly make it over to him for a sesterce.</p>
          <p>But Proserpine, whose will is law, now drags me hence. <lb/>
            Farewell; long life to you. <note type="footnote"> 1 Literally " Gather up your ear," i.e., hold up your ear with your <lb/>

          <p>This was a wish of mine;—a piece of land, not very large, <lb/>
            in which there was a garden, and near the house a spring of <lb/>
            never-failing water, and, over and above, a little wood. <lb/>
            The gods have dealt by me more liberally, and better than <lb/>
            I hoped. I am content. No more I ask, 0 son of Maia, <lb/>
            but that you make these things my own for life. If hitherto <lb/>
            I've not increased my goods by wicked arts, nor am about <lb/>
            to make them less by vice or negligence; if I offer up no <lb/>
            foolish prayer like this : 0 that to my farm were joined that <lb/>
            tiny nook which mars just now its shapely form! 0 if <lb/>
            some lucky chance would show to me a pot of money, as <lb/>
            once it did to him, who working on a farm for hire, bought <lb/>
            with the treasure-trove, and tilled as his own, that self-same <lb/>
            land-thanks to kind Hercules, a rich man now. If what I <lb/>
            have contents my mind and makes it grateful, I entreat you, <lb/>
            with this prayer, "For the owner make heavy 1 both his <lb/>
            flocks and herds and all things else except his mind, and as <lb/>
            you're wont be ever near me as my surest guard."</p>
          <p>So when from the city I have moved out to my fortress <lb/>
            and my hills, what should I sooner 2 celebrate in these my <lb/>
            satires and poetic prose? Neither does base ambition hurt <lb/>
            me, nor sirocco with depressing air, nor deadly autumn, the <lb/>
            harvest time of heartless Libitina.</p>

            life and work,-so it has pleased the gods,-be you first <lb/>
            topic of my verse. At Rome you drag me out to bail a <lb/>
            friend: " Ho! hurry on, lest another do the kindness ere <lb/>
            you come!" Should north wind scourge the earth, or <lb/>
            winter lead the snowy day in shorter course,1 I'm bound to <lb/>
            go. Then having uttered in clear tones and in set form what <lb/>
            some day afterwards may prove my hurt, I'm forced to <lb/>
            struggle through the crowd and jostle those who won't <lb/>
            move on. " What do you mean, you madman, and what <lb/>
            are you about ? " and then he follows up, the surly dog, with <lb/>
            imprecations full of wrath: "You would knock everything <lb/>
            about that's in your way, if you are hasting to Maecenas <lb/>
            with a mind that ne'er forgets that treat." This2 pleases <lb/>
            me, and is sweet as honey to my taste; I'll not deny it.</p>
          <p>But soon as I reach Esquiliae with its gloomy past, a <lb/>
            hundred cares of others patter on my head and ears, round <lb/>
            front and flank: " Roscius requested that you would meet <lb/>
            him at the Puteal3 before the second hour." "Quintus, <lb/>
            the writers begged that you'd remember to come back about <lb/>
            that new affair which interests all." " See to it, that Maecenas <note type="footnote"> 1 "In shorter course," interiore gyro, literally, "inner circle”— <lb/>
            “ the arc traversed apparently by the sun growing smaller from day to <lb/>

            that he did not care whom or what he pushed about if he were hastening <lb/>
            to keep an engagement with Maecenas." But lines 47-49 will perhaps <lb/>
            help us to a more natural explanation, viz., the public confession by <lb/>
            this surly fellow of the grounds for the jealousy felt by many towards <lb/>
            the poet, and also the coupling of his name with that of Mæcenas. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 " The writers," i.e., The Association of scribæ, or public clerks, of <lb/>

            duly seals these documents." Should you say, I'll try: you <lb/>
            can, if you wish, he adds, and urges you.</p>
          <p>The seventh year, now nearing eighth, will soon be gone <lb/>
            since Mæcenas first began to have me in the number of his <lb/>
            friends; so far as this at least, as one whom he would take <lb/>
            to ride beside him when going to drive, and with whom he <lb/>
            could exchange such simple chat as this: " What o'clock <lb/>
            is it ? Is the Thracian Gallina a match for Syrus ? The <lb/>
            morning cold now nips one if he shows not caution;" and <lb/>
            such remarks as may be safely trusted to a leaky ear. <lb/>
            Through all this time “our friend has been exposed to <lb/>
            envy more and more from day to day and hour to hour. " He <lb/>
            had sat beside him at the games," says one: " He had <lb/>
            played in a match with him in the Campus," says another : <lb/>
            " He's a lucky fellow," say they all. A chilling rumour <lb/>
            spreads from the Rostra through the streets; whoever meets <lb/>
            me asks me of it: " Good Sir, for you must know since you <lb/>
            have closer contact with the great, have you heard anything <lb/>
            about the Dacians? ” " Not a word, I do assure you." <lb/>
            " How you will always jeer your friends !" " But may all <lb/>
            the gods confound me if I've heard a whisper of it." <lb/>
            “What? is it in Sicily or Italy that Caesar is to give the <lb/>
            soldiers promised farms?" When I swear that I know <lb/>
            nothing of it, they wonder at me as the one and only man of <lb/>
            silence, strange and deep.</p>
          <p>'Midst such distractions the day is lost and I made <lb/>
            wretched, not without many a wish : 0 country, when shall <lb/>
            I look on you again ? when shall I be free, now with the <lb/>
            books of men of yore, now with sleep and hours of idleness, <lb/>
            to quaff the draught that all life's worries drowns ? 0 when <lb/>
            shall beans, kin to Pythagoras, be placed on my board, and <lb/>
            with them cabbage well soaked with fat of bacon ? 0 nights <note type="footnote"> 1 “Our friend," i.c., I myself. </note> <pb n="193"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="39-92.]"/><lb/>
            and suppers of the gods! in which at my own fireside my <lb/>
            friends and I enjoy our meal, and then I feed the saucy <lb/>
            slaves on dishes we've but tasted. The guests, each as he <lb/>
            wishes, drain cups of varying strength, free from all silly <lb/>
            rules, whether one of stronger head takes fiery cups, or <lb/>
            another wishes to grow mellow with those of moderate <lb/>
            strength.</p>
          <p>And so the talk begins, not of others' houses in country <lb/>
            or in town, not whether Lepos dances well or ill; but we dis­ <lb/>
            cuss what it concerns us more to know, and what it is hurtful <lb/>
            not to know,-whether the happiness of men depends on <lb/>
            virtue or on wealth: or what draws us into friendships— <lb/>
            self-interest or worth : what is the nature of the Good, and <lb/>
            what's the highest Good.</p>
          <p>Meantime my neighbour Cervius tells in his chatty way <lb/>
            old women's stories bearing on some mooted point. For if <lb/>
            one praise Arellius and his wealth, not knowing all the care <lb/>
            it brings, he thus begins.</p>
          <p>Once on a time a Country Mouse, 'tis said, received a city <lb/>
            kinsman in his humble cell-an ancient guest now welcoming <lb/>
            an ancient friend. Rough in his way he was, and careful of <lb/>
            his stores, but still he could at times relax his narrow <lb/>
            soul to hospitable calls. Why enlarge ? A mouse like that <lb/>
            grudged neither choice chick-pea nor long oat-heads; and <lb/>
            carrying in his mouth raisins and nibbled scraps of pork <lb/>
            he offered them, anxious by a varied fare to overcome <lb/>
            his guest's disdain, who barely touched each viand with his <lb/>
            saucy tooth: while the host himself stretched at his length <lb/>
            on this year's straw ate spelt and darnel, leaving untouched <lb/>
            the daintier fare.</p>
          <p>At length, the City Mouse says to his host:—“ My friend, <lb/>
            what pleasure can it give to live midst hardships on the <lb/>
            slope of this steep wooded height ? Surely you prefer men <note type="footnote"> N </note> <pb n="194"/>
             <note type="margin">[SAT. VI.</note><lb/>
            and the city to these savage woods ? Trust yourself to me <lb/>
            and come along and bear me company; since earthly things <lb/>
            have mortal lives, and neither for high nor low is there escape <lb/>
            from death: wherefore, good sir, live happy while you can <lb/>
            in pleasure's walks; enjoy your life, and ever think how <lb/>
            short your span must be."</p>
          <p>When these few words convinced the Country Mouse he <lb/>
            bounds out nimbly from his home, and both perform their <lb/>
            purposed march, anxious to creep into the town while still <lb/>
            ’twas dark.</p>
          <p>And now Night held the middle space of heaven, when <lb/>
            both set footsteps in the gorgeous mansion of a wealthy <lb/>
            man, where coverlets, in scarlet dyed, glowed on the ivory <lb/>
            couch, and many dishes left from last day's feast were <lb/>
            packed hard by in baskets high piled up. So when he placed <lb/>
            his rustic friend, stretched at full length on purple rug, the <lb/>
            host runs up and down, like waiter with his tunic tucked, <lb/>
            and brings course after course without a break, and like a <lb/>
            slave performs his every duty, licking beforehand all he <lb/>
            serves. The other as he lolls at ease joys in his altered lot, <lb/>
            and acts the part of happy guest in midst of all things good; <lb/>
            when all at once loud banging of the doors roused both <lb/>
            from off the couch. They run in consternation through the <lb/>
            whole saloon, and dead with fright they trembled still the <lb/>
            more soon as the lofty house resounded with Molossian <lb/>
            dogs.</p>
          <p>Then says the Country Mouse: " Of such a life I've had <lb/>
            enough," says he, " and so good-bye: my wood and cell <lb/>
            from dangers free will satisfy my needs with humble vetch."</p><pb n="195"/>

            <title type="sub">DAVUS. NO MAN FREE BUT THE SAPIENS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>DAV. I have been listening all this time, and anxious to <lb/>
            say a word or two, being only a slave I fear to venture.</p>
          <p>HOR. Is it Davus ?</p>
          <p>DAV. Yes, Davus, a slave who loves his master, and is <lb/>
            tolerably honest, that is, that you may think him likely <lb/>
            to live.1</p>
          <p>HOR. Come then, employ December liberty, since our <lb/>
            forefathers so have willed; speak on.</p>
          <p>DAV. Many men delight in vicious ways without a halt, and <lb/>
            cling to their settled plan : some fluctuate, now following the <lb/>
            right, now wholly prone to wrong. Priscus was often seen to <lb/>
            wear three rings at once, again he had the left hand bare: <lb/>
            he lived an inconsistent life, so that from hour to hour he <lb/>
            changed his stripe:2 emerging from a splendid house he <lb/>
            suddenly would plunge into a den, from which a freedman <lb/>
            of the better sort would be ashamed to come. At one time <lb/>
            he'd prefer to live a profligate at Rome, again at Athens as <lb/>
            a learned man, born under anger of the Vertumni, however <lb/>
            many they may be.</p>
          <p>The buffoon Volanerius, after the well-earned gout <lb/>
            crippled his joints, maintained a slave at daily pay to lift <lb/>
            the dice and put them in the box: the more persistently a <lb/>
            man goes on in vice, the less will he be wretched, and <lb/>
            superior to him who strains now with a tightened, now with <lb/>
            a slackened rope.</p>
          <p>HOR. Are you not going to tell me all this day, you rascal, <lb/>
            what is the drift of this unsavoury stuff ? <note type="footnote"> 1 So we speak of one as " too good to live." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 " Changed his stripe," i.e., changed from senator's robe with broad <lb/>

          <p>DAV. It aims at you, I say.</p>
          <p>HOR. How SO, you scoundrel ?</p>
          <p>DAY. You laud the income and the morals of the plebs of <lb/>
            old, and yet if any god should suddenly put them in your reach, <lb/>
            you'd out and out refuse, either because you do not really feel <lb/>
            that that is better which you clamour for, or because you do <lb/>
            not with firm conviction champion the right, and stick in <lb/>
            the mire, striving in vain to pluck your foot out of the mud. <lb/>
            When at Rome you long for the country; when living in <lb/>
            the country, with fickle will you praise to the skies the city <lb/>
            far away. If it chance that you're invited nowhere, you <lb/>
            laud your quiet dish of cabbage, and just as though you <lb/>
            went from home only when forced, you say that you are <lb/>
            happy, and are delighted that you're not obliged to sup out <lb/>
            anywhere. Should Mæcenas bid you to his house, at lighting <lb/>
            of the lamps, as a later guest: “ Will nobody bring me the <lb/>
            oil1 more quickly ? Does anybody hear me ? " you sputter <lb/>
            out with a loud noise, and off you rush.2 Milvius and the <lb/>
            parasites depart, after they've prayed some prayers for you, <lb/>
            not meant to be reported. 11 For," suppose he (Milvius) said <lb/>
            " I confess that I am weak, and led by my appetite; I raise <lb/>
            my nose 3 to catch a flavour: I'm devoid of self control, I <lb/>
            have no energy, and if you wish still more, I'm a glutton." <lb/>
            Sir, when you yourself are what I am and worse, perhaps, <lb/>
            would you inveigh 'gainst me, as if you were a better man, <lb/>
            and cover up your faults in specious words ? What if you <lb/>
            be found a greater fool than I, bought for five hundred <lb/>

            tell you what Crispinus' porter taught me.... I'm <lb/>
            not a profligate, you say, nor by Hercules am I a thief when <lb/>
            I wisely pass your silver plate. Away with the risk, at once <lb/>
            will froward nature take the leap, the curbs removed. Are <lb/>
            you my master, subject to so many and so strong restraints <lb/>
            of men and things, whom the prætor's rod once and again <lb/>
            applied will never free from painful dread ? Add, moreover, <lb/>
            this which will not have less force than what I've said 1: for <lb/>
            whether he's a helper who obeys a slave, as your custom <lb/>
            has it, or a fellow-slave, what am I to you? Without a <lb/>
            doubt you who lord it over me are in a wretched bondage <lb/>
            to another, and like a puppet, are led on by strings outside <lb/>
            yourself.</p>
          <p>Who, then, is free ? The philosopher who controls him­ <lb/>
            self, whom neither poverty, nor death, nor bonds affright, <lb/>
            brave to resist his passions, honours to despise, and self­ <lb/>
            contained withal, both smooth and round so that no foreign <lb/>
            matter can to his polished surface cling, 'gainst whom even <lb/>
            Fortune rushes impotent, and maims herself. Can you find <lb/>
            any thing in this that fits yourself? A mistress demands <lb/>
            five talents from you, she duns you for it, and as she drives <lb/>
            you from her door, gives you a pail of water on your head, <lb/>
            then calls you back ; from such base yoke withdraw your <lb/>
            neck; come, say the word, 11 I'm free, I'm free." You <lb/>
            cannot; for a master 2 nowise mild, your spirit rules, and <lb/>
            goads you sharply when you're weary, and when you're <lb/>
            restive, whirls you round and round.</p>
          <p>Or when, you fool, you stand entranced before a picture <lb/>
            done by Pausias, how are you less culpable than I when I <lb/>
            admire the fights of Fulvius and of Rutuba, or of Pacideianus <note type="footnote"> 1 " Said," dietis, able of comparison after levius: some would make <lb/>
            it depend on adde. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 “ Master, viz. Love. </note> <pb n="198"/>

            with sinew on the strain,1 painted in chalk or charcoal, to <lb/>
            the very life, as if the men in thorough earnest fight, and <lb/>
            deal their blows, and move their arms to parry strokes? <lb/>
            Then Davus is a good-for-nothing and an idle scamp, while <lb/>
            you are called a subtle and a knowing judge of the " old <lb/>
            Masters'" works. I am worthless if attracted by a smoking <lb/>
            cake. Does your great self-denial and your strength of <lb/>
            mind resist rich dinners, and why does my obedience to <lb/>
            appetite more hurtful prove to me ? My back pays for it. <lb/>
            How will you be punished less, who hunt for dainties that <lb/>
            can't be had for nought ? 2 No doubt great feasts sought <lb/>
            after without end grow loathsome, and the feet befooled <lb/>
            refuse to bear the bloated frame. Does that slave sin who <lb/>
            under shade of night parts with a stolen scraper for a bunch <lb/>
            of grapes: is not he a slave who sells his farm to please <lb/>
            his stomach ? Here's another fault of yours: you cannot <lb/>
            be an hour alone, you can't employ your leisure right, and <lb/>
            you fly from yourself as runaway and truant, trying now with <lb/>
            wine and now with sleep to baffle Care. It's all in vain: <lb/>
            for your grim attendant holds you close and follows as <lb/>
            you fly.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>HORATIUS. How did you enjoy Nasidienus' feast, that <lb/>
            pet of Fortune ? For when I sought you yesterday to dine <lb/>
            with me, 'twas said you had been at his house since early <lb/>
            afternoon.</p>
          <p>FUNDANIUS. So well, that never in my life did I enjoy <lb/>
            myself so much.</p>
          <p>HOR. Tell me, if it isn't irksome, what dainty first <lb/>
            appeased the rage of appetite.</p>
          <p>FUND. First a Lucanian boar was served ; it was caught, <lb/>
            the host declared, when Auster gently blew; the garnishings <lb/>
            were pungent turnips, lettuce, and radishes, which stimulate <lb/>
            the languid stomach, with skirret, pickle, and lees of Coan <lb/>
            wine. This course removed, a slave, high tucked, wiped clean <lb/>
            the maple board with purple cloth, while a second cleared <lb/>
            away whatever scraps still lay about, which might be offen­ <lb/>
            sive to the guests : then, like an Attic virgin with Ceres' <lb/>
            sacred trays, in stalks a swarthy slave, by name Hydaspes, <lb/>
            who brings the Cæcuban, and Alcon follows with the Chian, <lb/>
            but not that mixed with brine.1</p>
          <p>On this the host explains: " Maecenas, if you prefer an <lb/>
            Alban or Falernian wine to those set on, we have them both."</p>
          <p>HOR. 0 miserable riches ! But now, Fundanius, I should <lb/>
            like to know who formed the company with whom you fared <lb/>
            so well.</p>
          <p>FUND. I was on the highest couch, and near me Viscus of <lb/>
            Thurii, and below me Varius, if I remember right: with <lb/>
            Servius Balatro Vibidius came, whom Mæcenas brought as <note type="footnote"> “ Mixed with brine.”—The phrase expers maris may also mean <lb/>
            “that never crossed the sea." </note> <pb n="200"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[SAT. VIII."/><lb/>
            extra guests.1 Nomentanus was above the host, and below <lb/>
            him Porcius, who at one mouthful gulped whole cakes like a <lb/>
            buffoon : Nomentanus' duty was to show with his finger any <lb/>
            dish which haply was unseen : for the other guests, we, I <lb/>
            mean, feast on fowl, on shell and other fish, which had a <lb/>
            hidden flavour far different from the common: as even at <lb/>
            once was plain when he had handed me the liver of a plaice <lb/>
            and of a turbot, which none had tasted.2</p>
          <p>Thereafter he informed me that honey-apples are rosy <lb/>
            when plucked beneath a waning moon. What profit this <lb/>
            may be you'll better learn from the connoisseur himself.</p>
          <p>Then Vibidius says to Balatro: " unless we drink both <lb/>
            deep and hard we shall die without revenge " ; and asks for <lb/>
            larger cups. On this paleness changes the purveyor's face, <lb/>
            who dreaded nought so much as heavy drinkers, either <lb/>
            because they make their rude remarks too freely, or because <lb/>
            the stronger wines deaden the keenness of the taste. Vibidius <lb/>
            and Balatro, all following suit, empty whole flagons into <lb/>
            Alifanian cups. The guests of the lowest couch did little <lb/>
            damage to their master's flasks.</p>
          <p>A lamprey at its length upon a dish is now brought in <lb/>
            midst floating shrimps. On this the master says, " this fish <lb/>
            was caught," says he, "before it spawned, after it spawned <lb/>
            'twould be inferior in the flesh." The sauce is mixed with <lb/>
            three ingredients,-with oil which Venafrum's first pressing <lb/>
            gave: with caviar, from Spanish mackerel made, with wine <lb/>
            of five years old, but grown this side the sea,1 while it still <note type="footnote"> 1 " Extra guests," literally, " shadows," as uninvited guests were <lb/>
            called. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Some interpret " which he himself had never tasted before ; or, <lb/>
            " Such (so good) as he had never tasted before." Professor Palmer <lb/>
            suggests that ingustata may mean that the peculiarity could be de. <lb/>
            tected by the nose, " without tasting" at all. This is the idea in the <lb/>
            translation given above : " the smell was quite enough for every one." </note> <pb n="201"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="21-80.]"/><lb/>
            boils;—the boiling done, the Chian suits it so as none <lb/>
            besides: pepper add and vinegar made from Methymna's <lb/>
            grapes when sour. 'Twas I that first showed how to boil <lb/>
            in it green rockets with elecampane of better juice. Curtillus <lb/>
            proposed unwashed sea-urchins, as something better than the <lb/>
            shell-fish yields.</p>
          <p>Meantime the curtain-awning fell in a heap upon the dish, <lb/>
            and brought more grimy dust than North wind raises on <lb/>
            Campania's plains. We feared some greater ill, but when we <lb/>
            saw the danger past, our spirits rose. Rufus with drooping <lb/>
            head wept as if a son had died before his day. What the <lb/>
            upshot would have been (I know not) had not Nomentanus <lb/>
            with ready tact thus cheered his friend. " Ah! Fortune, <lb/>
            what deity is more unkind to us than you? How you <lb/>
            always take delight in making sport of human things!" <lb/>
            Varius could scarce contain his laughter with his napkin in <lb/>
            his mouth. Balatro, who sneers at everything, then said, <lb/>
            such is the lot of life: and so your fame will ne'er reward <lb/>
            your toil. To think that you should thus be racked by every <lb/>
            care, that I may sumptuously dine: to see the bread's not <lb/>
            burned, the sauce not served ill-seasoned, that all the slaves <lb/>
            attend well dressed and brushed. Add besides mischances <lb/>
            such as these, if the curtains tumble down as they have done <lb/>
            just now: if a groom should slip his foot and break a dish. <lb/>
            But the misfortunes of a host, as of a leader, are wont to call <lb/>
            his genius forth, prosperity, to hide it. Then said Nasi­ <lb/>
            dienus in reply : " May the gods bestow on you all blessings <lb/>
            which you ask: so kind a man you are, and such a courteous <lb/>
            guest." Then he calls for his slippers. And now on every <lb/>
            couch you could observe how whispers buzzed about, <lb/>
            breathed secretly in every ear.</p>
          <p>HOR. No play should I have rather seen than that. But <lb/>
            tell me, pray, those things which afterwards afforded mirth. <pb n="202"/>

          <p>FUND. Whilst Vibidius asked the slave if the flagon had <lb/>
            been broken too, because no cups were given him when he <lb/>
            called, and whilst we laugh on false pretexts, with Balatro <lb/>
            as second,1 Nasidienus, you return with altered brow, mean­ <lb/>
            ing to amend ill-luck by skill: then followed slaves who <lb/>
            carried on an ample tray the limbs of a crane, carved up and <lb/>
            sprinkled well with salt and meal: the liver too of a goose, <lb/>
            all white, fattened on juicy figs, and wings of hares torn off, as <lb/>
            sweeter far, than if one ate them with the loins; next we <lb/>
            beheld some blackbirds served, with breasts quite scorched, <lb/>
            and pigeons with no rumps, all nice enough, if the host would <lb/>
            only leave untold the cause, and nature of the things. Him <lb/>
            we thus took vengeance on and fled, that not an article we <lb/>
            touched, as if on them Canidia, more fell than Afric snakes, <lb/>
            had blown with tainted breath. <note type="footnote"> 1 " As second," that is, "acting a second part," and helping on the <lb/>

            <title type="sub">INTRODUCTION.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>The Epistles are universally acknowledged to be the most <lb/>
            perfect in diction, in metre, in style, and in polish, of all <lb/>
            the writings of Horace. Most of them, if not all, were <lb/>
            written, it would seem, in his more mature years when his <lb/>
            great practice in composition had prepared him for his <lb/>
            highest effort. The train of thought is that of a refined <lb/>
            and educated man, conscious of his powers, and not afraid <lb/>
            to declare his opinions, and submit them to the judgment of <lb/>
            the world. The Epistles abound in excellent matter, and <lb/>
            are especially conspicuous for their high moral tone. They <lb/>
            have been called 11 the poetry of manner and society," and <lb/>
            justly so. They treat of difficult social and personal affairs <lb/>
            with rare discrimination and consummate tact, and give <lb/>
            token of greater seriousness and calmer reflection in coming <lb/>
            to conclusions than his other works afford. One sees <lb/>
            throughout them the same Horatian characteristics as have <lb/>
            been met with in the Odes, the Epodes, and the Satires­ <lb/>
            his patriotism, his love of the country, his admiration of <lb/>
            virtue, and his detestation of all that is mean, ignoble, or <lb/>
            snobbish; his advocacy of moderation in all things, and his <lb/>
            condemnation of the follies, the extravagance, and the lusts <lb/>
            and luxuries of his day, are clearly read between the lines" <lb/>
             <pb n="206"/>
            in his Epistles. These Epistles are not Satires, but they <lb/>
            serve an equally good purpose. It has been said that while <lb/>
            the Satires show what is wrong, the Epistles teach what is <lb/>
            right. Thus they are, in one sense, a continuation and a <lb/>
            filling out of the Satires, but are more concerned with <lb/>
            individual men, and special subjects and incidents. The <lb/>
            masculine good sense which is found in the Satires makes <lb/>
            itself as conspicuous in the Epistles, and renders them as <lb/>
            instructive and as appreciable to the reader of to-day as if <lb/>
            they were written by a modern author not far removed from <lb/>
            our times. In fact, they are human and cosmopolitan. <lb/>
            They are more free than the Satires from obscure allusions, <lb/>
            and their teaching goes at once to the understanding and <lb/>
            the heart. The poet is the same " dear old Horace " with <lb/>
            whom, after two thousand years have held his ashes in the <lb/>
            urn, we still can chat, and laugh, and sometimes almost <lb/>
            weep with him in his more pathetic moods. Horace had a <lb/>
            soul for man, his joys, his cares, his woes. His motto seems <lb/>
            to have been—“ Homo sum ; nil humani a me alienum puto.”</p>
          <p>The term Epistulæ is not one given by the poet himself, <lb/>
            though he uses the word once, Book II., ii, 22. He ranks <lb/>
            the so-called Epistulæ among his Sermones, or Prosaic <lb/>
            poetry. These, as was said of the Satires, are chatty, <lb/>
            gossipy notes on men and things in a light, friendly, con­ <lb/>
            versational style, such as a letter of the present day might <lb/>
            exhibit. In some cases they are letters proper, such as <lb/>
            XV., in which the poet asks a friend as to the merits of <lb/>
            some health-resorts; No. V. is simply an invitation to <lb/>
            dinner; IX. a letter of introduction for Septimius to Tiberius <lb/>
            Nero; XIV. remonstrates with his steward at the Sabine <lb/>
            farm in regard to his discontent with country life. Some of <lb/>
            them have a good deal of the Satiric in them, and some of <lb/>
            them a touch of irony, but all of them display much of <lb/>
            that bonhomie which marked Horace in all his dealings <lb/>
             <pb n="207"/>
            with his fellow man. In the Epistles, more than in the <lb/>
            Satires, Horace charms our imagination and wins our affec­ <lb/>
            tions. When he makes any reference to the faults or weak­ <lb/>
            nesses of friends, he does it with a delicate good humour, <lb/>
            full of sympathy and tenderness of feeling.</p>
          <p>In the Second Book of the Epistles, the subjects are not <lb/>
            moral and social, but literary and critical. In the First, <lb/>
            addressed to the Emperor Augustus, the author defends <lb/>
            the Classical School of Latin Poetry," combats the idea <lb/>
            that age and not real excellence should be the test of <lb/>
            poetry, and predicts with confidence that in process of time <lb/>
            the national literature would, slowly perhaps but certainly, <lb/>
            attain the highest name.</p>
          <p>The Second Epistle, to Florus, gives the poet's reasons <lb/>
            for abandoning Lyric Composition.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>The Third and most famous of these Literary Epistles is <lb/>
            that addressed to the Pisos. It is not known who gave it <lb/>
            the title of " Ars Poetica ”—certainly not Horace himself. <lb/>
            Probably it was one of the Scholiasts or one of the early <lb/>
            grammarians. It was evidently not intended as a complete <lb/>
            Treatise on the Art of Poetry, but simply as a friendly letter <lb/>
            to Piso and his two sons, the elder of whom, it is supposed, <lb/>
            was about to venture on the publication of some poetry he <lb/>
            had composed.</p>
          <p>Horace's " Ars Poetica " simply gives a brief sketch of the <lb/>
            Greek Drama, and states the principles of criticism which <lb/>
            should be applied to it. It accords well in subject and <lb/>
            treatment with the two Epistles which precede it. Horace's <lb/>
            remarks on some questions of an aesthetic character are <lb/>
            marked by his usual independence of judgment and sound <lb/>
            common sense. See Analysis of the poem in Dean Wick­ <lb/>

          <p>Theme of my earliest muse, theme worthiest of my last, <lb/>
            you seek, Maecenas, to shut me up again within my former <lb/>
            school,1 though I've been well approved, and already gifted <lb/>
            with the foil.2 My age is not what once it was, my inclina­ <lb/>
            tion's gone. Veianius to the temple door of great Alcides 3 <lb/>
            nails his arms, and in the country hides himself from sight, <lb/>
            lest from the margin of the sand he so often need to beg <lb/>
            the people for discharge.4 I have a monitor who of times <lb/>
            rings it in my well rinsed ear—“ Unyoke in time, if you are <lb/>
            wise, the steed now growing old, lest at the last he fail midst <note type="footnote"> 1 “School,” ludo, i.e., school for training gladiators. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 "Foil," rudis—a wand or wooden sword which gladiators received <lb/>
            as a sign of honourable discharge. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 "Alcides," i.e., Hercules. </note><note type="footnote">4 "Discharge." Gladiators, we are told, were awarded their rudis <lb/>
            in this way. It does not seem to refer here to begging the people for <lb/>
            one's life, if the combatant had fought well, but was beaten. </note> <note type="footnote"> O </note> <pb n="210"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[EP. I."/><lb/>
            jeers, and strain his panting flanks." 1 So now I lay aside <lb/>
            my verses and my other toys, and only study and enquire <lb/>
            what's true in morals, what is fit, and in this I'm all en­ <lb/>
            grossed : I treasure up and duly range what, later on, I <lb/>
            may bring forth for use.</p>
          <p>And lest you ask beneath what chief, within what hornet <lb/>
            I shelter seek,-to no one master do I fealty swear, but <lb/>
            where'er the stress of weather drives me, there do I land <lb/>
            and claim the rights of guest. Now I become a man of <lb/>
            action, and plunge in the waves of civil strife, true virtue's <lb/>
            rigid and attendant guard. Again the creed of Aristippus I <lb/>
            stealthily embrace, and strive to subjugate all things to me, <lb/>
            not me to things.</p>
          <p>As the night seems long to him whose lover breaks her <lb/>
            tryst-as the day seems long to him whose task is over­ <lb/>
            due, and as the year goes slowly by to minors curbed by <lb/>
            mothers' watchful care, just so the seasons move to me, tardy <lb/>
            and irksome, which delay the hope and the intent of pur­ <lb/>
            suing with an eager zeal what benefits the rich and poor alike, <lb/>
            and the neglect of which will harm alike the old and young.</p>
          <p>Then what remains is this, that by these Elements I <lb/>
            regulate my life, and comfort seek. With your eye you <lb/>
            may not strain far as famed Lynceus could, but you'd not on <lb/>
            that account neglect to salve your eyes when they are sore : <lb/>
            nor because you cannot hope for limbs like matchless <lb/>
            Glycon's, would you neglect to guard your body from the <lb/>
            knotty gout. Up to a certain point you may advance, even <lb/>
            if you cannot farther go.</p>
          <p>Perhaps your mind is fevered by a greed of wealth or <lb/>
            other miserable wish;—in that case there are words and <note type="footnote"> 1 ., Panting flanks" may refer simply to a horse over-driven, or to <lb/>
            one broken-winded. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 " Home," namely, what sect of philosophers. </note> <pb n="211"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="10-57.]"/><lb/>
            spells by which you can assuage that pain, and put away <lb/>
            much of your disease. If you're puffed up with love of fame, <lb/>
            there are unfailing remedies which will restore you to a <lb/>
            proper state, if you will only read the formulae three times <lb/>
            with pure intent. Be you jealous, irritable, given to sloth, <lb/>
            to wine or love, no one is so savage that he can't be tamed, <lb/>
            if he will only lend to culture an attentive ear.</p>
          <p>In virtue 'tis the earliest step to keep from vice-in <lb/>
            wisdom, to get quit of folly. You see with what a pain of <lb/>
            mind and risk of life you shun those evils which you think <lb/>
            the chief-a stinted purse and base defeat. You hasten <lb/>
            with your merchandise to India's furthest bounds, fleeing <lb/>
            from poverty o'er seas, o'er rocks, through fires,1—then <lb/>
            wont you learn and listen with belief to better men, to <lb/>
            save you from a care for that which now you foolishly admire <lb/>
            and wish.</p>
          <p>What athlete in the hamlets and the streets would fail <lb/>
            to accept the great Olympic wreath, had he the hope, had <lb/>
            he the offer, of the tempting palm without the dusty strife ?</p>
          <p>Silver is less worth than gold, gold than virtue. Citizens, <lb/>
            O citizens, money must first be got; after money, virtue. <lb/>
            This first and foremost rule Janus from end to end 2 pro­ <lb/>
            claims : this lesson boys repeat, and old men too, with <lb/>
            slate and satchel o'er the left arm slung.</p>

            statues of Janus in the forum, one at each end and one in the middle. <lb/>
            The middle one was that where usurers met. Some say that there were <lb/>

            you need, you lack but six or seven,-then you'll still be a <lb/>
            plebeian as you were. But boys in play say thus—“ If you <lb/>
            do right, you shall be king." Ever be this your wall of <lb/>
            brass. “To keep a heart that knows no guile, a cheek no <lb/>
            crime may pale.”</p>
          <p>Which, then, pray tell me, is the better guide-the law of <lb/>
            Roscius, or the children's rhyme which offers power to those <lb/>
            who do " the right," chanted from age to age by such as <lb/>
            Curius and Camillus, those men of mighty soul ? Is his <lb/>
            advice more sound who says, make money, make money, <lb/>
            rightly if you can ; if not, make money any way at all, that <lb/>
            from a nearer point you may get a better view of Pupius' <lb/>
            doleful plays; or his who with an ever ready help exhorts and <lb/>
            braces you to face proud Fortune's frowns like one who's <lb/>
            free and holds his head erect ?</p>
          <p>But if, perchance, the Roman people ask, why as I <lb/>
            walk their porticos, I don't adopt their views, and neither <lb/>
            follow nor avoid what they approve or hate, I will repeat <lb/>
            what once the wary fox said to the lion in his feeble state; <lb/>
            " because those footprints frighten me, all looking towards <lb/>
            you, but ne'er a one looks back again." You are a mon­ <lb/>
            strous beast of many heads. For what shall I follow or <lb/>
            whom obey ? Some take delight to farm all public jobs,1 <lb/>
            and some there are who hunt for greedy widows with tit bits 2 <lb/>
            and with fruit, and catch old men to put in their preserves. <lb/>
            For many money grows by usury kept hid.</p>
          <p>But be it so that different men are occupied by different <lb/>
            pursuits and tastes, can the same man continue for an hour <note type="footnote"> 1 " Public jobs," i.e., contracts for public works, or for farming the <lb/>

            to have the same delight? Suppose the rich man says, <lb/>
            " No bay in all the world excels the charming Baiæ,” at once <lb/>
            the lake and sea feel to their cost the ardour of the im­ <lb/>
            patient lord ; but if some silly whim should give a hint, to- <lb/>
            morrow, workmen, to Teanum you shall move your tools. If <lb/>
            the marriage bed is in his hall, he says there's nought before, <lb/>
            nought better than unwedded life : if it's not, he swears that <lb/>
            married men alone are blessed. By what a knot shall I <lb/>
            restrain this ever changing Proteus ?</p>
          <p>What of the poor man ? Have your laugh : he changes <lb/>
            garrets, beds and baths and barbers, and in his hired boat <lb/>
            gets as sick as does the wealthy man who sails his private <lb/>
            yacht.</p>
          <p>Should I meet you with my hair just trimmed, the barber <lb/>
            being uneven in his work, you laugh: if it happen that a <lb/>
            threadbare shirt is seen beneath a tunic with the nap still <lb/>
            fresh, or if my toga sits upon me all awry, you laugh. What <lb/>
            do you do when my judgment wars against itself, now spurns <lb/>
            what it has sought, then seeks again what it has lately left, <lb/>
            sways to and fro, and is inconsistent through the whole tenor <lb/>
            of my life; pulls down, builds up, changes square for round <lb/>
            and round for square? You think I have just a common <lb/>
            craze and so you do not laugh, nor do you think I need a <lb/>
            doctor, nor a guardian, by the prætor named, though you <lb/>
            take charge of my affairs, and are offended by the ill-pared <lb/>
            nail of one who leans upon you, and regards you with <lb/>
            respect.</p>
          <p>To sum up: the wise man is inferior to Jove alone, he's <lb/>
            rich and free, honoured and handsome, and in a word he's <lb/>
            king of kings : and above all, he's sound,1 unless it be when <lb/>
            phlegm is troublesome. <note type="footnote"> 1 " Sound”—sanus, the opposite of insanus, but a double meaning is <lb/>

            of the Trojan war : who shows more clearly and with more <lb/>
            effect than Crantor and Chrysippus do, what's noble, what is <lb/>
            base, what's useful, and what's not. Why I believe so, hear <lb/>
            me, unless some pressing business prevents you.</p>
          <p>The story which relates how, all for Paris' love, Greece <lb/>
            engaged in tedious war against barbarian hosts, sets forth <lb/>
            the passion-tides of foolish kings and nations too. An tenor <lb/>
            wishes to cut short the cause of war : but what says Paris ? <lb/>
            He declares he can't be forced, even though the terms should <lb/>
            be a peaceful reign and happy life. Nestor is eager to com­ <lb/>
            pose the strife between Achilles and the son of Atreus. <lb/>
            Love stirs the one, and anger, both in common. What­ <lb/>
            ever follies kings commit the people 2 suffer for the fault: <lb/>
            by broils, by craft, by crimes, by lust and wrath, both in <lb/>
            and beyond the walls of Troy they go astray.</p>
          <p>Again, to show what manly spirit, and what wisdom can <lb/>
            effect, he has given Ulysses as a worthy type, who after Troy's <lb/>
            o'erthrow with wise intent explored the cities and the ways of <lb/>
            many men, and while for his comrades and himself he seeks <lb/>
            a safe return over the spacious sea, bore many hardships, <lb/>
            not to be swamped in Fortune's adverse waves. Of Siren <lb/>
            songs and Circe's cups you know, for if in foolish greediness <note type="footnote"> 1 The full name is said by some to be Lollius Maximus ; others take <lb/>

            he like his friends had drunk of these, he would have been <lb/>
            debased and void of soul under a wanton queen; he would <lb/>
            have lived like filthy dog or sow that loves the mire. We <lb/>
            are mere numbers,1 born to consume the fruits of earth, <lb/>
            suitors of Penelope, worthless courtiers of Alcinous, too much <lb/>
            given o'er to pamper and make sleek the flesh, who thought <lb/>
            good to sleep till noon, and to lull their care to rest by the <lb/>
            lyre's dulcet sounds.</p>
          <p>Robbers rise up while still 'tis night to slay a man: will <lb/>
            you then not bestir yourself to save your life ? Yet if you <lb/>
            will not when you're well, you shall run when dropsy comes: <lb/>
            and unless you ask before the dawn your book and light, <lb/>
            unless you give your mind to noble studies and pursuits, <lb/>
            you will lie awake, tortured by jealousy or love. For why <lb/>
            are you eager to remove those things that hurt your eyes, if <lb/>
            you for a year defer the cure of that which gnaws your <lb/>
            mind ? " Well begun is half ended." Dare to be wise, <lb/>
            begin. He who puts off the time of guiding life aright, <lb/>
            waits like the rustic till the stream runs by; but it still runs, <lb/>
            and as it runs, for ever will run on. We seek for money, <lb/>
            and a wife fruitful in bearing sons, and by the plough we <lb/>
            tame the woodlands wild : let him who has what serves his <lb/>
            turn desire nothing more. Nor house nor policies, nor <lb/>
            heaps of gold and brass, are wont to drive the fever from <lb/>
            the owner's sickly frame, nor from his mind its cares. <lb/>
            The owner must be strong and well if he means with <lb/>
            comfort to enjoy his treasured wealth. The man who's <lb/>
            pressed by greed or dread,2 his house and farm delight no <lb/>
            more than pictures do the purblind, or heated cloths the <note type="footnote"> 1 is Mere numbers " ; that is, Ulysses was the only one worth men­ <lb/>

            transmits to distant years his treaties and his wars ? What's <lb/>
            Titius about, so soon to come before the Roman world? <lb/>
            who has not feared to drink from the Pindaric spring, daring <lb/>
            to spurn the lakes and open streams. How is he ? Has <lb/>
            he a thought for me ? Does he purpose, under guidance of <lb/>
            the Muse, to suit to the Latin lyre the strains of Thebes ? <lb/>
            or does he storm and swell and soar! in tragic style ? And <lb/>

          <p>To overvalue nothing is well-nigh the one and only thing, <lb/>

            men regard, without a tinge of fear, yon sun, the planets, and <lb/>
            the seasons, that with unerring movements pass. What think <lb/>
            you of the gifts of earth, what of those of ocean which make <lb/>
            the far-off Arab and the Indian rich ? What think you of <lb/>
            the shows and games, the plaudits, and the honours by the <lb/>
            friendly Romans given? How must they be regarded­ <lb/>
            with what feelings, think you, in what light? He that <lb/>
            fears the opposite of these,1 values them almost as much <lb/>
            as he who seeks the things themselves: in both2 the <lb/>
            " flutter of excitement" is the thing that pains, so soon as <lb/>
            an unlooked-for sight amazes one or other. Whether he <lb/>
            rejoice or grieve, desire or fear, what matters it, if with eyes <lb/>
            intent he's paralysed in body and in mind, when what he <lb/>
            sees is better than he hoped, or worse ? Let the wise man <lb/>
            bear the name of fool, the just of the unjust, if he seeks even <lb/>
            Virtue's self beyond due bounds.</p>
          <p>Go now, admire old silver plate, old marble statues too, <lb/>
            bronzes and works of art, and gems and Tyrian hues : rejoice <lb/>
            because a thousand eyes gaze on you while you speak; <lb/>
            in the morning to the Forum hie with active step, and late <lb/>
            at evening to your home, lest from his dowry-fields Mutus <lb/>
            should reap more gain and (what's a shame, for he has come <lb/>

            and fresh. Although Agrippa's colonnade has seen your <lb/>
            well-known form, and the via Appia, too, still it remains <lb/>
            for you to go where Numa and where Ancus have already <lb/>
            gone.</p>
          <p>If your side or kidneys suffer from a sharp attack, seek to <lb/>
            escape the malady. You wish to guide your life aright; <lb/>
            who does not ? If Virtue only can this boon bestow, leave <lb/>
            off your fancies, like a man, and give your strength to that.</p>
          <p>You think that Virtue's merely words : a sacred grove <lb/>
            but logs; see then that no one takes the port before you, <lb/>
            lest you lose your trade at Cibyra and in Bithynian marts. <lb/>
            Let a good round thousand talents be obtained, and <lb/>
            then a thousand more, and farther let a third succeed, <lb/>
            and that which squares the heap. Of course Queen Money <lb/>
            gives a man a downed wife, and credit too, and friends, <lb/>
            and lofty birth and handsome form, and Venus and Per­ <lb/>
            suasion join to deck well-moneyed men. The Cappadocian <lb/>
            king, though rich in slaves, is poor in coin ; see that you be <lb/>
            not such. Lucullus, as 'tis said, being asked if for the stage <lb/>
            he could supply a hundred cloaks, replied, " How could I <lb/>
            give so many? but I will look and send as many as I <lb/>
            have." A little afterwards he writes that at home he has <lb/>
            five thousand cloaks-let him take a part or all. That <lb/>
            house is ill supplied, in which there are not many things too <lb/>
            much, which escape the owner's eye and only benefit the <lb/>
            thieves. Therefore, if wealth alone can make and keep a <lb/>
            mortal happy, be first to seek this task, again and then again, <lb/>
            the last to give it over.</p>

            dogged obstinacy2 will give or take away the fasces and the <lb/>
            curule chair from whom he will." Add “Father,” “Brother”; <lb/>
            as is the age of each, so blandly count him of your kin.</p>
          <p>If he who dines well, lives well, let us start at dawn 8 <lb/>
            where palate guides; let us fish and hunt, as did Gargilius of <lb/>

            throng, so that a single mule might in the people's sight <lb/>
            bear back a purchased boar. Dyspeptic and swollen let us <lb/>

          <p>If, as Mimnermus thinks, there's nought enjoyable, <lb/>
            unless with love and mirth, then spend your years in love <lb/>
            and mirth. Long life I wish you, and, farewell. If you know <lb/>
            any rules to beat the precepts I have given, candidly impart <lb/>
            them; if not, use these as I shall do. <note type="footnote"> 1 " Obstacles," literally, weights, i.e. weighty or large things. <lb/>
            There have been many very silly suggestions made by learned men as to <lb/>
            what the Latin word pondera here means. Some say heavy loads of <lb/>
            stone or wood passing in the street: others the weights in the scales in <lb/>
            shops : others, beyond your weight, i.e., so as to lose your balance ! It <lb/>
            evidently means, over some obstacle of size, no matter what. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 "With dogged obstinacy," importunus, a most difficult word for <lb/>
            which to give an English equivalent, wherever it occurs. The primary <lb/>
            meaning seems to be " persistently disagreeable " ; " provoking," as we <lb/>

            difference there is 'tween coins and lupines. To match <lb/>

            a bin of corn, and having freely fed was vainly striving to get <lb/>

            spoke : "If you would escape from there," says she, seek <lb/>
            when you're lank the narrow rent by which when lank <lb/>
            you came." If this is aimed at me, I everything resign; <lb/>

          <p>Philip, a man of energy and purpose firm, and as a <lb/>
            pleader famed, when from his duties he returns one day at two <lb/>
            o'clock, and as his years advance, complains that Carinæ is <lb/>
            from the Courts too far removed, espied, they say, a man <lb/>
            close shaven in a barber's empty stall, who pared his nails, <lb/>
            quite at his ease, with penknife of his own. " Demetrius- <lb/>
            (this slave received his master's orders in no careless way),— <lb/>
            go, ask and bring me word what is his native country, what <lb/>
            his name, and rank of life, who is his father, who his <lb/>
            patron." He goes, returns, and tells that his name's Volteius <lb/>
            Mena, an auctioneer, in income limited, of blameless char­ <lb/>
            acter, known to be active at the proper time, and also to <lb/>
            relax, to acquire means and spend them too, taking pleasure <lb/>
            in his humble friends, and in his home, fond of the Circus, <lb/>
            and of the Campus when his duty's done. "I should like to <lb/>
            ask the man himself all that you say : tell him to come and <lb/>
            dine." Mena could not quite believe it, he wondered <lb/>
            inwardly but did not speak. Why enlarge? "No, thank <lb/>
            you," he replies. "Is he to refuse me?" "The wretch <lb/>
            refuses, and either slights or dreads you." Next morning <lb/>
            Philip comes on Volteius unawares, when selling odds and <lb/>
            ends to the rabble of the blouse-clad plebs, and surprises <lb/>
            him by saying first, "good day." The other offered as <lb/>
            excuse his heavy work and duties of a hired clerk, because <lb/>
            he had not paid his morning call, and because he had not <lb/>
            seen him first. " Consider that I pardon you on condition <lb/>
            that you come to dine with me to-day." " As you please." <pb n="228"/>
             <note type="margin">[EP. VII.</note><lb/>
            "Then come at three o'clock. Now go; with all your zeal <lb/>
            increase your means."</p>
          <p>When he came to dinner, he talked on every subject, wise <lb/>
            and not, and at length goes home to bed. When he was <lb/>
            often seen to hasten down, as fish to hidden hook, a morn­ <lb/>
            ing client and a never-failing guest, he is bidden to attend <lb/>
            his patron to his country seat during the Latin Feriæ. <lb/>
            Once in the carriage set, he ceases not to praise the Sabine <lb/>
            country and the Sabine air. Philip sees and smiles, and <lb/>
            while he seeks respite from care, for mirth from every <lb/>
            source, and while he gives him seven sestertia as a gift, and <lb/>
            offers seven more on loan, he leads him on to buy a farm. <lb/>
            He buys it. Not to weary you overmuch with tedious <lb/>
            details,—from a spruce citizen he turns a rustic, and talks <lb/>
            of nothing else but of his furrows and his groves of vines : <lb/>
            he makes elms ready to receive his plants : he kills himself <lb/>
            with eagerness, and ages fast through love of gain. But <lb/>
            when his sheep are stolen by thieves, his she-goats die of <lb/>
            plague, his crops belie his hopes, his oxen are quite killed <lb/>
            with work, staggered by his loss, when midnight's past, he <lb/>
            quietly takes out his horse and in ill-humour 1 hastens to his <lb/>
            patron's house. And soon as Philip saw him squalid and <lb/>
            untrimmed, he says: "Volteius, you seem to me too hard <lb/>
            a worker, and too intent on gain." " By Pollux, patron, you <lb/>
            would call me I wretched man,' if you wished to give my <lb/>
            proper name. But by your genius and your faith, and by <lb/>
            the household gods, I adjure and beg you to restore me to <lb/>
            my former life."</p>
          <p>He who once has seen how much pursuits left off excel <lb/>
            those keenly sought, let him retrace his steps in time, and <lb/>
            seek again the things he left. 'Tis only right that each <lb/>

            sick at heart; that with my trusty doctors I'm displeased, <lb/>

            from the fatal sloth; because I follow what does harm, and <lb/>
            shun what I might think would do me good; because with <lb/>
            fickle will, at Rome I long for Tibur, and at Tibur long <lb/>
            for Rome.</p>
          <p>Then ask him how he is in health, how with his duty he <lb/>
            gets on and with his own affairs, how stands he with the <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>Bullatius, what did you think of Chios, and of Lesbos <lb/>
            known to fame? What of Samos "trim and trig"? What <lb/>
            of Sardis, Croesus' royal town? What of Smyrna and of <lb/>
            Colophon? Are they over or below1 their great repute? <lb/>
            Are they all inferior in your eyes to the Campus and to <lb/>
            Tiber's stream ? Does one of the towns of Attalus better <lb/>
            suit your taste, or do you Lebedus commend, through dis­ <lb/>
            like of travelling by sea and land ?</p>
          <p>BULLATIUS.—You know what sort of place is Lebedus,— <lb/>
            a village more lone than Gabii or Fidenæ: still, there I'd <lb/>
            gladly spend my days, forgetting friends, of friends forgot, <lb/>
            to view from shore old Neptune raging in storm far out to <lb/>
            sea.</p>
          <p>HOR.—But neither will he who goes from Capua to <lb/>
            Rome, though drenched, and splashed with mud, care in <lb/>
            a tavern to live, nor does the man when chilled to the heart, <lb/>
            commend the bakehouse and the bath as affording to the <lb/>
            full a life of bliss. So, neither if strong Austers' blast has <lb/>
            tossed you on the deep, would you on that account sell off <lb/>
            your ship beyond Ægean seas.</p>
          <p>To one who's free from ills, Rhodes and Mitylene fair <lb/>
            serve as a greatcoat in the summer's height, as running <lb/>
            drawers in the frosty winds, as a Tiber-bath in winter time, <lb/>
            a fire in August heats. Whilst you can, and whilst Fortune <lb/>
            wears a pleasant face, at Rome let Samos, Rhodes, and <lb/>
            Chios have your praise, when far away. <note type="footnote"> 1 " Over or below," literally, " greater or less" than. I have used <lb/>

            grateful hand, and don't for a year defer the sweets of <lb/>
            life, so that wherever you be, you still can say you've <lb/>
            passed a pleasant time, for if reflection and good sense remove <lb/>

          <p>Iccius, if you use aright Agrippa's revenues which you <lb/>
            collect in Sicily, it is not possible that a greater plenty <lb/>
            can be given you by Jove himself. Away with your frets, <lb/>
            for he's not poor who has the full use of property.1 If <lb/>
            you are well in stomach, chest, and feet, princely wealth <lb/>
            can give you nothing more. If perchance in midst of <lb/>

            nettles,2 so will you live right on, though Fortune's stream <lb/>

            riches cannot our nature change, or that you think all <lb/>
            else inferior to virtue. We wonder that his cattle browse <lb/>
            on fields of Democritus and on his crops, while his mind, <lb/>
            swift in its thoughts, is far abroad without the body, though <lb/>
            you, amidst the itch and taint of gain, have tastes for <lb/>
            nothing small, and still engage in lofty thoughts;—what <lb/>
            causes ocean's flow, what regulates the year, whether the <lb/>
            stars stray from their path and roam at will or under law, <lb/>
            what hides the moon in darkness, what brings her orb to <lb/>
            view again, what is the purpose, what the effect, of the <lb/>
            harmonious discord of the world; whether Empedocles is <lb/>
            wrong, or Stertinius of subtle mind.</p>

            in good health and in a cheery mood, and, in a word, if <lb/>

            too far and gain for my books ill-will, and in excessive <lb/>
            zeal prove by far too keen a "help." If perchance the <lb/>

            name of Asina into a joke, and be the public talk. Hold <lb/>

            myself again, which you despise though it supports five <lb/>
            yeomen and their homes, and sends to Varia five good and <lb/>
            trusty councillors, let us try whether I from my mind, or you <lb/>
            from the land, shall sooner1 pluck the prickly weeds; and <lb/>
            whether Horace or his fields be found in better trim. <lb/>
            Although my love and deep concern for Lamia, wailing his <lb/>
            brother, keeps me here-for Lamia who grieves for a <lb/>
            brother's sudden death, and will not be consoled-yet <lb/>
            every feeling of my mind leads me strongly to that spot, and <lb/>
            longs to burst the obstacles that bar the open way. I call <lb/>
            him happy who in the country lives, you him who dwells in <lb/>
            town. He who seeks another's lot of course dislikes his <lb/>
            own. Both in their folly wrongly blame the place, though <lb/>
            free of blame: the fault is in the mind which never from <lb/>
            itself can fly. You when a common drudge begged for the <lb/>
            fields in silent prayer-now when a steward you prefer the <lb/>
            town, the games, the baths. You know that I'm con­ <lb/>
            sistent, and that I go with heavy heart when any hated <lb/>
            business drags me off to Rome. Our tastes are not the same, <lb/>

            sider desert and inhospitable wilds, he who agrees with me <lb/>
            deems charming haunts, and hates what you think fine. <lb/>
            The stews and greasy cook-shops give you a taste for town, <lb/>

            feed him with the leaves you've newly stript. Should rain <lb/>

            used to drink of clear Falernian from early afternoon, a <lb/>
            simple meal now satisfies, and sleep on my streamlet's grassy <lb/>
            bank. I'm not ashamed I've had my sports, but that I do <lb/>
            not bring them to an end. There no one mars my comforts <lb/>
            with an evil eye, and no one poisons with hidden venom or <lb/>
            malicious bite. My neighbours smile to see me as I turn <lb/>
            the soil and move the stones. You prefer to eat your city <lb/>
            rations with the slaves: in your wish you haste to join <lb/>
            them: the cunning city drudge envies you the use of <lb/>
            gardens, logs, and flocks. The ox for trappings longs, the <lb/>

          <p>Dear Quintius, best of friends, in case you ask about my <lb/>

            makes him rich by fruit of olive groves, by orchards or by <lb/>
            meadow lands, or by the elms all clad with vines, I shall <lb/>
            describe in full detail its character and form, and how it <lb/>
            lies. There's an unbroken range of hills all round save <lb/>
            where 'tis parted by a wooded 1 vale, but so disposed that in <lb/>
            early day the sun lights up its right hand slope, and as he <lb/>
            downward goes in rapid car he warms the left. The mild­ <lb/>
            ness of the climate you would praise. What should you <lb/>
            think if brambles bear abundantly the ruddy cornel and the <lb/>
            prune ?2 If the oak and holm delight the owner and his <lb/>
            flock with. fruit in plenty and with shade? You would say <lb/>
            that Tarentum with its leafy bloom was close at hand? <lb/>
            There is a fountain there, quite large enough to give the <lb/>
            river name, and such it is that Hebrus does not wind through <lb/>
            Thrace with colder or with clearer stream. It goes on its <lb/>

            these: " May Jupiter, who seeks the city's good and yours <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>Scæva, though you are able for yourself to judge, and <lb/>
            though you know how it is best to treat the great, hear the <lb/>
            opinion of your humble friend, himself still needing to be <lb/>
            taught, as if a man that's blind should volunteer to show the <lb/>
            way: see if even I can tell you aught which you may care <lb/>
            to turn to use.</p>
          <p>Should you delight in peaceful rest and sleep till dawn <lb/>
            of day, if dust and rumbling wheels disturb you, and the <lb/>
            tavern with incessant din, I will bid you go your way to <lb/>
            Ferentinum. For pleasures fall not to the rich alone, nor <lb/>
            has he spent his life amiss, whose birth and death no notice <lb/>
            Claimed. If you should wish to serve your own, and treat <lb/>
            yourself to better fare, since you are poor, go join a wealthy <lb/>
            man.1 " If Aristippus could well on cabbage dine, he would <lb/>
            not cultivate his kings and queens." " If he who censures me <lb/>
            knew how to cultivate his kings and queens, he would despise <lb/>
            his cabbage." 2 Tell me of which of these do you approve <lb/>
            the words and acts, or as you're younger, hear why the <lb/>
            notion of Aristippus is better; for thus he parried, as they <lb/>
            say, the snarling Cynic : "I play the fool to please myself, <lb/>
            but you to please the people : this way of mine is better far <lb/>
            and more respectable. I pay my court that I may ride a <lb/>
            horse and live with kings; you beg for worthless scraps, hum­ <lb/>
            bling yourself to him who gives them, although you boast that <note type="footnote"> 1 “Wealthy man," unctum, one who eats rich food. Some take <lb/>

            you're in need of nothing.1 Every complexion of life, every <lb/>
            rank, and every grade of means, became Aristippus, who <lb/>
            aimed at greater things, though usually content with what he <lb/>
            had. On the other hand I shall be astonished if a change in <lb/>
            mode of life will suit for him whom endurance clothes with <lb/>
            doubled rag. The one won't stay to get his purple cloak, but <lb/>
            clothed in anything, will walk through most frequented <lb/>
            parts, and will support both characters 2 not awkwardly : the <lb/>
            other will avoid a cloak of Miletus make, as worse than <lb/>
            dog or snake; he'll die of cold if you won't give back his <lb/>
            rag: give it back, and let him live his silly life.</p>
          <p>To finish war's exploits, and show to citizens their cap­ <lb/>
            tured foes, comes near the throne of Jove, and aims at <lb/>
            heavenly fame : to have pleased the foremost men is not <lb/>
            the least of merit. It falls not to the lot of all to go to <lb/>
            Corinth. The man sits still who fears he shan't succeed. <lb/>
            Well! has he who reached the goal acted with manly <lb/>
            pluck ? And yet in this if anywhere else we find the very <lb/>
            thing we seek.3 One dreads a burden, as too great for little <lb/>
            soul and little frame; another takes it up and bears it to the <lb/>
            end. Either virtue is an empty name, or the man of enter­ <lb/>
            prise is right in seeking honour and reward.</p>
          <p>He who ne'er speaks of poverty when his patron is at hand, <lb/>
            is sure to bear off more than he who bluntly asks : it differs <lb/>
            much whether you modestly accept, or snatch with greedy <note type="footnote"> 1 " In need of nothing," or taking nullius gen. masc., " needing no <lb/>

            poor man. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 " The very thing we seek." What is the very thing we seek? <lb/>
            The most sensible answer seems to be that qui refers to the question, qui <lb/>
            pervenit fecitne viriliter. There are two characters contrasted, the man <lb/>
            of action, and his opposite, as in Epp. 1. I, 24, 25, 26 ; and in energy <lb/>
            and action Horace finds the secret of success. </note> <pb n="248"/>

            hand. And yet this was the fountain-head and source of <lb/>
            the whole matter.1 " I have a sister who has got no dower, <lb/>
            a mother, a poor wretched thing, a farm that will not sell, <lb/>
            and can't support us;" the man who says so, cries aloud, <lb/>
            " Give me food." Another one whines in, " and me too." <lb/>
            The cake will be divided for a dole to each. But if the <lb/>
            crow could eat its prize in peace, it would have more of <lb/>
            feast, much less of brawl and grudge.</p>
          <p>He who, when taken to Brundusium as a guest, or to <lb/>
            Surrentum, with its charming scenes, complains of ruts, the <lb/>
            bitter cold and showers, or wails his broken trunk and <lb/>
            pilfered goods, repeats the harlot's common tricks, who oft <lb/>
            laments a chain or anklet stolen, so that ere long no faith is <lb/>
            placed in real losses and regrets. Nor will a man, once <lb/>
            cheated, care to lift a vagrant in the streets, with fractured <lb/>
            leg, though many a tear should flow, though he invoke <lb/>
            Osiris' holy name, and say, " Believe me, I do not mock ; <lb/>
            unfeeling men, help a poor cripple up." " Seek one who <lb/>
            does not know your tricks," the neighbours harshly cry. <note type="footnote"> 1 " Whole matter ”—rerum—Wickham explains, " the very essence <lb/>

          <p>My Lollius, frankest of men, if I have read you right, <lb/>
            you'd scorn, in friendship's guise, to play the part of sneaking <lb/>
            parasite. Just as an honest matron will from a harlot differ <lb/>
            far in character and hue, so will a friend from faithless parasite <lb/>
            be distant as the poles. To the latter vice there is an oppo­ <lb/>
            site and perhaps a greater one-a clownish roughness, both <lb/>
            inelegant and gross, which courts regard by stubbly skin and <lb/>
            blackened teeth, anxious the while to be esteemed mere <lb/>
            un-restraint, and virtue, properly so called. Virtue is the <lb/>
            mean of vices, apart from both extremes. One, obsequious <lb/>
            to a fault, a jester of the lowest couch, so dreads the lord­ <lb/>
            ling's nod, so iterates his talk, and as they drop, catches his <lb/>
            words, that you would think a schoolboy conned the task by <lb/>
            some harsh master read, or that an actor played the second <lb/>
            part. The other often wrangles about the wool of goats, <lb/>
            and fights for trifles, armed to the teeth : " To think," he says, <lb/>
            " that my authority should not be deemed the best, and that <lb/>
            I should not state with open mouth 1 what I sincerely think ! <lb/>
            a second life is dear at such a price." For what's in dispute ? <lb/>
            Whether Castor or Dolichos has greater skill: for Brundusium <lb/>
            is it well to take the Appian or Minucian road.</p>
          <p>Whom love at ruin's cost, whom dice with headlong speed <lb/>
            strips of his means, whom vanity both clothes and per­ <lb/>
            fumes past his power to pay, whom hunger and thirst <lb/>
            for wealth enthral, whom shame and dread of poverty <lb/>
            engross, a rich friend, ten times more versed in vice, oft <lb/>
            hates and dreads; or if he does not hate, schools him, and <lb/>
            like a kindly mother, wishes him to be wiser and more <note type="footnote"> 1 " With open mouth," elatrem, literally " bark, or howl forth." </note> <pb n="250"/>

            virtuous than himself, and says, what's pretty true : 11 Don't <lb/>
            vie with me, my wealth allows my folly; your means are <lb/>
            very small, a narrow toga suits a prudent friend;1 cease <lb/>
            to contend with me." To any one he wished to harm, <lb/>
            Eutrapelus was wont to give a suit of costly clothes : " For <lb/>
            now," said he, "in pride of heart, with handsome robes he'll <lb/>
            conceive new notions and new hopes, will sleep till dawn2 <lb/>
            of day, for a mistress will defer his rightful work, will bor­ <lb/>
            row money,3 and at last turn Thracian,4 or drive a gardener's <lb/>
            cart for hire."</p>
          <p>Into a patron's secrets you will never pry, and keep with <lb/>
            special care one trusted to your faith, aye even when racked <lb/>
            by wine and wrath; nor will you praise your own pursuits or <lb/>
            blame another's; nor when he shall wish to hunt, will you <lb/>

            Amphion, as is thought, yielded to his brother's mood; so <lb/>
            likewise you, yield to your patron's mild demands, and when <lb/>
            to the fields he leads his dogs, and horses laden with <lb/>
            Ætolian nets, get up at once, and lay aside the moroseness <lb/>

            now is taking down the eagles from the Parthian shrines, <lb/>
            and is adjudging to Italian arms whatever parts of earth <lb/>
            are unsubdued. And-lest you draw back, and from the <lb/>
            hunt abstain without excuse-though you are careful to do <lb/>
            nothing out of tune and time,”2 sometimes you do amuse <lb/>
            yourself at your father's country-seat; the crews divide the <lb/>
            boats; the Actian fight's rehearsed in hostile fashion by <lb/>
            your slaves, with you as leader;—your brother is your foe, <lb/>
            the pond is Hadria,—till Victory crowns one or other <lb/>

          <p>To warn you further, if indeed you need a monitor, <lb/>
            often ponder what you say, concerning each, and to whom <lb/>
            you say it. Avoid the prying man, for he's a gossip too, <lb/>

            cease to defend him when you're once deceived, so that you I <lb/>
            may watch and guard one fully known and trusting to your <lb/>
            help, for if by slanders tongue he's bitterly assailed, don't <lb/>
            you see that in a little time the risk will reach yourself? <lb/>
            For your property's at stake when the nearest wall's ablaze; <lb/>
            and fires neglected are wont to gain new strength.</p>
          <p>To pay attention to the great is sweet to those un­ <lb/>
            tried : he who has tried it shrinks. When your ship is <lb/>
            out at sea, attend to this, that a change of wind bear you <lb/>
            not back again. The gloomy hate the cheerful, and the <lb/>
            mirthful the morose; the lively the sedate; the sluggish do <lb/>
            not like the active and the brisk: those who drink deep <lb/>
            of good Falernian about the midnight hour, dislike him <lb/>
            who declines the proffered cups, although you swear you <lb/>
            greatly fear the fevers1 of the night. From your brow <lb/>
            remove the cloud : very often the retiring man assumes the <lb/>
            look of the reserved and sly, the silent of the sour.</p>
          <p>Throughout all this you'll take good care to read and <lb/>
            ask of learned men by what means you can spend your life <lb/>
            in calm and quiet bliss; whether desire, always in want, <lb/>
            excite and worry you, or fear and hope of outward things, <lb/>
            but moderately good :2 whether learning brings us virtue, or <lb/>
            nature gives it free; what lessens cares, what restores your <lb/>
            inward calm 3 what gives you perfect peace-honours or dar­ <lb/>
            ling gains, or the retired road and path of an unnoticed life.</p>
          <p>As oft as cold Digentia's stream recruits me, which <lb/>

          <p>Mæcenas, learned friend, if in old Cratinus you put trust, <lb/>
            no poems water-drinkers write can please or live for long. <lb/>
            Ever since Bacchus ranged the half cracked poets midst his <lb/>
            Satyrs and his Fauns, the darling Muses have almost daily <lb/>
            smelt of wine from early morn. By his praise of drink 'tis <lb/>
            proved that Homer loved his wine. Sire Ennius himself <lb/>
            ne'er bounded forth to sing of arms till stirred by wine. " To <lb/>
            Abstainers I commit the Forum and the Puteal of Libo; the <lb/>
            strictly sober I forbid to sing." Soon as this edict I gave <lb/>
            forth, the poets did not cease to vie in cups by night, to smell <lb/>
            of wine by day.</p>
          <p>What if one with fierce and scowling look, with feet all <lb/>
            bare, with gown of scanty cut, should Cato ape, would he <lb/>
            embody then the character and worth of Cato ? Iarbitas <lb/>
            burst, while in wit and fire of eloquence he strove to <lb/>
            match Timagenes, with all his gifts. A model, easy to <lb/>
            imitate in faults, leads men astray; why, if I showed pale <lb/>
            by accident, they'd drink the blanching cumin. 0 imitators, <lb/>
            servile herd, how often have your noisy efforts stirred my <lb/>
            wrath, how oft my mirth.</p>
          <p>I was the first to plant untrammelled footsteps on a virgin <lb/>
            soil; with foot of mine I never trod another's ground. He <lb/>
            who in himself confides will lead and rule the swarm. I was <lb/>
            the first to show to Latium the Parian Iambics, following <lb/>
            Archilochus in numbers and in tone, not in the subject and <lb/>
            the words which drove Lycambes mad. And lest perhaps <lb/>
            you should on this account bedeck me with a meaner wreath, <lb/>
            because I did not care to change the measure and poetic <pb n="255"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="1-49.]"/><lb/>
            form, Sappho, for poets quite a match, qualifies1 her verse <lb/>
            by the metres of Archilochus; Alcæus does the same, <lb/>
            though quite unlike in subjects and in form,2 but he <lb/>
            seeks not a father-in-law, whom to befoul with verses full <lb/>
            of spite, nor will he twist, by his lampoons, a halter for <lb/>
            his bride. Alcæus, not sung before by other lips, I, a <lb/>
            Latin lyrist, have made well-known; 'tis a pride to me that <lb/>
            bringing forward things before untold, I'm read by free­ <lb/>
            men's eyes and thumbed by freemen's hands.</p>
          <p>You would wish to know perhaps why the thankless <lb/>
            reader praises and likes my humble works at home, but when <lb/>
            abroad unfairly runs them down. Votes of the fickle mob I <lb/>
            do not hunt for, at cost of feasts and gifts of cast off clothes; <lb/>
            I, who listen to our noble authors and pay them back in kind,3 <lb/>
            do not demean myself by canvassing the platforms of the <lb/>
            pædagogic tribes: hence these tears.4 If I have said, "I <lb/>
            am ashamed to read aloud things not deserving of a crowded <lb/>
            hall, and to add weight to trifles"; "you jest," one says, <lb/>
            "and keep those gems of yours only for Augustus' 5 ears, for, <lb/>
            in your own eyes spotless, you feel assured that you alone <lb/>
            the poet's honey can distil." Chafing at this I fear to sneer <lb/>
            at them, and, lest I be torn by the sharp nail of my <lb/>
            opponent, I call aloud, I do not like the ground,6 and I de­ <lb/>
            mand an interval. For contests in sport are wont to breed <lb/>

          <p>You seem, my book, to give a wistful glance to Janus and <lb/>
            Vertumnus, that smoothed by pumice of the Sosii,l you may <lb/>
            stand forth, forsooth, to public gaze. You don't like locks <lb/>
            and seals, which modest books desire; you grieve that you <lb/>
            are shown to few, and you prefer a social life, not so brought <lb/>
            up. Off then to the place to which you long to go. Once <lb/>
            gone forth you can't come back again. "What have I done, <lb/>

            you will be a favourite at Rome until your bloom departs: <lb/>
            when thumbed by vulgar hands you shall begin to have a <lb/>

            not a soul to read you,2 or you'll run away to Utica, or to <lb/>

            have his laugh, like him who, in a rage, pushed down the <lb/>

            our leaders and the men of Greece, by no means values other <lb/>
            things on a like principle and plan, for they despise and hate <lb/>
            all else save what they see removed from earth and done with <lb/>
            time: while they so much admire the ancient poets as to <lb/>
            insist that on the Alban Mount the Tables which all crimes <lb/>
            forbid, by the Decemvirs framed, the leagues of kings <lb/>
            arranged with Gabii, or with the Sabines brave and stern, <lb/>
            the Pontiffs books, and the seers' ancient rolls, fell from <lb/>
            the Muses' lips.</p>
          <p>If, because the oldest writings of the Greeks are also best, <lb/>
            the Roman writers in like scales be weighed, there is <lb/>
            no reason to say much: there is nothing hard inside the <lb/>
            olive, nothing hard outside the nut. We have reached the <lb/>
            pinnacle of Fortune: we paint, we sing, we wrestle more <lb/>
            skilfully than the oil-smeared Greeks. If time makes poems <lb/>
            better, as it does our wines, I should like to know how <lb/>
            many years would on our writings stamp a price. Is the <lb/>
            writer who died a century ago to be ranked among the <lb/>
            perfect and the old, or with the worthless and the new? <lb/>
            Let some limit bar disputes.</p>
          <p>He is old and classic who has lived a hundred years.</p>
          <p>With which must he be reckoned who has died less by a <lb/>
            month or year? among the ancient poets or with those <lb/>
            whom both a present and a future age may spurn ?</p>
          <p>Such a one indeed may fairly rank among the ancients <lb/>
            who is younger by a brief month or an entire year.</p>
          <p>Your concession I accept, and as the hairs of a horse's <lb/>
            tail,' I pluck and remove first one and then another, until <lb/>
            baffled he falls like tumbling heap who has recourse to <lb/>
            annals, and judges virtue by years, and admires nothing but <lb/>
            that which Libitina hallows. <note type="footnote"> 1 “Horse's tail." This is the figure called "Sorites." Take away <lb/>

          <p>Ennius, both wise and vigorous, a second Homer too, as <lb/>
            critics say, seems to care little to what his promises and his <lb/>
            Pythagorean dreams may come. Is not Nævius now read <lb/>
            and does he not cling to our memory, as almost fresh ? So <lb/>
            sacred is every poem of the olden days. When the ques­ <lb/>
            tion's raised which of the two is better, Pacuvius gains the <lb/>
            fame of "learned sage," Accius of "lofty and sublime." <lb/>
            'Tis said that Afranius' mantle fitted Menander quite, that <lb/>
            Plautus hurries on after the manner of Sicilian Epicharmus, <lb/>
            that Csecilius excels in dignity, Terence in skilful plot. <lb/>
            These mighty Rome learns off by heart, and these she views, <lb/>
            cramped up in close-packed theatres : these she esteems and <lb/>
            reckons poets, from the age of Livius down to these days of <lb/>
            ours.</p>
          <p>Sometimes the public see what's right, again, they go <lb/>
            astray. If they so admire and praise the ancient poets, as <lb/>
            nought to prefer to them, nought to compare, they're wrong: <lb/>
            if they think that sometimes they're too archaic, many <lb/>
            times, too harsh, and confess they're often very dull, they're <lb/>
            wise and side with me, and judge with Jove's assent. For <lb/>
            my part I don't rail at them, and think the works of Livius <lb/>
            should be destroyed, which I remember that Orbilius, of <lb/>
            flogging fame, read out to me, a little boy; but I wonder <lb/>
            that they're faultless deemed and beautiful and very nearly <lb/>
            perfect: in which if perchance an elegant expression has <lb/>
            cropped up, and if a verse or two are rather neatly <lb/>
            turned, that merit brings the poem to the front1 and <lb/>
            guarantees its sale.</p>
          <p>It is a shame that anything be censured, not because it's <lb/>
            coarsely or inelegantly composed, but because 'twas lately <lb/>
            done: and that it's not indulgence, but honour and re­ <lb/>
            wards, that for the ancients should be asked. If I should <note type="footnote"> 1 " Brings to the front." See an annotated edition. </note> <pb n="261"/>

            doubt whether a play of Atta's rightly treads the stage 1 or <lb/>
            not, almost all the senators would exclaim that shame has left <lb/>
            the earth, since I attempt to blame what dignified Æsopus, <lb/>
            what well-trained Roscius, played : either because they think <lb/>
            there's nothing right except what pleases them, or that they <lb/>
            deem it a disgrace to yield to juniors, and to confess when <lb/>
            old that what they learned when young should now be <lb/>
            blotted out. Now, he who praises Numa's Salian hymn, <lb/>
            and wishes to seem alone to know, what he as little knows <lb/>
            as I, does not favour or commend departed genius, but <lb/>
            attacks our writings and in his spite hates us and ours. But <lb/>
            if newness had been as hateful to the Greeks as it is to us, <lb/>
            what ancient work would now exist, or what would the <lb/>
            public have which it could read and thumb, each for <lb/>
            himself?</p>
          <p>As soon as Greece, her wars given o'er, began to turn to <lb/>
            life's less serious things, and in prosperity to vice incline, <lb/>
            she now was fired with zeal for athletes, now for horses; she <lb/>
            fancied works in marble, ivory, or brass, she riveted her face <lb/>
            and mind on pictures, and took delight, now in flutists, now <lb/>
            in actors: what she eagerly sought she very soon gave up, <lb/>
            quite sated, even playing with her toys, just as a little girl, <lb/>
            still with her nurse, would do.</p>
          <p>What is there pleasing or disliked which you would not <lb/>
            think worthy to be changed ? " Piping times of peace " had <lb/>
            this result, and favouring gales of Fortune. For long at <lb/>
            Rome it was a pleasure, and a usual thing, to be early up, with <lb/>
            open door, to expound the law to clients, to lend out money <lb/>
            well secured on creditable names, to learn from seniors, and <lb/>

            and are in a fever with the one desire of writing: boys and <lb/>
            rigid fathers, their hair with bay leaves wreathed, dictate their <lb/>
            poems whilst they dine. I myself, who stoutly allege that I <lb/>
            no verses write, am found to be more false than a Parthian, <lb/>
            and wide awake before the sun is up, I call for my pen and <lb/>
            paper and my desk. He fears to steer a ship who knows <lb/>
            not how: none but one who has been trained dares give <lb/>
            a patient herbs: 1 doctors profess what doctors' duties are: <lb/>
            workmen handle workmen's tools: learned or unlearned we <lb/>
            all write poems everywhere.</p>
          <p>But yet what great and worthy points this craze and this <lb/>
            mild madness has, infer as follows :-A poet's mind is rarely <lb/>
            tinged with greed: verses he loves; this one thing only he <lb/>
            pursues: losses, flight of slaves, and fires he laughs at: he <lb/>
            never plans to cheat a partner or a youthful ward; he lives on <lb/>
            potherbs and brown bread; though as a soldier he is slack and <lb/>
            cuts a sorry figure, he's useful to the state, if this you grant, <lb/>
            that even by small things are the great ones helped. The <lb/>
            poet forms the tender and the lisping mouth of youth, he <lb/>
            turns its ear even now from words and language coarse, and <lb/>
            afterwards he moulds the mind by useful rules for life; he <lb/>
            checks all rudeness, jealousy, and tides of passion: he tells <lb/>
            of noble deeds, and as generations rise, he teaches them by <lb/>
            famed examples of the great and good, the poor man he <lb/>
            consoles, and cheers the sick at heart. From whom would <lb/>
            the unwedded maid and pious boy learn prayerful hymns, <lb/>
            had not the Muse a poet sent ? The chorus begs for help, <lb/>
            and feels the sacred influence nigh, it asks the rains of <lb/>
            heaven, and wins the favour by the prayer it learned, it <lb/>
            averts disease and dreaded perils drives away, it earns us <lb/>
            peaceful times and seasons rich in crops. By hymns the <lb/>
            gods above are soothed, by hymns the gods below. <note type="footnote"> 1 " Herbs," literally "southern wood." </note> <pb n="263"/>

          <p>The husbandmen of ancient days, sturdy in frame, and <lb/>
            pleased with humble fare, recruiting their bodies in festive <lb/>
            time, after their corn was stored, and their minds as well <lb/>
            which hardships bore in hope of rest, with the sharers of their <lb/>
            toil, their sons and faithful wife, appeased the goddess Earth <lb/>
            with swine, Silvanus, god of woods, with milk, with flowers <lb/>
            and wine their Genius which ne'er forgets that life is short. <lb/>
            This custom brought about Fescennia's licence, which poured <lb/>
            its rustic taunts in dialogue, and the liberty, still welcomed <lb/>
            as each year came round, indulged in friendly sport, until the <lb/>
            jest, now cutting, began to turn to undisguised abuse, and <lb/>
            without restraint passed on through families of good repute, <lb/>
            with threatening mien. They suffered who were assailed <lb/>
            with blood-stained tooth: even the unassailed felt anxious for <lb/>
            the public weal; nay more, a law was passed with penalties <lb/>
            attached, which forbade that any man be branded by abusive <lb/>
            verse: they changed their tone, by the bludgeon forced to <lb/>
            use more civil speech, and even to give delight.</p>
          <p>Captive Greece captured her rugged conqueror in turn, <lb/>
            and to unpolished Latium gave her arts, and then that <lb/>
            rough Saturnian verse soon ceased to flow, and grace and <lb/>
            elegance banished offensive gall; but yet for many a day <lb/>
            traces of its rustic birth remained, and even now remain. <lb/>
            For the Roman was late in turning his native wit to writings <lb/>
            of the Greeks, and now at peace, when Punic wars were done, <lb/>
            began to search what useful matter Sophocles, and AEschylus, <lb/>
            and Thespis could present. This too he also tried, if he <lb/>
            could worthily translate their works, and with his trial he <lb/>
            was pleased, being uplifted and eager to succeed, for he <lb/>
            fairly shows the tragic breath, and is happy in his ventures, <lb/>
            but in his ignorance he deems erasure a disgrace, and fears <lb/>
            to change.</p>

            there's less indulgence shown, the greater is the labour. <lb/>
            See how Plautus supports the part of love-sick youth, of <lb/>
            stingy father, of deceitful pimp; how great1 Dossenus is <lb/>
            in greedy parasites, in what a slipshod style he bustles <lb/>
            o'er the stage: for his great delight is to drop a coin into <lb/>
            his chest, regardless after that whether the play succeed or <lb/>
            fail.</p>
          <p>Him, whom glory in her airy car has borne on the <lb/>
            stage, the listless hearer deadens, the attentive cheers, so <lb/>
            slight, so small a thing is that which can cast down or raise <lb/>
            again the man who covets praise. Farewell the stage if by <lb/>
            refusal of the palm I'm rendered lean, and if the gift of <lb/>
            it sends me to my home both plump and full. Often <lb/>
            too this frightens and drives off the daring poet, that <lb/>
            the majority, inferior in honour and in worth, unlearned <lb/>
            and senseless and ready to show fight if a knight should <lb/>
            disagree, call for a bear or boxers in the middle of the <lb/>
            play; for in such shows the lowest plebs delight. But now <lb/>
            the pleasure even of the knight has passed from ear to eyes <lb/>
            that never rest, and unsubstantial joys. For four long <lb/>
            hours or more the curtain is kept down, while troops of <lb/>
            horse and bands of foot pass quickly by: then after that <lb/>
            ill-fated kings, maybe, are dragged along with hands behind <lb/>
            them tied, all kinds of waggons, aye, even ships are hurried <lb/>
            past, and captive ivory with all the spoils of captive Corinth. <lb/>
            Democritus, were he on earth, would have a hearty laugh, <lb/>
            should a camel and a leopard joined in one, or a white <lb/>
            elephant attract the notice of the crowd; he would gaze at <lb/>
            the people with more amazement than at the show itself, as <note type="footnote"> 1 "How great"—this is ironical. There is another view of the <lb/>
            passage making Dossenus a character in a play. In that case Plautus <lb/>
            would be spoken of throughout. </note> <pb n="265"/>

            affording him more sights by far;1 he would think that <lb/>
            writers tell their tales to some deaf ass. For what powers <lb/>
            of voice can drown the sounds our theatres give forth? <lb/>
            You'd think it was the roar of all Garganus' woods or of the <lb/>
            Tuscan sea, with so much din are shows and works of art <lb/>
            beheld, and foreign wealth, bedecked with which the actor, <lb/>
            when on the stage he stands, is cheered and clapped again <lb/>
            and yet again. Did he say anything as yet? No, not a <lb/>
            word. What then affords the pleasing sight ? The woollen <lb/>
            robe that by Tarentine dye rivals the purple hue.</p>
          <p>But lest you think that I praise grudgingly what I myself <lb/>
            decline to do, while others treat it with success, the poet, <lb/>
            I assure you, seems to me quite fit to walk the tightened <lb/>
            rope, who racks my heart by mere illusion, who rouses or <lb/>
            soothes my passions, and fills me with unreal fears, like a <lb/>
            magician, and one time places me at Thebes, and then again <lb/>
            at Athens.</p>
          <p>But come and give brief heed to those who rather on the <lb/>
            reader lean than bear the haughty hearer's whims, if you <lb/>
            wish to fill with books your gift so worthy of Apollo's name <lb/>
            and to the poets add a spur, that with a greater zeal <lb/>
            they may seek Helicon and all its bloom. We poets, <lb/>
            doubtless, to ourselves do harm (to cut my own vineyard 2 <lb/>
            down) by offering you a book when weary and worried, <lb/>
            when we feel hurt if any friend has dared a single verse to <lb/>
            censure; when unasked we return to passages already read : <lb/>
            when we complain that our labours are not at once per­ <lb/>
            ceived, and with how fine a thread we've spun our poems ; <lb/>
            when we hope that matters will come round to this, that as <note type="footnote"> 1 " By far," nimio. There is another reading mimo, "than the <lb/>

            soon as you have heard that we are making poems, you <lb/>
            will with obliging readiness call us, unasked, force us to <lb/>
            write, and bid us not to want.</p>
          <p>But yet it's well1 to know what kind of guardians your <lb/>
            worth possesses, well proved in peace and war,—worth that <lb/>
            should not be entrusted to bards unfit. That noted <lb/>
            Choerilus was pleasing to Alexander, called The Great," <lb/>
            and owed to his rude and ill-made verse the Philips2 he <lb/>
            received, a royal coin. But just as ink, when touched, <lb/>
            leaves blots and stains, so writers very often smear most <lb/>
            brilliant deeds by wretched verse. That self-same king who <lb/>
            bought so dear with lavish purse a poem so absurd, forbade <lb/>
            by edict that any save Apelles should his portrait paint, or <lb/>
            any but Lysippus mould the brass which represents the <lb/>
            features of the valiant prince. But if to books and to the <lb/>
            Muses' gifts you called that taste, so fine in works of art, <lb/>
            you'd swear that 'midst Boeotia's heavy fogs 'twas born and <lb/>
            bred.</p>
          <p>But neither do Varius and Virgil, your poets well beloved, <lb/>
            disgrace your estimate of them, nor yet the gifts which they <lb/>
            received-to the giver's credit, all confess; nor do busts in <lb/>
            bronze more faithfully present the features of our famous <lb/>
            men, than does the poet's work display their character and <lb/>
            gifts of mind. Nor should I rather write poetic prose that <lb/>
            crawls along the ground, than in verse record war's great <lb/>
            exploits, and sing of scenes and streams of foreign lands, <lb/>
            and castles built on mountain heights, and savage realms, <lb/>
            and wars, under your guidance brought to a happy end o'er <lb/>
            all the world, and of the bars that prison Janus, guardian <lb/>

            lay, nor does my modesty essay a task my powers should <lb/>
            fail to bear. Officious zeal unwisely plies him whom it <lb/>
            loves, the more so when it shows itself in numbers and their <lb/>
            art; for one more quickly learns and more readily recalls <lb/>
            what men may laugh at, than what invites approval and <lb/>
            respect. I care not for attentions which annoy me, and I <lb/>
            neither wish to be exposed for sale in wax, with features <lb/>
            worse than mine, nor to be praised in verses, poor and ill­ <lb/>

            given me, and, stretched beside my author in a box, be <lb/>

          <p>Florus, trusty friend to good and noble Nero, if any one <lb/>
            perchance should wish to sell to you a slave at Tibur born <lb/>
            or Gabii, and should treat with you like this: "He is fair <lb/>
            complexioned, well made from head to foot; he will be yours <lb/>
            to 'have and hold' for eighty pounds; a home-born lad, <lb/>
            ready for duty at his master's nod, with a smattering of <lb/>
            Greek, and fitted for whatever you please ; you'll shape him <lb/>
            into anything, like clay, when moist; besides he'll sing, <lb/>
            untrained a bit, but nice enough when one's at wine; many <lb/>
            promises shake confidence, when he who wishes to palm off <lb/>
            his wares praises too much the things for sale. There's <lb/>
            nothing pressing me: I am poor enough, but not in debt. <lb/>
            No dealer but myself would give you such a chance; it isn't <lb/>
            everyone would get from me an offer such as this. He once <lb/>
            turned lazy, it is true, and as boys will do, he hid below <lb/>
            the stairs, fearing the impending lash. You would give <lb/>
            your money, if the flight, his only fault, does not displease <lb/>
            you." The seller, without a penalty, would bear away the <lb/>
            price, in my opinion. With open eyes you bought a faulty <lb/>
            slave ; the terms were plainly told you ; do you pursue him, <lb/>
            however, and annoy him with vexatious suit ?</p>
          <p>I told you as you started that I was indolent, I told you <lb/>
            I was almost quite unfit for duties such as this, lest you <lb/>
            should chide me harshly because no answer came from me. <lb/>
            What did I profit then if you attack the laws which side <lb/>

          <p>When one of Lucullus' soldiers, exhausted by fatigue, was <lb/>
            sound asleep by night, he lost to a farthing all the savings <lb/>
            he had made by many toils. Thereafter, like a ravening <lb/>
            wolf, enraged with self and foe alike, by hungry teeth made <lb/>
            fiercer, he from its post dislodged a royal garrison, 'tis said, <lb/>
            highly fortified and rich in varied stores. Being famed for <lb/>
            this exploit, he is adorned with many gifts of honour, and <lb/>
            gets in sesterces twenty thousand, over and above. Just <lb/>
            after this, as chance would have it so, the general wished to <lb/>
            take by storm some fort or other, and so began to urge this <lb/>
            man in words which might put soul into a coward: "Go, <lb/>
            my brave fellow, where your valour calls, go and all luck <lb/>
            attend you, and you will gain a grand reward for your <lb/>
            deserts. Why do you hesitate ?" Then the soldier, <lb/>
            boorish though he was, with ready wit replied, "He will <lb/>
            go, yes he who has lost his purse, will go where'er you <lb/>
            please."</p>
          <p>It was my lot to be brought up at Rome, and to be <lb/>
            taught what woes Achilles' wrath brought on the Greeks. <lb/>
            Kind Athens lent me a little further skill, to wit, that I <lb/>
            might wish to know the right from wrong, and seek for truth <lb/>
            'mid groves of Academus. But times of hardship forced me <lb/>
            from the pleasant spot, and civil turmoils bore me, unskilled <lb/>
            in war, to arms not doomed to match great Caesar's might. <lb/>
            Whence soon as Philippi sent me forth, "a poor plucked <lb/>
            fledgeling," stripped of my father's house and farm, daring <lb/>
            poverty drove me on to write in verse; but now that I <lb/>

            clear my madness out, if I do not choose to be at rest <lb/>
            rather than scribble verse ?</p>
          <p>Years as they pass deprive me of my pleasures, one by <lb/>
            one: already they have taken hence my mirthful glee, my <lb/>
            gallantry, my social ways, my sports; they are about to <pb n="270"/>

            wrest from me my powers of poesy; what think you should <lb/>
            I do ? In short, we do not all admire and like the same; <lb/>
            in Lyric lays you take delight, for a second friend Iambics <lb/>
            have a charm; a third, again, revels in satiric verse and <lb/>
            biting wit. Much like this three guests of mine appear to <lb/>
            disagree, asking with varied tastes for things far different in <lb/>
            kind. What am I to give ? What am I not to give ? You <lb/>
            refuse what a second asks: what you request is quite dis­ <lb/>
            tasteful and offensive to the other two.</p>
          <p>Above all else, think you that at Rome I can write poetry <lb/>
            amidst so many cares and calls ? One asks me to go bail, <lb/>
            another to leave my own affairs and listen to his works: on <lb/>
            the Quirinal one friend lies sick, on farthest part of Aventine, <lb/>
            another, and I must visit both; "nicely convenient" 1 as to <lb/>
            distance, you observe. But the streets are clear, you say, so <lb/>
            that nothing interferes with those engaged in thought. Yes. <lb/>
            Here the contractor in hot haste hurries on with mules and <lb/>
            men; a crane swings round now a great stone, and now a <lb/>
            monster log; sad funeral trains with heavy lorries strive; <lb/>
            here runs a rabid dog, and there a sow, all mud: go now, <lb/>
            con over, if you can, melodious lines. The poets all with <lb/>
            one accord rejoice in woodlands and the city shun, due <lb/>
            followers of Bacchus who delights in sleep and shade: do <lb/>
            you really mean that I, 'midst noise by night and din by <lb/>
            day, should verses sing and follow in the poets' narrow <lb/>
            track? The genius who has sought still Athens for his <lb/>
            home, and to his studies seven years has given, and has <lb/>
            grown old with books and their attendant cares, not seldom <lb/>
            walks abroad2 more silent than a statue, and with laughter <lb/>

          <p>At Rome a rhetorician lived, a pleader's sworn twin, so <lb/>
            much so that in common talk the one would nothing hear <lb/>
            but praises of himself, to such extent that this to that was <lb/>
            Gracchus, and that was Mucius to this. In what way does <lb/>
            this craze less exercise our tuneful bards ? 'Tis lyrics I <lb/>
            compose; another elegies indites. "A work (says one) <lb/>

            survey the temple free to Roman bards ! These afterwards, <lb/>
            if haply you are idle, follow on, and at a distance hear what <lb/>
            each recites, on what account each claims a wreath. We <lb/>
            are hit, and with as many blows we waste the foe, like <lb/>
            Samnites in the listless fight, until the lights come in. <lb/>
            By vote of him I'm dubbed Alcaeus; and what is he by <lb/>

            I hail him as Mimnermus, and all at once he swells in size, <lb/>
            by the adopted name. I much endure that I may soothe <lb/>
            the testy race of bards, while I write poetry myself, and as <lb/>
            a candidate, seek for the people's votes : my studies ended <lb/>
            and my sanity regained, I may with safety stop my open <lb/>
            ears against them as they read.</p>
          <p>Men laugh at those who worthless verses make, but they <lb/>
            themselves feel happy as they write, and admire themselves, <lb/>
            and if you do not speak, unasked they laud whatever they <lb/>
            have written,-happy men ! But he who shall wish to write <lb/>
            a poem by the laws of Art, will with his tablets take an <lb/>
            honest critic's role; all that he shall find devoid of noble­ <lb/>
            ness and weight, all that is undignified, he will not scruple <lb/>
            to displace, though with a grudge it goes, and lingers still in <unclear/> <lb/>
            Vesta's holy shrine. With good intent he will unearth and <pb n="272"/>

            to learn by heart the numbers and the measures of the true <lb/>
            and real life. Wherefore of these things to myself I speak, and <lb/>
            con them over in my silent thought; if water without stint <lb/>
            would fail to quench your thirst, you would consult your <lb/>

            you not dare to own the fact to any friend ? If a wound <lb/>
            were not made easier by a herb or root prescribed, you <lb/>
            would decline to be treated by a root or herb which did no <lb/>
            good. You had heard (we'll say) that sinful folly quits the <lb/>
            man to whom the gods give wealth; and though you're <lb/>
            nothing wiser from the time you've grown more rich, yet <lb/>
            will you take the same advisers as before ? But if wealth <lb/>

            differs from a waster, and what a gulf there is between the <lb/>

          <p>Ye authors, take subject matter equal to your powers, and <lb/>
            ponder long, what your shoulders cannot bear, and what <lb/>
            they can. The man who shall a subject choose within his <lb/>
            powers, neither rich choice of words will fail, nor clear <lb/>
            arrangement. Of arrangement this will be the merit and <lb/>
            the charm, or I'm deceived, that one should say just now <lb/>
            what should be said just now, should much postpone and <lb/>

            allowed, if wisely used. Words strange and newly coined <lb/>
            will gain acceptance, if from a Grecian source they flow, <lb/>
            with small divergence from the parent stream.1 But why <lb/>
            will Romans grant to Plautus and Cæcilius what to Virgil <lb/>
            and to Varius they denied? Why should a grudge be <lb/>
            shown to me if I some vocables can add, when the language <lb/>
            of a Cato and an Ennius enriched their mother tongue, and <lb/>
            introduced fresh names for things ? It has been right and <lb/>
            always will be so, to coin a word that 11 bears the mint-mark <lb/>

          <p>As when the woods their foliage change, as year by year <lb/>

            born soon flourish and grow strong. Death has a right <lb/>
            to us and ours: whether the sea retiring inland shelters <lb/>

            than to learn ?</p>
          <p>A comic subject will decline to be set forth in tragic <lb/>
            verse; likewise Thyestes' supper scorns to be treated in the <lb/>
            strains of common life, scarce worthy of the sock. Let <lb/>
            each kind, as it befits, retain the place it has acquired. Yet <lb/>
            sometimes Comedy uplifts her voice, and an angry Chremes <lb/>
            vents his rage with scathing words, and in tragedy a Telephus <lb/>
            and a Peleus wail in lowly prose, when each, poor and in <lb/>
            exile, discards his paint-pots and his yard-long words, that <lb/>
            is, if by his plaints he wish to touch the hearer's heart.</p>
          <p>Nor is't enough that poems should be prettily composed: <lb/>
            let them be charming too, and let them lead the hearer's <lb/>
            mind where'er they please. As smile responds to smile, so <lb/>
            kindly faces wait on those who weep. If you wish that I <lb/>
            should grieve, you first must grieve yourself; then Telephus <lb/>

            ings ill-conceived, you'll make me either sleep or laugh. Sad <lb/>
            words become a face that's sad, and threats befit an angry <lb/>
            one; sportive words a merry cheek, and sober ones a brow <lb/>
            severe. For Nature first adapts our inward state to For­ <lb/>
            tuners every guise; she makes us happy, or impels to wrath, <lb/>
            or with heavy sorrow bows us to the ground and wrings our <lb/>
            hearts ; then afterwards reveals the mind's emotions through <lb/>
            medium of the tongue.</p>
          <p>If a speakers words are quite unsuited to his state, the <lb/>
            Romans all, both high and low, would raise a loud guffaw. <lb/>
            It will vastly differ whether 'tis god or demigod who speaks, <lb/>
            a man of years mature or one still glowing with the bloom <lb/>
            of youth, the matron of authority, or bustling nurse, the <lb/>
            roving trader or the tenant of a thriving farm, a Colchian or <lb/>
            Assyrian, one reared in Argos or in Thebes.</p>
          <p>Either let tradition be your guide, or frame new characters <lb/>
            which with themselves shall well accord. If perchance you <lb/>
            bring once more upon the stage the famed Achilles, let him <lb/>
            be restless, wrathful, obdurate and fierce ; let him deny that <lb/>
            laws were made for him; let him claim all for arms. Let <lb/>
            Medea be savage and relentless, Ino tearful, Io a wanderer, <lb/>
            Ixion perjured, Orestes melancholy-mad.</p>
          <p>If on the stage you place an untried venture, and risk to <lb/>
            cast your characters afresh, let each be kept up to the close <lb/>
            the same as when it started first, and let it be consistent <lb/>
            with itself throughout. It is difficult to give things common <lb/>
            an individual cast, and you do better if you divide Troy's <lb/>
            story into acts, than if you were the first to bring out things <lb/>
            before unknown and still unsung. Matter that is common <lb/>
            you will make your own, if you linger not upon the cheap and <lb/>
            well known round, and do not render word for word, as some <lb/>
            -close copyist, nor as an imitator jump into a narrow hole, <lb/>
            from which your honour and the poem's law forbid escape. <pb n="281"/>

          <p>Nor will you begin like Cyclic poets long ago ; " Priam's <lb/>
            fortunes I'm about to sing, and the war so famous." What <lb/>
            will this boaster bring worthy of such a mouth? The <lb/>
            mountain will with labour heave, and will produce a tiny <lb/>
            mouse. How much more wise is he who nought professes <lb/>
            with a laboured show: " Sing, Muse, the man, who after <lb/>
            Troy was sacked, went forth to view the cities and the ways <lb/>
            of many men." He never tries to bring forth smoke from <lb/>
            brilliant blaze, but from the smoke to give out light, that <lb/>
            after that he may disclose to view things beautiful and <lb/>
            strange,—Antiphates and Scylla, and Cyclops and Charybdis. <lb/>
            Nor does he trace brave Diomede's return, from Meleager's <lb/>
            death, nor tell the story of the Trojan war from Leda's two­ <lb/>
            yolked egg : he always hastens to the main event, and lands <lb/>
            his reader in the midst of things, as if he knew them all, <lb/>
            and leaves those points to which he cannot hope to give <lb/>
            eclat by treatment, and so invents, so mixes up the real and <lb/>
            the feigned, that 'tis impossible to tell the opening from the <lb/>
            middle, the middle from the end.</p>
          <p>Hear now what I and Romans all desire; if you wish a <lb/>
            pleased spectator to await the curtain's rise and to remain <lb/>
            until the actor says, "give your applause," the habits of each <lb/>
            time must be observed, and something fitting must be given <lb/>
            to varying tastes and years.</p>
          <p>The boy who now can talk and mark the ground with <lb/>
            steady tread, with mates delights to play, and readily flares <lb/>
            up in wrath, as readily cools down, and changes moods from <lb/>
            hour to hour.</p>
          <p>The beardless youth, now from his tutor free, delights in <lb/>
            horses and in dogs, and in the contests on the sunny plain, <lb/>
            pliant as wax to mould to vice, gruff to those who counsel <note type="footnote"> 1 "Rise." In the Roman theatre the curtain did not fall, but rise, <lb/>

            right, slow to provide what's needful, lavish of his gold, <lb/>
            high spirited, and of keen desires, and quick to lay aside <lb/>
            what he had loved before; with tastes quite changed, of <lb/>
            age and mind mature he now seeks wealth and friendships, <lb/>
            to office is a slave, is cautious of doing aught which after­ <lb/>
            wards he may desire to change.</p>
          <p>The old man many ills surround, either because he <lb/>
            follows gain, and grudgingly abstains from what he has <lb/>
            amassed, and fears to take its use, or because he sets about <lb/>
            all matters in a timid and a heartless way, a dawdler, <lb/>
            patient in hope, wanting in energy, and eager for the future, <lb/>
            morose, a grumbler, still praising the good old times when <lb/>
            he was young, a reprover and reformer of younger men.</p>
          <p>Years as they come bring with them many boons, and as <lb/>
            they go they many blessings take. Lest haply old men's <lb/>
            words and acts be given to youths, and full grown men's to <lb/>
            boys, we shall always dwell upon the features which best <lb/>
            befit each stage of life.</p>
          <p>Events either occur upon the stage, or are reported there <lb/>
            as having taken place. What enters through the ears less <lb/>
            keenly stirs the mind than what's submitted to the trusty <lb/>
            eyes, and what the spectator to himself imparts; but yet <lb/>
            you will not on the stage produce what's better done behind <lb/>
            the scenes, and much will from the view withhold, which <lb/>
            grace of eloquence will soon record before the House: let <lb/>
            not Medea slay her sons in the spectators' sight, nor openly <lb/>
            let impious Atreus cook the human flesh, nor Procne be to a <lb/>
            bird transformed, nor Cadmus to a snake. Whatever you <lb/>
            thus show to me I don't believe, but only loathe.</p>
          <p>Let a play have just five acts, no more, no less, if 'tis <lb/>
            meant to be called for, and when acted once to be performed <lb/>
            again. Bring in no god, unless a crisis comes which calls for <lb/>
            such a help; nor force one actor more than three to speak. <pb n="283"/>
            </p><note type="correspondsTo" n="165-222]"/>
          <p>The chorus should perform an actor's part, and do the <lb/>
            duty "like a man;" and let not anything be sung between the <lb/>
            acts, save what assists the plot and aptly fits the place. Let <lb/>
            it show favour to the good and give its kind advice, and <lb/>
            check the wrathful, and cherish those who fear to sin: let <lb/>
            it praise the dishes of a frugal board, justice that's fair <lb/>
            to all, and laws, and peace with open gates; let it secrets <lb/>
            keep, and let it pray and importune the gods, that fortune <lb/>
            would to wretched men return, and would forsake the proud.</p>
          <p>In days of old the flute, not bound, as now, with brass, <lb/>
            nor rivalling the trumpet's roar, but slim and simple with <lb/>
            few stops, was useful to accompany and aid the choirs, and <lb/>
            with its breath to fill the seats not yet too densely crammed; <lb/>
            to which the people, as 'twas small, flocked on in moderate <lb/>
            amount, temperate, devout, respectful.</p>
          <p>Then, its conquests o'er, when it began to enlarge its <lb/>
            bounds, and gird its cities with a wall of greater sweep, and <lb/>
            at feasts to appease its Genius with wine by day, without a <lb/>
            fear of penalty, a greater licence was allowed to rhythm and <lb/>
            measure; for what good taste could unlearned rustics have, <lb/>
            when from their work set free, they mixed with townsmen, <lb/>
            the base born with the high ?</p>
          <p>Thus to the ancient art the flutist added movement of <lb/>
            limb, and splendid dress, and as he strode the stage he drew <lb/>
            a robe with sweeping train. Thus, too, clear notes were <lb/>
            added to the solemn lyre, and a headlong rush of words <lb/>
            produced a burst of eloquence before unknown, and the <lb/>
            utterance, full of useful saws, and presage of things to come, <lb/>
            differed in nothing from the Delphic lots.</p>
          <p>He who in tragic verse contended for a worthless goat <lb/>
            soon brought upon the stage the naked Satyrs, and, rudely <lb/>
            sarcastic, tried his jokes without the loss of dignity, for this <note type="footnote"> 1 It It," i.e., the people. </note> <pb n="284"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[EP. III."/><lb/>
            reason that the spectator must be kept alive by some allure­ <lb/>
            ment, and some novelties to please, since he had aided in <lb/>
            the sacrifice, had freely drunk, and now defied all law.</p>
          <p>But it will be fitting to commend the drollery and <lb/>
            smartness of the Satyrs, to change from grave to gay, yet <lb/>
            provided that, whatsoever god or hero shall be introduced, <lb/>
            one lately conspicuous in royal gold and purple should <lb/>
            not descend into low taverns with his vulgar talk, or whilst <lb/>
            he shuns the ground, should never try to gain the clouds and <lb/>
            empty void. Tragedy, beneath whose role it is to babble <lb/>
            forth some silly lines, will with the froward Satyrs mix, <lb/>
            with some becoming modesty, just as an honest matron does <lb/>
            when bid to dance on festal days.</p>
          <p>O Pisos, should I ever come to write satyric plays, I <lb/>
            shall not choose some trite and common words; nor shall <lb/>
            I strive to differ so from tragic style, that it should matter <lb/>
            nought whether the speaker be a Davus, and a brazen <lb/>
            Pythias who from deluded Simo a whole talent stole, or a <lb/>
            Silenus, guardian and attendant of his heavenly ward. My <lb/>
            aim shall be a poem founded on a well-known theme, so <lb/>
            that any one may hope to do the same, but when he has <lb/>
            tried, may labour much, and find his toil in vain. So great <lb/>
            is the effect produced by arrangement and combination, so <lb/>
            much dignity is added even to materials very mean.</p>
          <p>Let the Fauns, brought from the woods to tread the stage, <lb/>
            beware, as I advise, lest as if born in Rome's most busy <lb/>
            part, and almost forum-bred, they either ape the youths too <lb/>
            much in tender strains, or utter foul and shameful words; <lb/>
            for the knight, the freeborn, and the men of means, are thus <lb/>
            in feelings hurt, nor though the crowds who1 live on peas and <lb/>
            roasted nuts approve of anything, do they on that account <lb/>
            receive it patiently, and gift the poet with a wreath. <note type="footnote"> 1 "Live on," buy. </note> <pb n="285"/>

          <p>To a short add on a long, and thus an Iamb form, a light <lb/>
            and tripping foot; whence also it bade the name of trim­ <lb/>
            eter 1 to be given to Iambics, though it returned six beats, <lb/>
            each foot the same from first to last: 2 not long ago, that <lb/>
            it might come upon the ear with somewhat slower and <lb/>
            more solemn step, it took the staid spondeus to its native <lb/>
            rights, kind and obliging, but not so far, that from the <lb/>
            second and the fourth it should retire, as partners mighty <lb/>
            In Accius' noble trimeters this foot is seldom found; and <lb/>
            Ennius' verses, sent upon the stage with ponderous weight, it <lb/>
            charges with the shameful fault of work too hurried and <lb/>
            devoid of care, or else with ignorance of poetic art. It is <lb/>
            not every judge who sees false rhythms in verse, and thus <lb/>
            unworthy licence is to Roman bards allowed.</p>
          <p>Am I then to roam at will and write as fancy leads ? or <lb/>
            should I think that all will see my faults, and so keep safe <lb/>
            and wary within reach of pardon ? In short, I have <lb/>
            avoided blame,—not praise deserved. Ye Pisos, look to <lb/>
            Greece, and con her models over night by night and day <lb/>
            by day.</p>
          <p>But your fathers praised the numbers and the wit of <lb/>
            Plautus; admiring both, too easy critics, not to say foolish, <lb/>
            if, only, you and I can judge between what's coarse and <lb/>
            what's refined in words, and can detect the proper cadence <lb/>
            of a line by finger and by ear.</p>
          <p>Thespis invented Tragedy, 'tis said, a kind of poetry <lb/>
            unknown before, and in waggons carried round his Plays, <note type="footnote"> 1 "Trimeter."

            might." The iambus and spondee unite, and between them form a <lb/>
            special metre. </note> <pb n="286"/>

            which persons, their faces smeared with lees of wine, should <lb/>
            sing and act. Then Æschylus, deviser of the mask and <lb/>
            seemly robe, taught actors lofty utterance and the buskin's <lb/>
            stately tread. After these the Older Comedy came in, not <lb/>
            without its meed of praise, but liberty to licence turned, and <lb/>
            to excess which called for law's restraints. A law was <lb/>
            passed, and the right of libel being removed, the chorus, <lb/>
            to its shame, was dumb.</p>
          <p>Nought have our poets left untried, and not least honour <lb/>
            have they gained, when they have boldly swerved from foot­ <lb/>
            steps of the Greeks, and sung our country's deeds, whether <lb/>
            it was Tragedy or Comedy they showed in Roman dress. <lb/>
            Nor would our Latium be less renowned for letters than for <lb/>
            bravery in arms, did not our poets, one and all, disdain to <lb/>
            bear the tedious labour of the file.1 0 you who come of <lb/>

            his duty too, whence he gains his rich supplies, what rears <lb/>
            and moulds the poet true; what is proper, what is not; <lb/>
            whither true Art directs your path, where false ideas <lb/>
            bear you to.</p>
          <p>Sound wisdom is the starting point and source of writing <lb/>
            well; the works of Socrates will matter give, and matter <lb/>
            once supplied, words will follow with a ready flow. He who <lb/>
            has learned what to our country, what to our friends we <lb/>
            owe, with what affection we should cherish parents, brothers, <lb/>
            guests, what duty to a senator belongs, what to a judge, <lb/>
            what part a general sent out to war should play, that man, <lb/>
            without a doubt, knows how to give each character its own <lb/>
            becoming traits. I should advise the man who with cunning <lb/>
            skill both men and things would paint, to regard with care <lb/>
            a fitting type of manners and of life, and thence to draw the <lb/>
            words that live and speak. Sometimes a Play, devoid of <lb/>
            beauty, "of solid value or artistic skill," if it have passages <lb/>
            of showy moral saws, and characters well drawn, thrills <lb/>
            the audience with more true delight, and holds them spell- <lb/>
            bound with a surer grasp, than verses wanting substance, <lb/>
            or trifles with a pleasing sound.</p>
          <p>To the Greeks who nought but fame desire the Muse has <lb/>
            given the native gift of poesy: she has given the art of pure <lb/>
            and finished speech. The Roman boys learn to divide the <lb/>
            as into a hundred parts, in lengthy sums.</p>
          <p>" Let the son of Albinus say, if an uncia is taken from a <lb/>
            quincunx, what remains.1 You might have said, "a triens" <note type="footnote"> 1 The as was worth rather more than three farthings of English <lb/>
            money. It was divided into twelve parts called uncia. Sextans </note> <pb n="288"/>

          <p>" Good! you'll be able to guard your interests. Reverse <lb/>
            the process and add an uncia, what is the result ? " <lb/>
            "A semis."</p>
          <p>When this canker, and this petty greed of pelf has once <lb/>
            imbued their minds, can we still expect that poems can be <lb/>
            made, worthy to be touched with cedar oil, or to be kept in <lb/>
            well smoothed cypress case ? Poets wish to profit or amuse, <lb/>
            or to say what is at once agreeable, and of use in life. <lb/>
            Let what you enjoin be brief, that things said quickly may <lb/>
            be retained by willing ears and faithful minds: pour in too <lb/>
            much, the vessel overflows.</p>
          <p>Let fiction meant to please be near as possible to truth, <lb/>
            and let no story claim belief for every thing it chooses to <lb/>
            invent, and let it not draw forth a living child from Lamia's <lb/>
            stomach, newly dined.1 The elder knights2 drive from the <lb/>
            stage a piece without a moral aim ; the haughty "juniors " <lb/>
            scout the tight-laced and the dry: that poet carries every <lb/>
            vote who blends the pleasant with the good, who charms <lb/>
            the reader, and gives him counsel too; such book is sure <lb/>
            the coffers of the Sosii to fill; it crosses ocean, and there <lb/>
            is read, and to a distant age hands down the writer's well- <lb/>
            known name.</p>
          <p>Yet faults there are which may indulgence claim; for <lb/>
            neither does the string return the sound which hand and <note type="footnote"> (a sixth) was two unciæ; quadrans (a fourth) three unciæ; triens <lb/>
            (a third) four; quincunx, five. This examination on arithmetic is <lb/>
            supposed to be made by the boy's teacher, or by some friend, perhaps <lb/>
            by Horace. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 " Lamia," a monster bugbear to frighten children. She was said <lb/>

            mind intend, but very often gives you back a sharp when <lb/>
            you demand a fiat, nor will the bow at all times hit the <lb/>
            object of your aim. But when the beauties in a piece are <lb/>
            more in number far, I shall not with the blots find fault, <lb/>
            which either want of care has caused,1 or nature's weak­ <lb/>
            ness failed to shun. How then stands the case? Just <lb/>
            as a copyist no pardon finds, if ever and again he makes <lb/>
            the same mistake, though often warned; just as a jeer the <lb/>
            harpist greets who always strikes the same false note; so he <lb/>
            who often fails, appears to me a second Chcerilus, at whom, <lb/>
            when now and then he makes a hit, I wonder as I laugh; <lb/>
            though all the same I feel aggrieved if 'tis found that worthy <lb/>
            Homer sometimes takes a nap: and yet it's no great sin if <lb/>
            o'er a lengthy poem sleep should steal at times.</p>
          <p>As with a painting, so with a poem; there is one which <lb/>
            takes you more, if you are near, and one, if you are farther <lb/>
            off; one likes the shade, another will prefer to brave the <lb/>
            open light, dreading not the critic's keenest skill; this <lb/>
            pleases once, this viewed ten times will please.</p>
          <p>O elder son of Piso's house, though by your fathers words <lb/>
            you're trained to right, and though your judgment is by <lb/>
            nature true, take and make your own this word of mine­ <lb/>
            to certain things a middling and a reasonable share of <lb/>
            worth is rightly given. Thus, the counsellor and advocate <lb/>
            of fair abilities is far below the talent of the eloquent <lb/>
            Messala, and of Cascellius Aulus' legal lore, but yet he is <lb/>
            esteemed; mediocrity to poets is denied by men and gods <lb/>
            and bookstalls. As at a pleasant feast jarring music gives <lb/>
            offence, and unguents coarse, and poppy with Sardinian <lb/>
            honey, because the banquet could be carried on without <lb/>
            such helps ; so a poem made and designed to please men's <note type="footnote"> 1 "Caused," fudit, literally, poured forth-a metaphor from spill­ <lb/>

            minds, if it descend the least from merits heights, sinks to <lb/>
            the depths.</p>
          <p>The man not versed in games abstains from Campus' <lb/>
            sports, and one unskilled in ball, or quoit, or hoop, sits still, <lb/>
            lest the crowded rings should find good cause to raise the <lb/>
            laugh : he who verses knows not, verses dares to make, and <lb/>
            why should he not ? He's free and free-born, and more than <lb/>
            that, he's rated as a knight, and far removed from every <lb/>
            taint of crime. You, my friend, will nothing say and nothing <lb/>
            do, which native wit forbids :1 such is your judgment, such <lb/>
            your purpose. Yet if you some day write a piece, let it be <lb/>
            read in private by Maecius as judge, by your father and by <lb/>
            me, and let it be withheld for nine long years, your "copy" <lb/>
            safely locked away; what you've never published you can <lb/>
            easily destroy : a word sent forth ne'er finds its home again.</p>
          <p>Orpheus, the priest, and mouth-piece of the gods, restrained <lb/>
            from bloodshed savage men, and from their foul repasts, and <lb/>
            hence 'twas said he tamed the tigers and the lions fierce; 'twas <lb/>
            said too that Amphion, founder of the Theban fort, by his <lb/>
            lyre's notes made stones to move, and led them where he <lb/>
            willed by coaxing strains. In days of old 'twas wisdom's <lb/>
            task to draw a line betwixt the rights of men and states, <lb/>
            twixt sacred and profane, to guard from stray concubinage, <lb/>
            to lay down marriage rights, cities to found, and laws on <lb/>
            wood engrave. So honour and renown accrued to bards <lb/>
            and strains of bards as if by heaven sent. Famed after <lb/>
            these old Homer and Tyrtaeus by their verses whetted <lb/>
            manly souls to martial wars; by means of verse were oracles <lb/>
            declared ; in verse the path of life was clearly shown; and <lb/>
            in Pierian strains were monarchs' favours sought; amuse­ <lb/>
            ment too was found to close the weary labours of the year: <note type="footnote"> 1 " Native wit forbids,"—That is, you will examine your own abilities <lb/>
            before you attempt anything. </note> <pb n="291"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="378-433]"/><lb/>
            all this I say, in order that the Muse, skilled in the lyre, <lb/>
            and Apollo, god of song, may never chance to cause you <lb/>
            blush of shame.</p>
          <p>It has been asked whether it is by Art or nature's gift that <lb/>
            poems, worthy of our praise, are made. I, for my part, do <lb/>
            not see of what avail would either study be without a true <lb/>
            poetic vein, or what genius wanting culture could effect: <lb/>
            thus each demands the other's aid, and so in friendly union <lb/>
            they combine.</p>
          <p>He who is eager in the race to reach the wished-for goal, <lb/>
            even while a boy has much endured and practised much, <lb/>
            has borne extremes of heat and cold, has abstained from love <lb/>
            and wine : he who at the Pythian games plays on the flute <lb/>
            has learned the art before, and borne a master's stern rebuke. <lb/>
            But now 'tis quite enough to say, "I make wondrous poems : <lb/>
            plague take the hindmost; 'tis a shame for me to stay <lb/>
            behind and to confess, I really know not what I never <lb/>
            learned."</p>
          <p>Just as the salesman draws a crowd to buy his wares, so <lb/>
            the poet rich in land, rich in invested funds, invites his <lb/>
            flatterers to come for gain. But if he's one who can afford <lb/>
            to serve in style a dainty meal, and bail the poor and needy, <lb/>
            and free them from the fatal meshes of the law, I shall be <lb/>
            astonished if, happy man, he shall come to know the lying, <lb/>
            from the honest, friend. If you, my friend, have given, or <lb/>
            mean to give a gift to any one, bring him not, when full of <lb/>
            joy, to verses made by you : for he will exclaim, beautiful! <lb/>
            bravo! well done! over some he will no doubt grow pale, <lb/>
            will even with loving eyes shed tears, with delight will dance, <lb/>
            and stamp the floor.</p>
          <p>As those who weep at funerals for hire make almost <lb/>
            more lament and more ado than those who from the heart <lb/>
            their wailings pour, so does the mocking flatterer show more <pb n="292"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="[EP. III."/><lb/>
            emotion than the true admirer. Tis said that kings ply <lb/>
            hard with many cups, and put to the test by wine, him whose <lb/>
            inner thoughts they wish to know, and see if he deserves <lb/>
            their friendship; if poems you compose, never let thoughts <lb/>
            lurking beneath a cunning guise, deceive you.</p>
          <p>Suppose that to Quintilius you read a piece, he'd say, <lb/>
            " Correct this, I beseech you, and this;" should you declare, <lb/>
            you could not do it better, though you had tried again and <lb/>
            yet again with no effect, he would bid you cancel it, and on <lb/>
            the anvil place again the verses badly formed. If, rather <lb/>
            than amend the line you chose the blot to keep, he would not <lb/>
            spend another word, or waste his efforts, but let you hug <lb/>
            both self and work, without a rival and alone.</p>
          <p>The man of honesty and sense will censure verses void of <lb/>
            pith, will blame the harsh, the inelegant will cross and <lb/>
            smear, will prune away all florid ornament, will bid you to <lb/>
            make clear what is obscure, will challenge the equivocal, <lb/>
            will mark what should be changed; will become, in fact, an <lb/>
            Aristarchus out and out: he will not say, " Why should I <lb/>
            hurt the feelings of a friend for trifles ? " These trifles will <lb/>
            bring to serious trouble him who has once been fooled, and <lb/>
            with uncandid warmth received.</p>
          <p>As all shun him whom a malignant itch affects, or <lb/>
            jaundice, or frenzied craze, or moonstruck madness, so men <lb/>
            of sense avoid, and even flee, the crackbrained bard; the <lb/>
            boys torment him, and follow on, heedless of risks. While <lb/>
            he with head in air, belches his verses forth, and strays about, <lb/>
            if like a fowler, on his game intent, he falls into a well or pit, <lb/>
            although he shout to reach afar, 11 ho citizens, come to my <lb/>
            help," not one would care to take him out. If any one does <lb/>
            care to aid him and let down a rope, I should say, " How <lb/>
            know .you if on purpose he jumped in, and would rather not <lb/>
            be saved ? and I will tell how the Sicilian bard, Empedocles, <pb n="293"/>
             <note type="correspondsTo" n="434-476]"/><lb/>
            came by his death. While wishing to be deemed a god, <lb/>
            he leaped into burning Ætna, " calm and cool." Let poets <lb/>
            have the right and liberty to perish if they wish. He who <lb/>
            saves a man against his will, is just as bad as he who kills <lb/>
            him. For not once only has he acted thus, nor if you bring <lb/>
            him back, will he at once become a reasonable man, and <lb/>
            lay aside the love of a notorious death. Nor does it quite <lb/>
            appear why he should verses make: whether he has defiled <lb/>
            his father's grave, or impiously disturbed some cursed spot1 ; <lb/>
            at any rate, he's mad: and like a bear, if he can burst the <lb/>
            bars which guard his cell, this merciless reciter puts to <lb/>
            flight learned and unlearned alike; but if he catches one, <lb/>
            he holds him fast, and by his reading kills,-a very leech <lb/>
            that wont let go the flesh till he is filled with blood. <note type="footnote"> 1 "Cursed spot "-a bidental, that is, a place struck by lightning, <lb/>
