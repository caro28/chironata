          </ab>
          <p>This was a speech in support of an indictment preferred against <lb/>
            Timocrates for passing an improper Jaw. It was composed by Demos-<lb/>
            thenes for Diodorus, the same person for whom he wrote the speech <lb/>
            against Androtion, and who in this case, as in the former, was associ <lb/>
            ated in the prosecution with his friend Euctemon. The circum <lb/>
            stances of the case were as follows :—</p>
          <p>Hostilities had broken out during the Social War between At' lived <lb/>
            . <lb/>
            the Persian king; the Athenians sent an embassy to Mone ) is <lb/>
            Prince of Caria, to complain of some attack which he ha I am <lb/>
            upon their islands in the Archipelago. At the head of the et will <lb/>
            were Androtion, Melanopus, and Glaucetes, who, sailing in a came <lb/>
            war, captured on their way a merchant ship of Naucrat <lb/>
            brought it home with them to the Piraeus. Naucratis bellow, <lb/>
            Egyptian city, in the dominions of the Persian king, the vessel ; I <lb/>
            condemned by the Athenians as a lawful prize, and the more <lb/>
            ordered to be sold. The proceeds, nine talents and a half, inste <unclear>nly</unclear> <lb/>
            being paid at once, as they should have been, into the <unclear>p</unclear> <lb/>
            treasury, were kept by the ambassadors in their own hands. A in <lb/>
            some lapse of time, the government being in want of mon, <lb/>
            inquisitors were appointed to discover all concealed property belong <lb/>
            ing to the state. Euctemon gave information, in consequence c <lb/>
            which the ambassadors were required to pay this sum of nine talents <lb/>
            and a half. Not having paid it at the close of the year, they <lb/>
            became chargeable with double the debt, and, in default of payment, <lb/>
            were liable to imprisonment. At this crisis their friend Timocrates <lb/>
            came forward with a law, framed, as the prosecutor contends, for the <lb/>
            sole purpose of helping them out of their difficulty. The law which <lb/>
            he proposed and contrived to pass was to the following effect:- <lb/>
            That any person who had been, or should hereafter be condemned <lb/>
            to imprisonment for default in paying a debt to the state, should be <lb/>
            allowed to put in bail, and respited until the ninth Prytanea (or <lb/>
            Presidency): if the debt was not then paid by him or by his bail, <lb/>
            he should be imprisoned, and the property of the bail should be con- <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> B </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="2"/>
            fiscated. There was a clause excepting from the operation of the <lb/>
            law farmers of the taxes and lessees of the public revenue.</p>
          <p>To obtain a repeal of this law and the punishment of its author, Dio­ <lb/>
            dorus and Euctemon adopted the means which the Athenian consti­ <lb/>
            tution afforded them, and preferred an indictment. They contended, <lb/>
            first, that the motives of Timocrates in proposing the law were not <lb/>
            to promote the public good, but to serve himself and his private <lb/>
            friends; secondly, that the law was intrinsically a bad one, being <lb/>
            unconstitutional in its character and mischievous in its tendency; <lb/>
            and further, that it had been passed in an illegal manner, the con­ <lb/>
            ditions required by the laws of Athens not having been complied <lb/>
            with. The orator enters into an elaborate argument to establish <lb/>
            these positions, referring to various existing statutes, to which the <lb/>
            law in question was repugnant, and showing that it was impossible <lb/>
            for it to work well either in a financial or in any other point of <lb/>
            view. He also, according to the practice of the Athenian courts, <lb/>
            assails the characters of Timocrates and AndrotioD, avowing that <lb/>
            his own personal enmity to the latter was one of the motives which <lb/>
            induced him to prosecute. Several passages of the speech against <lb/>
            Androtion are here repeated, as the reader will perceive. For <lb/>
            information as to the law and other matters illustrative of this <lb/>
            ech, the reader is referred to Volume iL Appendices IV. V. and <lb/>
            Volume ii. Appendix VIII. <lb/>
            If the speech was B.C. 353.</p>
          <p>OCRATES himself must admit, men of the jury, that he <lb/>
            one but himself to blame for the present prosecution. <lb/>
            .th intent to deprive the state of a considerable sum. <lb/>
            aey, men of Athens, he introduced a law, in violation <lb/>
            the existing laws, which was neither proper nor just. <lb/>
            .iat other respects it will be mischievous and detrimental <lb/>
            ne commonwealth, should it be confirmed, you will learn <lb/>
            letail presently from my speech; but the most important <unclear/><lb/>
            nt which I have to urge, and that which most obviously <lb/>
            ggests itself, I shall not hesitate to declare-it is this. <lb/>
            The decision which you give upon oath on every question <lb/>
            is rendered null and void by the defendant's law, not to <lb/>
            confer any advantage upon the state—that's impossible, when <lb/>
            it makes the courts of justice, which are known to be the <lb/>
            supports of the constitution, unable to enforce the legal <lb/>
            penalties of crime-but in order that some of that clique, <lb/>
            who have for a long time been living on you and pillaging <lb/>
            you to an enormous extent, may escape refunding even what <lb/>
            they are clearly proved to have stolen. And so much easier <lb/>
            is it to pay court to certain private individuals, than to <lb/>
            stand up for your rights, that the defendant has received <lb/>
             <pb n="3"/>
            money from those men, and did not introduce this law for <lb/>
            them till he got it, whilst I, acting on your behalf, instead of <lb/>
            receiving anything from you, run the risk of paying a thousand <lb/>
            drachms. It is the practice in general with those who <lb/>
            undertake any public matter, to tell you that the subject on <lb/>
            which they are addressing you is a most serious one, and <lb/>
            peculiarly worthy of your attention. It appears to me that, <lb/>
            if any one ever has said this with justice, I may properly say <lb/>
            it now. For no one will dispute, I imagine, that for the. <lb/>
            blessings which the commonwealth enjoys, for her popular <lb/>
            constitution and her freedom, she is principally indebted to <lb/>
            the laws. Well; this is the very question now before you, <lb/>
            whether all the other statutes against public offenders are to <lb/>
            be invalidated, and this one to be established, or whether, on <lb/>
            the contrary, this is to be repealed, and the others allowed to <lb/>
            remain in force. Such (to speak in a short compass) is the <lb/>
            matter upon which you have now to decide.</p>
          <p>You might wonder perhaps why a person who has lived <lb/>
            quietly all the rest of his life (as I believe I have done) is <lb/>
            now found engaged in trials and public prosecutions. I am <lb/>
            anxious therefore to give you a short explanation, and it will <lb/>
            not be irrelevant. You must know, men of Athens, I came <lb/>
            into collision with a vile, quarrelsome, abominable fellow, <lb/>
            with whom at last the whole city has come into collision ; I <lb/>
            mean Androtion. I have been injured by him far more' <lb/>
            grievously than Euctemon has; for Euctemon suffered only <lb/>
            pecuniary damage; whereas I, if Androtion had succeeded in <lb/>
            his attack, should have been deprived not only of my property, <lb/>
            but of my life; nay, even to part with life, which is open to <lb/>
            mankind in general, would not have been easy for me. He <lb/>
            accused me of a thing which a man of right feeling would <lb/>
            hardly like even to mention-that I had killed my own father: <lb/>
            he then got up an indictment for impiety, and brought me <lb/>
            to trial: in this, however, he failed to get a fifth part of the <lb/>
            votes, and incurred the penalty of the thousand drachms ; I <lb/>
            obtained my just acquittal, principally through the favour of <lb/>
            the Gods, and, under them, through the jury of my country. <lb/>
            The man, who had wickedly brought me into such peril, I 8 <lb/>
            regarded as an irreconcileable enemy: and seeing that he had <lb/>
            done public wrong to the commonwealth, both in the collec­ <lb/>
            tiou of the property tax, and in the manufacture of the <note type="footnote"> B 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="4"/>
            sacred utensils,1 and that he retained in his possession and <lb/>
            refused to pay considerable sums belonging to the Goddess <lb/>
            and the heroes and the state, I took proceedings against him <lb/>
            on conjunction with Euctemon, thinking I had found a good <lb/>
            opportunity at the same time to redress the grievances of the <lb/>
            commonwealth and obtain satisfaction for my own. So should <lb/>
            I wish now both for myself to accomplish my own objects, <lb/>
            and for the defendant to suffer what he deserves. When the <lb/>
            facts were beyond all dispute, the council having pronounced <lb/>
            sentence of condemnation, the assembly having given a whole <lb/>
            day to that single question, and besides this, two tribunals <lb/>
            composed of a thousand and one jurors having pronounced <lb/>
            their verdict-when there was no longer any pretext for <lb/>
            keeping you out of the money—Timocrates the defendant <lb/>
            treated all the proceedings with such contempt as to propose <lb/>
            this law, by means of which he deprives the Gods of their <lb/>
            sacred property and the state of hers, and invalidates the <lb/>
            decisions of the council and the assembly and the court of <lb/>
            justice, and has enabled any one that pleases to plunder the <lb/>
            state with impunity. For all this the only remedy that we <lb/>
            can see is, to indict the law, bring it before you, and endeavour <lb/>
            to repeal it. I will in a few words explain the transaction to <lb/>
            you from the beginning, that you may the more clearly see <lb/>
            and comprehend the iniquitous character of the law itself.</p>
          <p>Aristophon moved a decree in the assembly, that inquisi­ <lb/>
            tors 2 should be appointed, and that, whoever knew of any <lb/>
            one having in his possession any sacred or public property of <lb/>
            the state, should give information to them. After this <lb/>
            Euctemon gave information, that Archebius and Lysithides, <lb/>
            who had been trierarchs, had in their possession the proceeds <lb/>
            of a cargo from Naucratis, estimated at nine talents and <lb/>
            thirty minas. He communicated with the council; an order <lb/>
            of council was drawn up; an assembly was thereupon held, <lb/>
            and the people voted for a hearing of the question. Euctemon <lb/>
            got up, and explained in the course of his speech, how the <lb/>
            ship was taken by the trireme which carried Melanopus and <lb/>
            Glaucetes and Androtion on their embassy to Mausolus; how <lb/>
            the people to whom the cargo belonged presented their peti- <note type="footnote"> 1 See the Oration against Androtion, VoL iii. page 160. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 See Vol. iii. Appendix VIII. page 341. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="5"/>
            tion,1 and how you rejected it on the ground that the cargo <lb/>
            was not friendly. He then reminded you and read the laws, <lb/>
            which declare that in such a case the property must be con­ <lb/>
            fiscated. You all thought that what he said was just. <lb/>
            Androtion, Glaucetes, and Melanopus jumped up, and (pray <lb/>
            watch if I am speaking the truth) they poured out a torrent <lb/>
            of complaint and abuse, exonerated the trierarchs, confessed <lb/>
            that they had the money themselves, and desired that the <lb/>
            inquisition should proceed against them. You heard what <lb/>
            they said, and, as soon as they had done bawling, Euctemon <lb/>
            advised-nothing could be fairer-that you should get the <lb/>
            money from the trierarchs, and they should have recourse to <lb/>
            the persons who had it, and, if there was any dispute, you <lb/>
            should direct an interpleader, and the party who lost the <lb/>
            verdict should be deemed the state-debtor. They indict the <lb/>
            decree; it came into court; to cut the matter short, it was <lb/>
            considered to have been moved legally, and the verdict was <lb/>
            in its favour. What then ought to have been done ? The <lb/>
            state should have had the money, and the party defrauding <lb/>
            her should have been punished, and surely there was no <lb/>
            occasion for any law. Well; up to this point, you had sus­ <lb/>
            tained no injury from Timocrates, the present defendant. <lb/>
            Subsequently, however, he took everything which I have <lb/>
            mentioned upon himself, and it will appear that you have <lb/>
            been injured solely by him; for by lending himself to the <lb/>
            artifices and trickeries of those other men, and making him­ <lb/>
            self their tool, he took their guilt upon his own shoulders, as <lb/>
            I will show you clearly. I must first remind you of the 15 <lb/>
            dates, and the occasion upon which he proposes his law; for <lb/>
            it will appear that he has treated you with mockery and <lb/>
            insult. It was the month of Scirophorion when those men <lb/>
            were beaten in their indictment of Euctemon : hiring then the <lb/>
            present defendant, and not being even in a condition to do <lb/>
            justice to you, they put some tattling fellows in the market- <lb/>
            place to say, that they were ready to pay the single sum, but <lb/>
            would not be able to pay the double. This was an impudent 16 <lb/>
            conspiracy, a contrivance that the present law might be <lb/>
            passed without observation. The fact itself proves my <lb/>
            assertion : for they did not pay you at that time a drachm of <note type="footnote"> 1 The owner of the goods placed a bough, as the symbol of petition, <lb/>
            upon the altar, which stood at the entrance of the theatre. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="6"/>
            the money, while by a single law they nullified a plurality of <lb/>
            existing laws, and by a law which, of all that ever were passed <lb/>
            before you, is the most shameful and scandalous.</p>
          <p>I have something to say about the statutes, which allow <lb/>
            indictments of this kind, and then I will proceed to the law <lb/>
            itself which I have indicted: when you have heard these <lb/>
            explanations, you will be in a better position to understand <lb/>
            the rest of the case. In our existing laws, men of Athens, is <lb/>
            clearly and accurately defined everything which is required <lb/>
            to be done for laws about to be enacted. And first of all, a <lb/>
            time is specified at which laws must be proposed; and even <lb/>
            then it is not allowed to be done in what manner the indi­ <lb/>
            vidual proposer pleases, but he is directed first to write out <lb/>
            his law, and put it up before the statues of the Heroes, that <lb/>
            every man may have an opportunity of seeing it, and he is <lb/>
            required also to propose the same law for all, and further, to <lb/>
            repeal those laws which are inconsistent with it; and there <lb/>
            are other directions, which there seems no necessity to advert <lb/>
            to now. If a man violates any one of these, the lawgiver <lb/>
            allows any other person to indict him. If Timocrates had <lb/>
            not offended in all these particulars, if he had not violated <lb/>
            all these conditions in introducing his law, one would have <lb/>
            preferred a single accusation against him, whatever that <lb/>
            might have been. As it is, however, I must take the charges <lb/>
            one by one, and speak separately of each. I will begin with <lb/>
            his first offence, and show how he attempted to legislate in <lb/>
            violation of all the existing laws; after that, I will take the <lb/>
            other parts of the case in what order you like. Here-take <lb/>
            these statutes and read them. It will appear that he has <lb/>
            complied with none of these requisitions. Attend, men of <lb/>
            the jury, to the laws while they are read.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>" In the first presidency, on the eleventh day, in the assem­ <lb/>
            bly, when the crier has pronounced the prayer, the votes of <lb/>
            the people shall be taken upon the laws, first, those which <lb/>
            concern the council, next, the general laws, then those <lb/>
            which are enacted for the nine archons, afterwards those <lb/>
            relating to the other magistrates. The first question shall <lb/>
            be, Who are content with the existing laws concerning the <lb/>
            council ? the next, Who are not content ? and so on for the <lb/>
             <pb n="7"/>
            general laws. And the votes upon the revision of laws shall <lb/>
            be taken according to the established legal practice. If any <lb/>
            of the existing laws be condemned, the presidents, in whose <lb/>
            term of office the condemnation has taken place, shall appoint <lb/>
            the last of the three assemblies for the consideration of them; <lb/>
            and the committee of council, who shall be in office on that <lb/>
            assembly-day, are required, immediately after the sacrifice, to <lb/>
            put the question concerning the law-revisors, in what manner <lb/>
            they shall hold their session, and how their pay is to be <lb/>
            provided: and the law-revisors shall be chosen from those <lb/>
            who have sworn the Heliastic oath. And if the presidents <lb/>
            shall not appoint the assembly, or if the committee of <lb/>
            council shall not put the question according as the statute <lb/>
            prescribes, every one of the presidents shall forfeit a thousand <lb/>
            drachms to Minerva, and every one of the committee shall <lb/>
            forfeit forty drachms to Minerva; and an information shall <lb/>
            lie against them to the judges, in like manner as when a <lb/>
            man holds an office being indebted to the state, and the <lb/>
            judges shall bring the parties informed against into court <lb/>
            according to law, or they shall lose their promotion to the <lb/>
            Areopagus, for putting down the amendment of the laws. <lb/>
            Before the assembly any Athenian that pleases shall write <lb/>
            out the laws which he proposes, and expose them before the <lb/>
            statues of the heroes, so that, according to the number of <lb/>
            the proposed laws, the people may determine what time shall <lb/>
            be allowed for the law-revisors : and whosoever proposes a <lb/>
            new law shall write it on a white board and expose it <lb/>
            before the statues of the heroes every day until the assembly <lb/>
            is held. And the people shall, on the eleventh day of the <lb/>
            month Hecatombæon, elect five men from the whole body of <lb/>
            Athenian citizens, to defend the laws proposed to be repealed <lb/>
            before the law-revisors."</p>
          <p>All these laws have been established for a long period, men <lb/>
            of the jury, and have often proved themselves to be of prac­ <lb/>
            tical advantage, and no man ever questioned their wisdom; <lb/>
            at which I am not surprised ; for they command nothing <lb/>
            which is cruel or oppressive or tyrannical, but, on the <lb/>
            contrary, prescribe everything to be done in a fair and con­ <lb/>
            stitutional manner. In the first place, they give you the 25 <lb/>
            power of deciding whether a new law ought to be introduced, <lb/>
            or whether the established laws are, in your opinion, suffi­ <lb/>
             <pb n="8"/>
            cient. Secondly, if you vote for the introduction of a law, <lb/>
            they do not order it to be passed immediately, but appoint <lb/>
            the third assembly; and not even in this have they given <lb/>
            permission to pass the law, but only to consider on what <lb/>
            terms you will appoint the session of the law-revisors. In <lb/>
            that interval they require those who wish to introduce the <lb/>
            laws to expose them before the statues of the heroes, so that <lb/>
            whoever pleases may examine them, and, if he discover any­ <lb/>
            thing inexpedient for you, may inform you of it, and oppose <lb/>
            it at his leisure. Not one of all these conditions has the <lb/>
            defendant Timocrates performed : he neither exposed the law <lb/>
            to view, nor gave those that liked the opportunity to read <lb/>
            and oppose it, nor waited for any of the periods prescribed <lb/>
            in the laws; but when the assembly, in which you voted <lb/>
            upon the laws, was the eleventh of Hecatombæon, he brought <lb/>
            in his law upon the twelfth, the very next day, (although it <lb/>
            was the festival of Saturn, and the council therefore was <lb/>
            adjourned,) having, in conjunction with persons who mean no <lb/>
            good to you, contrived that law-revisors should sit under a <lb/>
            decree, upon a pretence of the Panathenæa. I will read you <lb/>
            the decree itself which was passed, to show you that they did <lb/>
            all these things by arrangement, and none of them by chance. <lb/>
            Take you the decree, and read it to them.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>"In the first presidency, to wit, that of the Pandionian <lb/>
            tribe, on the eleventh day thereof Epicrates moved : In <lb/>
            order that the sacrifices may be offered, that the ways and <lb/>
            means may be sufficient, and whatever is wanting for the <lb/>
            Panathenæa may be supplied, let the presidents of the Pan­ <lb/>
            dionian tribe impanel law-revisors to-morrow, and let the <lb/>
            law-revisors be a thousand and one in number, selected from <lb/>
            those who have taken the oath, and let the council be asso­ <lb/>
            ciated with them in the revision."</p>
          <p>Observe, in the reading of the decree,1 how artfully the <lb/>
            , framer of it, under pretext of financial arrangements and the <lb/>
            wants of the festival, without adverting to the time prescribed <lb/>
            by law, puts in a clause for proceeding with the revision <note type="footnote"> 1 I adhere to the reading of Bekker, notwithstanding that it is <lb/>
            disapproved by so many commentators. It is a loose way of saying, <lb/>
            If Observe how artfully it appears from the decree that," &amp;c. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="9"/>
            to-morrow; assuredly, from no desire to increase the splen­ <lb/>
            dour of the festival, (for nothing was omitted or unprovided <lb/>
            for,) but in order that this statute, which is now upon its <lb/>
            trial, might be passed and become law without any mortal <lb/>
            having notice or making opposition. Here is the proofs <lb/>
            When the law-revisors were sitting, no law good or bad was <lb/>
            brought in by any man concerning the matters specified, the <lb/>
            ways and means and the Panathenæa; but concerning matters <lb/>
            on which the decree did not require legislation and the laws <lb/>
            forbid it, Timocrates, the defendant, passed his law without <lb/>
            the least disturbance. The time named in his decree he held <lb/>
            to be more binding than the time mentioned in the laws; <lb/>
            and, while you were all enjoying a holiday, and though there <lb/>
            is a law to do no wrong to one another either in public or in <lb/>
            private at such a period, and to transact no business which <lb/>
            does not relate to the festival, he did not scruple (as I shall <lb/>
            show you) to inflict an injury, not upon a chance individual, <lb/>
            but upon the whole commonwealth. Is it not shameful that1 <lb/>
            a man, who knew the statutes, which you have all just heard, <lb/>
            to be in force-who knew also of another statute declaring <lb/>
            that no decree, even though it be legal, shall be of greater <lb/>
            force than a law—should frame and propose to you a law in <lb/>
            pursuance of a decree, which itself he knew to have been <lb/>
            illegally moved ? Is it not cruel, that, when the state has <lb/>
            secured us all against the suffering of wrongs or grievances <lb/>
            at this period by the institution of a holiday, she should her­ <lb/>
            self have obtained no such security against Timocrates, but <lb/>
            have suffered on this very holiday the most grievous wrong ? <lb/>
            For how could a private individual more deeply have injured <lb/>
            the state, than by overthrowing the laws by which she is <lb/>
            governed 1</p>
          <p>That the defendant has done none of the things which he: <lb/>
            was bound to do, and which the laws require, you may know <lb/>
            by what I have already said. His offence however does not <lb/>
            consist in this only, that he transgressed the time prescribed <lb/>
            by the law, and destroyed the possibility of your deliberating <lb/>
            and considering about these matters, by proceeding with <lb/>
            his legislation during a holiday; but it consists further in <lb/>
            this, that he has introduced a statute repugnant to all the <lb/>
            existing statutes, as I will show you plainly in a few minutes. <lb/>
            Take and read me first this statute, which expressly forbids <lb/>
             <pb n="10"/>
            the introduction of any repugnant law, and, if such a one be <lb/>
            introduced, requires that it should be indicted.1 Read.</p>

            <title type="sub">THE LAW.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>" It shall not be lawful to repeal any of the established laws, <lb/>
            except at the session of the law-revisors ; and then any <lb/>
            Athenian that pleases shall be at liberty to repeal a law, pro­ <lb/>
            posing another in its stead. And the committee of council <lb/>
            shall put the question upon such laws, first upon the esta­ <lb/>
            blished law, whether the people of Athens approve of it or <lb/>
            not; and afterwards upon the proposed law. And whichever <lb/>
            the law-revisors shall vote in favour of, that one shall be in <lb/>
            force. And no one shall be at liberty to propose a law con­ <lb/>
            trary to any of the established laws. And if any one, having <lb/>
            repealed any of the established laws, pass another in its stead <lb/>
            not expedient for the people of Athens, or contrary to any of <lb/>
            the established laws, an indictment shall lie against him, <lb/>
            according to the statute provided in case of a person pro­ <lb/>
            posing an improper law."</p>
          <p>You have heard the statute. Among many wise laws <lb/>
            which the state possesses, there is none, I think, which has <lb/>
            been framed more admirably than this. Only observe, how <lb/>
            just, how favourable to the people its provisions are. It <lb/>
            forbids the introduction of a law contrary to the existing <lb/>
            laws, without repealing the one first established. Why ? <lb/>
            First, that you may be able to give a just verdict with a safe <lb/>
            conscience. For if there were two inconsistent laws, and any <note type="footnote"> 1 The policy of the Athenian lawgiver was not to allow two incon­ <lb/>
            sistent lawn to remain together in his code; and there was no such <lb/>
            thing among the Athenians as the repealing of a statute by implication. <lb/>
            In the multiplicity of our modern Acts of Parliament, it has not <lb/>
            unfrequently occurred, that an enactment has been passed at variance <lb/>
            with some previous one, of which it makes no mention, or which, at all <lb/>
            events, it does not expressly repeal The rule then is, that, if the <lb/>
            negative of the first is necessarily implied, the second operates as a <lb/>
            repeal of the first. For example, where a statute imposed a fine of <lb/>
            100l. and three months' imprisonment for seducing artificers, and a <lb/>
            subsequent statute inflicted a penalty of 500l. and twelve months' <lb/>
            imprisonment for the same offence, it was decided that the former was <lb/>
            virtually repealed by the latter. The English courts lean against such <lb/>
            constructive repeals, and strive, if possible, to reconcile two apparently <lb/>
            conflicting statutes. If the repugnancy however cannot be got over, <lb/>
            then the rule prevails, leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="11"/>
            parties came to trial before you, either on a public or a <lb/>
            private question, and each of them claimed the verdict, pro­ <lb/>
            ducing a different law, you could not, of course, decide in <lb/>
            favour of both ; that is impossible : nor could you decide for <lb/>
            either one of them with due regard to your oaths; for <lb/>
            such decision violates the repugnant law, which is equally <lb/>
            valid with the other. Against such a mischief the legislator <lb/>
            provided by this clause. But he had a further motive in it. <lb/>
            He wished to make you guardians of the laws; for he knew <lb/>
            that the other safeguards which he has provided for them <lb/>
            there are various ways of eluding. The public advocates, <lb/>
            whom you appoint, may be persuaded to hold their tongues. <lb/>
            He requires the laws to be exposed to view, that all men <lb/>
            may have notice. It may possibly happen that persons who <lb/>
            would oppose them remain in ignorance, without some pre­ <lb/>
            vious notice, while persons who pay no attention to the <lb/>
            subject read them. But, it may be said, every man may <lb/>
            indict a law, as I have done now. Yes; but, if a man gets <lb/>
            rid of the prosecutor, the state is still cheated. What then is <lb/>
            the only proper and firm safeguard of the laws ? You, the <lb/>
            people : for no man can deprive you of the power of judging <lb/>
            and testing what is right; no man can by deceit or cor­ <lb/>
            ruption persuade you to pass the worse law instead of the <lb/>
            better. On these accounts, the legislator blocks up all the <lb/>
            paths of injustice, checking the evil-disposed, and not letting <lb/>
            them stir a step. All these wise and righteous enactments <lb/>
            Timocrates cancelled and expunged, as far as it lay in his <lb/>
            power, and introduced a law contrary, I may say, to all the <lb/>
            existing laws, not reading one in comparison with it, not <lb/>
            repealing the opposite, not giving you a choice between <lb/>
            them, not performing any other of the legal requisites.</p>
          <p>That he has become amenable then to the indictment by <lb/>
            having brought in a law repugnant to the existing laws, I <lb/>
            imagine you are all convinced. To show you what sort of a <lb/>
            law he has introduced, and what sort of laws he has violated, <lb/>
            the usher shall first read you the defendant's law, and then <lb/>
            the others, with which it is inconsistent. Read.</p>

            the day on which it was passed."</p>
          <p>Admirable as were the existing laws, men of the jury, the <lb/>
            law which has just been read defined (as it were) and con­ <lb/>
            firmed them. For it declares that every one shall come into <lb/>
            force from the day when it was passed, except where a date is <lb/>
            expressly mentioned, and then it shall commence from the <lb/>
            prescribed date. Why so! Because to many statutes a clause <lb/>
            had been annexed, " that the act should come into operation <lb/>
            in the archonship succeeding the present." The person <lb/>
            therefore who afterwards proposed this law which has been <lb/>
            read, framing it at a later period, thought it not right that <lb/>
            statutes which themselves contained a postponing clause <lb/>
            should be carried back to the day of their enactment, and <lb/>
            made to come in force before their respective authors desired. <lb/>
            See how contrary to this law is the one which the defendant <lb/>
            has passed. The one declares, that the prescribed date, or <lb/>
            the day of enactment, shall be the starting point: Timocrates <lb/>
            inserts a clause, " if any person has been condemned," refer­ <lb/>
            ring to past transactions; and even this he does not limit, by <lb/>
            naming any archonship as the term of commencement, but <lb/>
            has made his law come in force not only before the day of its <lb/>
            enactment, but before any of us were born; for he has taken <lb/>
            in the whole of the past indefinitely. You ought, Timocrates, <lb/>
            either never to have framed your law, or to have repealed <lb/>
            the other; not to have thrown everything into confusion, to <lb/>

          <p>Here is another law, forbidding any speech concerning dis­ <lb/>

            remission of their debts or for composition, unless liberty has <lb/>
            been granted, and that by the votes of not less than six <lb/>
            thousand persons. The defendant frames an express clause, <lb/>
            that, if any debtor has been condemned to imprisonment, he <lb/>
            shall have his release upon finding persons to be his bail, <lb/>
            without there having been any proposal or any liberty of <lb/>
            speech granted in that behalf. And the law, even when a <lb/>
            man has obtained permission, does not allow him to proceed <lb/>
            as he pleases, but in such manner as the council and the <lb/>
            people approve : Timocrates was not content with a simple <lb/>
            breach of law, in speaking and introducing a bill upon these <lb/>
            matters without leave, but he went further, and, without <lb/>
            saying a word upon the subject to the council or the people, <lb/>
            introduced a law irregularly and clandestinely, after the <lb/>
            council had broken up, and while the rest of the people were <lb/>
            taking a holiday on account of the festival. It was your <lb/>
            business, Timocrates, knowing this law which I have read, if <lb/>
            you wished to do what was right, first to petition the council <lb/>
            for an audience, then to bring the matter before the assembly, <lb/>
            and, in the event of all the Athenians giving it their sanction, <lb/>
            to draw up and propose your bill; but even then you should <lb/>
            have waited the time prescribed by the laws. Proceeding <lb/>
            thus, even had any one attempted to show that your bill was <lb/>
            injurious to the state, you would at all events have been <lb/>
            thought, not to have any sinister design, but to have erred <lb/>
            in judgment only. Now, by your clandestinely and hastily <lb/>
            and illegally, I will not say passing, but foisting your law into <lb/>
            the statute-book, you have deprived yourself of all excuse; <lb/>
            for those are excusable who err unintentionally, not those <lb/>
            who have nourished evil designs, as you are plainly shown to <lb/>
            have done. However, I will speak of this presently. Now <lb/>

            who petitions before he has paid the fiue, an information <lb/>

            party amerced, or for any other person on his behalf, before <lb/>
            he has paid the debt, such member shall be disfranchised."</p>
          <p>It would be a tedious thing, men of the jury, if I dwelt <lb/>
            upon every law to which the defendant's is repugnant; yet if <lb/>
            there is any one worth discussion, this one is which he has <lb/>
            just read. For the author of this law, men of Athens, knew <lb/>
            your humane and lenient disposition, and saw that by reason <lb/>
            of it you had on many occasions before then submitted to <lb/>
            serious losses. Wishing therefore to leave no excuse for the <lb/>
            miscarriage of the public interests, he did not choose that <lb/>
            persons who by legal verdict and judgment had been con­ <lb/>
            victed of misconduct should avail themselves of your good <lb/>
            nature, and have the advantage of petitioning and suppli­ <lb/>
            cating you in their distress; but positively forbade either the <lb/>
            party himself or any one else to petition or speak upon such <lb/>
            a matter, making it imperative to do justice in silence. If <lb/>
            you were asked now, for which persons you would be more <lb/>
            likely to do anything, for those who asked a favour, or those <lb/>
            who gave a command, I am sure you would say, for those <lb/>
            who asked a favour; for this is the part of kind-hearted men, <lb/>
            the other that of cowards. Well: all laws command what is <lb/>
            needful to be done; petitioners ask it as a favour. If then <lb/>
            it is forbidden to petition, could it be allowed to introduce a <lb/>
            law, which implies command ? I should think not. It would <lb/>
            be shameful, if, in cases where you have deemed it right to <lb/>
            abstain even from acts of grace, the purposes of certain <lb/>
            persons might be accomplished against your will.</p>

          <p>Timocrates, as if he were drawing a deposition to prove his <lb/>

            deal with the matter in his behalf, so that the decision of the <lb/>

            requires the committee of council, if any one puts in bail, <lb/>

          <p>It allows no law to be proposed unless it be the same for <lb/>

            that he had proposed a law not applying to all, when he <lb/>
            inserted a clause excepting from the operation of his law <lb/>
            the farmers of taxes and lessees of the revenue and their sure­ <lb/>
            ties. When there are persons whom you exclude, you cannot <lb/>

            Although a privilegium strictly so called, that is, a law applying to one <lb/>
            or more individuals, is not allowable, there may be a privilegium <lb/>
            applying to a class, if passed by six thousand citizens voting by ballot. <lb/>
            For example, a law could not be passed that Androtion should <unclear>je</unclear> <lb/>
            released on bail; but a law might (with the requisite assent) be <lb/>
            enacted, that a certain class of persons, to whom Androtion belonged, <lb/>
            ex. gr. state debtors under sentence of imprisonment, should be released <lb/>
            on bail </note><note type="footnote"> Some commentators however have thought the text to be corrupt. <lb/>
            (See the Apparatus Criticus.) Petit's reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐὰν μὴ ψηφισαμένων</foreign> makes <lb/>
            it agree with Andocides De Mysteriis, 87. (See the Oration against <lb/>
            Aristocrates, Vol. iii. page 195.) But who can say whether one or other <lb/>
            of the orators does not misquote the law? The text, as it stands, better <lb/>

            this, that of all persons who are condemned to imprisonment <lb/>
            the farmers of taxes are the greatest or most heinous offenders, <lb/>
            and therefore you excluded them alone from the benefit of <lb/>
            the law. For surely those commit much greater offences, who <lb/>
            betray any of the public interests, or who ill-use their parents, <lb/>
            or who enter without pure hands into the market-place ; to <lb/>
            all of whom the existing laws denounce imprisonment, while <lb/>
            yours gives them a release. But here again you disclose the <lb/>
            parties in whose favour you proposed the law : for, because <lb/>
            their debt occurred, not from a farming of taxes, but from <lb/>
            peculation, or rather from plunder, therefore, I imagine, you <lb/>
            did not care about the farmers of the taxes.</p>
          <p>Many other excellent laws might be cited, to all of which <lb/>
            the defendant's law is repugnant. But perhaps, if I touched <lb/>
            upon them all, I should be pushed out of the argument, that <lb/>
            this law is altogether injurious to the state; and you will <lb/>
            equally consider it indictable, if it be repugnant to only one <lb/>
            of the existing laws. What course then shall I take ? I will <lb/>
            pass by the other laws, and-first noticing one which Timo­ <lb/>
            crates himself formerly passed—I will proceed to that part <lb/>
            of the accusation, in which I undertake to show that his law, <lb/>
            if confirmed, will be highly detrimental to the commonwealth. <lb/>
            Now to have introduced a law contrary to the laws of other <lb/>
            men, is a grave offence, yet it requires another party for <lb/>
            accuser; but for a man to legislate in contradiction to a law <lb/>
            passed by himself, this makes him his own accuser. That <lb/>
            you may see this is the case, he shall read you the very law <lb/>

            convicted, the Heliaatic tribunal shall impose such penalty, <lb/>
             <pb n="19"/>
            corporal or pecuniary, as they consider him to deserve; and, <lb/>
            if sentenced to a pecuniary penalty, he shall be imprisoned <lb/>
            until he has paid whatsoever sum he was condemned to pay."</p>

          <p>" And if sentenced to a pecuniary penalty, he shall be im­ <lb/>
            prisoned until he has paid—"</p>
          <p>Enough. Is it possible to propose two more opposite <lb/>
            enactments than these?—that convicted persons shall be <lb/>
            kept in prison until they have paid, and that the same per­ <lb/>
            sons shall give bail and not be put in prison ? Well: this <lb/>
            charge is brought against Timocrates by Timocrates, not by <lb/>
            Diodorus, nor by any other of his countrymen, numerous as <lb/>
            they are. But what temptation do you think a man could <lb/>
            resist, or what would he scruple to do for lucre's sake, who has <lb/>
            thought proper to legislate at variance with himself, when <lb/>
            variance even with others is prohibited by law ? Such a man, <lb/>
            as it appears to me, is impudent enough to do anything. As <lb/>
            therefore the laws command, that malefactors of other kinds, <lb/>
            who confess, should be punished without trial; so, men of <lb/>
            Athens, when you have caught the defendant playing foul tricks <lb/>
            with the laws, you ought to find him guilty without allowing <lb/>
            him to speak or to be heard : for he has confessed his crime <lb/>
            by proposing this law at variance with the other which he <lb/>
            passed before.</p>
          <p>That his law is inconsistent with those just cited, and with <lb/>
            those before mentioned, and, I may almost say, with every <lb/>
            law of the country, is plain, I imagine, to you all. I wonder, <lb/>
            indeed, what he can possibly venture to say upon the point. <lb/>
            He will not be able to show that his law is not contrary to <lb/>
            the other laws; nor can he persuade you that he overlooked <lb/>
            it through inexperience, being no politician; for he has been <lb/>
            seen long ago both framing decrees and introducing laws for <lb/>
            hire. Nor yet is this course open to him, to confess that the <lb/>
            thing is a crime and ask for pardon ; for he is shown to have <lb/>
            proposed his law not unintentionally, not in behalf of the <lb/>
            unfortunate, not for relations and connexions of his own; but <lb/>
            intentionally, and in behalf of persons who had grievously <lb/>
            injured you, and who were in no way related to him, unless <lb/>
            he means to say that he regards his hirers as relations. <note type="footnote"> 02 </note> <pb n="20"/>
            </p>
          <p>I shall now proceed to show, that he has introduced a law <lb/>
            not suitable or advantageous to the commonwealth. You <lb/>
            will all agree, I take it, that a law, to be good and useful to the <lb/>
            multitude, should, in the first place, be framed simply and <lb/>
            intelligibly to all, and it should be impossible for one man to <lb/>
            put this construction upon it, and another that; secondly, <lb/>
            what is to be done by virtue of the law should be practicable; <lb/>
            for, however well drawn, if it prescribed anything impossible, <lb/>
            it would perform the work of a prayer, not of a law. In <lb/>
            addition to this, it should plainly appear that it allows no <lb/>
            indulgence to wrong-doers. If any one thinks it is a feature <lb/>
            of a popular government for the laws to be mild, let him <lb/>
            consider to what persons they should be mild; and, if he <lb/>
            takes the right view, he will see they should be mild to <lb/>
            persons about to be tried, not to persons who have been coin­ <lb/>
            victed ; for, in the former case, it is uncertain whether a man <lb/>
            has not been unjustly calumniated, whereas the latter can no <lb/>
            longer deny that they are rogues. Of the qualities which I <lb/>
            have just mentioned, you will see that the law of Timocrates <lb/>
            does not possess a single one, but exactly the opposite. This <lb/>
            may be shown in many ways, but most clearly by going <lb/>
            through the articles of the law itself; for it is not good in <lb/>
            one part and faulty in another; but from the beginning, from <lb/>
            the first syllable to the last, it is framed entirely to your <lb/>
            prejudice. Take the indictment, and read them the statute <lb/>
            as far as the first clause. That will be the easiest way for <lb/>
            me to show, and for you to catch, what I mean.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>" In the first presidency, to wit, that of the Pandionian <lb/>
            tribe, on the twelfth day thereof, Aristocles of Myrrhinus, of <lb/>
            the committee of council, put the question, Timocrates <lb/>
            moved : If any of the persons who are indebted to the state <lb/>
            has been or shall hereafter be condemned, pursuant to a law <lb/>
            or to a decree, to suffer the penalty of imprisonment, it shall <lb/>
            be lawful for him, or for another person on his behalf, to put <lb/>
            in such bail—"</p>
          <p>Stop. You shall read clause by clause by and by.</p>
          <p>This, men of the jury, is about the most shameful of all <lb/>
            the articles in the statute. I believe no other man, intro­ <lb/>
            ducing a law for the purpose of its being used by his fellow- <lb/>
             <pb n="21"/>
            citizens, would dare to rescind the judgments which have <lb/>
            been pronounced according to the pre-existing laws. Yet <lb/>
            Timocrates, the defendant, has done this, impudently and <lb/>
            without the least disguise; for he says expressly, " If any <lb/>
            of the persons who are indebted to the state has been or <lb/>
            shall hereafter be condemned, pursuant to a law or a decree, <lb/>
            to suffer the penalty of imprisonment." If he had only <lb/>
            advised what was proper with respect to future cases, he <lb/>
            would have done no wrong; but to introduce a law to rescind <lb/>
            what a court of justice has decided, and what is definitively <lb/>
            settled-is not this shameful conduct ? As if a man, after <lb/>
            suffering the defendant's law to be confirmed, were to frame <lb/>
            another to the effect following:—" If any persons, having <lb/>
            become debtors, and having been condemned to the penalty <lb/>
            of imprisonment, have put in bail according to the law, they <lb/>
            shall not have the benefit of their bail, nor shall it hereafter <lb/>
            be lawful to release any person on baiL" No sane man, I <lb/>
            take it, would do this ; and Timocrates, in doing what he did, <lb/>
            committed a wrong. He ought, if he deemed the thing good, <lb/>
            to have proposed his law in reference to the future; not to <lb/>
            mix up future offences with past, certain with uncertain, and <lb/>
            then prescribe the same judgment for all. Is it not shocking <lb/>
            to award the same measure of justice to persons convicted of <lb/>
            former crimes against the state, and to persons of whom it is <lb/>
            not known whether they will ever do anything worthy of trial 1</p>
          <p>You may see in another way, how shamefully he has acted <lb/>
            in passing a retrospective law, if you will only reflect what it <lb/>
            is that makes law differ from oligarchy, and how it comes <lb/>
            about that those who choose to be governed by laws are held <lb/>
            to be honest and independent and worthy people, while <lb/>
            those who live under oligarchies are unmanly and slavish. <lb/>
            You will find this the true and obvious explanation; that, <lb/>
            among people who live in oligarchies, every man has the <lb/>
            right1 both to undo what has been done, and to order what <note type="footnote"> 1 That is, there is no law to prevent him. What the orator says is <lb/>
            not to be understood (as Schäfer thinks) of the rulers only. Every <lb/>
            man has the right, if he can only enforce it. By putting it in this <lb/>
            way, the orator makes the contrast between oligarchy and democracy <lb/>
            the more striking. In the former there is no law, and therefore no <lb/>
            security either for the past or the future. Compare the argument in <lb/>
            the Leptinea, VoL iii. page 9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="22"/>
            he pleases for the future; whereas laws give direction of <lb/>
            what is necessary for the future, being enacted under the <lb/>
            persuasion that they will benefit those who live under them. <lb/>
            And yet Timocrates, legislating in a domocratical state, car­ <lb/>
            ried into his law the iniquity of an oligarchy, and thought <lb/>
            proper to assume over the past a power greater than that of <lb/>
            the convicting jurors.</p>
          <p>Nor is his arrogance confined to this. He goes on to say, <lb/>
            " or if any one shall hereafter be condemned to the penalty <lb/>
            of imprisonment, it shall be lawful for him, on putting in bail <lb/>
            as security for payment, to be released." He ought, if he <lb/>
            regarded imprisonment as a cruel thing, to have enacted, that <lb/>
            no man who offers bail to you shall be sentenced to imprison­ <lb/>
            ment ; not to give him his discharge on bail when he finds <lb/>
            your sentence of imprisonment already passed, and a bad <lb/>
            feeling excited against you in the convicted party. He intro­ <lb/>
            duced his law in this ostentatious manner, as if to show that <lb/>
            he would release people though you had thought fit to im­ <lb/>
            prison them. Does any one think a law beneficial to the <lb/>
            commonwealth, which is to overrule the judgment of a legal <lb/>
            tribunal, and which will require persons not on their oaths to <lb/>
            rescind the verdicts of sworn jurors? I believe no one dues. <lb/>
            Well then; both these consequences, it is plain, are involved <lb/>
            in the defendant's law; therefore, if each of you has a regard <lb/>
            for the constitution, if you think that effect should be given <lb/>
            to your verdicts upon matters which you have decided upon <lb/>
            oath, you must repeal a law of this description, and not suffer <lb/>
            it to receive confirmation now.</p>
          <p>He was not content with invalidating the penal sentences of <lb/>
            the courts. You will find that even the regulations which he <lb/>
            himself made in his law, the terms which he imposed upon <lb/>
            the condemned parties, even these he has not framed simply <lb/>
            or honestly, but just as a man would do who was most anxious <lb/>
            to cheat and delude you. Only see how he has drawn them <lb/>
            up. " Timocrates moved "-it says—" If any of the persons <lb/>
            who are indebted to the state has been or shall hereafter be <lb/>
            condemned, pursuant to a law or to a decree, to suffer the <lb/>
            penalty of imprisonment, it shall be lawful for him, or for <lb/>
            another person on his behalf, to put in such bail as the people <lb/>
            shall approve, to be security for payment." Mark where he <lb/>
            jumps to from the court and the sentence. To the people <lb/>
             <pb n="23"/>
            stealing off the guilty party, and preventing his delivery to <lb/>
            the Eleven. For what magistrate will deliver up the debtor ? <lb/>
            which of the Eleven will receive him—when this statute <lb/>
            orders that he shall put in bail before the people, and it is <lb/>
            impossible that there should be an assembly and a court at <lb/>
            once on the same day, and it nowhere directs that he shall <lb/>
            be kept in custody until he has put in bail ? What possible <lb/>
            objection could there be to his inserting this express clause <lb/>
            —" and the magistrate shall keep the condemned party in <lb/>
            custody until he has put in his bail"? Was it not a just <lb/>
            provision ? I am sure you will all say it was. But was it <lb/>
            contrary to any law ? No: it would have been the only <lb/>
            legal clause in the statute. What was the reason then? <lb/>
            Only one can be found: his object was, not that parties <lb/>
            whom you condemn should pay the penalty, but that they <lb/>
            should escape.</p>
          <p>How does it go on after that ? " He shall put in bail to <lb/>
            be security for payment of the sum which he owed." Here <lb/>
            again, he has filched away the decuple of the sacred monies, <lb/>
            and the half of the public, in all cases where the double is <lb/>
            given by the law.1 How does he do that ? By saying, in­ <lb/>
            stead of " the penalty," "the sum," and instead of "which <lb/>
            becomes due," " which he owed." What is the difference ? <lb/>
            If it had been " he shall put in bail to be security for pay­ <lb/>
            ment of the sum which becomes due," he would have com­ <lb/>
            prehended the laws by virtue of which some of the debts are <lb/>
            decupled and some doubled; so that the debtors would have <lb/>
            been legally compelled both to pay the amount sued for,2 and <lb/>
            to satisfy the penalties accruing by law. Now however, by <lb/>
            saying that the bail shall be put in " to be security for pay­ <lb/>
            ment of the sum which he owed," he fixes the payment <lb/>
            according to the plaint and written charge, upon which the <lb/>
            party was brought to trial, in which the simple sum which <lb/>
            a man owed is always inserted.</p>
          <p>Again, after having knocked off so much by the change of <lb/>
            words, he adds—" and the committee of council are hereby <lb/>
            required to take the votes of the assembly when any one <note type="footnote"> 1 See my articles Epibole, Practores, Tamias, &amp;c. in the Archæo­ <lb/>
            logical Dictionary. And, for further information, the parts of Boeck's <lb/>
            Public Economy of Athens there referred to. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Τὸ γεγραμμένον</foreign>, the sum set down in the plaint or written charge. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="24"/>
            wishes to put in bail;" thinking it right throughout the <lb/>
            whole of the statute to save the guilty party who has been <lb/>
            convicted before you. For, by allowing him to put in bail <lb/>
            when he pleases, he has put it in his power never to pay or go <lb/>
            to prison. For who won't provide men of straw, and after <lb/>
            their rejection by you take himself off Should any one <lb/>
            insist upon his going to prison for not putting in the bail, he <lb/>
            will assert that he does put them in, and means to put them <lb/>
            in, and he will produce the defendant's law, which orders that <lb/>
            he may put in bail when he chooses, and does not say, he <lb/>
            shall be kept in custody in the meantime, or require him to <lb/>
            be imprisoned if you reject the bail, but is really a sort of <lb/>
            preservative to people who wish to do wrong.</p>
          <p>" And the person who has given bail," he says, " if he pays <lb/>
            to the state the money for which he gave the bail, shall be <lb/>
            released from imprisonment." Here again he persisted in the <lb/>
            artifice which I mentioned just now, and did not forget it, <lb/>
            enacting that the party should be released from imprison­ <lb/>
            ment, not if he paid the penalty which became due, but if <lb/>
            he paid the money which he owed.</p>
          <p>" But if neither he nor his bail shall have paid the money <lb/>
            in the ninth presidency, the party released on bail shall be <lb/>
            imprisoned, and the property of the bail shall be confiscated." <lb/>
            In this last clause it will manifestly appear that he charges <lb/>
            himself with injustice. For he forbade imprisonment, not <lb/>
            because he thought generally that it was a shameful or shock­ <lb/>
            ing thing for any citizen to be imprisoned, but after robbing <lb/>
            you of the opportunity when you might catch the guilty <lb/>
            party, he left to you, the injured parties, the name of redress, <lb/>
            but took away the reality. And he gave a discharge against <lb/>
            your will to persons who retain your money by force, and all <lb/>
            but inserted a clause, that it should be lawful for the party <lb/>
            to commence an action against the jurors who inflicted the <lb/>
            penalty of imprisonment.</p>
          <p>What, among all the shameful clauses of the statute, is <note type="footnote"> 1 " Calumniatorem agere videtur orator. Neque enim liberabitur. <lb/>
            nisi approbatis a populo vadibus ex lege Timocratis."—Wolf. Assuming <lb/>
            that, according to the true construction of the statute, bail might be <lb/>
            offered more than once; still, after failing to justify bail, the party <lb/>
            would have to go to prison in the meantime, until he found other <lb/>
            Mail. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="25"/>
            most deserving of indignation, I am about to tell you. <lb/>
            Throughout the whole of the law all his provisions are for <lb/>
            one who has put in bail, but for a person who has not put in <lb/>
            any bail either good or bad, and who does not pay you any <lb/>
            regard whatever, he has prescribed no penalty or punishment, <lb/>
            but has created the most complete impunity that can be.1 <lb/>
            For example, the time which he has appointed, the ninth <lb/>
            presidency, he gives to the person who has put in bail. You <lb/>
            may see from this—He proceeds to say, that the property <lb/>
            of the bail shall be confiscated, if the debt is not paid; but <lb/>
            of course there can be no bail of a person who has not put <lb/>
            them in. And while he has obliged the committee of council, <lb/>
            who are chosen by lot from the people, to receive the bail <lb/>
            when any one offers them, he imposes no obligation upon <lb/>
            the public offenders, but, as if they were benefactors, gives <lb/>
            them the choice whether they will be punished or not.</p>
          <p>How can there be a law more inexpedient for you or more <lb/>
            objectionable than this-which, as regards the judgments of <lb/>
            past time, puts a veto on what you have decided, and, as <lb/>
            regards those of the future, while it orders sworn jurors to <lb/>
            inflict penalties, deprives those penalties of their validity; <lb/>
            and, in addition to this, gives their franchise to debtors who <lb/>
            do not satisfy their obligations; in short, exhibits you as <lb/>
            persons whose oaths, whose assessments, whose verdicts, whose <lb/>
            punishments, all of whose acts are ineffectual ? For my part, <lb/>
            I think that if Critias, he of the Thirty, had introduced the <lb/>
            law, he would not have framed it in any other manner.</p>
          <p>That the law deranges our whole political system, that it <lb/>
            overturns everything, and strips the commonwealth of many <lb/>
            of her honours; of this too I think you will easily be con­ <lb/>
            vinced. Of course you know that our state often owes her <lb/>
            safety to her expeditions by land and sea, and you have ere <lb/>
            now performed many glorious exploits either in rescuing <lb/>
            people or punishing or mediating. Well: these things you <lb/>
            can only carry out by means of laws and decrees, imposing <lb/>
            on some the burthen of contributions, requiring some men <lb/>
            to take command of ships, some to go on board, others to <note type="footnote"> 1 This objection is more clearly captious than the former one which <lb/>

            you impanel juries and pass sentence of imprisonment upon <lb/>
            the refractory. 'Only see how this fine fellow's law mars and <lb/>

            then will there be 1 in what manner will the forces be sent <lb/>
            off ? How shall we levy our monies, if every debtor gives <lb/>
            bail according to the defendant's law, instead of doing his <lb/>
            duty ? We shall say, I suppose, to the Greeks—" we have a <lb/>
            law of Timocrates: wait for the ninth presidency; then we <lb/>
            will start." That's the only thing left. But, should you be <lb/>
            called upon to arm in your own defence; think ye that the <lb/>
            enemy will wait the tricks and subterfuges of the miscreants <lb/>
            here? or that the commonwealth, if she passes laws which <lb/>
            embarrass her and are contrary to her interests, will be in a <lb/>
            condition to do aught that she should do ? We may be glad, <lb/>
            men of Athens, if, with everything going right, and without <lb/>
            any such law as this, we can get the upper hand of our <lb/>
            enemies, keep pace with sudden emergencies,1 meet the occa­ <lb/>
            sions of war, and never be behindhand. If it appears that <lb/>
            you have proposed a law destroying the means by which our <lb/>
            commonwealth has become respected and honoured among <lb/>
            all men, do you not deserve to suffer any punishment that <lb/>
            can be devised ?</p>
          <p>Further, men of Athens, he ruins our finances, both sacred <lb/>
            and civil. I will show you how. You have a law in force- <lb/>
            there is not a better existing-that those who have in their <lb/>
            hands any money belonging to the temples or the treasury <lb/>
            shall pay it into the council-chamber, or, if not, the council <lb/>
            shall get it from them under the statutes which relate to the <lb/>
            farmers of taxes. By means of this law the public revenue <lb/>
            is administered. Through this the money which is spent <lb/>
            upon the assemblies, the sacrifices, the council, the cavalry, <lb/>
            and other things, is provided beforehand. For, as the pro- <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ταῖς ὀξύτησι</foreign> is differently understood by Auger: " de pouvoir, par <lb/>

            ceeds of the taxes are not sufficient for the administration, <lb/>
            the extras (as we call them) are paid through the fear of this <lb/>
            law. What then can prevent the whole government being <lb/>
            overturned, when the income of the taxes is not sufficient for <lb/>
            the administration, but there is a large deficit, which cannot <lb/>
            be made up till towards the close of the year, and the council <lb/>
            and the courts are not authorized to send to prison those who <lb/>
            make default in the extras, but they put in bail till the ninth <lb/>
            presidency ? What shall we do during the eight presidencies 1 <lb/>
            Tell us, Timocrates. Shall we cease to meet and deliberate <lb/>
            in case of need ? Then shall we still be living under a free <lb/>
            government 1 Shall the courts civil and criminal not sit ? <lb/>
            And what security will there be for people who suffer wrong 1 <lb/>
            Shall the council not attend to transact their constitutional <lb/>
            business 1 And what remains for us but dissolution of the <lb/>
            government ? But perhaps we are to do these things without <lb/>
            pay. Would it not be monstrous that, through a law which <lb/>
            you have been paid to propose, the assembly and the council <lb/>
            and the courts should be unpaid ? Surely, Timocrates, you <lb/>
            ought to have inserted the clause which you did with respect <lb/>
            to the farmers of taxes and their sureties, that the state dues <lb/>
            should be recovered according to the existing laws, and, if in <lb/>
            any other law or decree it is provided that the debts of any <lb/>
            persons may be recovered in the same manner as those of the <lb/>
            farmers of taxes, that the debts of such persons also should <lb/>
            be recovered according to the existing laws. Now however, <lb/>
            carefully avoiding the laws of the tax-farmers, because the <lb/>
            decree of Euctemon has ordered that we may levy upon <lb/>
            judgment-debtors according to those laws, for this reason he <lb/>
            did not insert the clause which I refer to. And in such way, <lb/>
            by abolishing the existing punishment of defaulters to the <lb/>
            treasury, and not substituting another, he destroys every­ <lb/>
            thing, the popular assembly, the cavalry, the council, our <lb/>
            sacred and our civil revenue : in return for which, if you are <lb/>
            wise, men of Athens, you will inflict upon him such penalty <lb/>
            as he deserves, and make him an example to others not to <lb/>
            propose similar statutes.</p>
          <p>Not only does he disable the courts to enforce their penal <lb/>
            sentences; he goes further; he gives impunity to public <lb/>
            offenders, he ruins our military enterprises, he overturns our <lb/>
            financial system, he has by his law come to the rescue of <lb/>
             <pb n="28"/>
            malefactors, persons who strike their fathers and desert the <lb/>
            army; for he abolishes the punishments which by the laws <lb/>
            now in force are imposed. The laws enacted by Solon, a <lb/>
            legislator nothing like the defendant, declare that, if a man <lb/>
            be convicted of theft and sentence of death be not passed, a <lb/>
            cumulative penalty of imprisonment shall be imposed on <lb/>
            him, and, if any one, having been convicted of ill-treating his <lb/>
            parents, enter the market-place, he shall be imprisoned, and <lb/>
            if a man has been fined for desertion, and assumes any of <lb/>
            the privileges enjoyed by ordinary citizens, he also shall be <lb/>
            imprisoned. Timocrates creates an impunity for all such <lb/>
            persons; for by the putting in of bail he takes away impri­ <lb/>
            sonment. It appears to me therefore-it may seem some­ <lb/>
            what coarse, what I am about to say, yet I am resolved to <lb/>
            speak it out-he ought for this very reason to be sentenced to <lb/>
            death, that he may pass his law for the wicked in Hades, and <lb/>
            allow us who live upon earth to enjoy these righteous and <lb/>
            holy laws.</p>
          <p>Read these statutes. <lb/>
            The laws concerning theft: <lb/>
            The laws concerning ill-treatment of parents: <lb/>
            The laws concerning desertion :</p>
          <p>" If a man has recovered the article which he has lost, the <lb/>
            thief shall be condemned to pay the double value; if not, to <lb/>
            pay tenfold, besides the cumulative penalty; and he shall be <lb/>
            kept in the stocks five days and as many nights, if the <lb/>
            Heliastio tribunal shall have imposed such sentence. And <lb/>
            any person who likes may propose the additional penalty, <lb/>
            when the question of a penal sentence is before the court. <lb/>
            And if any one is taken off in custody after conviction for <lb/>
            ill-treatment of parents, or for desertion, or for entering <lb/>
            where he has no business to enter after notice of exclusion <lb/>
            from legal privileges, the Eleven shall put him in prison and <lb/>
            shall bring him before the Heliastic tribunal; and any one <lb/>
            that pleases, to whom such right belongs, may prosecute; <lb/>
            and if the party accused be convicted, the Heliastic tribunal <lb/>
            shall determine what penalty, corporal or pecuniary, he shall <lb/>
            suffer; and if he be sentenced to apecuniary penalty, he <lb/>
            shall be imprisoned until he has paid."</p>
          <p>Solon and Timocrates resemble each other as legislators, <lb/>

            don't they, men of Athens? The one improves both the <lb/>
            living and the unborn. The other shows to people who have <lb/>
            done evil a way to escape punishment, procures a license for <lb/>
            knavery as well for the unborn as for the living, gives in­ <lb/>
            demnity and security to the bad of every age. What punish­ <lb/>
            ment then can meet your case 1 what sentence can be severe <lb/>
            enough, when—I pass by other matters—you destroy the <lb/>
            protectors of old age, who compel children to maintain their <lb/>
            parents while they are alive, and secure to them the cus­ <lb/>
            tomary honours after death? How can one help regarding <lb/>
            you as the vilest of mankind, when, you abominable fellow, <lb/>
            it is shown that you set more value upon thieves and rogues <lb/>
            and deserters than upon your country, and on this account <lb/>
            propose laws to our prejudice ?</p>
          <p>I will now reckon up how I have performed what in the <lb/>
            beginning of my speech I promised. I said that I would <lb/>
            prove him to be in every way amenable to the indictment; <lb/>
            first, as legislating in a manner forbidden by the laws; <lb/>
            secondly, as having framed enactments repugnant to the <lb/>
            existing laws; and thirdly, for framing such as are in­ <lb/>
            jurious to the state. Well. You heard the laws, and what <lb/>
            they require a man proposing a new law to do; and again, <lb/>
            I showed you that the defendant did not comply with any of <lb/>
            their requisitions. Further, you heard the statutes, to which <lb/>
            the defendant's is shown to be repugnant; and you know <lb/>
            that he has passed this before repealing them. That his <lb/>
            statute is not a desirable one, you have undoubtedly heard ; <lb/>
            for I have just concluded that part of the argument. In <lb/>
            every way therefore it is plain that he has done wrong, in <lb/>
            everything has he been reckless and unscrupulous. Indeed <lb/>
            it seems to me that, had there been anything else prohibited <lb/>
            by the existing laws, besides what I have mentioned, he <lb/>
            would have done that likewise.</p>
          <p>That he framed this statute with evil design, that he com­ <lb/>
            mitted this offence deliberately and not by error of judgment, <lb/>
            is evident in many ways, and especially from his law being <lb/>
            of the same character from the beginning to the end; for <lb/>
            not even against his will did he propose anything good or <lb/>
            likely to benefit you. Can it be otherwise than proper then <lb/>
            to detest and punish a man, who cared not for the wrongs of <lb/>
            the people, but proposed laws in favour of men who had <lb/>
             <pb n="30"/>
            done the wrong and intend to do it again ? I am astonished <lb/>
            at his impudence, men of the jury, on this account; that, <lb/>
            when he himself held office with Androtion, he never felt <lb/>
            this compassion for the many, who were exhausted in paying <lb/>
            taxes out of their property, but when Androtion had to pay <lb/>
            the money which he had long ago filched from the state, as <lb/>
            well the sacred as the public money, then he proposed his <lb/>
            law to deprive you both of the public and the sacred fund, <lb/>
            the double in the one case, the decuple in the other. And <lb/>
            thus has a man behaved himself to the mass of the people, <lb/>
            who will presently say that he proposed this law on the <lb/>
            people's behalf. It seems to me, there is no punishment too <lb/>
            severe for one, who considers that, if an overseer of the <lb/>
            market or an overseer of the streets or a district judge1 has <lb/>
            been convicted of peculation at his audit--a man in humble <lb/>
            circumstances, unacquainted with public business, of little <lb/>
            experience, who has served an office to which he was chosen <lb/>
            by lot—he ought to pay tenfold; and who proposes no law for <lb/>
            the relief of such persons; but if wealthy men, chosen as <lb/>
            ambassadors by the popular assembly, have embezzled large <lb/>
            sums of money, both public and sacred, and kept them for <lb/>
            a long time in their hands, studiously contrives that they <lb/>
            shall escape every punishment which either laws or decrees <lb/>
            ordain. Timocrates himself will hardly say that he is as <lb/>
            good a legislator as Solon. Now Solon, men of the jury, did <lb/>
            not contrive that people of this kind should play their tricks <lb/>
            with impunity, but that they should either abstain from <note type="footnote"> 1 The '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αγορανόμοι</foreign>, Overseers of the Market, were ten in number, one <lb/>
            being chosen by lot from each tribe. Five served in the city, five in the <lb/>

            repair, to attend it during the hours of business, to inspect the goods <lb/>

            doing wrong or suffer condign punishment; and he intro­ <lb/>
            duced a law, that, if a man stole anything in the daytime of <lb/>
            greater value than fifty drachms,he might be taken off to <lb/>
            the Eleven, and, if he stole anything by night, it should be <lb/>
            lawful to kill or wound him in pursuit or take him off to the <lb/>
            Eleven, at the option of the party. And a person convicted <lb/>
            of crimes for which arrest was allowed could not give bail <lb/>
            and refund his thefts, but was to suffer capital punishment. <lb/>
            And if a man filched a cloak or an oil-cruet or the most <lb/>
            trifling article from the Lyceum or the Academy or Cyno­ <lb/>
            sarges, or any of the utensils from the gymnasia or the ports, <lb/>
            above the value of ten drachms, he enacted that such person <lb/>
            should be punished with death; and that, if any one were <lb/>
            convicted of theft in a private action, he might pay double <lb/>
            the assessed value, but it should be lawful for the court, in <lb/>
            addition to the pecuniary damages, to inflict on the thief the <lb/>
            penalty of imprisonment for five days and as many nights, <lb/>
            so that all men might see him in custody. (You heard those <lb/>
            laws just now.) For Solon's opinion was, that a person <lb/>
            guilty of such turpitude ought not to be let off upon pay­ <lb/>
            ment simply of what he had stolen; because thieves would <lb/>
            be very numerous, if they could keep their plunder when not <lb/>
            found out, and being found out had only to refund it; and <lb/>
            therefore he thought that a thief should pay double the <lb/>
            value of the thing stolen, and, in addition to that penalty, <lb/>
            should be imprisoned and live in disgrace for the rest of his <lb/>
            life. Such was not the view of Timocrates however. He con­ <lb/>
            trived that people should pay the simple sum where they ought <lb/>
            to pay the double, and that there should be no penalty in <lb/>
            addition. And he was not content with doing this injustice in <lb/>
            respect to the future, but he even discharged persons who had <lb/>
            been already sentenced for their misdeeds. I always imagined <lb/>
            that a legislator was to make provision for the future, with <lb/>
            respect to the conduct of people and the regulation of affairs <lb/>
            and the ordinances of the penal code. This is the way to pass <lb/>
            laws applying impartially to all citizens : to frame statutes <lb/>
            about past events, is not to legislate, but to save the criminals. <lb/>
            Mark how I prove the truth of my statement. If Euctemon <lb/>
            had been convicted upon the indictment for an illegal decree, <lb/>
            Timocrates would not have proposed this law, nor would the <lb/>
            state have required this law, but they would have been con­ <lb/>
             <pb n="32"/>
            tent, after plundering the state, to let everything else alone. <lb/>
            Now, as he was acquitted, he thinks that your resolution and <lb/>
            the verdict of the court and the rest of the laws ought to be <lb/>
            set aside, while his own law and his own authority are esta­ <lb/>
            blished. But, Timocrates, our existing laws, which are in <lb/>
            force, give the control of everything to ,the jurors, and em­ <lb/>
            power them, after hearing the case, to deal more or less <lb/>
            rigorously with the offender according to the character (in <lb/>
            their opinion) of his offence. For, when the expression <lb/>
            occurs—“ what penalty, corporal or pecuniary, is to be im­ <lb/>
            posed”—the assessment of it is vested in the jury. You <lb/>
            take away corporal punishment, by remitting imprisonment; <lb/>
            and in favour of what persons? Committers of theft and <lb/>
            sacrilege, strikers of their parents, homicides, deserters and <lb/>
            poltroons : all of whom you preserve by your law. Surely <lb/>
            a man who, legislating in a democracy, passes laws not for <lb/>
            the benefit of religion or the people, but in favour of such <lb/>
            persons as I have just mentioned, deserves the extremity of <lb/>
            penal rigour. He can't say that such persons ought not to <lb/>
            be, and that the laws do not make them, amenable to the <lb/>
            severest punishment, or that these men, in whose behalf he <lb/>
            has proposed his law, are not guilty of theft and sacrilege­ <lb/>
            men who have pillaged sacred property, keeping it in their <lb/>
            possession instead of refunding it, (the tenths, I mean, of <lb/>
            Pallas and the fiftieths of the other Gods,) and who have <lb/>
            embezzled the public monies which belonged to the state. <lb/>
            This sacrilege herein differs from others, that they never <lb/>
            even brought the money into the Acropolis, as they ought to <lb/>
            have done. By Olympian Jupiter! I believe, men of the <lb/>
            jury, that this overweening insolence did not come upon <lb/>
            Androtion by accident, but was a visitation of the Goddess, <lb/>
            in order that, as those who mutilated the Victory1 perished <lb/>
            by their own hands, so these men might perish by litigating <lb/>
            among themselves, and either pay the money tenfold accord­ <lb/>
            ing to the laws, or be thrown into prison.</p>
          <p>A point just occurred to me while I was speaking on these <lb/>
            matters, which is really striking and important. You shall <lb/>
            hear it The defendant, men of the jury, framed a clause, <lb/>
            that the farmers of taxes, if they did not pay their debts, <note type="footnote"> 1 Those who cut off the extremities, i.e. the feet, wings, &amp;c. of the <lb/>
            golden statue of Victory in the temple of Pallas in the Acropolis. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="33"/>
            should be proceeded against according tothe former laws, <lb/>
            which condemn both to imprisonment and double payment <lb/>
            men who were likely, by having made a bad bargain, to <lb/>
            injure the state unintentionally ; while he took away im­ <lb/>
            prisonment in favour of persons who commit robbery upon <lb/>
            the state and sacrilege against the Goddess. If you mean to <lb/>
            say, Timocrates, that the crime of the latter is (in your <lb/>
            opinion) less serious than that of the former, you must <lb/>
            acknowledge yourself to be a madman; if you believe the <lb/>
            Litter to be, as they are, the more culpable, and yet release <lb/>
            them and not the others, is it not plain that you have sold <lb/>
            your services to them for a bribe ?</p>
          <p>It is worth while mentioning, how much you, men of the <lb/>
            jury, surpass the orators in magnanimity. You do not <lb/>
            repeal the severe enactments passed against the multitude- <lb/>
            against such, for example, as receive pay from both sides, or <lb/>
            take part in the assembly, or sit on juries, while they are in­ <lb/>
            debted to the state, or do anything else which the laws prohibit, <lb/>
            although you know that whoever did anything of that sort <lb/>
            would do it from poverty; nor do you pass laws to give people <lb/>
            the means of doing wrong, but, on the contrary, to deprive them <lb/>
            of the means; whereas these men bring in bills to extricate <lb/>
            from punishment miscreants of the vilest description. Then <lb/>
            they sneer at you in their private conversation, as if they them­ <lb/>
            selves were men of worth and honour, when, in fact, their <lb/>
            behaviour is that of base and ungrateful servants. Just as <lb/>
            servants who have been made free are not grateful for it to <lb/>
            their masters, but hate them above all men, because they <lb/>
            know of their having been in servitude; so these orators, <lb/>
            men of the jury, are not content with having been raised <lb/>
            from poverty to wealth by their political career, but they <lb/>
            even insult the people, because the people know how each of <lb/>
            them used to live in their younger and humbler days.</p>
          <p>But, I suppose, it would have been a shocking thing for <lb/>
            Androtiou or Glaucetes or Melanopus, to be thrown into <lb/>
            prison. A fiue idea! It would be far more shocking, men <lb/>
            of the jury, for the commonwealth, when she is wronged and <lb/>
            outraged, not to obtain satisfaction both for the Goddess and <lb/>
            herself. As for Androtion, is not imprisonment his paternal <lb/>
            heritage ?Why, you know yourselves that his father spent <lb/>
            many quinquennial periods in prison, and ran away at last. <note type="footnote"> voi IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> D </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="34"/>
            without being discharged. But for the practices of his youth <lb/>
            perhaps. Why. for these he deserves a prison quite as much <lb/>
            as for his thefts. Or because he entered the market-place <lb/>
            when he had no right, and took respectable people from it to <lb/>
            prison of his own authority. But it's a terrible thing for­ <lb/>
            sooth, that Melanopus should be in bondage. I won't speak a <lb/>
            word against his father, though I might say a good deal about <lb/>
            certain thieveries. For all that I have to say, let the father <lb/>
            be as excellent a man as Timocrates would make him out. <lb/>
            But if Melanopus, notwithstanding he had so good a parent, <lb/>
            was himself a rogue and a thief; if he was adjudged to be a <lb/>
            traitor and paid a fine of three talents; if the court found <lb/>
            him guilty of theft when he had been their colleague, and he <lb/>
            had to pay tenfold ; if he betrayed his duty on an embassy <lb/>
            to Egypt, and defrauded his own brother ; ought he not to <lb/>
            be imprisoned all the more, for being what he is when he had <lb/>
            so good a father 1 It seems to me that, if Laches was really <lb/>
            a good man and a patriot, he would himself have put his son <lb/>
            in bondage for being what he is, and involving him in such <lb/>
            foul disgrace. Let us pass him by, and look at Glaucetes. <lb/>
            Is not he the man who deserted to Decelea, and sallied from <lb/>
            thence to overrun and plunder the country 1 Why, you all <lb/>
            know what I say.—Is he not the man who paid to the Spartan <lb/>
            governor there the exact tenth of all the plunder that he took <lb/>
            from you, your wives and children, and of everything else that <lb/>
            he got ?—who, after you had elected him your ambassador, <lb/>
            abstracted from the Goddess here the tithe of the spoil taken <lb/>
            from your enemies ?-who, since that, when he was treasurer <lb/>
            in the Acropolis, has stolen from it those monuments of <lb/>
            victory which our commonwealth took from the barbarians, <lb/>
            the silver-footed throne and the scymitar of Mardonius, <lb/>
            which was worth three hundred darics? Why, these things <lb/>
            are so notorious that everybody knows them. And is he not <lb/>
            a brutal fellow in other respects 1 There is no man so brutal. <lb/>
            Then would it be right to spare any of them, and for their <lb/>
            sakes to overlook the tenths of the Goddess, or the double <lb/>
            which belongs to the state ;or should you leave unpunished <lb/>
            the man who is endeavouring to save them 1 And what will <lb/>
            prevent all people being rogues, men of the jury, if they get <lb/>
            more by it 1 Nothing that I can see.</p>
          <p>Don't then yourselves encourage, but punish them. Don't <lb/>
             <pb n="35"/>
            let them grumble at being put in prison when they keep <lb/>
            your money, but bring them under the laws. Even those <lb/>
            who are convicted of being aliens do not grumble at their <lb/>
            sojourn in this lodging1 till after the trial for false testimony, <lb/>
            but remain there, and do not expect to go about on giving <lb/>
            bail For the state thought proper to distrust them, and <lb/>
            considered that she ought not to be cheated out of punish­ <lb/>
            ment by their putting in bail, but that they ought to remain <lb/>
            where many citizens have stayed before. People have been <lb/>
            imprisoned ere now both for debt and upon judgments, <lb/>
            and yet they have submitted. It is perhaps an unpleasant <lb/>
            thing to mention any of them by name, yet it is necessary to <lb/>
            compare them with these men. I will pass by those before <lb/>
            the archonship of Euclides, and the very ancient cases. All <lb/>
            these persons however, at the respective times when they <lb/>
            lived, notwithstanding their high previous reputation, met with <lb/>
            great severity from the people for their subsequent offences ; <lb/>
            because the state considered, that they ought not to be honest <lb/>
            for a time and knaves afterwards, but honest always in regard <lb/>
            to the public property ; and persons like them were deemed <lb/>
            to have been honest in time- past not naturally, but by design, <lb/>
            with a view to obtain confidence. But after the archonship <lb/>
            of Euclides, men of the jury-in the first place, you all <lb/>
            remember that Thrasybulus2 of Colyttus was twice im­ <lb/>
            prisoned, and both times sentenced in the assembly ; though <lb/>
            he was one of the men from Piræus and from Phyle.3 Secondly, <lb/>
            Philepsius of Lampra. Thirdly, Agyrrhius of Colyttus, a <lb/>
            good man, and a friend of the people, who had shown great <lb/>
            zeal for your interests; and yet even he considered, that the <lb/>
            laws ought to be as operative against himself as against the <lb/>
            humble, and he was in this lodging for many years, until he <lb/>
            paid the public money which it was found he had in his <lb/>
            hands; and Callistratus, though a man of influence, and his <note type="footnote"> 1 The Prison. " Erat ergo, quod videtur ex hoc loco colligi posse, <lb/>

              nephew, did not propose laws in his favour. And Myronides, <lb/>
              the son of Archinus, who seized Phyle, and to whom, next to <lb/>
              the Gods, the return of the popular party was chiefly owing, <lb/>
              and who had performed many other noble acts of statesman­ <lb/>
              ship, and had many times been general. Nevertheless, all <lb/>
              these men submitted to the laws. And the treasurers, in <lb/>
              whose time the Opisthodomus was burned, both those of <lb/>
              Pallas and those of the other deities, were in this lodging until <lb/>
              their trial took place. And the persons suspected of mis­ <lb/>
              feasance regarding the corn; and many others, men of the <lb/>
              jury, all better people than Androtion. Then was it right <lb/>
              that the old established laws should be in operation for those <lb/>
              persons-that they should have suffered punishment accord­ <lb/>
              ing to the existing laws-and that a new statute should be <lb/>
              passed for the sake of Androtion and Glaucetes and Melanopus, <lb/>
              for persons who have been convicted, who have been sentenced <lb/>
              by verdict according to the established laws, and found to <lb/>
              have had in their hands moneys belonging to the Gods and <lb/>
              the state? And will not the commonwealth become ridi­ <lb/>
              culous, if she is seen passing a law to save persons guilty of <lb/>
              sacrilege ?I should think so. Do not then allow yourselves <lb/>
              or the commonwealth to be insulted. Remember, that not <lb/>
              very long ago, in the archonship of Evander, you put to <lb/>
              death Eudemus of Cydathenæum, who was judged to have <lb/>
              proposed an improper law ; and you were very near putting <lb/>
              to death Philip, the son of Philip the shipowner, and, when he <lb/>
              himself asked for a large fine in mitigation of his sentence, <lb/>
              you were within a few votes of disfranchising him.1 Bear <lb/>
              this in mind, and show the same spirit now against the <lb/>
              defendant; considering also, what injury Timocrates himself <lb/>
              would have done you, if he had been your ambassador alone. <lb/>
              [ believe there is nothing that he would have refrained from. <lb/>
              You see his disposition; for the law, which he has dared to <lb/>
              propose, shows the character of the man.</p>
          <p>I wish to tell you, men of the jury, how they legislate <lb/>
            among the Locrians. You will be none the worse for having <lb/>
            heard an example, especially one of a commonwealth governed <lb/>
            by good laws. There they consider it right to abide by their <lb/>
            old established laws, to preserve hereditary institutions, and <note type="footnote"> 1 Pabst adopts the reading of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐτιμήσατε</foreign>, preferred by Schäfer, whose <lb/>
            reasoning (in the Apparatus Criticus) does not quite convince me. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="37"/>
            not to legislate for the gratification of caprice, or for the <lb/>
            escape of crime; and so far do they carry this, that, if any one <lb/>
            wishes to enact a new statute, he proposes it with his neck in <lb/>
            a noose, and if the statute is judged to be good and useful, <lb/>
            the proposer goes away alive, but, if not, the noose is drawn <lb/>
            and he dies. In fact, they do not venture to pass new laws, <lb/>
            but strictly obey the old established ones. It is said, men of <lb/>
            the jury, that in a long period of years they had only one <lb/>
            new statute passed. It was this: there being a law, that, <lb/>
            if any one knocked out the eye of another, he should lose his <lb/>
            own, without any pecuniary penalty, a man having an enemy <lb/>
            with only one eye threatened to knock it out. The one-eyed <lb/>
            man, alarmed at this threat, and thinking that his life would <lb/>
            not be worth having after such a misfortune, ventured (they <lb/>
            say) to introduce a law, that, whoever knocked out the eye of <lb/>
            a one-eyed man, should lose both his own, so that both should <lb/>
            suffer the same affliction. And this (they say) is the only <lb/>
            Jaw which the Locrians enacted in more than two hundred <lb/>
            years. But our orators, men of the jury, are almost every <lb/>
            month passing laws for their own advantage; and though <lb/>
            they, when in office, take private citizens off to prison, they <lb/>
            do not choose the same measure of justice to be applied to <lb/>
            themselves. The laws of Solon, which our ancestors passed, <lb/>
            and which have so long since undergone probation, they <lb/>
            repeal of their own authority; their own laws, proposed by <lb/>
            them for the detriment of the commonwealth, you are bound <lb/>
            (they think) to adopt. If you don't punish them then, the <lb/>
            mass of the people will, before it's very long, become the <lb/>
            slaves of these monsters. Be assured, men of the jury, that, <lb/>
            if you show a determined resentment, they will not misbehave <lb/>
            themselves so grossly; if you do not, you'll have a pretty lot <lb/>
            of these rascals who insult you under the pretence of zeal in <lb/>
            your service.</p>
          <p>That I may speak also of that law, men of the jury, which <lb/>
            I hear the defendant means to quote for a precedent, and to <lb/>
            say that he has proposed his own in conformity with it-in <lb/>
            which there are the words,—“Nor will I put any Athenian <lb/>
            in bondage, who offers three sureties of the same class, unless <lb/>
            where a man has been convicted of conspiracy to betray the <lb/>
            commonwealth or put down the democracy, or where a <lb/>
            farmer of taxes or a surety or collector commits default." <lb/>
             <pb n="38"/>
            I beg you to hear my reply to this. I will say nothing about <lb/>
            Androtion taking people to prison and putting them in bonds <lb/>
            notwithstanding this law; but I will show you to what <lb/>
            persons the law is applicable. Observe then, men of the jury ; <lb/>
            this law was meant not for persons who have had their trial <lb/>
            and sentence, but for the untried, lest by their being im­ <lb/>
            prisoned they should be crippled in their means of defence, <lb/>
            or even unprepared for it altogether. Timocrates will try to <lb/>
            make out, that a provision meant for the untried was intended <lb/>
            for all. I will show you how you may convince yourselves <lb/>
            of the truth of my statement. In the first place, men of the <lb/>
            jury, it would not have been lawful for you to determine, <lb/>
            what penalty, corporal or pecuniary, a man should suffer <lb/>
            (for in the expression " corporal penalty" is included im­ <lb/>
            prisonment; therefore you could not have sentenced to <lb/>
            imprisonment) ;and again, with regard to those offenders <lb/>
            against whom information or arrest is allowed, there would <lb/>
            not have been inserted this clause in the statutes, " And the <lb/>
            Eleven shall put in the stocks the party who has been in­ <lb/>
            formed against or arrested," had it not been lawful to put in <lb/>
            bondage other persons besides those who have conspired to <lb/>
            betray the commonwealth or put down the democracy, and <lb/>
            besides farmers of the taxes who are defaulters. These facts <lb/>
            must be taken as proofs that imprisonment is lawful; were <lb/>
            it otherwise, your penal sentences would have been wholly <lb/>
            null and void. Besides, men of the jury, this formula, <lb/>
            " Nor will I put any Athenian in bondage," is not of itself a <lb/>
            law, but is. a clause in the oath of the councillors, to prevent <lb/>
            the orators in the council from combining together, and <lb/>
            moving to imprison any of the citizens. To put it then out <lb/>
            of the council's power to inflict imprisonment, Solon inserted <lb/>
            this in the oath of the councillors, but not in yours; for he <lb/>
            considered that a court of justice should have control over <lb/>
            everything, and that whatever punishment it imposed should <lb/>
            be undergone by the convicted party. He shall read you <lb/>
            for this very purpose the oath of the Heliasts. Read.</p>

            those who are here resident contrary to the established laws <lb/>
            and decrees of the Athenian people and council; nor will I <lb/>
            permit any one else to do the like. Nor will I appoint any <lb/>
            man to an office,2 so that he may hold it while accountable <lb/>
            for another office, whether that of the nine Archons, or of the <lb/>
            Hieromnemon, or any to which the election takes place on this <lb/>
            day together with the nine Archons, or that of herald, ambas­ <lb/>

            man to hold the same office twice, or the same man to hold <lb/>
            two offices in the same year; nor will I accept bribes for <lb/>
            performing my Heliastic duty; nor shall any other man or <lb/>
            woman accept a bribe on my account, with my knowledge, <lb/>
            by any trick or contrivance whatsoever. And I am not less <lb/>
            than thirty years of age. And I will hear both the accuser <lb/>

          <p>That it is lawful then for you to pass sentence of imprison­ <lb/>
            ment, I show in this way: that to nullify judicial decisions <lb/>
            is an act of wickedness and impiety and a subversion of the <lb/>
            democracy, I think all men will agree. For our state, men <lb/>
            of the jury, is governed by laws and decrees. If then what <lb/>
            has been decreed by verdict may be rescinded by a new law, <lb/>
            where is the thing to end ? Can we call this properly law, <lb/>
            or not rather lawlessness ? And ought not a legislator of this <lb/>
            sort to be visited with the heaviest displeasure 1 The severest, <lb/>
            in my opinion, not merely for having proposed such a law, <lb/>
            but because he shows a road to others, both for the abolition <lb/>
            of our tribunals, and the restoration of exiles, and everything <lb/>
            else that is most dreadful. For if the defendant, who has <lb/>
            proposed such a law, is to get off with impunity, what, men <lb/>
            of the jury, prevents a second person starting up and sub­ <lb/>
            verting by a new law some other main bulwark of the state 1 <lb/>
            Nothing that I can see. I am told that in former times the <lb/>
            democracy was put down, by first putting down the indict­ <lb/>
            ments for illegal measures and destroying the authority of <lb/>
            the tribunals. It may be objected perhaps, that I am talk­ <lb/>
            ing about subversion of the democracy under different circum­ <lb/>
            stances from what then existed. I reply, men of the jury, <lb/>
            that no man ought ever to sow the seed of such things in the <lb/>
            commonwealth, although it may not spring up yet awhile, <lb/>
            but whoever attempts to say or do anything of the kind should <lb/>
            be punished.</p>
          <p>That he attempted also to injure you by craft, it is well you <lb/>
            should be informed. He saw that all men at all times, poli­ <lb/>
            ticians as well as private persons, regarded the laws as the <lb/>
            source of blessings to the country; he looked then for a <lb/>
            means, how he could destroy them without being discovered, <lb/>
            or, in case he were found out, avoid the appearance of having <lb/>
            done anything shocking or shameful. He devised the plan <lb/>
            which he has adopted, of putting down the laws by a <lb/>
            law, so that his misdeeds may have the name of salutary <lb/>
            measures. For the laws which preserve the commonwealth, <lb/>
            and this of the defendant, which has nothing in common with <lb/>
            them, equally bear the title of law. He knew that you <lb/>
             <pb n="41"/>
            would highly approve of the philanthropic name; that the <lb/>
            working would turn out very differently, did not trouble him.1 <lb/>
            For, by heavens ! would any committee-man or president ever <lb/>
            have put to the vote a single clause of this law ? None <lb/>
            would, I believe. How then did he slip into it ? He gave <lb/>
            the name of law to his mischievous acts. For they don't <lb/>
            injure you in simplicity or by accident, but purposely and <lb/>
            deliberately; and not these men only, but many of your <lb/>
            politicians, who will come forward by and by and assist <lb/>
            Timocrates in his defence, assuredly from no desire to favour <lb/>
            him—that is not very likely-but because each thinks the <lb/>
            law is for his own advantage. As these men then support <lb/>
            one another against you, so ought you to support yourselves. <lb/>
            A man was asking him why he had framed these enactments, <lb/>
            and urging the perilous nature of the contest which he had <lb/>
            undertaken. The speaker, he said, was mad; for Androtion <lb/>
            would come to his help, and had got up at his leisure such <lb/>
            arguments upon every point, that he was quite sure no harm <lb/>
            could come to him from that indictment. I am astonished <lb/>
            at the impudence both of Timocrates and Androtion, the one <lb/>
            for coming forward, the other for calling him to assist in the <lb/>
            defence. For surely it will be a clear proof to you, that he <lb/>
            proposed his law for this man's sake, and not the same law <lb/>
            for all. However, it is better that you should hear a little <lb/>
            about Androtion's political acts, especially those in which the <lb/>
            defendant has taken a part, and for which you ought to detest <lb/>
            him as much as the other. I shall not mention anything <lb/>
            that you have heard, unless indeed there were some present <lb/>
            at Euctemon's trial.</p>
          <p>And first let us inquire into that upon which he most <lb/>
            prides himself-his collection of the moneys, which he levied <lb/>
            from you all in conjunction with this worthy person. He <lb/>
            accused Euctemon of retaining your taxes in his hands, and <lb/>
            undertaking to prove his charge or pay the money out of his <lb/>
            own pocket, upon this pretence he got a decree deposing an <note type="footnote"> 1 Auger: “Il lie songe en consequence qu’à l'agrément du nom <lb/>

            officer elected by lot,1 and so crept into the collection. At <lb/>
            the same time, on the plea of ill health, he proposed the <lb/>
            appointment of the defendant, " to help him " (as he said) <lb/>
            " in managing the business." He harangued you upon the <lb/>
            occasion, saying that you had the choice of three courses, <lb/>
            either to break up your sacred vessels, or to have a new pro­ <lb/>
            perty tax, or to levy the arrears from those who had not <lb/>
            paid; and, as you naturally preferred to levy the arrears, <lb/>
            and as he had won you over by his promises, and had a <lb/>
            license under the peculiar circumstances, he did not choose <lb/>
            to act in this matter under the existing laws, or (if he thought <lb/>
            them insufficient) to pass new ones, but moved illegal and <lb/>
            shameful decrees in the assembly, by means of which he <lb/>
            made jobs for his private benefit, using the defendant as the <lb/>
            instrument of his gains. And with the defendant's assist­ <lb/>
            ance he has largely plundered you, having a clause in the <lb/>
            decree that the Eleven and the receivers and officers should <lb/>
            accompany him. Attended by them, he led the way to your <lb/>
            houses. And you, Timocrates, went with him, you alone of <lb/>
            all his ten colleagues. Don't understand me to say, that pay­ <lb/>
            ment ought not to have been required from the defaulters. <lb/>
            It ought: but how ? As the law prescribes, for the good of <lb/>
            the people at large : that accords with the principles of <lb/>
            democracy. You have not been so much benefited, 0 Athe­ <lb/>
            nians, by the receipt of the five talents which these men then <lb/>
            collected, as you have been injured by the introduction of <lb/>
            such practices into the government. If you will only inquire <lb/>
            why people would rather live under a democracy than under <lb/>
            an oligarchy, you will find the most obvious reason to be <lb/>
            this, that everything is milder under a democracy. That <lb/>
            these men did things far more shameful and outrageous than <lb/>
            any oligarchy in the world, I need not mention : but let me <lb/>
            ask—When have the most shameful things been done in our <lb/>
            commonwealth 1 I am sure you will say, in the time of the <lb/>
            Thirty. Yet then, we are told, no one was deprived of safety, <lb/>
            who could conceal himself at home; but the Thirty are re­ <lb/>
            proached specially for this, that they took people unlawfully <lb/>
            to prison from the market-place. These persons went far <lb/>
            beyond them in atrocity; for, being statesmen in a popular <lb/>
            government, they converted every private house into a prison, <note type="footnote"> 1 See the speech against Androtion, Vol. iiL page 154. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="43"/>
            taking to your houses the Eleven. What think ye of this, <lb/>
            men of the jury, that a poor man, or even a rich one who <lb/>
            had been at great expense and perhaps for some reason or <lb/>
            other was out of cash, should not only be afraid to enter the <lb/>
            market-place, but deem it unsafe even to stay at home, and <lb/>
            that Androtion should be the cause of this, Androtion, who, <lb/>
            on account of his life and conduct, is forbidden to sue for <lb/>
            justice on his own behalf, much more to levy property taxes <lb/>
            for the state? If he, or you, Timocrates, who aided and <lb/>
            abetted these proceedings, were asked, whether the property <lb/>
            or the person is answerable for taxes, you would say the pro­ <lb/>
            perty, if you meant to speak truth; for it is from property <lb/>
            that we contribute. Why then, 0 ye basest of mankind, in­ <lb/>
            stead of sequestering lands and houses and scheduling them, <lb/>
            did ye imprison and insult members of the commonwealth <lb/>
            and the poor resident aliens, whom you treated with more <lb/>
            insolence than your own servants 1 If you will only reflect, <lb/>
            men of the jury, what is the difference between being a slave <lb/>
            and a freeman, you will find this to be the chief distinction, <lb/>
            that with slaves the person is responsible for all offences, <lb/>
            while with freemen it is the last thing that ought to suffer <lb/>
            punishment. These men took a contrary view ;they inflicted <lb/>
            corporal punishment on people, as if they were bondsmen. <lb/>
            And on such unfair and selfish principles did Androtion act <lb/>
            towards you, that, while he allowed his father, who was in <lb/>
            prison for a public debt, to run away without payment or <lb/>
            trial, he thought that any other citizen who could not pay <lb/>
            taxes out of his own property ought to be taken by himself <lb/>
            to prison and incarcerated. And Timocrates, when he was <lb/>
            levying the double, would not have taken bail from one of <lb/>
            us common folk, I won't say till the ninth presidency, but <lb/>
            for a single day : no ;we must either have paid him the debt, <lb/>
            or have been instantly imprisoned; and he delivered to the <lb/>
            Eleven people who had not been condemned in court. Yet <lb/>
            now he has ventured at his own peril to introduce a law, that <lb/>
            persons on whom you have passed sentence may go about freely.</p>
          <p>However, they will say that both on that and on the pre­ <lb/>
            sent occasion they acted for your good. Will you then <lb/>
            admit that such things have been done for your good, and <lb/>
            will you quietly endure their acts of audacity and wicked­ <lb/>
            ness? You ought, men of Athens, to detest such persons <lb/>
             <pb n="44"/>
            rather than have mercy on them. He that acts in any way <lb/>
            for the commonwealth, and would experience your clemency, <lb/>
            should be shown to have the spirit of the commonwealth. <lb/>
            What is that ? To compassionate the weak, repress the inso­ <lb/>
            lence of the strong and powerful; not to treat the multitude <lb/>
            with cruelty and flatter those who appear from time to time <lb/>
            to possess influence, as you do, Timocrates; and therefore <lb/>
            the jury ought rather to shut their ears against you and <lb/>
            condemn you to death, than acquit you for the sake of <lb/>
            Androtion.</p>
          <p>That they have not even made these levies for your benefit, <lb/>
            I will pretty quickly show you. If they were asked, who (in <lb/>
            their opinion) do the greater injury to the state, those who <lb/>
            farm and live frugally, but through their having to maintain <lb/>
            children, through domestic expenses and other public burdens, <lb/>
            are in arrear with the property tax, or those who plunder and <lb/>
            waste the means of people willing to pay the tax and the <lb/>
            contributions of your allies, surely with all their impudence <lb/>
            they would not be bold enough to say, that men who do not <lb/>
            contribute their own money commit greater crime than men <lb/>
            who steal that of the public. How comes it then, Timocrates <lb/>
            and Androtion, when it is more than thirty years since one of <lb/>
            you commenced his political career, and in that period many <lb/>
            generals have wronged the republic, and many orators too, <lb/>
            who have been tried before your countrymen, and some of <lb/>
            whom have suffered death for their crimes, while others <lb/>
            withdrew into exile, which was an act of self-condemnation­ <lb/>
            how comes it that neither of you ever appeared as the accuser <lb/>
            of any of them, or ever was seen to express indignation at <lb/>
            the wrongs of the state, and yet you have displayed a zeal for <lb/>
            our interests upon an occasion where it was necessary to ill- <lb/>
            use so many people? Would you like me to tell you the <lb/>
            reason, men of Athens? It is because they share in the <lb/>
            wrong which is done you by certain persons, while they <lb/>
            embezzled a portion of the taxes which were levied ; and so <lb/>
            insatiable is their avarice, they make a double profit of the <lb/>
            commonwealth. For it is not more agreeable to quarrel with <lb/>
            a large number of petty offenders than with a small number of <lb/>
            great ones, and surely it is not more like a friend of the <lb/>
            people to notice the crimes of the many than those of the <lb/>
            few, But the reason is what I tell you.</p><pb n="45"/>
            
          <p>You must therefore take these things into account; you <lb/>
            must bear in mind the various offences which are committed, <lb/>
            and punish the delinquents when you catch them, not looking <lb/>
            to see whether a long time has elapsed since the act, but only <lb/>
            whether the parties were guilty. Should you now submit <lb/>
            quietly to what roused your indignation before, it will appear <lb/>
            that you condemned these men to pay the money because you <lb/>
            were angry, not because you were injured. For angry people <lb/>
            usually vent their spite on the offender in the heat of the <lb/>
            moment; injured persons only inflict punishment when they <lb/>
            have got the wrong-doer in their power. It must not then <lb/>
            appear from your present leniency, that on the former occa­ <lb/>
            sion you disregarded your oaths and gave way to your feelings <lb/>
            contrary to j ustice: no; you should manifest your abhorrence <lb/>
            both of Timocrates and Androtion, and refuse even to hear <lb/>
            them, after their political conduct.</p>
          <p>But perhaps, notwithstanding these political faults, there <lb/>
            are other things which they have managed creditably. Nay: <lb/>
            their behaviour to you in everything else has been such, that <lb/>
            what you have heard are the smallest grounds for detesting <lb/>
            them. What would you have me speak of ? Their repair of <lb/>
            the sacred utensils and their destruction of the crowns 1 or <lb/>
            their infamous manufacture of the plates 7 Why, for this, <lb/>
            if there were no other wrong which they did to the common­ <lb/>
            wealth, it seems to me they deserve to die three times over: for <lb/>
            they are chargeable with sacrilege and impiety and embezzle­ <lb/>
            ment and everything that is most shameful. The greater <lb/>
            part of what Androtion said to deceive you I shall pass by. <lb/>
            Under a pretext that the leaves of the crowns were dropping <lb/>
            off, and that they were rotten from age, as if they had been <lb/>
            made of violets or roses and not of gold, he persuaded you <lb/>
            to melt them down. Being elected to perform that duty, he <lb/>
            associated with himself the defendant, the partner of all his <lb/>
            tricks. And then-although for the taxes he added a clause <lb/>
            that the public officer should be present (an affectation of <lb/>
            honesty, when every one that paid them was sure to check <lb/>
            the accounts); for the crowns which he broke up he did not <lb/>
            apply the same rule, but has himself been orator, goldsmith, <lb/>
            treasurer, and checking-clerk. Now, if you require to be <lb/>
            trusted in all that you do for the state, you would not have <lb/>
            been caught peculating so clearly : but having defined what <lb/>
             <pb n="46"/>
            is just for the property-tax, namely, that the state should not <lb/>
            trust you, but her own servants, when it appears that in <lb/>
            another affair, in the alteration of sacred properties, some of <lb/>
            which were not consecrated even in our own generation, you <lb/>
            did not introduce the same protective clause which you did <lb/>
            in the case of the taxes, are not your motives obvious ? I <lb/>
            should imagine so.</p>
          <p>Again, men of Athens, look to futurity, and see what <lb/>
            glorious and admirable public inscriptions he destroyed, and <lb/>
            what impious and shameful ones he has written in their place. <lb/>
            You must all have seen these inscriptions under the rings of <lb/>
            the crowns—“The allies crown the people of Athens for <lb/>
            valour and justice ;" or, "The allies present as the prize of <lb/>
            victory to Pallas ;” or, naming the particular states, " Such <lb/>
            and such a people crown the Athenians, having been saved by <lb/>
            the Athenians "-as, for example, there was inscribed some­ <lb/>
            where, " The Eubceans having been delivered crown the <lb/>
            Athenians”—and again, "Conon, from the sea-fight with the <lb/>
            Lacedemonians." Such were the inscriptions upon the crowns. <lb/>
            These, which for you were themes of honour and emulation, <lb/>
            by the destruction of the crowns have disappeared: and on <lb/>
            the plates, which this impure wretch ordered to be made in <lb/>
            their stead, is inscribed, " By the care of Androtion." Yes! <lb/>
            though for the crime of impudicity the laws forbid him to <lb/>
            enter the temples, his name is in the temples engraved upon <lb/>
            the plates. Like the former inscriptions-is it not ?—and a <lb/>
            theme of equal glory for you !</p>
          <p>One may see therefore, three of the most disgraceful things <lb/>
            have been accomplished by them. The Goddess they have <lb/>
            despoiled of her crowns : in the state they have extinguished <lb/>
            an emulation fostered by deeds, of which the crowns while <lb/>
            they existed were a memorial: the dedicators tRey have <lb/>
            robbed of no small honour, the credit of being grateful for <lb/>
            obligations. Yet after doing all this quantity of mischief, <lb/>
            they are so hardened and audacious, that they mention these <lb/>
            things as creditable acts of administration ; and the one <lb/>
            imagines that through his friend he shall be spared by you, <lb/>
            while the other sits by and does not sink for shame. at his <lb/>
            performances. And he is not only so shameless in regard <lb/>
            to money matters, but so stupid as not to know that crowns <lb/>
            are a sign of merit, plates and the like are tokens of wealth, <lb/>
             <pb n="47"/>
            and every crown, though it be small, has the same glory in it <lb/>
            as a large one, whereas, although cups and censers, if exceed­ <lb/>
            ingly numerous, gild the possessors with a show of opulence, <lb/>
            yet if a man prides himself upon small matters, so far from <lb/>
            his obtaining honour on that account, he is thought to be <lb/>
            vulgar-minded. This man however has destroyed the pos­ <lb/>
            sessions of honour, and made those of wealth insignificant <lb/>
            and unworthy of you. And he did not even see, that <lb/>
            Athenians were never anxious for the acquirement of riches, <lb/>
            but for that of renown were more ambitious than for any­ <lb/>
            thing in the world. Here is a proof. They once possessed <lb/>
            greater wealth than any of the Greeks, but to win renown <lb/>
            they expended it all, and, contributing out of their private <lb/>
            means, they never shrank from any peril in the pursuit of <lb/>
            glory. From which they have acquired for themselves im­ <lb/>
            perishable treasures, partly the remembrance of their achieve­ <lb/>
            ments, partly the splendour of the sacred edifices raised to <lb/>
            commemorate them, yonder gateway, the Parthenon, docks <lb/>
            and porticoes, not a pair of little jars, or three or four <lb/>
            golden saucers, each weighing a mina, which, when you <lb/>
            please, you will frame another decree to melt down. Not'by <lb/>
            levying tithes upon themselves, not by doing what their <lb/>
            enemies would pray for, doubling the taxes, did they raise <lb/>
            these sacred ornaments : not by the help of such coun­ <lb/>
            sellors as you did they carry on the government : but by <lb/>
            overcoming their enemies, doing what every prudent man <lb/>
            would wish them to do, uniting the people in harmony, while <lb/>
            they expelled from the market-place men that led such lives <lb/>
            as you, they have left behind them a fame that will never die. <lb/>
            But you, my countrymen, are so far gone in thoughtlessness <lb/>
            and folly, that, even with such examples before your eyes, you <lb/>
            will not follow them : but Androtion is repairer of your <lb/>
            sacred utensils; Androtion, 0 earth and heaven ! And can <lb/>
            any impiety, think ye, surpass this ? I look upon it, that a <lb/>
            man who is to enter the sanctuaries, to touch the baskets <lb/>
            and holy water and superintend the service of religion, ought <lb/>
            not to be pure for a stated number of days only, but to have <lb/>
            been pure all his lifetime from the practices in which this <lb/>
            man's life has been passed.</p>
          <p>And of these things by and by. As to his intended defence <lb/>
            of Timocrates, though I have a good deal more yet to say, I <lb/>
             <pb n="48"/>
            will be content,! That the law is not against your interests <lb/>
            and introduced in defiance of all the laws and iniquitous in <lb/>
            every respect, I know he will not be able to contend. But <lb/>
            he says, I am told, that the money has been paid by Andro­ <lb/>
            tion and Glaucetes and Melanopus, and that it would be the <lb/>
            hardest thing in the world on himself, if, after these persons, <lb/>
            for whose benefit he is charged with having proposed his law, <lb/>
            have satisfied the demands of justice, he should nevertheless <lb/>
            be convicted. For my part, I think that such an argument <lb/>
            is not in any way open to him. For, if you confess that you <lb/>
            proposed your law for the benefit of these men, who you say <lb/>
            have done what is right, you ought clearly to be convicted on <lb/>
            this account, that the existing laws, according to which the <lb/>
            jury have sworn to decide, expressly forbid the proposing of <lb/>
            any law, unless it be the same for all the citizens. If you <lb/>
            assert that your legislation was for the general good, don't <lb/>
            talk about the payment of these men ; for it has no con­ <lb/>
            nexion with the present statute; but show that the statute is <lb/>
            useful and proper. That is the purpose for which you say <lb/>
            you introduced it, and which I denying have indicted you, <lb/>
            and which the jury are called upon to try. I should indeed <lb/>
            have no difficulty in showing, that the payment which those <lb/>
            men have made is anything but a payment according to law ; <lb/>
            however, as that is not the question which you have to <lb/>
            decide, why should I trouble you with it now ?</p>
          <p>I expect also that he will not refrain from this argument, <lb/>
            that it would be hard on him to suffer for having enacted <lb/>
            that no Athenian shall be sent to prison, and that it is spe­ <lb/>
            cially for the interest of the humble that the laws should be <lb/>
            as mild and lenient as possible. Against such an argument <lb/>
            it is better you should be prepared by a few observations, and <lb/>
            so there will be less chance of your being misled. When he <lb/>
            says "that no Athenian shall be sent to prison," don't forget <lb/>
            that he is telling a falsehood. It is not this that he has pro- <note type="footnote"> I The critics wish to alter the text of this passage, because the <lb/>
            orator has not yet said anything about the expected argument of <lb/>
            Androtion. But we must remember that orators often commit these <lb/>
            oversights, and sometimes (if the expression may be allowed) commit <lb/>
            them intentionally. Nor is it true that the orator has been silent as to <lb/>
            the expected argument of Androtion ; for he has anticipated a refer­ <lb/>
            euce by him to the political services of Timocrates, partly in these very <lb/>
            matters for which the prosecutor assails him. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="49"/>
            posed, but that you shall have no power to enforce your <lb/>
            cumulative penalty. Your verdict, given upon oath after <lb/>
            argument and trial, he sets aside. Don't then let him select <lb/>
            for recital those expressions in the law which sound the most <lb/>
            humane; but let him bring the whole law before you as it <lb/>
            stands, and allow you to consider its effects. You will find <lb/>
            they are what I tell you, not what Timocrates says. With <lb/>
            respect to its being the interest of the many, that the laws <lb/>
            should be as mild and lenient as possible, you have to con­ <lb/>
            sider an important distinction. There are, men of Athens, <lb/>
            two classes of things to which the laws of all states have <lb/>
            reference : the first, those rules which govern our mutual <lb/>
            dealings and contracts, which define our duties in private <lb/>
            matters, and generally, our relations to each other in life; <lb/>
            the second, those obligations which every one lies under to <lb/>
            the commonwealth, if he means to become a statesman, and <lb/>
            pretends to watch over his country's welfare. Now it is for <lb/>
            the people's interest, that those laws which concern private <lb/>
            life should be framed with mildness and humanity; but on <lb/>
            the other hand it is desirable for you, that these laws which <lb/>
            concern our public duties should be stringent and severe; for <lb/>
            thus you the people will suffer the least wrong from your <lb/>
            statesmen. When therefore he resorts to this argument, <lb/>
            meet him with the reply, that he abates the rigour, not of <lb/>
            those laws which are for you, but of these which inspire your <lb/>
            statesmen with fear.</p>
          <p>It would be a long affair to show that every word of his <lb/>
            forthcoming speech will be deception and imposture. The <lb/>
            mass of it I will pass by, and mention only one head which <lb/>
            you will bear in mind. Among all the arguments which he <lb/>
            adduces, see if he can bring anything to convince you, that it <lb/>
            is right for a legislator to order the same things to be done <lb/>
            in relation to what is past and ended, as in relation to the <lb/>
            future : for, shameful and scandalous as all the clauses of the <lb/>
            statute are, this is the most scandalous and the most uncon­ <lb/>
            stitutional. If neither the defendant nor any one else can <lb/>
            establish this proposition, you ought clearly to see and under­ <lb/>
            stand that he is imposing on you, and to ask yourselves how <lb/>
            it ever entered into his head to legislate in such a way. You <lb/>
            did not propose your law for nothing, Timocrates : no ! very <lb/>
            far from that! You cannot suggest any pretext for intro­ <lb/>
            ducing such a bill, except your own abominable avarice ; for <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> a </note> <lb/>

            not one of these men was either a relative or a connexion or <lb/>
            an intimate friend of yours. Nor can you allege, that you <lb/>
            pitied men who had been cruelly treated, and therefore chose <lb/>
            to assist them. In the first place, you never considered it <lb/>
            cruel treatment, that they should pay the money of the state <lb/>
            so long after it was due, and with such unwillingness and <lb/>
            reluctance, after conviction by three tribunals; (it was cruel <lb/>
            conduct on their parts, which should excite indignation rather <lb/>
            than move to compassion:) and in the next place, there is <lb/>
            nothing so remarkably kind and gentle in your disposition, <lb/>
            more than in that of other people, that you should take pity <lb/>
            on them. It is not in the same spirit, to pity Androtion and <lb/>
            Glaucetes and Melanopus, for having to refund what they <lb/>
            have embezzled, and never to have pitied one of all these in <lb/>
            court, or the other citizens, (to whose houses you went with <lb/>
            the Eleven and the Receivers and officers,) but to have re­ <lb/>
            moved their doors, and drawn the bedclothes from under <lb/>
            them, and taken favourite waiting-maids for a distress : all <lb/>
            which you did for a whole year with Androtion. Surely, <lb/>
            you execrable man, the treatment of your countrymen has <lb/>
            been far more cruel, and you had much more reason to pity <lb/>
            them, who through you orators have no respite from payment <lb/>
            of taxes. And this is not enough. The double is exacted <lb/>
            from them, and that by you and Androtion, who have never <lb/>
            contributed to the property tax a single mite. And yet such <lb/>
            was this man's arrogance, such his confidence of impunity, <lb/>
            that, though he had ten colleagues, he ventured to enter his <lb/>
            account alone with Androtion.1 For Timocrates has no <lb/>
            interest, no personal object to serve, when he incurs your <lb/>
            hatred, and introduces laws contrary to all the rest, nay, even <lb/>
            to a former law of his own, as (by Athene !) I think has not <lb/>
            escaped your notice.2</p>
          <p>What most (in my judgment) deserves your indignation, I <lb/>
            will tell you without disguise. It is this, men of Athens; <lb/>
            that, although he does these things for money, although he <lb/>
            has decidedly taken up the trade of a hireling, he does not <lb/>
            apply the money to purposes, for which, if one knew it, one <lb/>
            might have excused him. What do I mean? The de­ <lb/>
            fendant's father, men of the jury, is indebted to the state ; <note type="footnote"> 1 To enter in the public book his account of the monies which he <lb/>
            had collected during his term of office. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 " Acerba ironic, quâ Timocratem ridet.”—Reiske. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="51"/>
            (T do not mention it by way of reproach to him, but from <lb/>
            necessity;) and this worthy person allows him to remain so. <lb/>
            He, who will inherit the disfranchisement, in case anything <lb/>
            happens to his father-and yet, rather than pay the debt, <lb/>
            chooses to enjoy, during his father's life, what it'would cost <lb/>
            him to pay it-what baseness do you think he is not capable <lb/>
            of! And when you have no pity on your father• when you <lb/>
            think it no hardship on him, that, whilst you are making <lb/>
            money and profit from the taxes which you levied, from <lb/>
            the decrees which you frame, from the laws which you intro­ <lb/>
            duce, he, for want of a small sum, is excluded from civic <lb/>
            rights—do you tell us that you feel compassion for any other <lb/>
            people ? Oh, but he has managed nicely for his sister ! Why, <lb/>
            if he had committed no other crime, he deserves to perish for <lb/>
            this; for he has sold her, instead of giving her in marriage. <lb/>
            One of your enemies, a Corcyræan, of the party now holding <lb/>
            the city, used to lodge at his house when he came here as <lb/>
            ambassador, and expressed a desire to have his sister-on <lb/>
            what terms, I forbear to mention—so he has given her up <lb/>
            for a sum of money, and she is now in Corcyra. A man <lb/>
            who, under the pretence of marrying his sister to a foreigner,1 <lb/>
            has in reality sold her-who takes this care of his father in <lb/>
            his old age-who is a parasite, a hireling politician and de­ <lb/>
            cree-drawer—won’t you put him to death, men of Athens, <lb/>
            when you have got him in your power ? If you don't, it will <lb/>
            be thought you like trials and annoyances, and don't wish to <lb/>
            rid yourselves of bad people.</p>
          <p>That all offenders ought to be punished, you would all <lb/>
            agree, if you were asked, I am sure. That this man, who has <lb/>
            introduced a law to the prejudice of the multitude, deserves <lb/>
            punishment above all others, I will endeavour to show you. <lb/>
            A thief or highwayman or other malefactor of that sort, in <lb/>
            the first place, injures just the person that encounters him, <lb/>
            and would not be able to rob all men or steal the property <lb/>
            of all; in the next place, he disgraces his own life and <lb/>
            character only. But if a man introduces a law, by which a <lb/>
            perfect license and impunity is given to those who are mis­ <lb/>
            chievously inclined, such a person injures the whole state <lb/>
            and disgraces all: for, when a disgraceful law is in force, it <lb/>
            is a reproach to the state which enacted it, and a calamity to <note type="footnote"> I Which was itself illegal. See the article Exagoges Dike in the <lb/>
            Archæological Dictionary. </note> <note type="footnote"> E 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="52"/>
            all who use it. Here then is a man who attempts to do yon <lb/>
            mischief and cover you with infamy—won’t you punish him <lb/>
            when you have caught him ? And what will you have to <lb/>
            say for yourselves ? You may see with what deep designs he <lb/>
            has framed the statute, and how adverse such designs are to <lb/>
            the existing government, if you reflect that, wherever people <lb/>
            embark in revolutionary measures with a view to put dowu <lb/>
            a democracy, they begin with this-they release those who <lb/>
            are suffering imprisonment under previous legal sentence for <lb/>
            crimes. Then does not the defendant deserve, if possible, to <lb/>
            perish three times over-when, standing alone, and being (as <lb/>
            I presume) not likely to put down you, but rather himself to <lb/>
            die by your sentence, if you do what is right and proper, he <lb/>
            nevertheless followed this flagitious example, and chose by <lb/>
            means of his law to release those whom the tribunals have <lb/>
            sent to prison, framing an impudent clause, that, if any one <lb/>
            has been condemned or shall hereafter be condemned to <lb/>

            Why, suppose 1 just now you were to hear a noise close to the <lb/>
            court, and then some one told you that the prison had been <lb/>
            opened and the prisoners were making their escape : there is <lb/>
            not a man, however old or indifferent, who would not run to <lb/>
            give what help he could. And if any one came forward and <lb/>
            said that it was Timocrates who was setting them at liberty, <lb/>
            he would be led off instantly, and put to death without a <lb/>
            hearing. Now then, 0 Athenians, you have the defendant, <lb/>
            who has not secretly done this, but by cheating and imposing <lb/>
            on you has publicly passed a law, by which the prison is not <note type="footnote"> 1 Longin, don son traité du sublime, cite cet endroit du discoura, <lb/>

            sentenced to imprisonment are released, and, if you sentence <lb/>
            any one hereafter, you are none the better for it ?</p>
          <p>You should look at this also, that many of the Greeks have <lb/>
            often passed resolutions to adopt your laws ; a circumstance <lb/>
            in which you take a pride, very naturally. For a saying in <lb/>
            this court that I have heard of I consider to be true, that all <lb/>
            wise people regard the laws as the morals of a state. You <lb/>
            should be anxious therefore to make them appear as good as <lb/>
            possible, and to punish those who corrupt and impair them; <lb/>
            for, should they suffer by your neglect, you will be deprived <lb/>
            of this honour, and will create an unfavourable opinion of the <lb/>
            commonwealth. Again, if Solon and Draco are justly eulo­ <lb/>
            gised, though there is no public service that you could attri­ <lb/>
            bute to either of them, except that they passed good and <lb/>
            useful laws, surely towards those who legislate in a contrary <lb/>
            spirit you ought to show displeasure and resentment. Certain <lb/>
            I am that Timocrates has introduced this statute in great <lb/>
            measure on his own account; for he felt that many of his <lb/>
            political acts merited a prison.</p>
          <p>I wish to tell you however of another saying, attributed <lb/>
            to Solon, when he was prosecuting a man for having passed an <lb/>
            improper law. It is reported that, after having gone through <lb/>
            his other charges, he said to the jury, that it was the law in <lb/>
            almost all countries, to punish a man with death for debasing <lb/>
            the coin-he then asked them if they considered that law <lb/>
            just and reasonable, and the jurors answering in the affirma­ <lb/>
            tive, he declared it to be his opinion that money was a coin <lb/>
            invented for the private dealings of individuals, but the laws <lb/>
            he regarded as the coin of the state; therefore, if any one <lb/>
            debased this, the coin of the state, and introduced a counter­ <lb/>
            feit, the jurors had much more reason to detest and punish <lb/>
            such a person, than one who debased the coin of individuals. <lb/>
            And, as a further proof of its being a greater crime to debase <lb/>
            the laws than the currency, he added, that many states, by <lb/>
            openly using silver alloyed with copper and lead, saved them­ <lb/>
            selves from ruin and suffered no damage by it, whereas no <lb/>
            people ever came off well by adopting bad laws and letting <lb/>
            their existing laws be corrupted. To this charge, I say, <lb/>
            Timocrates now stands amenable, and ought in justice to <lb/>
            receive condign punishment from you.</p><pb n="54"/>
            
          <p>All men indeed who pass bad and disreputable laws are <lb/>
            just objects of resentment; but especially men who vitiate <lb/>
            that class of laws, upon which it depends whether the com­ <lb/>
            monwealth is mean or great. Which are they ? The laws <lb/>
            which punish wrong-doers, and those which confer honour <lb/>
            upon the virtuous. For if all men were zealous to serve the <lb/>
            public, from an ambition to win the attendant honours and <lb/>
            rewards; and if all men abstained from vicious conduct, <lb/>
            through fear of the pains and penalties which follow; is there <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>ARISTOGITON was an Athenian orator contemporary with Demosthenes, <lb/>
            but one of the most opposite character in all respects. His speaking <lb/>
            was distinguished by a coarse volubility and vulgar impudence, <lb/>
            which, together with certain other qualities and propensities, obtained <lb/>
            for him the opprobrious nickname of the Dog. He is said to have <lb/>
            belonged to that class of persons at Athens who were called Syco­ <lb/>
            phantæ, of whom I have spoken elsewhere (see Vol. iii. p. 344); <lb/>
            and certainly no man better deserved the title than he did, if we <lb/>
            only believe half what is said of him by Demosthenes and Dinarchus, <lb/>
            whose statements pretty well agree with each other, and are con­ <lb/>
            firmed by what we read in Plutarch's Life of Phocion and else­ <lb/>
            where. The father of Aristogiton having died in debt to the state, <lb/>
            he, according to the Athenian law, inherited the liability, and, not <lb/>
            being able to discharge it, was thrown into prison. From this time <lb/>
            he seems to have been hardly ever free from debt, and to have <lb/>
            passed more of his time in prison than out of it. When he was at <lb/>
            liberty, he owed it more to the mercy than to the justice of the law; <lb/>
            yet he did not scruple to violate it, by intruding into the assemblies <lb/>
            and law-courts, from which his disfranchisement excluded him. <lb/>
            His vocation was, to attack those public men of the day over whom <lb/>
            he could get any advantage; to commence actions, or lay informa­ <lb/>
            tions, against persons whom he caught tripping in the law, some­ <lb/>
            times bringing them to trial, but more often extorting money by <lb/>
            threats of legal proceedings. Among others whom he prosecuted <lb/>
            were Demosthenes and Hyperides, after the battle of Chæronea. <lb/>
            Divers anecdotes are related, marking the thorough profligacy of his <lb/>
            character. He counterfeited lameness, in order to escape enrolment <lb/>
            for military service. He refused to bury his own father. When he <lb/>
            was in prison, he committed a theft and an outrage of so gross a <lb/>
            kind, that even his fellow-prisoners refused to associate with him. <lb/>
            Having been chosen by lot to serve the office of Overseer of the <lb/>
            Emporium, he was rejected by the jury on his probation. Finally <lb/>
            he was prosecuted by Dinarchus, for having taken a bribe of <lb/>
            Harpalus, the Persian envoy, and being thrown into prison, he <lb/>
            died there.</p>
          <p>The present prosecution was brought against Aristogiton, for exercising <lb/>
            his civic franchise before he had discharged certain debts which ho <lb/>
             <pb n="56"/>
            owed to the state. He had been fined five talents upon a conviction <lb/>
            for moving an illegal decree. He had also incurred the penalty of <lb/>
            a thousand drachms, upon failing to get a fifth part of the votes on <lb/>
            an indictment preferred by himself. These two sums not having <lb/>
            been paid within the prescribed period, the debt in due course was <lb/>
            doubled, and became ten talents two thousand drachms. To secure <lb/>
            the payment of this, he mortgaged a piece of land to the state; and <lb/>
            shortly afterwards the mortgage was transferred to his brother <lb/>
            Eunomus, he agreeing to pay the debt by ten yearly instalments. <lb/>
            Eunomus made two payments, amounting to two talents four hun­ <lb/>
            dred drachms, leaving eight talents sixteen hundred drachms still <lb/>
            due. Aristogiton, regarding himself as no longer indebted to the <lb/>
            state, his brother having been accepted as debtor in his place, pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded to exercise his 'political rights as usual, speaking in the <lb/>
            assembly, appearing as a suitor in the courts, and commencing pro­ <lb/>
            secutions against his fellow-citizens. For this an information was <lb/>
            laid against him by Lycurgus, assisted by Demosthenes; and upon <lb/>
            the foregoing facts arose a question, whether Eunomus had become <lb/>
            the state-debtor in lieu of his brother, or whether he was only a <lb/>
            guarantee, or, at most, a joint debtor with him, Aristogiton not being <lb/>
            released from liability. There was also another debt, with which <lb/>
            Aristogiton was entered as chargeable in the public register, but <lb/>
            which he disputed, alleging that a false entry had been made by one <lb/>
            Ariston, against whom he had preferred an indictment for the fraud. <lb/>
            The prosecutors contended that this had nothing to do with the <lb/>
            present inquiry; that, so long as a man's name remained inscribed <lb/>
            in the register of debtors, he must be taken for all purposes to be <lb/>
            the debtor; if it was wrongfully entered, he had his legal remedy <lb/>
            and could procure his name to be struck out, but in the meantime <lb/>
            he was subject to the legal disabilities.</p>
          <p>Lycurgus, as principal manager of the prosecution, spoke first, and left <lb/>
            very little for his colleague to say upon the questions of law and <lb/>
            the evidence in the case. Demosthenes therefore, in his address <lb/>
            to the jury, confines himself almost entirely to general observa­ <lb/>
            tions upon the nature of the offence and the character of the <lb/>
            defendant; urging, that it was necessary on constitutional grounds, <lb/>
            and for the sake of example, to punish infractions of the law; that <lb/>
            Aristogiton was a person who deserved no clemency, because his debts <lb/>
            were contracted by misconduct, not by misfortune; that his previous <lb/>
            life (which was notorious to all) showed what an abandoned profligate <lb/>
            he was-a bad son, a treacherous friend, a corrupt politician ; in <lb/>
            short, in every respect, both public and private, a pest of society, <lb/>
            whom it was dangerous and disgraceful to let off.</p>
          <p>The exact date of these speeches cannot be determined; but it appears <lb/>
            from internal evidence that they are some years later than the battle <lb/>
            of Chæronea. Dionysius and many other critics, both ancient- and <lb/>
            modern, judging from the style of the orations, have expressed <lb/>
            doubts whether they are rightly ascribed to Demosthenes. That in <lb/>
            the first of them there are many fine passages, with much force both <lb/>
            of argument and language, and that it is in all probability a genuine <lb/>
            Attic speech of the day, can hardly be denied; but it has been <lb/>
             <pb n="57"/>
            thought not to be Demosthenic in character, from its containing <lb/>
            harsher and bolder metaphors and expressions, and a less elaborate <lb/>
            composition, than we are accustomed to in our orator. It has been <lb/>
            suggested that Demosthenes may have purposely adopted an unusual <lb/>
            style, in imitation of Lycurgus. Reiske attributes the first of the <lb/>
            orations to Hyperides, and Schäfer and some others incline to the <lb/>
            same opinion. That the second speech, if it has been correctly <lb/>
            handed down to us, could hardly have been delivered by Hyperides, <lb/>
            appears from a passage in which Hyperides is spoken of in the third <lb/>
            person. But the genuineness of the second speech is perhaps more <lb/>
            open to suspicion than that of the first; for, in point of merit, it is <lb/>
            less worthy of Demosthenes; and Plutarch, in his Life of the orator, <lb/>
            mentions only a single speech of his against Aristogiton.</p>
          <p>I HAVE been sitting for a long time, men of the jury, and <lb/>
            listening, like yourselves, to the speech of Lycurgus for the <lb/>
            prosecution; the general tenor of it I admired, but seeing how <lb/>
            he over-exerted himself, I have been wondering whether he is <lb/>
            ignorant, that the justice of this case derives not its strength <lb/>
            from what he has said or what I am about to say, but the <lb/>
            result depends on the favour or the disfavour with which <lb/>
            profligacy is regarded by each of you. For my own part, I <lb/>
            believe that it is necessary to conduct the prosecution and <lb/>
            make long speeches, in order to comply with custom, and that <lb/>
            the case may be duly laid before you ; but that this matter <lb/>
            has been decided by each juror in his own mind and according <lb/>
            to his own principles long before, and that now, if the majo­ <lb/>
            rity of you are disposed to protect and to cherish rogues, we <lb/>
            shall have rhapsodized to no purpose, but, if you are disposed <lb/>
            to abhor them, the defendant will, with heaven's permission, <lb/>
            be punished.</p>
          <p>Though much has-been said, and all of it well, I shall not <lb/>
            hesitate to declare to you my own views. It seems to me that <lb/>
            the present trial is not in the least like others. Look at it in <lb/>
            this way. Juries come to the courts in general, to learn from <lb/>
            the accuser and the defendant the question upon which they <lb/>
            have to give their verdict, while each of the parties comes to <lb/>
            prove that the legal right is strongly on his own side. But <lb/>
            how is it with the present trial ? You the jurors know better <lb/>
            than we the prosecutors, that the defendant speaks in public <lb/>
            when he has no right, being a state debtor and registered as <lb/>
            such in the Acropolis; so that each of you is in the position <lb/>
            of an accuser, knowing the facts, and not requiring to He told <lb/>
            them. The accused is here without the shadow of a defence ; <lb/>
             <pb n="58"/>
            he has no arguments upon the question itself, not a character <lb/>
            like that of an ordinary man,1 not a single point in his favour : <lb/>
            but he thinks to get off upon grounds, which would have <lb/>
            alarmed another man notwithstanding his innocence; for he <lb/>
            places his hope of safety in the enormity of his wickedness. <lb/>
            This being so, it would hardly be incorrect, methinks, to say, <lb/>
            that, while Aristogiton is the defendant, you are upon your <lb/>
            probation, and your own character is at stake. For if you <lb/>
            manifest your displeasure at these open and grave delin­ <lb/>
            quencies, and if you visit them with punishment, you will <lb/>
            seem to have entered court like judges and guardians of <lb/>
            the laws, as you are : but should different motives prevail, <lb/>
            (motives which no one would confess, but which will appear <lb/>
            by the votes,) it will look, I fear, as if you were the training <lb/>
            masters of every man in the city that wants to be a rogue. <lb/>
            For every rogue is weak by himself; but one that you assist <lb/>
            becomes strong: and such assistance is power and profit to <lb/>
            him that gets it, but to you that lend it a reproach.</p>
          <p>Before I begin to speak of the defendant's private life, I <lb/>
            should wish you, men of Athens, to consider seriously for a <lb/>
            few minutes, to what depth of disgrace and infamy the com­ <lb/>
            monwealth has been brought by all these monsters, among <lb/>
            whom the defendant stands middle, last, and first. I will <lb/>

            -in which you invite your orators to express their opinions, <lb/>
            not give utterance to their profligacy-there they come, <lb/>
            ready-furnished with audacity and clamour and false charges <lb/>
            and calumny and impudence and everything of the kind­ <lb/>
            nothing could be more opposite to the purpose of deliberation ; <lb/>
            nothing, I am sure, could be more disgraceful. And by these <lb/>
            foul means they control everything in the state which is <lb/>
            respectable-the laws, the committee of council, the questions <lb/>
            of the day,2 and public decency. If you like such doings— <lb/>
            if the conduct of these men has your approval-it is all <lb/>
            regular, and we must let things take their course. But if <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Βίον ἀνθρώπινον</foreign>. Reiske—“ civilem—honesto viro dignam vitam.” <lb/>

            even at this late period you desire to correct the abuses, to <lb/>
            reform a vicious and disreputable state of things, which these <lb/>
            men introduced long ago and which you have suffered to <lb/>
            continue, you must to-day disregard all such practices and <lb/>
            pronounce a conscientious verdict, esteeming above all things <lb/>
            Eunomia,l the lover of right, the preserver of countries and <lb/>
            states: you must consider every one of you, that you are <lb/>
            under the eyes of inexorable and sacred Justice, who, as we <lb/>
            are told by Orpheus, our instructor in the most holy ordi­ <lb/>
            nances, sits by the throne of Jupiter, and overlooks all the <lb/>
            works of men; under that persuasion you must give your <lb/>
            votes, taking every possible care not to act unworthily of <lb/>
            her, from whom the duty of you jurors derives its name—you <lb/>
            that are chosen from time to time to sit in justice, and on that <lb/>
            day are charged upon your oaths by your country, by the con­ <lb/>
            stitution, by the laws, to maintain the rights and honour <lb/>
            and interests of the commonwealth. Should you not be thus <lb/>
            disposed, should you have brought your accustomed easiness <lb/>
            with you to the bench, I fear the thing may turn out dif­ <lb/>
            ferently from what is expected, and we who fancy we are <lb/>
            accusing Aristogiton shall appear to be your accusers; for, the <lb/>
            more clearly we demonstrate his turpitude without making <lb/>
            an impression on you, the greater will be the reproach that <lb/>
            falls upon you. And upon this subject enough.</p>
          <p>I shall certainly, men of Athens, speak the truth to you <lb/>
            with all frankness. When I saw you in the assemblies pro­ <lb/>
            posing and putting me up for accuser of Aristogiton, it <lb/>
            annoyed me, and I declare to you solemnly I did not wish it. <lb/>
            For I was quite aware, that a man who undertakes anything <lb/>
            of this sort at Athens hurts himself before he has done with <lb/>
            it; if not so seriously as to feel it immediately, yet, if he <lb/>
            repeats it often and doesn't stop, hell quickly find it out. <lb/>
            However, I deemed it necessary to comply with your wishes. <lb/>
            I supposed that Lycurgus himself would state the case upon <lb/>
            the information and the laws, as he has done; and I saw that <lb/>
            he was summoning the witnesses who speak to this man's <lb/>
            baseness. The general points, which are fit to be considered <lb/>
            and ought to be weighed by persons deliberating for the state <lb/>
            and the laws, I took upon myself to explain; and to this I <lb/>
            will now proceed. Give me leave, I entreat you, men of <note type="footnote"> 1 By this title the orator personifies legality and good order. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="60"/>
            Athens, to discuss these matters with you in the way that is <lb/>
            natural to me and according to the plan that I have marked <lb/>
            out. Indeed I could not do it in any other way.</p>
          <p>The whole life of men, 0 Athenians, whether they inhabit <lb/>
            a great city or a small one, is governed by nature and by <lb/>
            laws. Of these-nature is a thing irregular, unequal, and <lb/>
            peculiar to the individual possessor: laws are regular, com­ <lb/>
            mon, and the same for all. Nature, if it be depraved, <lb/>
            has often vicious desires; therefore you will find people of <lb/>
            that sort falling into error. fLaws desire what is just and <lb/>
            honourable and useful; they seek for this, and, when it is <lb/>
            found, it is set forth as a general ordinance, the same and <lb/>
            alike for all; and that is law, which all men ought to obey <lb/>
            for many reasons, and especially because every law is an in­ <lb/>
            vention and gift of the Gods, a resolution of wise men, a cor­ <lb/>
            rective of errors intentional and unintentional, a compact of <lb/>
            the whole state, according to which all who belong to the <lb/>
            state ought to live. |That Aristogiton has been convicted <lb/>
            upon every charge of the information-that no argument <lb/>
            which he could urge to the contrary would be endurable-it <lb/>
            is easy to show. All laws, men of Athens, are enacted for <lb/>
            two objects, first, to prevent the doing of injustice, secondly, <lb/>
            that the punishment of transgressors may make other men <lb/>
            better. Both of these grounds of condemnation, as you will <lb/>
            see, apply to the defendant. For having transgressed the <lb/>
            laws in the beginning, he has incurred the penalties; and, for <lb/>
            not acquiescing in them,1 he is brought here to be punished <lb/>
            by you; so that there is no pretext left for acquitting him. It <lb/>
            cannot be said either, that the state is not damaged by these <lb/>
            things. I will not remind you, that all the fines of the state <lb/>
            are lost, if you admit the sophistries of the defendant-that, <lb/>
            if any persons owing fines are to be let off, you should let off <lb/>
            the most honest and the best, and those who have been <lb/>
            amerced for the least serious offences, not the person who is <lb/>
            most profligate, who has most often trespassed, who has been <lb/>
            most justly condemned, and for the most shocking offences; for <lb/>
            what can be more shocking than pettifoggery and unconsti­ <lb/>
            tutional decree-moving, for both of which the defendant has <note type="footnote"> 1 Pabst's version explains the meaning of these words, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐκ ἐμμένει <lb/>

             <pb n="61"/>
            been condemned 1 I need not say that, if you forgave every <lb/>
            one else, you ought surely to allow no favour to a person who <lb/>
            sets you at defiance ; for that is outrageous insolence. These <lb/>
            and the like arguments I will pass by. But this I think I shall <lb/>
            demonstrate to you clearly, that all order legal and political <lb/>
            is confounded and destroyed, as far as it can be, by the <lb/>
            defendant. And I shall urge nothing that is new or extra­ <lb/>
            ordinary or peculiar, but only what you all know as well as <lb/>
            myself</p>
          <p>If any of you will consider what the power is which causes <lb/>
            the council to meet, the people to go up to the assembly, the <lb/>
            juries to be impanelled, the old magistrates to make way <lb/>
            voluntarily for the new, everything in short by which the <lb/>
            state is maintained and governed to be done; he will find <lb/>
            that this is owing to the laws and the universal obedience which <lb/>
            is paid to them : for, if they were abolished, if every man had <lb/>
            a license given him to do what he pleases, not only is the <lb/>
            constitution gone, but our mode of living would in no way <lb/>
            differ from that of wild beasts. For example, what do you <lb/>
            think the defendant himself would do if the laws were <lb/>
            abolished, he who thus behaves himself while they are in <lb/>
            force ? Since then it is acknowledged that, next to the Gods, <note type="footnote"> 1 With this and what follows compare Shakspeare, Troilus and <lb/>

            And appetite, a universal wolf, <lb/>
            So doubly seconded with will and power, <lb/>
            Must make perforce a universal prey, <lb/>

            it is the laws which preserve the commonwealth, you should act, <lb/>
            all of you, in the same manner as if you were sitting here to <lb/>
            make up a club-subscription.1 Him that obeys the laws you <lb/>
            should praise and honour, as a person contributing his full <lb/>
            share to the welfare of his country; him that disobeys them <lb/>
            you should punish. For whatever any of us does at the <lb/>
            bidding of the laws, is a contribution to the state and to the <lb/>
            public; and he that is a defaulter to it robs you, men of <lb/>
            Athens, of many noble institutions, many important advan­ <lb/>
            tages, yea, does all he can to destroy them. One or two of <lb/>
            these, which are the most familiar, I will mention for the sake <lb/>
            of example. The Council of Five-hundred, by means of a <lb/>
            slight railing, is able to ensure secrecy, and to prevent the <lb/>
            intrusion of strangers. The Council of Areopagus, when it <lb/>
            sits in the King's porch and shuts itself in with a cord, is <lb/>
            quiet and undisturbed, all people retiring out of the way. <lb/>
            All the magistrates who are elected by lot from the people, as <lb/>
            soon as the officer has said " withdraw,” are armed with the <lb/>
            power of the laws, which they were commissioned to execute, <lb/>
            and no violence is offered by outrageous persons. A thousand <lb/>
            instances besides these I could mention. Everything which <lb/>
            is honourable and noble-everything by which the common­ <lb/>
            wealth is adorned and upheld-discretion, modesty, reve­ <lb/>
            rence for parents, respect of the young for their elders-all <lb/>
            these prevail by the assistance of the laws over what is <lb/>
            disgraceful, over impudence, audacity, and temerity. For <lb/>
            profligacy is a thing of a bold and reckless and grasping <lb/>
            nature ; while honesty, on the contrary, is quiet and scru­ <lb/>
            pulous and slow, and easy to be taken advantage of. You <lb/>
            therefore who sit as jurors from time to time should give <lb/>
            heed to the laws, that you may maintain their efficiency ; for <lb/>
            by their help good men prevail over bad. If not, everything <lb/>
            is loosed, opened, confounded; the state is at the mercy of <lb/>
            the most wicked and the most shameless. By heavens ! <lb/>
            suppose every citizen had the boldness and impudence of <lb/>
            Aristogiton, and reasoned with himself as he does, that a man <lb/>
            may say or do what he pleases in a democracy without re­ <lb/>
            straint, if he that so acts has no regard for his reputation, and <lb/>
            that for no offence whatever will he be put to death imme­ <lb/>
            diately—and suppose, under such persuasion, the non-elect <note type="footnote"> 1 See the Oration against Midias, Vol. ii. p. 99. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="63"/>
            pretended to equality with the elect (whether by lot or by <lb/>
            show of hands), and claimed to share the same privileges- <lb/>
            suppose, in short, that neither young nor old would perform <lb/>
            their duties, but that each individual, banishing order and <lb/>
            discipline from his life, regarded his own will as law, as magis­ <lb/>
            trate, as all in all-if we were to act in this way, could any <lb/>
            government go on 1 How say ye 1 Could the laws retain their <lb/>
            authority ? What violence and outrage would the city be filled <lb/>
            with every day ! What lawlessness, what licentiousness of lan­ <lb/>
            guage, in place of the present moderation and reserve! And why <lb/>
            need I tell you that all order is preserved by the laws and the <lb/>
            obedience which is paid to them 1 You yourselves are the <lb/>
            only persons here impanelled, though all the Athenians drew <lb/>
            lots just now, and all wished, I am sure, to be drawn for this <lb/>
            court. How comes this about? Because the lot fell on you, <lb/>
            and then you were again drawn for the court ;1and this is <lb/>
            what the laws prescribe. You then, who have taken your <lb/>
            own places here by virtue of the laws-will you let off a <lb/>
            person, when you have caught him, who resolves to speak or <lb/>
            to act in defiance of the laws 1 And will none of you show <lb/>
            resentment or indignation at the violence offered to the <lb/>
            laws by this impudent and abominable man ? Why, you <lb/>
            monster of impurity! when your right of speech is barred <lb/>
            not by doors or railings, which one may push open, but by <lb/>
            penalties of such number and magnitude, which are registered <lb/>
            in the temple of the Goddess—you dare to burst those <lb/>
            barriers and approach a place from which the laws have <lb/>
            banished you ! Excluded2 as you are by every principle of <lb/>

            the Judges, by another of the Collectors, by the indictment <lb/>
            for false entry which you yourself prefer1–excluded almost <lb/>

          <p>That you ought in no way to tolerate such things, I will <lb/>
            show you by a plain and striking illustration. Suppose any <lb/>
            one now were to get up and contend that our speakers ought <lb/>
            to be taken from the youngest men, or from the richest, <lb/>
            or from those who have performed the official services, or <lb/>
            from any other class which he chose to select, you would <lb/>
            put him to death, I am sure, as a person endeavouring to <lb/>
            overthrow the democracy. And you would be justified in <lb/>
            doing so. Yet none of these proposals would be so shocking <lb/>
            as for a man to advise, that the privilege of speaking should <lb/>
            be given to any of the classes to which Aristogiton belongs, <lb/>
            namely, to wilful violators of law, or to persons who have <lb/>
            come out of prison, or to those whose fathers the people have <lb/>
            put to death, or those who have been drawn for an office and <lb/>
            rejected on their probation, or debtors to the treasury, or <lb/>
            persons completely disfranchised, or those who are, and are <lb/>
            reputed to be, thoroughly base: all of which categories <lb/>
            belong to the defendant, and apply to such as resemble him <lb/>
            in character. I consider, men of Athens, that he deserves <lb/>
            death for what he is doing now, but much more, or at least as <lb/>
            much, for what it is manifest he would do, if he got the <lb/>
            means and opportunity from you; which I trust he never <lb/>
            will. I can hardly suppose any of you to be ignorant, that <lb/>
            the defendant is fit for nothing that is good or honourable <lb/>
            or worthy of the state ; (never, 0 ye Immortals, may there <lb/>
            be such a dearth of men in the commonwealth, that she <lb/>
            should employ Aristogiton upon any honourable service!) <lb/>
            no : the things, for which any one would employ this monster, <lb/>

            are not guided by any reason or good feeling, but by despera­ <lb/>
            tion ? Or rather his political life is wholly desperation : <lb/>
            which is a calamity most baneful to the possessor, shocking <lb/>
            and offensive to all, and intolerable to the state. For a <lb/>
            desperate man has abandoned all care of himself, all hope of <lb/>
            rational safety, but is saved, if at all, by some extraordinary <lb/>
            and paradoxical means. What wise man then would connect <lb/>
            himself or his country's interests with such a pest ? Who <lb/>
            would not shun it as far as possible, and keep a person <lb/>
            infected with it out of his way, for fear at some time he <lb/>
            might stumble upon it unintentionally? Those who take <lb/>
            counsel for their country, 0 Athenians, should not look for a <lb/>
            person who will communicate to them his desperation, but <lb/>
            one who will impart to them understanding and good sense <lb/>
            and a fair share of prudence. These are the things which <lb/>
            lead men to happiness : despair leads them where the de­ <lb/>
            fendant ought to pack himself off to. In considering this <lb/>
            question, have regard not to my speech, but to the general <lb/>
            customs of mankind. There are in all cities altars and. <lb/>
            temples of all the Gods, and among them one of Minerva the <lb/>
            provident, worshipped as a good and great Goddess; and at <lb/>
            Delphi there is a grand and magnificent temple to her1 im­ <lb/>
            mediately as you enter the sanctuary of Apollo; who, being <lb/>
            a God and a prophet, on both accounts knows what is best; <lb/>
            but there is no temple of despair or impudence. And there <lb/>
            are altars too among all people of justice and legality and <lb/>
            modesty, the most beautiful and holy being in the very soul <lb/>
            and nature of every man, while others are set up for all men <lb/>
            publicly to honour; but there are none of shamelessness or <note type="footnote"> 1 As to the confusion between ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">ΑθηνὴΠρόνοια</foreign>and ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αθηνὴ Προναία</foreign>, <lb/>

            pettifoggery or perjury or ingratitude, all of which qualities <lb/>
            belong to the defendant.</p>
          <p>I know that he will avoid the proper and regular course of <lb/>
            defence, and, keeping clear of that, will resort to railing and <lb/>
            abuse, and threaten to prosecute, to bring into court, to give <lb/>
            into custody, and the like. However, he'll get nothing by <lb/>
            all this with you,1 if you give your attention as you should <lb/>
            do : for has not the futility of it all been proved in case after <lb/>
            case repeatedly? Other instances I will pass by : but, Aris­ <lb/>
            togiton, you have tried seven indictments against me, having <lb/>
            hired yourself to the party who then acted for Philip ; and <lb/>
            you accused me twice when I rendered my account at the <lb/>
            audit. I pay that respect to Nemesis which it becomes me <lb/>
            as a human being, and I am deeply thankful to the Gods and <lb/>
            to all of you, 0 Athenians, who preserved me; but you, <lb/>
            Aristogiton, never were known to speak a word of truth, but <lb/>
            were always proved to be a pettifogger. If the jury then <lb/>
            should neglect to enforce the laws and should let you off to- <lb/>
            day, will you convict me now ? For what ? Only look at it <lb/>
            in this way. For two years the defendant has been obtruding <lb/>
            himself on the platform, when he has no right to speak, and <lb/>
            he does speak not withstanding. In this time he could see <lb/>
            the wretched Phocides and the brazier from Piræus and <lb/>
            the leather-dresser and all the rest whom he has accused <lb/>
            before you–he could see them wronging the state; yet he <lb/>
            did not see me, the orator, with whom he was at war, nor <lb/>
            .Lycurgus, nor the others of whom he will have something to <lb/>
            say presently. Take it either way, he deserves death: <lb/>
            whether, having a good criminal charge against us, he let us <lb/>
            off and proceeded against private men; or whether, having <lb/>
            nothing against us, he will make such statements to deceive <lb/>
            and impose upon you. Now if there really is a man in <lb/>
            the city of this way of thinking, that he must and will find <lb/>
            some one to bring vexatious charges and prosecutions, without <lb/>
            earing whether he does it justly or unjustly, he cannot find <lb/>
            any one less useful to him than the defendant. Why? <lb/>
            Because a person who is to accuse others and bring them all <lb/>
            to trial ought himself to be irreproachable, in order that his <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀδόκιμα</foreign>. Pabst–“Diess ARes wird euren Beifall nicht haben. <lb/>

            adversaries may not escape through his baseness. But there <lb/>
            is no one in the city so full of crimes, and crimes of so serious <lb/>
            a character, as the defendant. What is he then, I ask 1 Oh, <lb/>
            some men say, he is the peoples dog. What sort of a dog ? <lb/>
            One that will not bite those whom he alleges to be wolves, <lb/>
            but himself eats the sheep, whom he professes to guard. For <lb/>
            to which of the orators has he done as much mischief as he <lb/>
            has to private persons, about whom he has moved decrees <lb/>
            and been convicted for it ? What orator has he brought to <lb/>
            trial since he resumed his public speaking! None: but he <lb/>
            has brought many private persons. They say that dogs who <lb/>
            taste mutton ought to be chopped up; therefore the sooner <lb/>
            he is chopped up, the better. He is of no use, men of <lb/>
            Athens, for any of the things which he says he is; but he <lb/>
            has devised an odious and impudent mode of proceeding <lb/>
            Railing in the assemblies and making rash attacks upon all, <lb/>
            whatever cheats he has there practised on you collectively <lb/>
            by such means, for these, when he has left the platform, he <lb/>
            gets satisfaction from each of you singly, making vexatious <lb/>
            charges, demanding and extorting money-not from the <lb/>
            orators–oh dear no !-they know how to bully again-but <lb/>
            from private and inexperienced people, as they who have been <lb/>
            hit are aware. Perhaps however you will agree that this is'so, <lb/>
            but say you think him a useful man to the state, and there­ <lb/>
            fore you ought to disregard all these things and save him. <lb/>
            Men of Athens, never judge of a thing from talk, when you <lb/>
            have had experience of it in fact. The defendant has not <lb/>
            approached you for five years, during which he was con. <lb/>
            demned to silence. Who, I ask, in all this time has regretted <lb/>
            him ? What business of the state has any one observed to be <lb/>
            neglected through his absence, or what done better since bia <lb/>
            return to the platform 1 It seems to me that, on the con­ <lb/>
            trary, during the time that he never came near you the state <lb/>
            had a respite from the annoyances which he caused to all, but, <lb/>
            since he has been haranguing you again, it is besieged, as the <lb/>
            defendant never ceases to make factious and turbulent <lb/>
            speeches in every assembly.</p>
          <p>I shall now touch upon a somewhat hazardous argument, <lb/>
            and address myself to those who like him for these things. <lb/>
            In what light such persons ought to be regarded, judge for <lb/>
            yourselves : I will say no more than this, that they are not <note type="footnote"> E </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="68"/>
            wise in attaching themselves to the defendant. I assume that <lb/>
            none of you who are now in court is a person of this sort; it <lb/>
            is just and right and proper, men of Athens, that I should think <lb/>
            and speak of you thus. Of the rest of our fellow citizens, that <lb/>
            my disparaging observations may apply to as few of them as <lb/>
            possible, I assume, that the only person of this description is <lb/>
            his pupil, or, if you like, his master, Philocrates of Eleusis ; <lb/>
            not that there are not more; (would indeed that there were <lb/>
            no other admirer of Aristogiton!) but what I shrink from <lb/>
            casting as a reproach upon you, I ought not publicly to charge <lb/>
            the other citizens with; and besides, the argument will have <lb/>
            the same effect, addressed to one. What sort of a person <lb/>
            he must be who finds Aristogiton to his taste, I shall forbear <lb/>
            to inquire very minutely, for fear I should be driven into <lb/>
            discussions of an offensive character: but I say this-If <lb/>
            Aristogiton is in downright earnest a rascal, a malignant <lb/>
            fellow, a pettifogger, that, in short, which he gives himself <lb/>
            out for, I concede, I allow, that you, Philocrates, who are a <lb/>
            person of that sort, ought to preserve one who resembles you: <lb/>
            for, when all other people are doing their duty and observing <lb/>
            the laws, no harm, I think, could come to you by it. But if <lb/>
            he is a retailer and huckster and barterer of roguery, and sold <lb/>
            every action of his life almost by weight and measure, why, <lb/>
            foolish man, do you spur him on ? Surely a cook can do <lb/>
            nothing with a knife that will not cut; and a man, who wants <lb/>
            to harass and annoy every one by his own measures, can make <lb/>
            no use of a pettifogger who will sell him. That such is the <lb/>
            defendant's character, I need not inform you, for you know it <lb/>
            already. You remember how he sold the impeachment <lb/>
            against Hegemon: you know how he let drop the indictments <lb/>
            against Demades. In the late case of the olive-dealer Aga­ <lb/>
            thou, after bawling and crying shame! shame! and turning <lb/>
            everything upside down in the assemblies, and calling out for <lb/>
            the torture, he received something or other, and, though he <lb/>
            was present at the man's acquittal, he kept his mouth shut. <lb/>
            The impeachment which he held in terror over Democles – <lb/>
            what did he do with it ? There are plenty of other cases : it <lb/>
            would be tiresome for me to mention them all; and I am <lb/>
            certain you have memorandums1 of them, as you were his <note type="footnote"> 1 Either memoranda of the proceedings in the several causes, as <lb/>
            Beiske explains it in his Index, or copies of the arrangements made </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="69"/>
            jobbing assistant. What man then, good or bad, would save <lb/>
            a fellow of this description ? and on what account ? (for he is <lb/>
            the betrayer of those who are like him, and the natural and <lb/>
            hereditary enemy of the good :) unless one thinks, in a spirit <lb/>
            of husbandry, that the seed and root of a pettifogger and <lb/>
            a rogue ought to be preserved for the state. But this, 0 <lb/>
            Athenians, would be dishonourable, yea, by the Gods, I think <lb/>
            it would be impious. Your ancestors, I conceive, did not <lb/>
            build these courts of justice for you, that you should make <lb/>
            them a nursery to propagate persons of this character, but, <lb/>
            on the contrary, that you should check and chastise them, <lb/>
            and that baseness should not become an object of ambition or <lb/>
            desire.</p>
          <p>A vicious inclination, I suspect, is a difficult thing to <lb/>
            eradicate. For, when Aristogiton is tried for acknowledged <lb/>
            crimes, and has not perished long ago, what can one do or say ? <lb/>
            He has arrived at such a pitch of wickedness, that, even after <lb/>
            the information had been laid against him, he never ceased <lb/>
            bawling, slandering, and threatening people : the generals, to <lb/>
            whose hands you entrusted the most important affairs, because <lb/>
            they would not give him money when he asked it, he said he <lb/>
            would not choose even to be superintendents of privies; which <lb/>
            was no reproach to them, no ; (for they might by giving him <lb/>
            a small sum of money have escaped the abuse;) but it was <lb/>
            an insult to your election, and an exhibition of his own base­ <lb/>
            ness : the magistrates chosen by lot he worried, asked and <lb/>
            extorted money from them, and gave them every possible <lb/>
            annoyance: and upon this last occasion he endeavoured to <lb/>
            throw all of us into squabbles and confusion, by publishing <lb/>
            false papers ; for, in fact, he was born to do everybody mis­ <lb/>
            chief, and his life proves him to be a person of that kind.</p>
          <p>Just consider. There are altogether about twenty thousand <lb/>
            Athenians. Each of them walks about the market-place, <lb/>
            doing (I may venture to say) some kind of business, either <lb/>
            public or private. But the defendant does none; he cannot <lb/>
            show any respectable or honest employment in which his life <lb/>
            is engaged. His mind is not occupied in promoting any <lb/>
            political good; he attends not to any trade or husbandry or <lb/>
            other business; he is connected with no one by ties of <note type="footnote"> between Aristogiton and the persons with whom he compounded his <lb/>
            charges, or copies of agreements between him and Philocrates. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="70"/>
            humanity or social union : but he walks through the market- <lb/>
            place like a viperl or a scorpion, with his sting uplifted, <lb/>
            hastening here and there, and looking out for some one whom <lb/>
            he may bring into a scrape, or fasten some calumny or mis­ <lb/>
            chief upon, and put in alarm, in order to extort money. He <lb/>
            does not frequent any one of the barbers' shops in the city, <lb/>
            or the perfumers', or any other such establishment; he is im­ <lb/>
            placable, undomiciled, unsociable,2 having no feeling of kind­ <lb/>
            ness or friendship, nor any other which a right-minded man has. <lb/>
            He goes about with those companions with whom painters <lb/>
            represent the impious in Hades, namely, with imprecation <lb/>
            and malediction and envy and dissension and discord. A man <lb/>
            who is likely to find no favour even with the Gods in Hades, <lb/>
            but rather to be thrust among the damned on account of the <lb/>
            wickedness of his life-will you, instead of punishing him <lb/>
            when his crime is detected, send him forth with greater <lb/>
            honours than 3 your benefactors ? For whom have you ever <lb/>
            allowed, when he owed a debt to the treasury, to enjoy civic <lb/>
            rights without paying if! No one. Then don't allow the <lb/>
            defendant now; but punish and make him an example to <lb/>
            others.</p>
          <p>It is worth your while, men of Athens, to hear the rest. <lb/>
            What you have just heard from Lycurgus is dreadful enough, <lb/>
            as dreadful as can be; yet what I have to mention will be <lb/>
            found to match with it, and to be quite of a piece. For, <lb/>
            besides that he left Eretria and abandoned his father in prison, <note type="footnote"> 1 Cicero, ad Herennium, Lib. iv 49, seems to refer to this passage: </note><note type="footnote"> “ Imago est formæ cum formâ. cum quâdam similitudine collatio. <lb/>

              as you have heard from Phædrus, this odious wretch would <lb/>
              not bury him when he died, nor pay those who did bury him <lb/>
              their expenses, but even commenced an action against them. <lb/>
              And besides that he has not kept his hands off his mother, <lb/>
              as you lately heard from the witnesses, he sold his sister­ <lb/>
              not a sister by the same father, but his mother's daughter <lb/>
              and his own sister, at all events, whoever her father was, <lb/>
              (for that I pass by)–he sold her, I say, to be taken into <lb/>
              a foreign country, as is stated by the plaint in the action <lb/>
              which was brought against him on that very account by this <lb/>
              worthy brother here, who will presently assist in his defence. <lb/>
              In addition to these things, which (heaven and earth!) are bad <lb/>
              enough, you shall hear another matter. When he broke his <lb/>
              prison and ran away, he goes at that time to a certain woman <lb/>
              named Zobia, whom-it seems he once cohabited with ; and she <lb/>
              keeps him in concealment during those first days when the <lb/>
              Eleven were searching for him and having him cried; after <lb/>
              that she gave him eight drachms to pay the expense of his <lb/>
              journey, and also a tunic and cloak, and sent him off to Megara. <lb/>
              Afterwards, when he was making a stir here and had become <lb/>
              a great man, and when this person who had been his bene­ <lb/>
              factress complained to him and reminded him of the service <lb/>
              she had done and asked for a requital, he gave her a box on <lb/>
              the ear, and dismissed her from his house with a threat: she <lb/>
              would not be quiet, but went, as was natural for a woman to <lb/>
              do, among her acquaintances, and talked of her grievance; <lb/>
              upon which, he took her off with his own hand to the sale­ <lb/>

              to have been paid, she would have been sold through this man, <lb/>
              who was indebted to her for his safety. To prove the truth <lb/>
              of my statements, call me the person who has not received <lb/>
              payment for his father's funeral, and the arbitrator in the <lb/>
              action which this man here brought against him for the sale <lb/>
              of his sister, and produce the plaint. And call me first of all <lb/>
              the patron of Zobia, who harboured him, and the commis­ <lb/>
              sioners of sales, to whom he took her off. You expressed <lb/>
              indignation just now, that he should accuse those who had sub­ <lb/>
              scribed to save him. The monster is odious-odious, men of <lb/>
              Athens, and unfit to associate with. Read the depositions. <note type="footnote"> 1 See Vol. ii. Appendix III. p. 251 ; and my article Poletæ in the <lb/>

          <p>What penalty then can be sufficient for a man who has <lb/>
            committed so many grave offences ? what punishment severe <lb/>
            enough ? Death would in my opinion <unclear>’s</unclear> too mild.</p>
          <p>I will mention one more of his misdeeds in private, and <lb/>
            pass by the rest. Before he left the prison, there came in <lb/>
            upon forfeit of bail1 a person from Tanagra, who had a pocket- <lb/>
            book in his possession. Aristogiton comes and has some chat <lb/>
            with him, and steals the pocket-book. Upon the man's <lb/>
            charging him with the theft, and insisting with vehemence <lb/>
            that no one else could have stolen it, he was brute enough to <lb/>
            try to strike him. The man being fresh and newly come, got <lb/>
            the better of Aristogiton, who was dried and shrivelled up 2 <lb/>
            from long confinement; so, when it had come to this, he <lb/>
            bites off the man's nose. The poor fellow in this calamity <lb/>
            gave up searching for the book, and afterwards they find it <lb/>
            in a box, of which the defendant had the key. Upon this the <lb/>
            men in prison pass a resolution, not to share fire or light, <lb/>
            meat or drink, with Aristogiton, and that none of them should <lb/>
            either give him anything or take anything from him. To <lb/>
            prove my statements, call me the man himself whose nose <lb/>
            this brutal wretch bit off and swallowed.</p>

            much more abandoned than themselves, as to exclude him <lb/>
            from their society--could you without shame admit him to <lb/>
            intercourse with yourselves–him who is by law an outcast <lb/>
            from the constitution 1 What part of his conduct or his life <lb/>
            do you approve, that you should do so, or which of all his <lb/>
            proceedings does not disgust you ? is he not godless 1 is he <lb/>
            not brutal ? is he not polluted 1 is he not a pettifogger ?</p>
          <p>And yet, notwithstanding all that he is and all that he <lb/>
            does, he is eternally shouting in the assemblies, " I am your <lb/>
            only well-wisher; all these men are conspirators; you are <lb/>
            betrayed; my goodwill is the only thing left you." I shall <lb/>
            be glad to examine this mighty and violent affection of his <lb/>
            for you, and to see how he gets it and whence it is derived, <lb/>
            that, if it is what he represents, you may make use of it and <lb/>
            put confidence in it, if otherwise, that you may be on your <lb/>
            guard. Do you suppose, because you passed sentence of <lb/>
            death upon his father, and sold his mother as a slave after <lb/>
            conviction for undutifulness to her patron,1 that on these <lb/>
            accounts he is well disposed to you ? By Jupiter and <lb/>
            all the Gods, that would be most unnatural! For if he is <lb/>
            attached to them and observes the law of nature, which is <lb/>
            one and the same both for men and beasts, and whose rule is <lb/>
            to love parents, it is plain he must be hostile to a people who <lb/>
            have destroyed them, and to the laws and constitution of that <lb/>
            people. If he does not resent these things, who, I should like <lb/>
            to know, seeing that he has cast off his regard for his parents, <lb/>
            believes in that which he now professes for his country 1 For <lb/>
            my part, I consider that a person who neglects his parents is <lb/>
            unworthy of trust, and is an enemy not only to men, but to <lb/>
            the Gods.2 But I suppose, because you convicted him upon <lb/>
            the information, and twice put him in prison, and his brother <note type="footnote"> 1 See Vol. iii. Appendix III. p. 251. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 He speaks in the spirit of the Athenian law, which severely <lb/>
            punished those who neglected their parents. See Vol. iii. Appendix <lb/>
            VIII. p. 351. As to the sentiment, compare Shakspeare, King Lear, <lb/>
            Act IV. Scene 2:— <lb/>
            I fear your disposition : <lb/>
            That nature which contemns its origin <lb/>

            She that herself will sliver and disbranch <lb/>

            as well as him, he is on these accounts well-disposed to you. <lb/>
            Why, that also would be unnatural. Or perhaps, because you <lb/>
            deprived him on his probation of the office to which he was <lb/>
            chosen by lot Or because you condemned him for moving <lb/>
            an illegal decree ! Or because you imposed on him a penalty <lb/>
            of five talents! Or because you point at him with your <lb/>
            fingers to designate him as the vilest of mankind! Or be­ <lb/>
            cause, while the present laws and constitution subsist, it is <lb/>
            impossible for him to be freed from all this disgrace ! On <lb/>
            what account then is the defendant well-disposed to you ? <lb/>
            Because (to use his own words) he is impudent. And from <lb/>
            what does an impudent man derive his name, but from this, <lb/>
            that he dares, for want of shame, to assert that which is untrue <lb/>
            and which never can be true; as the defendant does ?</p>
          <p>There are some points as to the information, which I <lb/>
            thought Lycurgus omitted, upon which I ought to address <lb/>
            a few words to you. I hold that you ought to try the <lb/>
            defendant and the rights of this case in the same manner as <lb/>
            if you were considering a question of private debt. Suppose <lb/>
            now that one man charged another with owing him a sum of <lb/>
            money, and the other denied it; if the covenant upon which <lb/>
            he borrowed the money were shown to be in existence,1 and <lb/>
            the tablets which were set up to be standing,2 you would hold <lb/>
            the party denying the debt to be an impudent person ; if <lb/>
            they were shown to be removed or destroyed, you would <lb/>
            think the complainant an impudent person : it is natural you <lb/>
            should. Well: of Aristogiton's debt to the state there are <lb/>
            these evidences: his covenant, the laws, according to which <lb/>
            all debtors are registered ; his tablet, the board which lies <lb/>
            in the temple of the Goddess. If indeed these are removed, <lb/>
            and the debt is cancelled, we are talking nonsense, or rather <lb/>
            telling falsehoods; but if they still exist, and will exist and <lb/>
            abide until he has paid the debt, then the defendant is not <lb/>
            speaking a word of truth, but is a wrong-doer and a criminal <lb/>
            for endeavouring to destroy a just claim of the public. For <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">κείμεναι</foreign>, " remaining where they were deposited -which was <lb/>

            we are not now trying or arguing, whether he owes all that <lb/>
            he once owed, but whether he owes anything at all. Or it <lb/>
            would be hard indeed upon those who are entered for a <lb/>
            drachm only, if, because they have done little or no wrong, <lb/>
            the fact of their being debtors must operate to their preju­ <lb/>
            dice ; while a person who has done grievous wrong may have <lb/>
            his franchise on making one or two payments. Besides, the <lb/>
            debts which are entered against Aristogiton, and for which <lb/>
            the information is laid, are three in number. Two of them <lb/>
            he has returned as being due ;1 the other he has not re­ <lb/>
            turned, but he prosecutes Ariston of Alopece for a fraudulent <lb/>
            entry. " Yes, " says he ; " for he has entered my name un­ <lb/>
            justly." For this then, as it seems, you must obtain satisfac­ <lb/>
            tion. But then it is necessary first to render satisfaction, and <lb/>
            to submit to the penalty which has been imposed on you; or <lb/>
            for what shall you obtain satisfaction ? For, if it is lawful <lb/>
            for you to act in every respect like other men, what wrong <lb/>
            have you suffered ? I beg of you, men of Athens, to consider <lb/>
            this. Should he convict Ariston of fraudulent entry, what <lb/>
            will be the consequence I His name will be expunged, I sup­ <lb/>
            pose, and Ariston's will be entered instead; that is what the <lb/>
            laws prescribe. Very good. I ask then, will this man whose <lb/>
            name is expunged be indebted to the treasury from that day, <lb/>
            and the other who is entered have his franchise 1 According to <lb/>
            what the defendant now contends for, this is the result; for if, <lb/>
            when his name is entered, he is not a debtor, when it is ex­ <lb/>
            punged, he will of course be a debtor. But this is not so ; it <lb/>
            can't be : the truth is that, when his name is expunged, then <lb/>
            he will not be a debtor; he is therefore a debtor now. But <note type="footnote"> I Because the very proposal to give his land in mortgage was an <lb/>
            acknowledgment of the debt; and there was doubtless a record of this <lb/>
            in the public register. Pabst, following Reiske, translates, " Zwei hat <lb/>
            er bezahlt und ausstreichen lassen.” I cannot see that this agrees <lb/>
            either with the words or the argument of the orator. Auger, who <lb/>
            gives the same translation, confesses candidly enough that he does not <lb/>
            understand the passage: " Ce que vent dire dans le texte <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐν ἀπογραφῇ <lb/>
            πεποίηται</foreign>. je l'ignore absolument." </note><note type="footnote"> The argument runs thus :—" There are three debts. I need not <lb/>
            trouble myself about two of them, for they are not in question; Aris. <lb/>
            togiton having admitted their existence when he mortgaged his land <lb/>
            for them. The third alone he denies, accusing Ariston of having <lb/>
            falsely entered it." Then he proceeds to show the fallacy of Aristo­ <unclear/> <lb/>
            ginon's argument with respect to it. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="76"/>
            what say you to this ? If Ariston be acquitted, from whom <lb/>
            will the state get satisfaction for what the defendant does now <lb/>
            without any right! And those persons whom he appears <lb/>
            against in the court, going about and proposing penalties of <lb/>
            death and imprisonment, how are they to recover their lives, <lb/>
            or indemnity for their sufferings ? For this man, whom the <lb/>
            laws allow not to share even common and ordinary rights, <lb/>
            brings irretrievable misfortune upon others in a way that is <lb/>
            neither just nor constitutional, nor for your advantage. For <lb/>
            my own part, when I see these things, I wonder what your <lb/>
            notion is of things being upside down. Is it the earth being <lb/>
            up there, and the stars down here ? That can never take place, <lb/>
            and I trust it never will. But when those, who have no liberty <lb/>
            by the laws, have liberty by your wills; when profligacy is <lb/>
            honoured and virtue discarded ; when what is just and useful <lb/>
            is overpowered by envy; then we should consider that every­ <lb/>
            thing has been turned upside down.</p>
          <p>I have seen persons on their trial before now, who, being <lb/>
            convicted by the facts, and having no means of proving their <lb/>
            innocence, appealed, as a last resort, either to their general <lb/>
            respectability and good behaviour, or to the deeds and services <lb/>
            of their ancestors, or to something else of that sort, by which <lb/>
            they moved the jury to compassion and clemency. Upon <lb/>
            none of those topics has the defendant any footing that I can <lb/>
            see : to him such ground opens nothing but precipices, whirl­ <lb/>
            pools, abysses. For of what really can he speak ? Of some­ <lb/>
            thing that his father has done, perhaps. Why, you passed <lb/>
            sentence of death upon him in these courts here, doubtless <lb/>
            because he was a rogue and deserved to die. I suppose <lb/>
            however, if this about his father is an awkward matter, he <lb/>
            will appeal to his own life, as being so decent and respectable. <lb/>
            What life ? where spent ? That which you have all witnessed <lb/>
            is not one of this character. Oh but, my good sir, he will <lb/>
            fall back upon the public services. When performed, and <lb/>
            where ? Those of his father ? There are none. His own ? <lb/>
            Presentments, arrests, informations you will find, but no ser­ <lb/>
            vices. But perhaps, even without these, a host of relations, <lb/>
            worthy and good men, will come forward to beg him off. <lb/>
            Why, he has none, and never had any; how could he, when <lb/>
            he is not even free born ? I beg pardon ; he has a brother, <lb/>
            this person who is here, and who commenced that pretty <lb/>
             <pb n="77"/>
            action against him. Other things about him there is no need <lb/>
            to mention. Brother he is to the defendant both on the <lb/>
            father's and the mother's side, and, to his further misfortune, <lb/>
            a twin brother. This person–I pass by other matters-but <lb/>
            the poisons and the enchantments, for which you put to death <lb/>
            that detestable poisoning woman, the Lemnian Theodoris.1 <lb/>
            and her whole race with her; these he got from her servant, <lb/>
            who gave the information against her, and by whom this <lb/>
            rascal has had children; and now he practises juggling tricks <lb/>
            and impostures, and professes to cure epileptic people, being <lb/>
            himself an epilept with every kind of baseness. This person, <lb/>
            I say, will petition for him; this poisoner, this pest, whom <lb/>
            any one would regard as an object of evil omen rather than <lb/>
            wish to address ; a man who has pronounced himself worthy <lb/>
            of death 2 by bringing such an action.</p>
          <p>What then remains, 0 Athenians ? Those aids, I suppose, <lb/>
            which are common to all persons on their trial, derived from <lb/>
            the feelings of you, their countrymen ; for the accused never <lb/>
            finds them for himself, but each juror brings them with him <lb/>
            from home: I mean mercy, compassion, humanity. But it <lb/>
            is not right, before God or man, to give this odious creature <lb/>
            the benefit of such feelings. Why is it not ? Because, what­ <lb/>
            ever law a man has in his own nature for his fellow-men, the <lb/>
            same ought to be applied to him by each of them. What <lb/>
            law do you think Aristogiton has for all ? what wish does he <lb/>
            cherish ? Think ye he wishes to see them prosperous, and <lb/>
            living in happiness and honour ? And what will he do to <lb/>
            live 1 For the misfortunes of others support him. He there­ <lb/>
            fore wishes all people to be involved in litigation and trials <lb/>
            and foul charges. This is his husbandry, this his trade. <lb/>
            Pray tell me, Athenians, what sort of a person deserves to be <lb/>
            called an out-and-out rogue, an accursed wretch, a common <lb/>

            allotted to try them, 0 Athenians, in the discharge of their <lb/>
            duty preserved; and, while they acquitted the objects of his <lb/>
            persecution, they did not give him a fifth part of the votes. But <lb/>
            his bitterness and bloodthirstiness and cruelty were found at <lb/>
            their post: he saw children and mothers of the accused, in <lb/>
            some cases aged women, standing before the tribunal, and had <lb/>
            no pity on them. And is there mercy for you, Aristogiton ? <lb/>
            On what account, and from whom? Or do your children <lb/>
            deserve compassion ?Far from it. You have forfeited their <lb/>
            title to compassion, or rather you have destroyed it wholly. <lb/>
            Do not then approach the harbours which you have yourself <lb/>
            blocked up and filled with stakes ;1 for it is not just.</p>
          <p>If you were to hear the slanders which he uttered against <lb/>
            you as he walked round the market-place, you would detest <lb/>
            him still more; and justly. He says that many persons are <lb/>
            indebted to the treasury, and that they are all in the same <lb/>
            predicament with himself. I grant that the unfortunate are <lb/>
            many, even though they are but two ; for they are decidedly <lb/>
            more than they should be, and none of the other citizens <lb/>
            ought to be state debtors. But most assuredly I don't think <lb/>
            they are in the same predicament with the defendant, nor <lb/>
            anything like it, but quite the contrary. Just consider-and <lb/>
            don't imagine, 0 Athenians, that I am addressing you as <lb/>
            persons indebted to the treasury; for it is not the fact, and <lb/>
            I trust never will be, and I don't believe it. But should any <lb/>
            one of you happen to have a friend or acquaintance among <lb/>
            that class, I will show you that on his account you ought to <lb/>
            detest the defendant. In the first place, because honest men, <lb/>
            who have become sureties, and done acts of kindness, and <lb/>
            contracted private debts, to which no criminality is attached, <lb/>
            and who have fallen into misfortune-such men he puts in <lb/>
            the same rank of infamy with himself, which is neither right <lb/>
            nor proper. For it is not the same thing, Aristogiton, nor <note type="footnote"> 1 As to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰρόβολοι</foreign>, see the Oration on the Chersonese, Vol. i. p. 111. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="79"/>
            anything like it, for you, who moved that three citizens should <lb/>
            be put to death without trial, to be indicted and convicted <lb/>
            for an illegal motion, and, when sentence of death ought to <lb/>
            have followed, to be let off with a fine, and for one who has <lb/>
            become security for a friend to be unable to pay an unex­ <lb/>
            pected penalty. It is not the same thing; no ! In the next <lb/>
            place, Aristogiton, as far as it depends upon himself, breaks <lb/>
            up and destroys that general good feeling which you have <lb/>
            naturally for one another; as you may see from what I am <lb/>
            about to say. You, men of Athens, exercising, as I have <lb/>
            said, your natural kind feelings towards each other, live toge­ <lb/>
            ther in the commonwealth much in the same way that rela­ <lb/>
            tions dwell together in their private houses. How then do <lb/>
            they manage ? Where there is a father with grown-up sons, <lb/>
            and perhaps their children also, there must necessarily be <lb/>
            many different inclinations; for youth and age neither talk <lb/>
            nor act in the same manner. However, if the young are dis­ <lb/>
            creet, they contrive in all that they do, if possible, to escape <lb/>
            observation, or, if they cannot, at all events to have the ap­ <lb/>
            pearance of desiring it: and the elder people again, if they <lb/>
            chance to observe any expenditure, or any drinking or plea­ <lb/>
            suring that passes the bounds of moderation, see it without <lb/>
            appearing to have seen. And by such means everything is <lb/>
            done which human nature prompts, and is done well. Just <lb/>
            in the same manner you, 0 Athenians, live in the state in a <lb/>
            spirit of relationship and humanity; the bulk of you so look­ <lb/>
            ing at the acts of unfortunate men, as (to use the words of <lb/>
            the proverb) seeing not to see and hearing not to hear, while <lb/>
            they manage in all their proceedings to display a cautious <lb/>
            reserve and sense of shame. And by such means that. uni­ <lb/>
            versal concord, which is the origin of all blessings, is esta­ <lb/>
            blished and abides in the commonwealth. This state of things, <lb/>
            so happily settled by your natures and habits; Aristogiton <lb/>
            disturbs, destroys, and casts to the wind; and, what every <lb/>
            other man who has been unfortunate does without noise, he <lb/>
            performs almost with bells round his neck. Neither presi­ <lb/>
            dent, nor crier, nor chairman, nor assistant tribe,1 can control <lb/>
            him. And now, when any of you, annoyed at the defendant's <lb/>
            indecent conduct, says–“ This fellow to act in such a way, <note type="footnote"> 1 Those who sat on the steps of the platform to keep order. See <lb/>
            VoL ii. Appendix V. p. 341. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="80"/>
            when he is a debtor to the treasury too !" " Well ! isn't such <lb/>
            and such a one a debtor ?”–this is the answer you get, every <lb/>
            man naming his private enemy : and thus Aristogiton's pro­ <lb/>
            fligacy draws forth these reproaches, which are cast upon <lb/>
            persons who do not resemble him.</p>
          <p>It remains then, 0 Athenians, for those who wish to get <lb/>
            rid of this man, now that they have a crime clearly proved <lb/>
            according to the laws, to pass sentence of death upon him <lb/>
            (that is the best course), or at all events to impose such a <lb/>
            pecuniary fine as he will not be able to pay: there is no <lb/>
            other way of getting quit of him, you may be assured. <lb/>
            Among the rest of mankind, 0 Athenians, you may observe, <lb/>
            that the good and honest, by their own natural impulse, do <lb/>
            what is right; those less estimable, who yet fall not within <lb/>
            the rank of the very bad, avoid committing faults through <lb/>
            fear of you and through their sensibility to reproach and dis­ <lb/>
            grace ; the worst sort, the most wicked wretches (to use a <lb/>
            common expression), are brought to their senses by misfor­ <lb/>
            tune. But this Aristogiton has so far surpassed all mankind <lb/>
            in wickedness, that even suffering has not been a warning to <lb/>
            him; he has again been caught in the same acts of injustice <lb/>
            and encroachment. And he deserves your wrath far more <lb/>
            now than he did before, because then he only thought proper <lb/>
            to move illegal decrees, whereas now he does everything- <lb/>
            accuses, speaks in public, utters foul and abusive language <lb/>
            proposes sentences of death, brings impeachments, slanders <lb/>
            citizens possessed of their franchise, he himself being a debtor <lb/>
            to the treasury ; nothing can be more atrocious than this. To <lb/>
            admonish him would be madness : he that never was fright­ <lb/>
            ened nor put down by that tumult with which your whole <lb/>
            assembly admonish troublesome persons–he’d be likely to <lb/>
            mind the warning of a single individual. The defendant's <lb/>
            case is incurable, incurable, men of Athens. As physicians <lb/>
            therefore, when they see a cancer or an ulcer or anything of <lb/>
            the sort which is incurable, burn it out, or cut it wholly away, <lb/>
            so ought you to exterminate this monster, to cast him out of <lb/>
            the commonwealth, to destroy him, not waiting till you suffer <lb/>
            something which I pray may never befall you either publicly <lb/>
            or privately, but taking timely precaution against it. For <lb/>
            just consider. None of you, I dare say, was ever bitten by <lb/>
            a viper or a tarantula, and I hope you never will be; but <lb/>
             <pb n="81"/>
            yet, whenever you see creatures of that kind, you kill them <lb/>
            directly. In like manner then, 0 Athenians, when you see <lb/>
            a pettifogger, or a man bitter and viper-like in his nature, <lb/>
            don't wait till he bites you, but whoever lights upon him, give <lb/>
            him his deserts.</p>
          <p>Lycurgus called Pallas and the mother of the Gods to <lb/>
            witness, and he did well. I invoke your ancestors and their <lb/>
            virtues, whose memory not even time has effaced ; and no <lb/>
            wonder: for they governed the state, not by lending them­ <lb/>
            selves to assist knaves and pettifoggers, not by venting spite <lb/>
            upon each other within the walls, but by honouring both <lb/>
            orators and private citizens who were virtuous and good, <lb/>
            while the wicked and the audacious they detested and <lb/>
            punished : the consequence of which was, that all were com­ <lb/>
            petitors in honourable deeds.</p>
          <p>One thing further, and I have done. You will go forth <lb/>
            presently from the court, and all who have stood around, <lb/>
            foreigners as well as citizens, will take a view of you, and will <lb/>
            look at every man who passes, one by one, and know those <lb/>
            who have given votes of acquittal by their countenances. <lb/>
            What will you say then, men of Athens, if you go forth as <lb/>
            persons who have abandoned the laws ? With what faces, <lb/>
            with what eyes will you meet the gaze of each beholder ? <lb/>
            How can you go to the temple of Cybele,1 if you have <lb/>
            any occasion ? Could you individually and separately have <lb/>
            recourse to the laws, as being in force, if you all collectively <lb/>
            quit the court without having affirmed them ? Surely not. <lb/>
            How on the first day of the month will you ascend to the <lb/>
            Acropolis, and implore the Gods to grant prosperity to the <lb/>
            state and to each of yourselves, when, Aristogiton and his <lb/>
            worthy father being there,2 you have given a judgment con­ <lb/>
            trary to your oaths and to the facts there registered ? Or <lb/>
            what will you say, Athenians, what will you say, should any <lb/>
            one guess the acquitting jurors and put the question to you ? <lb/>
            What will you answer ? That you like this man ? And who <lb/>
            will venture to say so ? Where is the person who would <lb/>
            inherit his baseness, attended with execration and dishonour ? <note type="footnote"> I In this were archives of the Athenian laws, to which every citizen <lb/>
            had access. See <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νόμος</foreign>, Arch. Diet. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 I.e. their names being there entered as debtors. For, though the <lb/>

            Will not each of you rather say that he did not acquit ? <lb/>
            Then you'll execrate those that did, each thus giving proof <lb/>
            that he was not one of them. And wherefore resort to this, <lb/>
            when good words might be on your lips, when all might im­ <lb/>

            Athenians for you, and I may add the foreigners also and <lb/>
            their wives and children ? For the defendant's mischievous <lb/>
            activity has reached, verily it has reached all; and all would <lb/>
            rejoice to be delivered from his wickedness, and to see <lb/>
            punishment inflicted upon him.</p>

          </head>
          <p>THAT Aristogiton the defendant is a debtor to the treasury, <lb/>
            and that he is not possessed of his franchise, and that the <lb/>
            laws expressly prohibit such persons from speaking in public, <lb/>
            has been clearly shown, men of the jury. It is your duty <lb/>
            to repress and restrain all people who break the laws, but <lb/>
            most especially those who hold magisterial offices and take a <lb/>
            part in political affairs. For through them the republic can­ <lb/>
            not help being either injured, if they are vicious, or, on the <lb/>
            other hand, greatly benefited if they are virtuous and choose <lb/>
            to observe the laws. If you once allow those who undertake <lb/>
            any public duty to violate the laws and set at nought the <lb/>
            rules of justice, it is a matter of course that all who belong <lb/>
            to the state should suffer by it. For as mistakes occurring <lb/>
            on board ship in a voyage, if committed by any of the com­ <lb/>
            mon sailors, cause but slight damage, but, if the pilot commits <lb/>
            a fault, the mischief which he does extends to all the pas­ <lb/>
            sengers ; in like manner the errors of private men do injury <lb/>
            not to the multitude, but to themselves, whereas those of <lb/>
            magistrates and statesmen reach the whole people, and there­ <lb/>
            fore Solon ordained that punishments for private men should <lb/>
            be slow, but speedy for official personages and political leaders ; <lb/>
            for he thought that from the former we might get satisfaction <lb/>
            in the course of time, but from the latter we could not wait <lb/>
            for it: and in fact there would be nobody left to punish, if <lb/>
            the constitution was overthrown.</p><pb n="83"/>
            
          <p>No one is impudent or arrogant enough to dispute these <lb/>
            principles, except this wicked wretch Aristogiton. We shall <lb/>
            find, they are submitted to by all our magistrates and states­ <lb/>
            men, when you have once passed any sentence against them. <lb/>
            For example, when any of the men in office are deposed, they <lb/>
            immediately cease to exercise their functions and are deprived <lb/>
            of their crowns; and again, such of the Judges as are not <lb/>
            promoted to the Areopagus never think of forcing themselves <lb/>
            into the place, but acquiesce patiently in your decision. And <lb/>
            it is reasonable they should do so : for as, while they are in <lb/>
            office, they consider that private men are bound to obey them, <lb/>
            so, when they have returned themselves to a private station, <lb/>
            it is right they should conform to the laws which govern the <lb/>
            state. And if you will look back to the earliest times, you <lb/>
            will see that all our statesmen in the same way submitted to <lb/>
            your ordinances. Aristides, they say, after being removed by <lb/>
            your ancestors, dwelt in Ægina until the people received him <lb/>
            back; and Miltiades and Pericles owing to the state, one of <lb/>
            them thirty and the other fifty talents, did not harangue the <lb/>
            people until they had paid. And it would be a most shock­ <lb/>
            ing thing to happen, that, while your greatest benefactors <lb/>
            could not obtain the privilege of acting for you contrary to <lb/>
            the established laws, a person who has done no service, but <lb/>
            committed innumerable offences, should be seen thus easily, <lb/>
            against justice and the public good, to have obtained from <lb/>
            you a license to infringe the laws ? But why need I speak of <lb/>
            ancient times ? Consider the men of your own day, and see <lb/>
            if any of them has ever been so outrageous. You will not <lb/>
            find one, if you look closely into the matter. Let me further <lb/>
            observe--when any one prefers an indictment to the Judges <lb/>
            against a law or a decree, the law or decree is invalid, and <lb/>
            the proposer or mover makes no impudent resistance, but <lb/>
            acquiesces in what you decide, even though he is the most <lb/>
            powerful orator or most able politician among you. Is it not <lb/>
            monstrous then, that what your whole assembled body has <lb/>
            voted according to the laws should be invalid, yet that Aris­ <lb/>
            togiton's inclination to break the laws should, with your con­ <lb/>
            sent, have greater effect than the laws themselves ? Again­ <lb/>
            when any prosecutor has failed to get a fifth part of the votes, <lb/>
            in those cases in which the laws declare that he shall not <note type="footnote"> o2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="84"/>
            indict or arrest or give into custody1 for the future, the <lb/>
            result is similar : none of the persons under any such penal <lb/>
            sentence ventures to act in defiance of it. Aristogiton, as it <lb/>
            seems, is the only man whose will is to be superior to the <lb/>
            court and to the <unclear>lav</unclear>. Neither you nor your ancestors ever <lb/>
            repented of observing all these ordinances, for it is the pre­ <lb/>
            servation of democracy, to overcome its enemies either by <lb/>
            counsel or by arms, but to submit to the laws either by <lb/>
            choice or by constraint. And that such course of action is <lb/>
            becoming, is acknowledged on the part of the defendant him­ <lb/>
            self. For after the misfortune of the Greeks at Chæronea, <lb/>
            when the city was in the extreme of peril, fearing for her very <lb/>
            foundations, and when Hyperides moved 2 that the disfran­ <lb/>
            chised should be restored to their rights, so that all might <lb/>
            join zealously and harmoniously in the struggle for freedom, <lb/>
            if any danger of such magnitude should menace the state, <lb/>
            Aristogiton indicted this decree as illegal, and appeared as <lb/>
            prosecutor in court. Is it not shocking, that this man <lb/>
            should not allow any citizen to obtain his franchise to acoom­ <lb/>
            plish his country's deliverance, and yet should demand the <lb/>
            same privilege from you to pursue his own lawless course I <lb/>
            Surely that vote was far more legal and more just than the <lb/>
            one which you now ask these jurors to pass for you. The one <lb/>
            was equitable and applied to all the citizens; the other was <lb/>
            inequitable, designed for your special advantage, and yours <lb/>
            alone. The one had for its object to prevent a peace by <lb/>
            whose terms a single man became master of the whole govern­ <lb/>
            ment; the other to give to you alone a license to defeat the <lb/>
            resolutions of these men, to transgress with impunity the <lb/>
            laws transmitted from ancient times by your ancestors, and to <lb/>
            do whatever you please. I should be glad to ask him whether <lb/>
            his indictment of the decree was just and lawful, or, on the <lb/>
            contrary, unjust and illegal: for, if it was improper and in­ <lb/>
            jurious to the people, for that very reason he deserves to die; <lb/>
            if it was advantageous and beneficial to the many, why <lb/>
            do you now require these men to pass a vote contrary tc <lb/>

            client for you. I see that you, men of the jury, hold this <lb/>
            opinion in regard to yourselves: for you have before now <lb/>
            given judgment upon many informations against private men. <lb/>
            Would it not be shameful that you should strictly put the <lb/>
            laws in force in your own case, and yet be so resigned in <lb/>
            the case of these busybodies, who make themselves a public <lb/>
            nuisance and endeavour to lord it over all ?</p>
          <p>Surely none of you can take this view, that it ought to be <lb/>
            as I say, but that, on account of Aristogiton's good character <lb/>
            and usefulness to the state, you ought to connive at his occa­ <lb/>
            sionally breaking the law. For, that he is a man of bad and <lb/>
            corrupt character, Lycurgus, as it seems to me, has already <lb/>
            abundantly proved; and that he is of no use to the state, you <lb/>
            may see easily enough from his political conduct. What man <lb/>
            has he ever brought into court and convicted upon these <lb/>
            charges which he prefers ? What revenue has he procured for <lb/>
            you ? What decree has he drawn, the acceptance of which <lb/>
            you have not afterwards deliberately repented of! For here <lb/>
            he is so wrong-headed and such a barbarian in his nature, <lb/>
            that, when he sees you slightly irritated against any persons <lb/>
            and more excited than you ought to be, he catches at your <lb/>
            wishes in the moment of your anger, and opposes your inte­ <lb/>
            rests. A statesman acting for your good ought not to follow <lb/>
            the passions which spring out of sudden anger, but to be <lb/>
            guided by reasonable calculations, by circumstances and oppor­ <lb/>
            tunities : the former are apt suddenly to change, the latter to <lb/>
            .endure and subsist somewhat longer. The defendant, disre­ <lb/>
            garding these considerations, exposes the secret weaknesses of <lb/>
            the government, so that you are compelled to make the same <lb/>
            things valid at one time and invalid at another.</p>
          <p>But perhaps, because his principle is to rail against all men, <lb/>
            to bawl people down, and object to everything that is said, it <lb/>
            is proper on these accounts to preserve him. Nay, men of <lb/>
            the jury; I declare to heaven, these things which are con­ <lb/>
            stantly occurring on our platform are a disgrace, and through <lb/>
            the desperation of these persons the better class of you have <lb/>
            come to be ashamed of meddling in politics. However, if <lb/>
            such proceedings are to any one's taste, you will be at no loss <lb/>
            for people of that sort; the platform is still full of them. <lb/>
            For it is not difficult to find fault with advice which has been <lb/>
            given; the difficult thing is to advise and persuade you to <lb/>
             <pb n="86"/>
            pass good resolutions. Besides, if he had not deceived you <lb/>
            before by means of such arguments, when he was tried on the <lb/>
            former information-though even then you could not justly <lb/>
            make any concession contrary to the existing laws; for you <lb/>
            must not allow some persons to break the laws and expect the <lb/>
            rest to obey them-yet, I grant, you might then with more <lb/>
            reason have trusted him and shown him favour and foregone <lb/>
            some of your strict rights. But when, after having let him <lb/>
            off in hopes of amendment, you shortly afterwards punished <lb/>
            the same person again as a mischievous orator and politician, <lb/>
            what decent excuse is left for you, if you are imposed upon <lb/>
            novel For why trust to words where you have the experience <lb/>
            of facts? In cases where you have not proof positive in your <lb/>
            possession, it may be necessary to judge by words. I am sur­ <lb/>
            prised at people who are so constituted, that, while they <lb/>
            entrust their private interests only to men of long-tried <lb/>
            honesty, they will confide the interests of the commonwealth <lb/>
            to men whose baseness has been proved beyond dispute. No <lb/>
            one would put a dog of inferior breed and quality to guard <lb/>
            his flock; and yet some say that, to watch your public men, <lb/>
            you should employ the first persons who present themselves, <lb/>
            who, while they pretend to inform against delinquents, require <lb/>
            the utmost watching themselves.</p>
          <p>If then you are wise, reflect upon these things; have done <lb/>
            with the persons who are always talking of their attachment <lb/>
            to you ; but exert every possible vigilance on your own part, <lb/>
            and allow none to defeat the laws, especially none of those <lb/>
            who boast of their ability to speak and move for the good of <lb/>
            the many. It would be a terrible thing that, while your an­ <lb/>
            cestors feared not to die in defence of the laws, you should <lb/>
            not even punish those who transgress them; and that, when <lb/>
            you have voted to erect in the market-place a brazen statue <lb/>
            of Solon who framed the laws, you should show such an utter <lb/>
            disregard of the laws themselves, on account of which he has <lb/>
            received such distinguished honour. What an absurdity it <lb/>
            would be, that in legislating you should manifest displeasure <lb/>
            against the vicious, yet, when you have caught any of them <lb/>
            in the act of crime, you should let them off with impunity ; <lb/>
            and that, while the lawgiver, a mere individual, incurs on <lb/>
            your behalf the hatred of all rogues, you yourselves, even <lb/>
            when you are assembled together to look after your interests, <lb/>
             <pb n="87"/>
            instead of showing your abhorrence of rogues, are over­ <lb/>
            come by the roguery of one man; and, while you have <lb/>
            made it punishable with death for any one to produce a <lb/>
            non-existing law, you allow persons to escape without punish­ <lb/>
            ment who give to our existing laws the character of non- <lb/>
            existing.</p>
          <p>You will perfectly comprehend how great an advantage it <lb/>
            is to obey the established laws, and how great an evil to despise <lb/>
            and disobey them, if you will place before your eyes and <lb/>
            examine separately the advantages arising from the law and <lb/>
            the results of their infraction. For you will find that the <lb/>
            latter performs acts of madness and intemperance and en­ <lb/>
            croachment, the former does the work of intelligence and <lb/>
            wisdom and justice. Here is the proof. Those states we <lb/>
            shall see are the best governed, in which there have been <lb/>
            the best legislators. As bodily ailments are checked by the <lb/>
            discoveries of medical men, so the ferocity of the mind is <lb/>
            removed by wisdom. In short, we shall find nothing noble <lb/>
            or useful which is not associated with law : indeed the whole <lb/>
            universe, the heavenly bodies and the seasons, as they are called, <lb/>
            if we may trust to what we see, appear to be governed by <lb/>
            law and order. Therefore, ye men of Athens, come with <lb/>
            mutual encouragement to the assistance of the laws, and pass <lb/>
            sentence upon those who have wilfully offended against what <lb/>
            is holy. If you act thus, you will perform your duty, and <lb/>
            give the most satisfactory decision.</p><pb n="88"/>

          </ab>
          <p>THE speeches against Aphobus, the first ever spoken by Demosthenes, <lb/>
            were delivered in a cause of his own, which came on for trial B. c. 364, <lb/>
            when he was in his twentieth year. The circumstances out of which <lb/>
            it arose are gathered mainly from the speeches themselves; but it <lb/>
            will assist the reader to give a brief account of them.</p>
          <p>Demosthenes, the father of the orator, was a man of considerable pro­ <lb/>
            perty, the greater part of which was embarked in trade and mer­ <lb/>
            cantile speculations. The total amount of capital which he died <lb/>
            possessed of, (the details of which are given below,) was estimated <lb/>
            at nearly fourteen talents. He left a widow and two children ; a son <lb/>
            at the age of seven, and a daughter at the age of five. By his last <lb/>
            will he bequeathed the guardianship of his children and his property <lb/>
            upon certain trusts to his two nephews, Aphobus and Demophon, <lb/>
            and an old friend, Therippides. The directions were, that Aphobus <lb/>
            should marry the widow and receive with her a portion of eighty <lb/>
            miuas : Demophon was to receive two talents, on condition that he <lb/>
            married the daughter when she reached the age of puberty : and <lb/>
            Therippides was to enjoy the interest of seventy minas until the son <lb/>
            came of age. The residue of the estate was ordered to be invested, <lb/>
            so as to accumulate for the benefit of the young Demosthenes.</p>
          <p>It appears that the guardians grossly neglected their duty, not only <lb/>
            failing to perform the conditions upon which they took their own <lb/>
            legacies, but squandering, wasting, or appropriating to their own use <lb/>
            the bulk of the property. They made no attempt to invest it as the <lb/>
            will directed; and the consequence was that, by the time Demosthenes <lb/>
            had attained his majority, i. e. when he had completed his seventeenth <lb/>
            year, the estate, instead of being vastly increased (as it might have <lb/>
            been by good management), was reduced to about a tenth of its <lb/>
            original value. He charges them with having committed during the <lb/>
            interval divers acts of fraud and meanness, and among others, with <lb/>
            having cheated his preceptors of their dues.</p>
          <p>Upon the attainment of his majority, Demosthenes called upon the <lb/>
            three, guardians to render him an account of the manner in which <lb/>
            they had disposed of the estate. Their conduct had become pretty <lb/>
            notorious, and the account, which, after various excuses and delays <lb/>
             <pb n="89"/>
            they at last rendered, was not wholly unexpected. The breach of <lb/>
            trust however was so flagrant, and the loss which it entailed so <lb/>
            enormous, that nothing remained for Demosthenes but to seek <lb/>
            redress by legal proceedings. Here indeed the chances seemed <lb/>
            against him; for he would have to contend with powerful and <lb/>
            experienced adversaries, whose resources were augmented by the <lb/>
            very plunder which they had taken from him. In order to recover <lb/>
            his rights, it would be necessary to use every possible diligence in <lb/>
            collecting proofs of the fraud, and preparing for the struggle in <lb/>
            court, in which he would have to appear as plaintiff, and (at least) <lb/>
            open his case to the jury. For the Athenians (as I have already <lb/>
            explained) required the parties to appear in person, and in general <lb/>
            to conduct their own causes; though a youth like Demosthenes <lb/>
            would be permitted, after a formal opening of his case, to leave the <lb/>
            substantial part of it to the advocacy of a friend. Demosthenes <lb/>
            however, as we have reason to believe, had no desire to escape from <lb/>
            the personal contest, or to procure an advocate to plead his cause. <lb/>
            It was just about this time that he heard Callistratus make his <lb/>
            celebrated defence in the affair of Oropus, which fired him with the <lb/>
            ambition to become an orator; he felt, as we may well imagine, that <lb/>
            he had within him the power to become one. At the same time he <lb/>
            must have known, and must have been advised, that for a contest so <lb/>
            important, upon the issue of which his future fortunes in life might <lb/>
            depend, some laborious preparation was indispensable. To ensure <lb/>
            success, there was more required than fluent speaking or an impas­ <lb/>
            sioned address to the jury. He must know something of Attic law, <lb/>
            more particularly the mercantile branch of it, and that which related <lb/>
            to wills and wardship ; also of the procedure and practice of the <lb/>
            Athenian courts, the rules of evidence, and the various artifices in <lb/>
            the management of causes, which are never thoroughly learned <lb/>
            except from long experience. It was impossible for a youth of <lb/>
            eighteen to obtain a competent knowledge of these things, and to <lb/>
            meet so pressing an emergency, without assistance. <lb/>
            Under such circumstances, Demosthenes applied for aid to a person of <lb/>
            that class, whom the great increase of litigation of Athens had <lb/>
            caused to spring up, and who united in themselves some of the <lb/>
            functions of our attorney and special pleader. Their chief business <lb/>
            was to prepare speeches for the suitors, or rather, to get up their <lb/>
            cases for them : the more eminent also gave lectures, or lessons in <lb/>
            rhetoric. The person selected by Demosthenes was Isæus, and a <lb/>
            better man could not have been chosen. He had been a pupil <lb/>
            of Isocrates, whom, though he was inferior in the graces of diction, <lb/>
            he greatly surpassed in vigour of reasoning and practical know­ <lb/>
            ledge of the world. He was (as we should say) the best real <lb/>
            property lawyer at Athens, where questions of disputed inheritance <lb/>
            (not without complexity and difficulty) were frequently occurring. <lb/>
            His extant speeches on these subjects, written for his clients, are <lb/>
            master-pieces of legal argument, expressed in clear and forcible <lb/>
            language. Under the tuition of this able man Demosthenes placed <lb/>
            himself, and obtained just the assistance which he needed. In the <lb/>
            course of the two years after he. had come of age, be so employed <lb/>
             <pb n="90"/>
            his time under the guidance of Isæus, as not only to prepare himself <lb/>
            for the conduct of his own cause, but, by the knowledge which he <lb/>
            acquired of Attic jurisprudence and public business, to lay the <lb/>
            foundation of his future fame as an orator. It has been said that <lb/>
            Isæus either composed or corrected the speeches which have come <lb/>
            down to us against Aphobus and Onetor. A similarity in the style <lb/>
            to his acknowledged works, as well as the relation which existed <lb/>
            between him and his pupil, renders either of such suppositions pro­ <lb/>
            bable enough; but, however that be, we may take it for granted, <lb/>
            that Demosthenes received from him those instructions as to the <lb/>
            preparing of his case for trial, the handling of it in court, the <lb/>
            arrangement of facts, evidence, and arguments, which were far more <lb/>
            important to the issue than the mere language in which he would <lb/>
            clothe his address to the jury.</p>
          <p>During the long interval which elapsed before the actual commencement <lb/>
            of legal proceedings, it seems that several attempts were made by the <lb/>
            parties or their common friends to obtain a settlement of the dispute, <lb/>
            or a reference to arbitration ; but all proved ineffectual. Aphobus <lb/>
            at one time had agreed with Demosthenes to refer the matters in <lb/>
            difference between them to three private arbitrators, whose decision <lb/>
            would have been final; but finding, as Demosthenes tells us, that <lb/>
            the arbitrators were likely to decide against him, he revoked the <lb/>
            submission, which he was at liberty to do, either because he had not <lb/>
            entered into a binding agreement, or perhaps because any submission <lb/>
            of that sort was revocable before, or within a certain time before, the <lb/>
            award. Nothing then remained for Demosthenes but an appeal to <lb/>
            a legal tribunal; and accordingly in the year B. C. 364, in the Archon­ <lb/>
            ship of Timocrates, he commenced three several actions against his <lb/>
            three guardians, prosecuting that against Aphobus immediately, and <lb/>
            postponing his proceedings in the other two until the first should be <lb/>
            decided.</p>
          <p>After the instructio litis before the Archon, the cause was sent to be <lb/>
            tried in the first instance before one of the official arbitrators, who <lb/>
            gave his decision against Aphobus, from which he appealed to a jury. <lb/>
            Fearful however of the result, he attempted to get rid of the whole <lb/>
            affair by an artifice, and, a few days before the day of trial, he pro­ <lb/>
            cured one Thrasylochus, a friend of his own, to tender to Demosthenes <lb/>
            the trierarchy, or the alternative (if that were declined,) an exchange <lb/>
            of estates. This plot was defeated, as the reader has already learned <lb/>
            from the speech against Midias, (see VoL iii. page 91,) by Demosthenes <lb/>
            raising the money, twenty minas, to pay the trierarchal charge. On <lb/>
            the appointed day the cause came on for trial; the plaintiff and <lb/>
            defendant were both heard; and the jury gave a verdict for the <lb/>
            plaintiff, assessing the damages at ten talents, the amount claimed.</p>
          <p>Aphobus was by no means disposed to acquiesce in this verdict. He <lb/>
            made an attempt to defeat it, by proceeding against one of the wit­ <lb/>
            nesses for false testimony; the conviction of whom might possibly <lb/>
            have led to the granting of a new trial in the original case. In the <lb/>
            third speech against Aphobus, Demosthenes defends this witness, <lb/>
            who, we may presume, was acquitted. Other measures, of an illegal <lb/>
            and fraudulent character, were taken by Aphobus, with a view to <lb/>
             <pb n="91"/>
            prevent Demosthenes obtaining execution, or reaping the fruits of <lb/>
            his verdict. These form the subject of the two speeches against <lb/>
            Ouetor. How much Demosthenes ultimately recovered from his <lb/>
            guardians, is unknown to us. Plutarch represents, that it was but <lb/>
            a small portion of his estate. That it was much less than he ex­ <lb/>
            pected and was entitled to, we gather from what he himself says <lb/>
            in the oration against Midias, and from other circumstances. The <lb/>
            actions against Demophon and Therippides were never tried; most <lb/>
            probably they were compromised. We know that Demon, the father <lb/>
            of Demophon, who was originally hostile to Demosthenes, afterwards <lb/>
            became reconciled to him; for Demosthenes composed for him the <lb/>
            speech against Zenothemis. In the speeches against Aphobus there <lb/>
            are some indications that Demophon and Therippides did not entirely <lb/>
            identify themselves with the cause of their colleague; and it is very <lb/>
            likely, that the issue of the first trial would incline them to come to <lb/>
            a settlement of their own cases.</p>
          <p>We may conclude upon the whole, that Demosthenes, though he may <lb/>
            have got back something considerable, still remained a great loser by <lb/>
            the frauds of his guardians. Out of evil however sometimes comes <lb/>
            good. He had sustained a pecuniary loss; but in other respects he <lb/>
            was a gainer. He had been thrown at an early age upon his own <lb/>
            resources, and compelled to make extraordinary exertions and to <lb/>
            fight an uphill battle, which, being attended with success, both gave <lb/>
            him self-confidence and earned for him a high reputation. His early <lb/>
            education had been in some degree neglected; he was forced to <lb/>
            undertake the task of self-education, which is often better than <lb/>
            scholastic training. He learned more from Isæus, under the pressure <lb/>
            of his necessities, than he would have done by attending any num. <lb/>
            ber of rhetorical lectures without such pressure; and the school of <lb/>
            life gave him a more useful lesson than he could have got in the <lb/>
            shade of the Academy. Even in a pecuniary point he was perhaps <lb/>
            ultimately no loser; for the knowledge which he had acquired <lb/>
            enabled him to follow the profession of Isæus, and write speeches <lb/>
            for others. He employed himself in this way for many years with <lb/>
            great advantage, and only discontinued the practice when politics <lb/>
            had begun to absorb all his attention. The speeches which we are <lb/>
            now considering are, on account of their own merits, well worthy of <lb/>
            our perusal; but they are chiefly interesting because the cause in <lb/>
            which they were delivered was the first step of Demosthenes on the <lb/>
            arena of the world. Here he first stood forth as the lawyer and the <lb/>
            man of business. Out of these in due time grew the statesman. <lb/>
            Nor can we doubt that from his early troubles and difficulties he <lb/>
            imbibed that love of right and truth, and that abhorrence of injustice, <lb/>
            which became the animating principles of his subsequent life; to which <lb/>
            his country was indebted for his exertions in her cause, and to which <lb/>
            we owe the splendid monuments of his eloquence.</p>
          <p>In his opening speech in this case, Demosthenes, after stating the con­ <lb/>
            tents of the will, which was in the possession of the guardians and <lb/>
            not produced by them, shows what the property of his father con. <lb/>
            sisted of; which, for the convenience of the reader, is subjoined in a <lb/>
            tabular form: <pb n="92"/>
            <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_19_fig3.jpg"/></figure></p>
          <p>He proceeds to show that upon his coming of age they had given into <lb/>
            his possession only the house, fourteen slaves, and thirty minas in <lb/>
            money; the total amount of which he puts at seventy minas; although <lb/>
            they had taken their own legacies, without performing the conditions <lb/>
            of the will; Aphobus, in particular, having received the eighty <lb/>
            minas, his mother's marriage portion, without marrying her, and <lb/>
            having also taken her jewels and plate. He proves that they had <lb/>
            rendered a false account of the profits of the sword-cutlery; that <lb/>
            they had altogether made away with the twenty sofa manufacturers, <lb/>
            and the whole amount of the stock in trade; and that the explana­ <lb/>
            tions which the three guardians gave of this were unsatisfactory and <lb/>
            inconsistent. They had made a return to the property tax, on behalf <lb/>
            of their ward, which proved the value of the estate to be what he <lb/>
            represented, as appeared by the public books. The large legacies <lb/>
            bequeathed to the guardians were of themselves a clear proof of the <lb/>
            falsehood of their account; for the testator would never have given <lb/>
            them so much, had there not been a considerable residue for his son; <lb/>
            they were not the principal objects of hie bounty, but he had made <lb/>
            handsome bequests to them, in order to secure their fidelity. Of <lb/>
            the contents of the will they had given different accounts; but their <lb/>
            refusal to produce it disentitled them to belief. Their omission to <lb/>
            invest the residue, as required by the will, was not merely evidence <lb/>
            of waste and breach of trust, but was a substantive fraud by the <lb/>
            Athenian law. If it had been properly invested, his estate might in <lb/>
            the course of ten years have been doubled or even trebled in value, <lb/>
            as those of other persons had been. In estimating the damages, the <lb/>
            jury were bound to take all the circumstances into account; they <lb/>
            should look at what Aphobus had wasted or appropriated either <lb/>
            singly or jointly with his colleagues; they should consider the value <lb/>
            of the estate at the time of the testator's death, and what it might <lb/>
            have yielded by judicious management; and having regard to all the <lb/>
            circumstances, they should give him just and reasonable compensation. <lb/>
            The facts relied upon are proved by a multitude of witnesses, and <lb/>
            partly by the admissions of the guardians, each of whom, in his <lb/>
            anxiety to clear himself, had made admissions tending to implicate <lb/>
             <pb n="93"/>
            his colleagues. The refusal of Aphobus to submit to friendly arbi­ <lb/>
            tration, and the decision given against him by the official arbitrator, <lb/>
            are insisted upon, as raising a strong presumption in favour of the <lb/>
            plaintiff. Some parts of the intended defence, which had become <lb/>
            known to him in the course of the proceedings, are shown by <lb/>
            Demosthenes to be fallacious or false in fact: after which, he con­ <lb/>
            cludes with a general peroration and appeal to the feelings of the <lb/>
            jury.</p>
          <p>For explanation of some matters of law the reader is referred to the <lb/>
            first and second Appendices.</p>
          <p>IF Aphobus, men of the jury, had been willing to act like <lb/>
            an honest man, or to submit the matters in dispute between <lb/>
            us to the arbitration of friends, there would have been no <lb/>
            need of lawsuits or troublesome proceedings. I should then <lb/>
            have been contented to abide by their decision, which would <lb/>
            have put an end to all our differences. Since however the <lb/>
            defendant has declined the umpirage of persons well ac­ <lb/>
            quainted with our affairs, and has chosen to come before you, <lb/>
            who have but a slight knowledge of them, I am compelled to <lb/>
            seek for redress at your hands. I am aware, men of the jury, <lb/>
            that it is dangerous for one, who by reason of his youth is <lb/>
            inexperienced in the world, to risk his all in a contest with <lb/>
            persons who are able speakers, and know how to provide all <lb/>
            the materials of defence. Yet, notwithstanding my disad­ <lb/>
            vantages, I am confident that I shall obtain justice in this <lb/>
            court, and that (in stating the case at least,) young as I am, <lb/>
            I shall speak well enough to make you understand the facts <lb/>
            and the issues which you have to try. I entreat you to give <lb/>
            me a favourable hearing, and, if you think I have been <lb/>
            wronged, to give me the justice which I am entitled to. I <lb/>
            shall compress my speech into as short a compass as possible, <lb/>
            commencing with a statement of those matters, which will <lb/>
            give you a clear view of the question.</p>
          <p>Demosthenes, my father, died possessed of property to the <lb/>
            amount of nearly fourteen talents. He left two children, <lb/>
            myself aged seven years, my sister aged five; and a widow, <lb/>
            my mother, who had brought him a fortune of fifty minas. <lb/>
            Being anxious to make the best provision for us, when he <lb/>
            was on the point of death, he left the whole of this property <lb/>
            to the care of the defendant Aphobus and Demophon the <lb/>
            son of Demon, who were his nephews, the one by his. <lb/>
             <pb n="94"/>
            brother, the other by his sister, and to Therippides of the <lb/>
            township of Pæania, who was no relation, but had been one <lb/>
            of his earliest friends. To the last-mentioned person he <lb/>
            gave the interest of seventy minas, parcel of my property, to <lb/>
            be enjoyed by him until my coming of age,l in order that he <lb/>
            might not be tempted by avarice to mismanage my affairs. <lb/>
            To Demophon he gave my sister with a portion of two talents, <lb/>
            to be paid immediately; and to the defendant he gave my <lb/>
            mother with a portion of eighty minas, and the use of my <lb/>
            house and furniture. These bequests he made to them, be­ <lb/>
            lieving that, the closer the ties by which they were connected <lb/>
            with me, the more faithfully would they act in the execution <lb/>
            of the trusts confided to them. Upon my father's death. <lb/>
            these men immediately took possession of their own legacies, <lb/>
            and, as my guardians, they took the management of all the <lb/>
            rest of the estate, which they retained for a period of ten <lb/>
            years; and now at the end of this period they have given up <lb/>
            to me the house, and fourteen slaves, and thirty minas in <lb/>
            money, amounting altogether in value to seventy minas; of <lb/>
            all the residue they have defrauded me.</p>
          <p>This, men of the jury, is a concise statement of the amount <lb/>
            of the injury which they have done me. That the property <lb/>
            left me by my father was as much as I have stated, they <lb/>
            have themselves given the best proof; inasmuch as they con­ <lb/>
            sented on my behalf to be rated to the property tax at one- <lb/>
            fifth of the whole value of my estate, the same per centage <lb/>
            at which Timotheus, the son of CODon, and men of the <lb/>
            largest fortunes were rated.2 It will be better, however, to <lb/>
            explain to you more particularly what portions of my estate <lb/>
            were producing a profit, and what were unproductive, and <lb/>
            what were their respective values; for I am sure that, whey <lb/>
            you are accurately informed of these particulars, you will see, <lb/>
            that no trustees ever plundered an estate in so flagrant and <lb/>
            barefaced a manner as these men have plundered mine. I <lb/>
            will produce witnesses to prove, that they consented on my <lb/>
            behalf to be taxed in the manner I have stated, and that my <lb/>
            father, so far from leaving me an estate of only seventy <lb/>
            minas, left me one so considerable, that even these men were <lb/>
            not able to conceal its value from the state. Take and read <lb/>
            this deposition. <note type="footnote"> 1 See Appendix L </note> <note type="footnote"> 2 See VoL i. Appendix IV. </note> <pb n="95"/>

          <p>From this evidence it is clear, what the value of the pro­ <lb/>
            perty was. Three talents is the rateable value of an estate <lb/>
            of fifteen; this was the proportion in which they thought <lb/>
            proper to be assessed. You will have a better notion of the <lb/>
            case, if I explain to you the component parts of the property. <lb/>
            My father, men of the jury, left two manufactories, in each of <lb/>
            which a considerable trade was carried on. One was a sword <lb/>
            manufactory, in which thirty-two or thirty-three slaves were <lb/>
            kept at work ; they were worth (most of them) about five or <lb/>
            six minas each, none being worth less than three ;1 and they <lb/>
            produced a clear annual income of thirty minas. The other <lb/>
            was a sofa manufactory,2 in which were employed twenty <lb/>
            slaves, who had been pawned to my father for a debt of forty <lb/>
            minas, aud brought him in a clear income of twelve minas. <lb/>
            He left in money as much as a talent, lent at the interest of <lb/>
            twelve per cent, which produced him more than seven minas <lb/>
            a year. This was the part of my father's capital which was <lb/>
            productive, as these men themselves will admit; the whole <lb/>
            amount of the principal being four talents and fifty minas, <lb/>
            and the annual proceeds fifty minas. Besides this, he left <lb/>
            ivory and iron, used in the manufacture, and wood for sofas, <lb/>
            worth altogether about eighty minas; and gall and copper, <note type="footnote"> 1 As Demosthenes has stated just before, that the house and fourteen <lb/>
            slaves given up to him were worth only forty minas, whereas by this <lb/>
            statement it appears that none of the sword-cutlers was worth less <lb/>
            than three minas, and that the house was worth thirty minas, Reiske, <lb/>
            Boeckh, and others accuse the orator of having made an intentionally <lb/>
            false statement to deceive the jury; for the house and slaves given up <lb/>
            to him could not (they argue) be fairly valued at less than one talent, <lb/>
            forty-two minas. Doubtless, if the value at the end of the ten years <lb/>
            had been the same as at the beginning, this charge would be well­ <lb/>
            founded ; and Demosthenes, or Isæus, must have been very simple to <lb/>
            imagine that the jury could be deceived by so obvious a miscalculation. <lb/>
            But is there any difficulty in supposing that both the house and the <lb/>
            slaves had greatly deteriorated in value ? The house may not have <lb/>
            been kept in proper repair; the slaves may have grown old; and the <lb/>
            guardians very probably left for Demosthenes those of the poorest <lb/>
            quality. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 So Thirlwall translates it. Pabst, " Bettgestellmacher :” makers of <lb/>

            which he had purchased for seventy minas, and a house <lb/>
            worth thirty minas, and furniture and plate, and my <lb/>
            mother's jewels and wearing apparel and ornaments, worth <lb/>
            altogether a hundred minas, and eighty minas in the house <lb/>
            in money. He left also seventy minas which were lent to <lb/>
            Xuthus on a maritime adventure; twenty-four minas in <lb/>
            Pasion's bank, six in that of Pylades, and sixteen in the <lb/>
            hands of Demomeles, the son of Demon; besides friendly <lb/>
            loans,1 to the amount of a talent, lent to different persons in <lb/>
            sums of two and three minas. The total of these last men­ <lb/>
            tioned sums is more than eight talents and thirty minas, <lb/>
            which, together with those first mentioned, you will find <lb/>
            comes to about fourteen talents.</p>
          <p>Such is the amount of property, men of the jury, which <lb/>
            was left by my father. It is impossible for me, in the time <lb/>
            here allowed me, to explain all the details of the fraud; to <lb/>
            specify what they have taken severally, and what they have <lb/>
            jointly embezzled. I must keep these matters distinct. It <lb/>
            will be time enough to discuss the frauds of Demophon and <lb/>
            Therippides, when I deliver in my charges against them.2 <lb/>
            Now I shall speak of the defendant, and of what I know, and <lb/>
            his colleagues prove, to be due to me from him. I will first <lb/>
            show you, that he is liable for the marriage portion, eighty <lb/>
            minas; then I shall go to the other parts of the case, and <lb/>
            state them as briefly as possible.</p>
          <p>Immediately after my father's death the defendant entered <lb/>
            and dwelt in the house, according to the directions of the <lb/>
            will, and took possession of my mother's jewels and the plate, <lb/>
            amounting in value to fifty minas. Besides that, he received <lb/>
            from Therippides and Demophon the proceeds of the sale of <lb/>
            the slaves, until he received the full amount of the marriage <lb/>
            portion; upon which, previous to his departure for Corcyra <lb/>
            with a ship of which he had the command, he sent Therippides <lb/>
            a written acknowledgment of the sums paid him, in which <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">χρᾷνο</foreign>r <foreign xml:lang="grc">κιχράναιι</foreign>s " tO lend without interest :” <foreign xml:lang="grc">δανείζειν</foreign> "to lend <lb/>

            he admitted that he had received the marriage portion. <lb/>
            These matters can be proved by Demophon and Therippides, <lb/>
            his co-trustees; his acknowledgment of the receipts can be <lb/>
            further proved by Demochares of Leuconium, the husband of <lb/>
            my aunt, and by many other witnesses. For when it was <lb/>
            found that the defendant refused to maintain my mother, <lb/>
            though he was in possession of her fortune, and declined also <lb/>
            to let the property,1 desiring to retain the administration of <lb/>
            it in the hands of himself and the other guardians, Demo­ <lb/>
            chares remonstrated with him upon the subject. Aphobus <lb/>
            heard him, and never denied that he had the money, never <lb/>
            expressed any anger as if he had not received it, but admitted <lb/>
            the fact, and said that he had had some disputes with my <lb/>
            mother about her jewels, and that, when these disputes were <lb/>
            settled, he would do everything that was right and proper in <lb/>
            regard to the maintenance and all the rest of my affairs. If <lb/>
            now it can be clearly shown, that he made these admissions <lb/>
            before Demochares and the other persons who were then <lb/>
            present; that he received from Demophon and Therippides <lb/>
            the money arising from the sale of the slaves, in part <lb/>
            payment of the marriage portion; that he gave a written <lb/>
            acknowledgment to his co-trustees of having received the <lb/>
            portion, and that he occupied the house immediately after <lb/>
            the death of my father; will there not be abundant proof <lb/>
            that he has had the portion, and that his present denial of <lb/>
            the receipt is barefaced impudence ? In support of what I <lb/>
            say, you shall hear the depositions read.</p>

          <p>It appears then, that he has received in this way the <lb/>
            marriage portion. Now, if he refuses to marry my mother, <lb/>
            he is by law indebted to me for the amount of her portion <lb/>
            and interest upon it at eighteen per cent.; however, I will <lb/>
            set it down at twelve per cent. only. Adding together then <lb/>
            the principal and interest for ten years, it makes about three <lb/>
            talents. I have thus shown you that he received this <lb/>
            money, and confessed it in the presence of many witnesses. <lb/>
            Besides, he has in his possession thirty minas (being the net <note type="footnote"> 1 Pabat—“die Babe zu vermiethen." For an explanation of this, <lb/>

            profits which he has received from the manufactory), of <lb/>
            which he has made the most impudent attempt to defraud <lb/>
            me. The income, which my father was deriving from this at <lb/>
            the time of his death, was thirty minas; and, upon the sale <lb/>
            by these men of one half of the slaves, I ought, according to <lb/>
            the ratio of the former profits, to have had fifteen minas. <lb/>
            Therippides, who superintended this business seven years, <lb/>
            has rendered an account to me of eleven minas for every <lb/>
            year, which is less by four minas a year than it ought to have <lb/>
            been. The defendant however, who managed it for the two <lb/>
            first years, gives no account of any receipts at all, but some­ <lb/>
            times says that there was no business done in the manufac­ <lb/>
            tory, and sometimes that he himself was not the manager, <lb/>
            but that the foreman, Milyas, a freedman of mine, conducted <lb/>
            the business, and that I must look to him for an account. If <lb/>
            he should repeat any of these assertions, he will easily be con­ <lb/>
            victed of falsehood. If he should say that there was no busi­ <lb/>
            ness done in the manufactory, remember that he has himself <lb/>
            given in an account of monies expended, not upon provisions <lb/>
            for the men, but upon stock, ivory for the trade, and sword- <lb/>
            hilts, and other materials, implying that the business was <lb/>
            then going on. Further, he charges me with money paid to <lb/>
            Therippides for the hire of three slaves, who were in my <lb/>
            workshop and belonged to him. But, if there was no work <lb/>
            done, neither ought Therippides to have received anything <lb/>
            for the loan of his men, nor ought I to have been charged <lb/>
            for such a disbursement. Again, should he say that there <lb/>
            was work done, but that there was no market for the manu­ <lb/>
            factures, he ought at any rate to show that he has delivered <lb/>
            up to me the manufactured articles, and to produce witnesses <lb/>
            who saw them delivered; otherwise, how can you doubt, <lb/>
            when the business has clearly been carried on, that he is <lb/>
            liable to me for thirty minas, the amount of two years' <lb/>
            income arising from it ? Should he however decline to <lb/>
            make any of these statements, and say that Milyas was the <lb/>
            person who conducted the whole business, how is it possible <lb/>
            to believe him, when he asserts that he has himself made all <lb/>
            the disbursements, amounting to more than five minas, and <lb/>
            that any profit which has accrued has been received by <lb/>
            Milyas ? For my part, I think it more probable (supposing <lb/>
            that Milyas did conduct the business), that he (Milyas) made <lb/>
             <pb n="99"/>
            the disbursements, and the defendant received the profits. <lb/>
            Such is the inference I should draw from the general disposi­ <lb/>
            tion and impudence of the defendant. Take and read this <lb/>
            evidence to the jury.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>These thirty minas then he has received from the manu­ <lb/>
            factory, and the interest on them for eight years, which, <lb/>
            reckoning at twelve per cent. only, amounts to thirty minas <lb/>
            more. These sums he has embezzled himself, and they, <lb/>
            added to the marriage portion, make, principal and interest <lb/>
            together, about four talents. I shall now proceed to specify <lb/>
            the effects which he has joined with the other guardians in <lb/>
            embezzling; some of which he pretends were not left at all by <lb/>
            my father. And first I will show you how very audaciously <lb/>
            and openly they endeavour to cheat me out of the twenty <lb/>
            sofa-makers, who were given to my father in pawn for forty <lb/>
            minas, and whom he certainly left at his decease, though the <lb/>
            guardians have made away with them. They all admit that <lb/>
            these men were left by my father in our house, and that they <lb/>
            produced him in his lifetime an annual income of twelve <lb/>
            minas. Yet from the same men, in a period of ten years, <lb/>
            the guardians (by the account which they have rendered to <lb/>
            me) have not derived a tittle of profit; nay, the defendant is <lb/>
            hardy enough to charge me with an expenditure upon them <lb/>
            of ten minas. The men themselves, upon whom this money <lb/>
            has been laid out, they have never prpduced, but have <lb/>
            trumped up an idle story about the man who pledged the <lb/>
            slaves to my father, viz. that he is a vile fellow, a defaulter <lb/>
            to his club,1 and over head and ears in debt; and they have <lb/>
            summoned a great many witnesses to prove this of him. As <lb/>
            to the slaves-who got them; how they went out of the house ; <lb/>
            or who carried them off; or who has recovered them by <lb/>
            judgment-they have no account to give. Now, if there <lb/>
            had been any truth in their story, they would not have <lb/>
            brought evidence to prove the villainy of this person (with <lb/>
            which I have no concern), but would have done their utmost <lb/>
            to keep possession of the slaves, and shown me the persons <lb/>
            who took them, and not lost sight of a single one. Instead <lb/>
            of this, after admitting that they were left by my father, and <note type="footnote"> 1 See Vol. iUi. Appendix XI. </note> <note type="footnote"> H2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="100"/>
            taking them into their own possession, and receiving the <lb/>
            profits of them for ten years, they have in the cruellest <lb/>
            manner made away with the whole lot of them. In proof of <lb/>
            what I say, take and read the depositions.</p>

          <p>I will now give you the strongest proof that Mœriades <lb/>
            was not in bad circumstances, and that my father had not <lb/>
            advanced his money on these slaves imprudently. When <lb/>
            Aphobus got possession of the men, as you have just learned <lb/>
            from the witnesses, he actually lent money upon them himself. <lb/>
            This was in violation of his duty as a guardian, which should <lb/>
            have led him rather to prevent any one else from lending on <lb/>
            such security ; however, he did lend to Mœriades upon these <lb/>
            slaves five minas, which he admits to have been duly repaid <lb/>
            by him. Is it not a shame, that (besides having obtained no <lb/>
            profit from the slaves) I, who first advanced money upon <lb/>
            them, should have lost my security, while a person, who lent <lb/>
            his money upon property pledged already to me, and whose <lb/>
            loan was so long subsequent to mine, should have thereby <lb/>
            recovered both principal and interest, and sustained no loss ? <lb/>
            In confirmation of what I say, take the deposition and read it.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Deposition.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Consider now, what a large sum they have embezzled by <lb/>
            these sofa-makers- principal, forty minas; and interest <lb/>
            thereon for ten years, two talents; the annual profit which <lb/>
            they obtained from them having been twelve minas. Is this <lb/>
            a trifling1 matter, an obscure item, and one easy to be mis­ <lb/>
            reckoned, or is it not nearly three talents which they have <lb/>
            openly robbed me of? As they have divided this plunder <lb/>
            between them, I ought surely to recover the third part from <lb/>
            the defendant.</p>
          <p>Pretty much in the same way, men of the jury, have they <lb/>
            dealt with the ivory and iron which was left me. They do <lb/>
            not produce it. Now it is absurd to suppose that a man <note type="footnote"> 1 Pabst—“Haben sie also etwa nur eine Kleinigkeit entwendet, viel­ <lb/>
            leicht aus Versehen und von einem Gegenstande, wo man sich leicht <lb/>
            verrechnen kann ?" Auger—“Ce tort est-il léger? est-il douteux ? Ce <lb/>

            that the miscalculation is venial ?” </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="101"/>
            possessing so many sofa-makers, and sword-cutlers also, should <lb/>
            not have left some iron and ivory; he must have had some, <lb/>
            or what could the slaves have manufactured without mate­ <lb/>
            rials ? However, though my father possessed more than fifty <lb/>
            slaves, and carried on two trades, and though one of the <lb/>
            factories easily consumed two minas' worth of ivory per <lb/>
            month for the couches, while the cutlery required the same <lb/>
            quantity of ivory and iron besides; these men are impudent <lb/>
            enough to say, that he left no such stock. That no credit is <lb/>
            due to them, may easily be collected from my statements; <lb/>
            but it can be shown also, that ray father left such an abund­ <lb/>
            ance of these materials, as to be sufficient not only for his <lb/>
            own men to use for the trade, but for general sale besides. <lb/>
            For my father in his lifetime used to sell the stock unmanu­ <lb/>
            factured ; and, after his decease, Demophon and the defendant <lb/>
            continued to sell it out of the house to any one that chose to <lb/>
            buy. Now I ask, what must one suppose the quantity left to <lb/>
            have been, when it appears to have supplied such extensive <lb/>
            trades, and also to have been sold by the guardians ? Was it <lb/>
            small, do you think, or was it not much greater than I have <lb/>
            alleged ? Take these depositions, and read them to the jury.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Depositions.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Of this ivory, you see, there is more than a talent's worth; <lb/>
            of which they show neither the raw material nor the product <lb/>
            -the whole has disappeared.</p>
          <p>I shall further, men of the jury, prove to you, from the <lb/>
            account which they render, and from their own admissions of <lb/>
            receipts, that the three together have in their possession <lb/>
            more than eight talents of my money, of which Aphobus is <lb/>
            separately chargeable with three talents and ten minas. That <lb/>
            you may understand the daring nature of their attempt, I <lb/>
            will put down their disbursements separately at a greater <lb/>
            amount than they themselves do, and will deduct the sums <lb/>
            which they have paid me. Observe, the defendant (besides <lb/>
            what I shall prove against him) confesses to having received <lb/>
            a hundred and eight minas out of my effects; Therippides <lb/>
            confesses to two talents, and Demophon to eighty-seven <lb/>
            minas; which makes altogether five talents and fifteen minas. <lb/>
            Of this sum there are nearly seventy-seven minas, which were <lb/>
            not received all at once (viz. the income from the slaves), and <lb/>
             <pb n="102"/>
            nearly four talents, of which they got immediate possession. <lb/>
            Adding to this last sum the interest of ten years at the rate <lb/>
            of twelve per cent. only, the whole, principal and interest <lb/>
            together, makes (you will find) eight talents and ten minas. <lb/>
            From the seventy-seven minas, proceeds of the manufactory, <lb/>
            I must deduct the maintenance of the men, on whom (as I <lb/>
            admit) Therippides spent seven minas a year. In ten years <lb/>
            the maintenance comes to seventy minas, leaving a balance <lb/>
            upon this account in my favour of seven minas.; to which I <lb/>
            forego my claim, and put down so much more to their credit <lb/>
            than they themselves do. I must next deduct from the <lb/>
            eight talents and odd the money which they handed over to <lb/>
            me upon my coming of age, and that which they paid for <lb/>
            property tax. The defendant and Therippides paid me <lb/>
            thirty-one minas, and they charge me, for payments to the <lb/>
            property tax, eighteen minas. I will be liberal to them, and <lb/>
            set down this last sum at thirty minas, that I may leave no <lb/>
            pretence for cavil. Subtracting then the one talent from the <lb/>
            eight, there remain seven, for which (according to their own <lb/>
            admissions) they must be liable ; and therefore, though they <lb/>
            dispute and cheat me out of everything else, they ought at <lb/>
            least to pay me this sum, which they acknowledge to have <lb/>
            received out of my estate. But what is it they do 1 They <lb/>
            show me no return of interest for this money, and tell me <lb/>
            they have spent all the principal, besides the seventy-seven <lb/>
            minas; and Demophon has gone so far as to set me down as <lb/>
            his debtor. Is not this plain and downright impudence 1 Is <lb/>
            it not rapacity of the most atrocious description 1 I know <lb/>
            not the meaning of atrocity, if conduct so outrageous falls <lb/>
            not within the term.</p>
          <p>It is clear then, that the defendant, who confesses that he <lb/>
            has himself received a hundred and eight minas, is liable to <lb/>
            me for these, and the interest upon them for ten years; <lb/>
            making altogether about three talents and ten minas. To <lb/>
            prove the truth of what I say-that each of the guardians <lb/>
            states in his account, that he received so much, but that he <lb/>
            has spent it all-let us have the depositions read</p>

          <p>I suppose, men of the jury, you are now fully enlightened <lb/>
            as to these points, and see the frauds and thefts which each <lb/>
             <pb n="103"/>
            of these men has committed. The information however <lb/>
            would have been more satisfactory, if they had chosen to <lb/>
            give up my father's will, in which (as my mother says) he <lb/>
            enumerated everything which he left, specified the fund out <lb/>
            of which the guardians were to take their legacies, and directed <lb/>
            the property to be let. They allow that there was a will, but <lb/>
            refuse, on my request, to produce it, for fear of making <lb/>
            known the amount of my father's property embezzled by . <lb/>
            them, and not wishing it to appear that they have received <lb/>
            their legacies-as though they are not sure to be convicted <lb/>
            by the circumstances of the case. Read the evidence of the <lb/>
            witnesses who depose to their answers.l <note type="footnote"> 1 Each of the parties in a cause at Athens was at liberty to put <lb/>
            questions to the other, and to insist on having them answered, both at <lb/>
            the hearing before the magistrate and at the trial, though the latter <lb/>
            was not so common. The answers given before the magistrate were <lb/>
            taken down in writing, and afterwards produced in evidence, if thought <lb/>
            expedient, verified by the depositions of witnesses who heard the <lb/>
            answers given. Here Demosthenes produces the answer of Aphobus, <lb/>
            which had been taken down before the Archon; he calls it <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν τούτου <lb/>
            άπόκρισιν</foreign>. It may be thought from the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὧν ἀπεκρίναντο</foreign>, the <lb/>
            verb being in the plural, that answers of the colleagues are read also. <lb/>
            I apprehend however that this is not so; but that depositions, not <lb/>
            answers, of the colleagues are produced, and that the expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὧν <lb/>
            άπεκρίναντο</foreign> is (in perfect strictness) applicable to Aphobus only. I say <lb/>
            in perfect strictness, because in a loose and popular way of speaking <lb/>
            anything which is said in reply to a question may be called an answer. <lb/>
            But the distinction here is between the answer of a party in the cause <lb/>
            and the evidence of a witness. We know that each of the guardians <lb/>
            had-and perhaps it was necessary he should have-a separate action <lb/>
            brought against him. In such action his colleagues could not be <lb/>
            treated in law as parties, notwithstanding the interest which they might <lb/>
            have in the result; they could therefore only furnish evidence for or <lb/>
            against either party in the regular way, by testimonial deposition and <lb/>
            appearance in court to confirm it. (See VoL iii. Appendix IX. pp. 381— <lb/>
            389.) Demosthenes compelled Demophon and Therippides to give evi­ <lb/>
            dence in this action, summoning them before the Archon, and taking <lb/>
            the chance of what they would say. They made some admissions <lb/>
            which were for his advantage, and therefore he put in their evidence, <lb/>
            notwithstanding that it contained other statements to his disadvantage. <lb/>
            We find him taking the same course in a suit against Demon, in which <lb/>
            he called Aphobus as a witness, notwithstanding his hostility. (See <lb/>
            Orat. cont. Aphob. III. 860, 861.) This point indeed does not rest upon <lb/>
            conjecture. Speaking of the statement of Therippides, which is here <lb/>
            put in, the orator says, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὗτος μαρτυρεῖ</foreign>. Therippides was present, and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μαρτυρεῖ</foreign> is the term properly applicable to a testimonial deposition. </note> <pb n="104"/>

          <p>This man, whose evidence you have just heard, declares <lb/>
            that a will was made, and that the two talents were thereby <lb/>
            given to Demophon, and the eighty minas to the defendant; <lb/>
            but he denies that there was any mention of the seventy <lb/>
            minas which Therippides received, or of the amount of pro­ <lb/>
            perty bequeathed, or a direction for the letting of it; for it <lb/>
            is against his interest to admit these facts. Now read the <lb/>
            answer of the defendant.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Deposition.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>The defendant says that the will was made, and that the <lb/>
            money arising from the copper and the gall was paid to The­ <lb/>
            rippides (which Therippides denies), and that the two talents <lb/>
            were paid to Demophon; but, as to the legacy which was <lb/>
            given to himself, though he admits it was mentioned in the <lb/>
            will, he says he did not assent to it, in order that it may not <lb/>
            appear to have been received by him. And he, as well as <lb/>
            Therippides, says nothing as to the amount of property being <lb/>
            stated in the will, or as to the letting clause; for it is against <lb/>
            his interest too to make these admissions. The amount how­ <lb/>
            ever is not the less apparent, though they will not suffer it <lb/>
            to appear in the will, when they admit that such large sums <lb/>
            were thereby given to one another. For if my father, out of <lb/>
            four talents and thirty minas, has given to two of these men <lb/>
            three talents and twenty minas as marriage gifts, and to-the <lb/>
            other the interest of seventy minas, it is clear, I imagine, <lb/>
            that he took these legacies not from a small property, but <lb/>
            from a residue (bequeathed to me) of more than double their <lb/>
            value. Surely he would not choose to leave me, his son, in <lb/>
            poverty, and to heap wealth upon these men, who were <lb/>
            wealthy enough already. No. It was because he bad left <lb/>
            me a very large estate, that he gave so handsome a legacy to <lb/>
            Therippides, and the interest of the two talents to Demophon <lb/>
            before the period of his marriage with my sister; for he <note type="footnote"> Compare also Orat. coat. Aphob. II. 838, 839; and coot. Aphob. <lb/>

            (if they should turn out dishonest) that such gross ingratitude <lb/>
            might exclude them from your mercy. And yet the de­ <lb/>
            fendant, who (besides my mother's portion) has taken the <lb/>
            female servants and dwelt in the house, when the time comes <lb/>
            to render an account of these matters, tells me he has enough <lb/>
            to do to mind his own business. Nay, he is so grasping, that <lb/>
            he has even cheated my instructors of their fees, and has not <lb/>
            paid some of the property taxes, though he charges them to <lb/>

          <p>Is there any way of showing more clearly, that the de­ <lb/>
            fendant has robbed me by wholesale without sparing the <lb/>
            most trifling article ? I have shown by numerous witnesses <lb/>
            and proofs, that he admitted having received the marriage <lb/>
            portion, and gave an acknowledgment thereof to the <lb/>
            guardians; that he has received the income of the manu­ <lb/>
            factory, and produces none ; that of the other effects he has <lb/>
            sold a part, and not paid over the proceeds, and the rest he <lb/>
            has kept and concealed. By the account which he has ren­ <lb/>
            dered himself, I prove him guilty of large embezzlement; I <lb/>
            show him also to have made away with the will, sold the <lb/>
            slaves, and managed the whole estate in such a way, as not <lb/>
            even my bitterest enemies would have done. I cannot con­ <lb/>
            ceive it possible to convict him more clearly.</p>
          <p>He dared to say before the arbitrator, that he had paid <lb/>
            debts for me out of the estate to Demophon and Therippides, <lb/>
            and that they got a good share of my property; but neither <lb/>
            of these facts could he prove. He did not show by the <lb/>
            ledger book that my father left me in debt; nor has he <lb/>
            called in evidence the parties, whom he says he paid; nor is <lb/>
            the money, for which he accounts by referring to his fellow- <lb/>
            guardians, equal in amount to his own receipts, but a good <lb/>
            deal less. When the arbitrator questioned him upon these <lb/>
            particulari, and asked him how he had managed his own <lb/>
            estate, whether he lived upon the interest or spent the prin­ <lb/>
            cipal, and whether, if his guardians had served him so, he <lb/>
            would have accepted of such an account from them, or have <lb/>
            insisted upon having his money, principal and interest, paid ; <lb/>
             <pb n="106"/>
            he gave no direct answer, but tendered me a challenger <lb/>
            offering to prove my estate to be worth ten talents, and said, <lb/>
            if it fell short, he would himself make up the difference. I <lb/>
            bade him prove this to the arbitrator; but he could not ; <lb/>
            nor did he show that his colleagues had paid me; (if he had, <lb/>
            the arbitrator would not have given an award against him;) <lb/>
            but he put in a piece of evidence, from which, in his address <lb/>
            to you, he will endeavour to raise an argument.2 If now he <lb/>
            shall still assert that I am possessed of so much property, <lb/>
            ask him from whom I obtained it, and require him to prove <lb/>
            every statement by witnesses. If he makes it out by reckon­ <lb/>
            ing what is due to me from his colleagues, he will only have <lb/>
            accounted for a third part, and even this I shall not be shown <lb/>
            to have received. I shall myself prove, that each of the <lb/>
            other two owes me as much as the defendant. It will not <lb/>
            avail him therefore to say this; he must show, that either he <lb/>
            or his colleagues actually paid me; otherwise, how can you <lb/>
            attend to his challenge, when at all events he gives no proof <lb/>
            that I am possessed of the sum in question ?</p>
          <p>Being at a loss to give any account of these matters before <lb/>
            the arbitrator, and being convicted in every single point, as <lb/>
            he now is before you, he ventured to tell a most wicked false­ <lb/>
            hood; that my father left me four talents buried under <lb/>
            ground, and put my mother in charge of them. His inten­ <lb/>
            tion was this-Either I should suppose he would repeat the <lb/>
            story here, and so lose time in confuting it, when I ought to <lb/>
            be proving other parts of my case; or I should pass it over <lb/>
            as unlikely to be repeated, and then he would bring it forward, <lb/>
            and I should get the less pity from you, for seeming to be <lb/>
            rich. In support of this bold assertion, he put in no evi­ <lb/>
            dence, but fancied he should be believed on his bare word.3 <lb/>
            And when any one asks him, upon what he has spent so <lb/>
            much of my money, he says he has paid debts for me, and so <lb/>
            far represents me as being poor; but again, when it suits <note type="footnote"> 1 See Vol. iii. Appendix IX. p. 382. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 He does not think it worth his while to mention what it was. <lb/>

            him, he makes me out to be rich, as indeed I should be, if <lb/>
            my father had left so much money in the house. That the <lb/>
            whole story is absurd and impossible, is evident from several <lb/>
            considerations. In the first place, if my father had no conn­ <lb/>
            dence in these men, it is plain, he would not have made them <lb/>
            trustees at all, and then (supposing he had left the four talents <lb/>
            in this way) he would not have mentioned it to them ; for it <lb/>
            were the height of madness to tell them of a hidden treasure, <lb/>
            if he meant not to entrust them even with his visible pro­ <lb/>
            perty. In the next place, if he had confidence in them, he <lb/>
            would surely not have committed the bulk of his property to <lb/>
            their management, and have taken a small portion out of <lb/>
            their hands. Again, he would never put this money in my <lb/>
            mother's keeping, and yet give her in marriage to the de­ <lb/>
            fendant, one of the guardians; for it is absurd to suppose, <lb/>
            that he would seek to secure the fund by her agency, and <lb/>
            yet place her as well as the money in the power of one of the <lb/>
            persons whom he distrusted. Further, if there had been any <lb/>
            truth in the tale of the defendant, do you suppose he would <lb/>
            not have taken my mother to wife, as the will directed? <lb/>
            This he has never done ; for though he took her fortune, the <lb/>
            eighty minas, with the apparent intention of living with her, <lb/>
            he afterwards married the daughter of Philonidas of Melita. <lb/>
            But had there been four talents in the house, and in her <lb/>
            custody (as he says), don't you think he would have flown to <lb/>
            get both her and them into his possession ? Or is it likely, <lb/>
            that after so basely conspiring with his colleagues to plunder <lb/>
            me of my visible property, which most of you knew to be <lb/>
            left me, he would miss the opportunity of seizing a fund, <lb/>
            which you would know nothing about ? 1 Who will believe <lb/>
            this? It is impossible, men of the jury; it is impossible. <lb/>
            The truth is, my father put the whole of his property into <lb/>
            their hands, and the defendant will tell this story, to dimi- <lb/>
            Dish your compassion for me.</p>
          <p>I have many other charges against him; but I will sum <lb/>
            them up in a single word, and cut off the whole ground of <lb/>
            his defence. He might have avoided all this trouble by <lb/>
            letting the estate, pursuant to the laws which I am going to <lb/>
            cite. Take and read the laws.</p>

            </p>
          <p>According to these laws the estate of Antidorus was let, <lb/>
            and for three talents and thirty minas he received at the end <lb/>
            of six years six talents and more, as some of you know by <lb/>
            ocular proof; for Theogenes of Probalinthus, the lessee, <lb/>
            counted out that sum in the market place. I therefore, who <lb/>
            had fourteen talents, calculating by the time and the terms <lb/>
            of his lease, ought in ten years to have had my estate more <lb/>
            than trebled.! Ask the defendant why this has not been <lb/>
            done. If he says it was better not to let the estate, let him <lb/>
            show, not that it has been doubled or trebled, but that the <lb/>
            principal has been returned to me. If however it appears, <lb/>
            that out of fourteen talents they have delivered to me hardly <lb/>
            seventy minas, and one of them even made me out to be bis <lb/>
            debtor, how can one be satisfied with a word they say? <lb/>
            Surely it is impossible.</p>
          <p>Such being (as you have heard) the value of my estate, <lb/>
            the third part yielding an income of fifty minas; the <lb/>
            guardians, though insatiably covetous, though resolved not <lb/>
            to grant a lease, might out of this income (without touching <lb/>
            the capital) have maintained us, and paid the public taxes, <lb/>
            and saved the residue; the other two-thirds they might have <lb/>
            invested profitably, taken for themselves a reasonable sum to <lb/>
            satisfy their desires, and, besides preserving the principal, in­ <lb/>
            creased my estate by means of the income. No such course <lb/>
            did they adopt, but selling to one another the most valuable <lb/>
            of my slaves, and getting rid of the remainder, they cut off <lb/>
            the existing sources of my revenue, and carved thereout a <lb/>
            considerable one for themselves. Everything they took in <lb/>
            the same shameful manner, and now they all join in main­ <lb/>
            taining, that more than half my property was never left at <lb/>
            all. They account to me, as though the estate, instead of <lb/>
            being so large, was only five talents; and, not content with <lb/>
            showing no income out of this, they don't even produce the <lb/>
            capital, but coolly tell me that the original fund has been <note type="footnote"> 1 Suppose the estate of Antidorus to have been doubled in six <lb/>
            years, it was capable at Athens of being more than trebled in ten years. <lb/>
            But the fact shows that it was not quite doubled in six years. We may <lb/>
            take it therefore that it might have been about trebled in ten years. <lb/>
            Then Demosthenes argues that his own estate might have been more <lb/>
            than trebled. Is there any overstatement in this ? I do not see that <lb/>
            there is: for very likely a greater profit might be made out of a greater <lb/>
            estate. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="109"/>
            expended; and for all this they are not ashamed of them­ <lb/>
            selves. I wonder how they would have served me, if my <lb/>
            pupillage had continued longer. They would find it hard to <lb/>
            say. For when, after an interval of ten years, from two of <lb/>
            these men I have got back such a little, and by a third I am <lb/>
            set down even as a debtor-can you wonder that I give way <lb/>
            to my feelings ?1—it is clear that, if I had then been left an <lb/>
            orphan of a year old, and been under the guardianship of <lb/>
            these men six years longer, I should not have recovered even <lb/>
            the miserable pittances which they have rendered me. For, <lb/>
            if their expenditure of the assets was right and proper, the <lb/>
            surplus which they handed over to me could not have lasted <lb/>
            out six years; and they must either have maintained me <lb/>
            themselves, or have allowed me to perish with hunger. Is it <lb/>
            not hard, that estates left to others, of one or two talents, <lb/>
            have been doubled and trebled by letting, and the owners <lb/>
            called upon to serve public offices, while mine, which has <lb/>
            been accustomed to equip ships of war, and contribute <lb/>
            largely to the property tax, is now (by the robberies of these <lb/>
            men) too poor to contribute anything ? Are there words to <lb/>
            describe the enormity of their conduct 1 They keep the will <lb/>
            out of sight, to avoid discovery; and while they have lived <lb/>
            upon the interest of their own property, and greatly increased <lb/>
            it by plundering me, they have destroyed the whole of my <lb/>
            capital, as if we had done them some cruel injury. You, <lb/>
            men of the jury, even when you pass sentence on a public <lb/>
            offender, do not strip him of all he has, but leave something <lb/>
            in mercy to his wife or children. How unlike these guardians <lb/>
            to you ! They have had legacies from us to make them <lb/>
            faithful in their trust, and yet they have committed this <lb/>
            outrage upon us. They are not ashamed of their ruthless <lb/>
            behaviour to my sister, who, though two talents were left her <lb/>
            by my father, will now get no suitable provision. They have <note type="footnote"> 1 Or, " Is it not a just cause of indignation ?" These words, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πῶς οὐκ <lb/>

            will create no difficulty, if we suppose that the orator has just exhi­ <lb/>
            bited some extraordinary warmth of manner, or that his voice has <lb/>
            faltered, or that he has shed tears, or something of that sort. These <lb/>
            words are then parenthetical; after which the argument proceeds. <lb/>

            acted without any regard to family connexion, j ust as though, <lb/>
            instead of being friends and relations, they had been our <lb/>
            deadliest enemies. As for me, I am in the greatest distress, <lb/>
            without means to give my sister a portion, or to maintain <lb/>
            myself. Then the government presses me for taxes, and no <lb/>
            wonder, when my father left me an estate ample enough to <lb/>
            pay them. Unfortunately, these men have got possession of <lb/>
            the whole. And now that I seek to recover my own, I.am <lb/>
            in the greatest peril; for, if the defendant should get a <lb/>
            verdict (which heaven forbid), I shall have to pay one-sixth 1 <lb/>
            of the damages, a hundred minas. Again, the defendant, if <lb/>
            your verdict be against him, will have an assessment of <lb/>
            damages, and will pay them not out of his own money, but <lb/>
            out'of mine ; whereas the penalty which I incur is fixed, so <lb/>
            that I shall not only be deprived of my inheritance, but de­ <lb/>
            graded from my civic rights, unless you now take compassion <lb/>
            upon me. I pray therefore and beseech and implore you, to <lb/>
            remember the laws and the oaths which you have taken as <lb/>
            jurors, to give me the redress which I am entitled to, and <lb/>
            pay no more regard to the entreaties of the defendant than <lb/>
            to mine. Your pity should be bestowed not upon the guilty, <lb/>
            but on the unfortunate ; not upon such cruel plunderers as <lb/>
            the defendant, but on me, who, besides being all this time <lb/>
            kept out of my patrimony, am insulted by the spoilers, and <lb/>
            in danger of losing my franchise. Deep indeed would be <lb/>
            the anguish of my father, could he be sensible, that, after <lb/>
            the portions and the legacies which he kindly gave to these <lb/>
            men, I his son am in peril of being condemned to pay the <lb/>
            sixth part of them ; and that, while some of our countrymen <lb/>
            have portioned out the daughters of relations and even <lb/>
            friends in distress, Aphobus does not choose even to return a <lb/>
            portion which he received, although it is ten years since it <lb/>
            became due. <note type="footnote"> 1 See Vol. iii. Appendix IX. p. 391. And as to the loss of franchise <lb/>

          <p>APHOBUS having opened his case for the defence, Demosthenes here <lb/>
            replies, answering some of the defendant's arguments, and recapitu­ <lb/>
            lating the chief points of his own case. He draws an affecting picture <lb/>
            of the scene at his father's deathbed, where the. testator solemnly <lb/>
            committed his children to the care of the guardians, who accepted <lb/>
            the trust, and yet had so grossly neglected it. The proceedings of <lb/>
            Thrasylochus to get the plaintiff's claim transferred to him by means <lb/>
            of the exchange, which had probably become notorious in the city, <lb/>
            are here referred to, Demosthenes representing that it was a mea­ <lb/>
            sure concerted between him and the guardians in order to quash the <lb/>
            present action. In conclusion, he makes a pathetic appeal to the <lb/>
            feelings of the jury, calling upon them to have pity on an injured <lb/>
            orphan, and reminding them, that the property in his hands would <lb/>
            be productive of advantage to the, state, for gratitude alone would <lb/>
            induce him to contribute liberally to the public service; whereas <lb/>
            the guardians would of course pay nothing out of a fund, the exist­ <lb/>
            ence of which they ignored.</p>
          <p>MANY gross falsehoods were asserted by Aphobus in his <lb/>
            address to you. The first which I shall endeavour to expose, <lb/>
            is one which it gave me the greatest pain to hear. He said <lb/>
            that my grandfather was indebted to the state, and that on <lb/>
            this account my father did not wish the property to be let, <lb/>
            for fear of the risk it would run. Such is the pretence of <lb/>
            the defendant; but observe, he has given no evidence that <lb/>
            my grandfather died a state debtor, but only that he became <lb/>
            a state debtor; and this he waited purposely till the last day <lb/>
            to put in, and has reserved it for his second speech, hoping <lb/>
            thus to make good the calumny. If he should read this <lb/>
            evidence, attend, and you will find it deposed, not that my <lb/>
            grandfather is a state debtor, but that he became one. <lb/>
            I shall now proceed to refute this charge, on which he relies <lb/>
            so much, and which I maintain to be false. Had I been in <lb/>
             <pb n="112"/>
            time, and not thus artfully taken by surprise, I should have <lb/>
            produced witnesses, to prove that the money was paid, and <lb/>
            all accounts settled between my grandfather and the state ; <lb/>
            as it is, however, I can show by strong circumstantial evidence, <lb/>
            that my grandfather was not indebted at the time of his <lb/>
            decease, and that we incurred no risk in living openly on <lb/>
            our property. In the first place, Demochares, whose wife is <lb/>
            the sister of my mother and daughter of Gylon, has not <lb/>
            concealed his property, but furnishes choristers, equips <lb/>
            triremes, and performs other official services, without being <lb/>
            in any alarm on that account. In the next place, my father <lb/>
            himself disclosed his whole property, and more especially the <lb/>
            four talents and a half, which the guardians, by their testi­ <lb/>
            mony against each other, confess to have been mentioned in <lb/>
            the will and to have been received by themselves. Further, <lb/>
            Aphobus himself revealed to the state the amount of assets, <lb/>
            when he and his colleagues made me chairman of a board of <lb/>
            tax-payers, and caused me to be assessed at so high a valua­ <lb/>
            tion as a fifth of my capital. Surely, if there were any <lb/>
            truth in his present charge, he would have been more cau­ <lb/>
            tious than to act so. It appears then, from the absence of <lb/>
            all concealment on the part of Demochares and my father <lb/>
            and of the guardians themselves, that they apprehended no <lb/>
            such risk as he says.1 <note type="footnote"> 1 Æschines in the Oration against Ctesiphon (78) states of this <lb/>
            Gylon, that he betrayed Nymphæum in the Tauric Chersonese to the <lb/>
            enemy, that for this he was impeached, and, not daring to await his <lb/>
            trial, fled from Athens, where sentence of death was passed on him. <lb/>
            He then settled in the Tauric peninsula, and received an estate called <lb/>
            the Gardens, as the reward of his treason, from the rulers of the <lb/>
            country (meaning probably Satyrus, as to whom see Vol. iii. p. 13, <lb/>
            note 3):—he there married a woman of large property, a native of the <lb/>
            Crimea (whom Æschines calls a Scythian, though perhaps she was of <lb/>
            Greek origin); by her he had two daughters, whom many years after­ <lb/>
            wards he sent with good fortunes to settle at Athens, and one of <lb/>
            them (whose name was Cleobula) married Demosthenes, father of the <lb/>
            orator. </note><note type="footnote"> Such is the statement of Æschines, which in its main facts may be <lb/>
            taken as true, for they are not denied by Demosthenes. Only it is not <lb/>
            improbable that the betrayal of Nymphæum may have been a more <lb/>
            venial affair than Æschines represents it; having occurred at the close <lb/>
            of the Peloponnesian war, when the place was no longer tenable by the <lb/>
            Athenians, and, if not given up to Satyrus, would have fallen into the <lb/>
            hands of the Spartans or of the Persian king. </note> <pb n="113"/>
            </p>
          <p>It is most strange, saying as they do, that my father for­ <lb/>
            bade them to let the property, they should never produce <lb/>
            the will itself, which would have removed all doubt upon the <lb/>
            subject, and, withholding so important a piece of evidence, <lb/>
            they should expect you to believe them on their word. It <lb/>
            was their duty, the moment after my father's death, to call <lb/>
            in several witnesses and request them to seal the will, so <lb/>
            that, in case of any dispute, the writing itself might have <lb/>
            been referred to, and the whole truth ascertained. Instead <lb/>
            of this, they thought proper to get certain other papers <lb/>
            sealed, which were only memoranda and did not specify all <lb/>
            the subjects of bequest; but the will itself, by virtue of <lb/>
            which they became possessed of these same papers and all <lb/>
            the rest of the effects, and were discharged from responsi­ <lb/>
            bility for not letting the estate, they neither sealed nor de­ <lb/>
            livered up. Very likely you should believe anything they <lb/>
            say about the matter!</p>
          <p>I cannot indeed understand their account. My father <lb/>
            (they say) did not allow them to grant a lease, or to disclose <lb/>
            the assets—To me (do you mean) or to the state 1 It appears <lb/>
            just the other way—you disclosed them to the state, and <lb/>
            have made them invisible to me, not producing even the <lb/>
            fund which was the basis of your return to the property tax. <lb/>
            Tell me now, if you can, what was this fund 1 where did you <lb/>
            deliver it to me, and in whose presence? Of the four <lb/>
            talents and a half, you received the two talents and the <lb/>
            eighty minas; so that they cannot be included in your <note type="footnote"> Of the debt here alluded to—whether it was connected or not with <lb/>
            the political crime of Gylon ; whether it was a fine for which the sen. <lb/>
            tence of death was commuted; or in what other way it was incurred— <lb/>
            we have no knowledge. It is next to certain however, that Gylon must <lb/>
            have received a pardon from his countrymen (perhaps at the time of <lb/>
            the general amnesty, after the expulsion of the Thirty Tyrants), and <lb/>
            must also have discharged his debt to the state, before he ventured to <lb/>
            send his daughters to reside at Athens. The arguments of Demosthenes <lb/>
            are themselves of considerable weight, not to mention the silence of <lb/>
            Æschines, who, though he would have been glad enough to reproach <lb/>
            his rival with not being born a citizen, says not a word about this <lb/>
            state debt, but only contends that he was by the mother's side a bar­ <lb/>
            barian, and (as grandson of a person condemned for high treason) an <lb/>
            hereditary enemy of Athens. It would have been impossible indeed <lb/>
            for Demosthenes to have attained his political eminence, with such a <lb/>
            liability hanging over him. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> T </note> <lb/>

            return, for at that time they belonged to you. Again, the <lb/>
            house and the fourteen slaves and the thirty minas, which <lb/>
            you delivered to me, could not have been assessed at so high <lb/>
            a rate as that which you agreed to. It is therefore beyond <lb/>
            all dispute, that there was property to a much larger amount, <lb/>
            which is all in your possession; and now that you are clearly <lb/>
            convicted of embezzling it, you invent these impudent <lb/>
            excuses. Sometimes you refer to one another; sometimes <lb/>
            you testify to one another's receipts ; and, while con­ <lb/>
            tending that you have received but little, you render <lb/>
            accounts of large outlays. You all acted together in the <lb/>
            trusts, but now each has his separate plot. The will, from <lb/>
            which we might have learned the whole truth, you have con­ <lb/>

          <p>That these effects were mentioned in the will, and were <lb/>
            received by the guardians, is proved by their testimony <lb/>
            against each other. The defendant, though he admits that <lb/>
            he was sent for by my father and went into the house, <lb/>
            declares that he never entered my father's chamber or con­ <lb/>
            sented to any of the arrangements, but only heard Demophon <lb/>
            read a document, and Therippides say that the testator had <lb/>
            made such dispositions; and this he declares, when (in fact) <lb/>
            he was the first that went in, and promised my father to <lb/>
            execute his will in every point. For my father, men of the <lb/>
            jury, when he felt that his disease was mortal, called together <lb/>
            these three men, and in the presence of Demon his brother, <lb/>
            whom he had requested to attend, placed us his children in <lb/>
            their hands, calling us a sacred deposit. He then gave my <lb/>
            sister to Demophon, with a portion of two talents, the in­ <lb/>
            terest to be enjoyed by him immediately, and betrothed her <lb/>
            to him in marriage; me, with my property, he left to the <lb/>
            care of all the three, charging them to let the estate, and <lb/>
            use their joint efforts to preserve it for me. At the same <lb/>
            time he bequeathed to Therippides the seventy minas, gave <lb/>
            ray mother to the defendant with a portion of eighty minas, <lb/>
            and placed me upon his knees. These trusts, the very con­ <lb/>
            ditions upon which he took possession of my property, this <lb/>
            most wicked of men has utterly disregarded; and now, after <note type="footnote"> i2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="116"/>
            uniting with his colleagues to strip me of everything, he <lb/>
            will solicit your compassion. I say everything, because what <lb/>
            all three have returned to me does not amount to seventy <lb/>
            minas; and even of this sum he has since laid a plot to <lb/>
            deprive me. For, when I was just bringing on my cause <lb/>
            against them, they procured an exchange of estates to be <lb/>
            tendered me; by accepting which (they thought) I should <lb/>
            lose my right of action, for it would be transferred to my <lb/>
            assignee ; or else I should serve the office with scanty means, <lb/>
            and be totally ruined. Thrasylochus of Anagyrus was the <lb/>
            person who performed this piece of service for them. I, with­ <lb/>
            out considering the consequences, accepted the exchange, but <lb/>
            refused to give possession, hoping to obtain a legal decision; <lb/>
            but failing in this, and time pressing, rather than abandon <lb/>
            the suit, I mortgaged my house and property and paid the <lb/>
            public demand, being anxious to bring this cause to a hearing <lb/>
            before you.1 <note type="footnote"> I The difficulty of this passage arises chiefly from our imperfect know­ <lb/>
            ledge of what took place upon a tender of the exchange under the <lb/>
            Athenian law. It is certain, that upon a refusal to accept the state charge <lb/>
            or its alternative, the exchange of properties, and probably upon an ac­ <lb/>
            ceptance of the exchange, if there were any disagreement (which there <lb/>
            was almost sure to be) as to the truth of the accounts rendered, or as to <lb/>
            the properties which were to be transferred, the dissatisfied party <lb/>
            might summon his opponent before the court, which in the case of the <lb/>
            trierarchy was the court of the Generals. The court decided every <lb/>
            dispute or question which arose. If the tender had been altogether <lb/>
            refused, the jury considered whether it was. a just tender, and, if they <lb/>
            thought it was, the resisting party was compelled to choose between <lb/>
            the two alternatives. The exchange being accepted, each of the parties <lb/>
            was obliged to give to the other an inventory of his property, and, to <lb/>
            prevent any concealment, power was given to each to enter and make <lb/>
            search upon the house and land of his opponent, and to seal up every <lb/>
            chamber, closet, barn, outhouse, or other place where his effects <lb/>
            might be deposited. The court must have had authority to enforce its <lb/>
            own orders, and to punish any act of oppression, violence, or fraud; <lb/>
            though it is obvious that the whole scheme was fraught with incon­ <lb/>
            venience and opened a wide field for abuse. </note><note type="footnote"> What however we are more immediately concerned with is to inquire, <lb/>
            how far, upon any dispute of this kind, the jury had power to look into <lb/>
            the equities of the case between the parties, or into the general ques­ <lb/>
            tion of public advantage; or whether they were bound strictly by the <lb/>
            balance sheets of assets exhibited on either side; and if so, whether <lb/>
            only visible and realised property was to be taken into account, or <lb/>
            whether debts, contracts, and uncertain contingencies were to be in <lb/>
            eluded. Thus, upon a question whether A or B ought to defray the </note> <pb n="117"/>
             </p>
          <p>Have I not been deeply wronged from the beginning, and <lb/>
            am I not still persecuted by them, because I seek to obtain <lb/>
            redress ? Is there one of y.ou, who does not feel an honest <note type="footnote"> public charges, it might appear that the whole of A'a property was <lb/>
            embarked in a trade speculation, which might ultimately realise some­ <lb/>
            thing considerable, but of whose present value it was almost impossible <lb/>
            to make an estimate, while B had a much larger amount of ready <lb/>
            money in his hands. Many similar examples might be suggested; but <lb/>
            we may content ourselves with this of Demosthenes. Here are two <lb/>
            men; one of whom (Thrasylochus) possesses (we will assume) five <lb/>
            talents; the other (Demosthenes) has only one talent in his possession, <lb/>
            but has a right of action by which he may possibly get thirty talents. <lb/>
            But his chance of success depends almost entirely on matters personal <lb/>
            to himself, such as, his own knowledge of the facts, his own exertions, <lb/>
            stimulated by a sense of wrong and injustice, his eloquence and ability, <lb/>
            his position and character, his claim to public sympathy as an injured <lb/>
            orphan. All these advantages were incapable of being transferred to <lb/>
            his assignee; and therefore it might well be, that an exchange of <lb/>
            estates, by which Demosthenes took the five talents and Thrasylochus <lb/>
            the one talent and the right of action, would be injurious to both <lb/>
            parties, and consequently, in some degree, to the public also. Common <lb/>
            sense therefore would lead us to infer, that the Athenian jury must <lb/>
            have had power to look into questions of this sort, and in such cases as <lb/>
            I have suggested either to dismiss the petition of the party tendering <lb/>
            the exchange, or to make such special order with respect to the mode <lb/>
            of effecting it, as the necessities of the case, and a due regard to what <lb/>
            was fair and equitable, required. Assuming that this was the practice of <lb/>
            the Athenian court, or that Demosthenes believed it to be such, we arrive <lb/>
            at a not unreasonable explanation of this passage. </note><note type="footnote"> When Thrasylochus proffers him the trierarchy or the exchange, <lb/>
            Demosthenes, not having ready money enough for the former, and <lb/>
            knowing that his estate in possession was much less than that of <lb/>
            Thrasylochus, accepts the exchange (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντέδωκε</foreign>). " Very well;”—says <lb/>
            Thrasylochus—“then the claim against the guardians is mine." " Oh, <lb/>
            no”—replies Demosthenes—“you will only take my estate in posses­ <lb/>
            sion : at all events, that will be decided upon the interpleader before <lb/>
            the Generals." Thrasylochus, pretending that the property had become <lb/>
            his immediately by the verbal acceptance of Demosthenes, began ii <lb/>
            conjunction with his brother Midias to take forcible possession and <lb/>
            break open the doors of the inner apartment (see the Oration <lb/>
            against Midias, Vol. iii. p. 91); upon which Demosthenes proceeds to <lb/>
            turn him out (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπέκεισε</foreign>), intending to have it decided before the <lb/>
            Generals (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς διαδικασίας τευξόμενος</foreign>), whether his claim against the <lb/>
            guardians would pass by the transfer, before he finally accepted the <lb/>
            exchange, and hoping also that the jury would under the circumstances <lb/>
            exonerate him altogether. Not however being able to get the inter­ <lb/>
            pleader brought on soon enough (<foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ τυχών ταύτης</foreign>), for the cause against <lb/>
            Aphobus came on in three or four days, he got alarmed, particularly <lb/>
            when he found that Thrasylochus had given a release of the action to </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="118"/>
            indignation against the defendant and compassion for me ; <lb/>
            seeing that he, besides an estate of more than ten talents <lb/>
            which he inherited, has got another of equal amount, belong­ <lb/>
            ing to me, while I have not only lost my patrimony, but am <lb/>
            by the villainy of these men deprived of the trifle which they <lb/>
            have returned me? To what can I have recourse, should <lb/>
            you come to any adverse decision ? To the property mort­ <lb/>
            gaged to creditors? It belongs to the mortgagees. To the <lb/>
            surplus remaining after repayment? That will go to the <lb/>
            defendant, if by your sentence I am decreed to pay a sixth <lb/>
            part of the damages. I entreat you, men of the jury, do not <lb/>
            entail upon us so heavy a calamity; do not allow my mother, <lb/>
            myself, and my sister, to be reduced to unmerited misfortune. <lb/>
            My father left us not with such prospects as these. His <lb/>
            daughter he had betrothed to Demophon with a portion of <lb/>
            two talents; his widow with a fortune of eighty minas was to <lb/>
            have married this most cruel of men, the defendant; and me <lb/>
            he intended to fill his own place as a contributor to the <lb/>
            public service. Succour us then, succour us, for the sake of <lb/>
            justice, for your own, for ours and our deceased fathers sake. <lb/>
            Save us, have mercy on us, since these our relations have <lb/>
            shown no mercy. To you we are come for protection. I pray <lb/>
            and beseech you, by your wives and children, by all the <lb/>
            blessings you possess; as you hope to enjoy them, do not <lb/>
            abandon me, do not cause my mother to be deprived of all <lb/>
            her remaining hopes in life, or to suffer distress unbecoming <lb/>
            her condition. Now, poor woman, she expects that I shall <lb/>
            return home to her, restored by your verdict to my rights, <lb/>
            and that my sister will not remain portionless; but should <lb/>
            you decide against me (which heaven forbid), what think <lb/>
            you will be her feelings, when she beholds me not only <note type="footnote"> the guardians; or perhaps he did not choose to be hampered with both <lb/>
            these affairs at the same time; so he borrowed the money, and paid <lb/>
            the trierarchal charge. </note><note type="footnote"> Reiske's version of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπέκλεισα δὲ ὡς διαδικασίας τευξόμενος</foreign>, " excepi at; <lb/>

            stripped of my inheritance, but also deprived of my franchise, <lb/>
            and my sister wholly destitute, without a chance of ever <lb/>
            obtaining a suitable establishment ? It would not be right, <lb/>
            men of the jury, either to refuse me redress, or to allow <lb/>
            Aphobus to retain his plunder. With regard to myself, <lb/>
            though you have no actual experience of my disposition <lb/>
            towards you, it is fair to presume that I shall not be worse <lb/>
            than my father. Of my opponent you have some experience; <lb/>
            and you well know that, though he has inherited a large <lb/>
            fortune, he has not only shown no liberality to the public, <lb/>
            but even grasps at the property of his neighbour. Bear in <lb/>
            mind this, with the other facts of the case, and give your <lb/>
            votes according to justice. You have the clearest evidence <lb/>
            to guide you, the evidence of witnesses, circumstances, pro­ <lb/>
            babilities, these men's own acknowledgment that they took <lb/>
            possession of my estate. They say they have spent it ; a <lb/>
            falsehood ; for they have it still. But let this warn you to <lb/>
            be careful of my interests; seeing that, if I recover my <lb/>
            rights by your assistance, I shall naturally be grateful to you <lb/>
            for restoring them, and glad to serve the public offices; <lb/>
            whereas the defendant, if you let him keep what belongs to <lb/>
            me, will do nothing of the kind; for don't suppose that he <lb/>
            will choose to contribute in respect of property, which he <lb/>
            denies having received : no; he will rather conceal it, to <lb/>
            justify the verdict in his favour.</p>

            <title type="sub">THE ARGUMENT.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>PREVIOUS to the trial of the last case, Aphobus had called upon <lb/>
            Demosthenes to give up Milyas, the foreman who managed the <lb/>
            sword-cutlery business, to be examined by torture. Demosthenes <lb/>
            refused to give him up, on the ground that he had been emancipated <lb/>
            from servitude by his father on his death-bed, and therefore it was <lb/>
            not lawful to examine him by torture. Knowing that the refusal <lb/>
            would be made a topic of observation against him on the trial, he <lb/>
            called Phanus, Philip, and Æsius, the brother of Aphobus, to prove <lb/>
            that Aphobus had, on being interrogated before the arbitrator, <lb/>
            admitted Milyas to be a freeman. Aphobus brought actions against <lb/>
            Phanus and Philip for having given this testimony, which he alleged <lb/>
            to be false. The cause against Phanus seems to have been tried <lb/>
            first, and Demosthenes appeared in his own person to defend him, as <lb/>
            he had a right to do; for the action for false testimony was consi­ <lb/>
             <pb n="120"/>
            dared as a branch of the original cause, and might perhaps lead to a <lb/>
            new trial. (See VoL iii. Appendix IX. p. 394.)</p>
          <p>Demosthenes in his speech shows by positive evidence that the testi­ <lb/>
            mony of Phanus was true; that Aphobus had made the statement <lb/>
            in question, and that Milyas was in fact a freedman. He shows the <lb/>
            improbability of the charge, insists upon the good character of <lb/>
            Phanus, and the absence of any motive to speak falsely. Supposing <lb/>
            even that his evidence has been untrue, Demosthenes contends that <lb/>
            he would not be liable to the present action; for the evidence was <lb/>
            not material, or not sufficiently material, to the issue in the original <lb/>
            cause. Aphobus had not been damnified by it; for Milyas could not <lb/>
            have proved anything to his advantage, if he had been examined. <lb/>
            The verdict was given against Aphobus, not for what Phanus had <lb/>
            deposed to, nor for lack of what Milyas could have proved, but <lb/>
            on account of the strong and direct testimony which fixed him <lb/>
            with the receipt of the trust funds, and the neglect to ad­ <lb/>
            minister them properly and render a just account. None of the <lb/>
            witnesses who gave that testimony had he dared to sue; that alone <lb/>
            proved the present proceeding to be unfounded and vexatious. In <lb/>
            fact it was a desperate attempt to re-open and re-argue a cause which <lb/>
            had been decided againpt Aphobus on the most irresistible evidence. <lb/>
            Demosthenes touches upon the leading features of the original cause, <lb/>
            in order to show how little bearing the testimony of Phanus had upon <lb/>
            the merits of the question, and with a view also to create an impres­ <lb/>
            sion in his own favour in the minds of the jury.</p>
          <p>IF I had not remembered, men of the jury, that on a <lb/>
            former trial between Aphobus and myself I convicted him <lb/>
            easily of greater falsehoods than any which he has now <lb/>
            uttered (so palpable were the wrongs he had done me), I <lb/>
            should have no slight misgivings as to my own ability to <lb/>
            expose the arts by which he misleads you. Now however, <lb/>
            (with the favour of the Gods be it spoken), if you will only <lb/>
            give me a fair and impartial hearing, I feel confident that <lb/>
            you will form the same opinion of this man's impudence as <lb/>
            the jury on the previous occasion. If indeed the case had <lb/>
            required an artful speech, I should have distrusted my youth <lb/>
            and shrunk from the contest: as it is, I shall simply have to <lb/>
            lay before you a statement of the plaintiffs conduct towards <lb/>
            us. From this you will have no difficulty in discovering <lb/>
            which of us is the rogue.</p>
          <p>I know that he has commenced these proceedings, not <lb/>
            with any expectation that he shall convict a witness of <lb/>
            giving false testimony against him, but in the belief that the <lb/>
            large amount of damages, which he was condemned to pay, <lb/>
            will excite a prejudice against me, and a feeling of compassion <lb/>
             <pb n="121"/>
            for himself. On this account he now labours to clear him­ <lb/>
            self of the charges made against him at the former trial, <lb/>
            on the merits of which he had not a word to say in his <lb/>
            defence at the time. I beg to observe, men of the jury, <lb/>
            that, if I had proceeded to execute the judgment without <lb/>
            showing him any indulgence, I should have done no wrong <lb/>
            in levying the damages which you had awarded, though it <lb/>
            might perhaps have been urged, that I had acted with ex­ <lb/>
            cessive rigour in depriving a relation of all his property. <lb/>
            The truth however is the reverse. The plaintifl has con­ <lb/>
            spired with his fellow-guardians to strip me of my whole <lb/>
            patrimony, and even now, after having been clearly convicted <lb/>
            by a jury of his country, he does not choose to do anything <lb/>
            which is fair and reasonable. He has dispersed the whole of <lb/>
            his effects, giving the house to Æsius,1 and the farm to <lb/>
            Onetor, with whom I have been compelled to go to law; he <lb/>
            took the furniture out of the house himself, carried away <lb/>
            the slaves, broke the wine vat, tore off the doors, and all but <lb/>
            set fire to the house; then he went off to Megara, where he <lb/>
            has settled and paid the alien's tax. Surely you have more <lb/>
            reason to execrate the plaintiff for such behaviour, than to <lb/>
            charge me with any undue severity.</p>
          <p>Of the rapacity and wickedness of this man I shall pre­ <lb/>
            sently give you a full account, though indeed you have heard <lb/>
            a pretty good summary of it already. But I shall now pro­ <lb/>
            ceed at once to prove the truth of that piece of evidence, <lb/>
            which is the subject of inquiry, and upon which you will <lb/>
            have to pronounce your judgment. I have one request to <lb/>
            make to you, men of the jury, and that is a reasonable one; <lb/>
            that you will give to both of us a fair hearing. It is for <lb/>
            your own advantage to do so as well as mine ; for, the more <lb/>
            accurately you are informed of the facts, the more just and <lb/>
            righteous will be your decision. I shall show that the plaintiff <lb/>
            has confessed Milyas to be a freeman, and proved the same <lb/>
            by his conduct; that he has declined the most infallible <lb/>
            test, the examination by torture, for fear the truth should <note type="footnote"> 1 I adopt the conjecture of Wolf, which seems to have occurred also <lb/>
            to Retake; and which is fortified by what follows about Æsius (p. 149, <lb/>
            orig.). Æsius was the brother of Aphobus, and clearly a partisan in <lb/>
            his cause. No one was more likely to have assisted him in making <lb/>
            away with his property. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="122"/>
            come out; that he is playing tricks, producing false witnesses, <lb/>
            and misrepresenting the real facts of the case. All this I <lb/>
            shall prove by such strong and cogent evidence, that you <lb/>
            will all plainly see, that I am speaking the truth, and not a <lb/>
            word the plaintiff has said is to be trusted. I shall com­ <lb/>
            mence with a statement of those particulars, which will best <lb/>
            enable me to give you a clear insight into the case.</p>
          <p>I commenced actions, men of the jury, against Demophon, <lb/>
            Therippides, and the plaintiff, for breach of their trust as <lb/>
            guardians, having been defrauded by them of all my property. <lb/>
            On the trial of the cause against Aphobus, I proved clearly <lb/>
            to the jury, as I shall prove to you, that he had conspired <lb/>
            with his colleagues to deprive me of all the estate bequeathed <lb/>
            to me. That I substantiated the charge not by means of <lb/>
            false evidence, is manifest from this circumstance. A multi­ <lb/>
            tude of depositions having been read at the trial, some of the <lb/>
            deponents stating that they delivered to the plaintiff certain <lb/>
            of my effects, others that they were present when he received <lb/>
            them, others again that they had made purchases from him <lb/>
            and paid him the prices, not one of them has he sued for <lb/>
            false testimony. The only witness against whom he has pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded is this man, whose evidence he cannot show to have <lb/>
            fixed him with the receipt of a single drachm. The amount <lb/>
            of damages which I claimed was not computed from the <lb/>
            defendant's deposition, in which there is no mention of <lb/>
            money, but by casting up the sums deposed to by the <lb/>
            other witnesses, whom Aphobus has not sued. It was upon <lb/>
            hearing their statements, that the jury found a verdict against <lb/>
            him for the whole amount demanded in the plaint. Why <lb/>
            then did he pass them over, and sue the defendant alone ? <lb/>
            I will tell you. He well knew, that the witnesses who proved <lb/>
            his receipt of money would only fix him with it the more <lb/>
            strongly, as every item in the account was more closely in­ <lb/>
            vestigated ; which it would be on the trial for false testimony: <lb/>
            for every charge, which occupied but a part of my former <lb/>
            case in conjunction with other charges, would then be opened <lb/>
            separately and form the subject of an entire speech. On <lb/>
            the other hand, in suing a witness who deposed to his answer, <lb/>
            he thought it would be in his own power to deny what he <lb/>
            confessed before. Therefore he brings an action against the <lb/>
            defendant, of the truth of whose testimony I shall endeavour <lb/>
             <pb n="123"/>
            to convince you, not by a suggestion of probabilities, not by <lb/>
            Arguments concerted for the present occasion, but by reason­ <lb/>
            ing which I am sure you will all think sound. Listen and <lb/>
            judge for yourselves.</p>
          <p>Being aware, men of the jury, that the whole contest at <lb/>
            the trial would be about the deposition set out on the record,1 <lb/>
            and that you would have to judge of its truth or falsehood, <lb/>
            I considered the first step to be taken was to challenge the <lb/>
            plaintiff to a test. What is it I do 1 I offered to deliver to <lb/>
            him, to be examined by torture, a young slave who had <lb/>
            learned to read and write, who was present when Aphobus <lb/>
            made the admission in question, and took down the very <lb/>
            statement deposed to by the witness. This youth had not <lb/>
            been ordered by me to play any tricks, to write down some <lb/>
            of the plaintiff's words and suppress others; he was there <lb/>
            simply to make a true report of every word the plaintiff <lb/>
            spoke. Now I ask, could there be a fairer opportunity of <lb/>
            convicting us of falsehood, than putting my slave to the <lb/>
            rack? Aphobus declined this test, because he knew better <lb/>
            than any man living that my witness had spoken the truth. <lb/>
            There are plenty of persons who can speak to this challenge, <lb/>
            for it has not been made in secret, but in the centre of the <lb/>
            market place before many bystanders. Call the witnesses.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[ Witnesses.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>The plaintiff is so cunning and determined to affect ignor­ <lb/>
            once of what is right, that, although he has preferred a <lb/>
            charge of false testimony, upon which you are sworn to give <lb/>
            your verdict, he declined to question the slave as to the truth <lb/>
            of the deposition (the point about which he ought to have <lb/>
            been most anxious), and now falsely asserts that he requires <lb/>
            him to be delivered up for a different purpose. Is it not <lb/>
            monstrous, that he should complain of my refusal to deliver <lb/>
            to him a freeman (for such I shall clearly prove Milyas to <lb/>
            be); and should not consider my witnesses hardly treated, <lb/>
            when I offer to him a person, who is confessedly a slave, and <lb/>
            he refuses to put their evidence to the test by examining <lb/>
            him? He surely cannot contend, that the torture is for <note type="footnote"> 1 A tablet hung up in court, containing a statement of the cause <lb/>
            and issue to be tried; which thus may be compared to our nisi prius <lb/>

             <pb n="124"/>
            some purposes (which he desires) a certain criterion of the <lb/>
            truth, and for other purposes uncertain.</p>
          <p>Besides, men of the jury, this very fact was first deposed <lb/>
            to by Æsius, the plaintiff's brother. He is now leagued <lb/>
            with Aphobus and denies the fact, but at the trial he deposed <lb/>
            to it with the other witnesses, not choosing to forswear him­ <lb/>
            self or to incur the penalty which would immediately follow. <lb/>
            Surely, if I had been getting up false evidence, I should not <lb/>
            have put this man in my list of witnesses, seeing that <lb/>
            Aphobus was his most intimate friend, and knowing that he <lb/>
            meant to plead for him in the cause, and that he was an <lb/>
            adversary of mine. It is absurd to suppose, that I should <lb/>
            call as witness to a falsehood a person who was at variance <lb/>
            with myself and brother of my opponent. I have many <lb/>
            witnesses to speak to this point, and as many circumstantial <lb/>
            proofs. In the first place, if he really never gave this testi­ <lb/>
            mony, he would have denied it, not now for the first time, <lb/>
            but immediately upon its being read in court, when denial <lb/>
            would better have served his purpose. In the next place, if <lb/>
            I had without cause exposed him to a suit for giving false <lb/>
            testimony against his brother, (a charge, on which men run <lb/>
            the risk of degradation, besides pecuniary penalties,) he <lb/>
            would not have let the matter rest, but would have brought <lb/>
            an action against me for damage. Further, to sift the thing <lb/>
            to the bottom, he would have demanded of me the slave <lb/>
            who wrote the deposition, so that, if I had refused to give <lb/>
            him up, I might have been deemed unworthy of credit. So <lb/>
            far from his adopting any of these courses-when I, finding <lb/>
            he denied having given the evidence, tendered him the slave <lb/>
            to be questioned, he declined my offer; his brother and he <lb/>
            being equally averse to try this point also by the torture. <lb/>
            In support of each of these statements I shall produce wit­ <lb/>
            nesses, who will prove, that Æsius stood by the plaintiff in <lb/>
            court when the deposition was read, that he appeared with the <lb/>
            other deponents and assented to it, and that, when I tendered <lb/>
            him my slave to be questioned on all these matters by <lb/>
            Aphobus and himself, he did not choose to receive him. <lb/>

          <p>I am going to lay before you, men of the jury, a stronger <lb/>
            proof than any which I have brought yet, of the plaintiff <lb/>
             <pb n="125"/>
            having given this answer. When he asked for Milyas (not­ <lb/>
            withstanding the admission which I have proved), I thought <lb/>
            I would expose the manoeuvre, and what do you think I did? <lb/>
            I summoned him to give evidence against Demon, his uncle, <lb/>
            and a partner of his frauds. I wrote out the evidence of the <lb/>
            witness whom he now sues for false testimony, and required <lb/>
            him to depose thereto. At first he flatly refused; but when <lb/>
            the arbitrator bade. him depose or take the oath of denial, he <lb/>
            deposed very reluctantly. Now, if the man was indeed a <lb/>
            slave, and had not previously been admitted by Aphobus to <lb/>
            be free, what could induce him to make this deposition ? <lb/>
            Why did he not at once deny, and get rid of the affair? <lb/>
            As to this matter also I offered to let him examine the slave <lb/>
            who wrote the deposition, who would know his own hand­ <lb/>
            writing, and well remembered Aphobus deposing. I made <lb/>
            the offer, not for lack of witnesses who were present, for <lb/>
            there were some; but in order that he might not accuse <lb/>
            these men of perjury, when confirmed by the result of the <lb/>
            torture. Surely this ought not to prejudice you against <lb/>
            these witnesses, who are a singular example of defendants <lb/>
            whose case is made out by the plaintiff's own evidence. To <lb/>
            prove the above statements, take the challenge and the <lb/>
            deposition.1</p>

          <p><note type="footnote"> 1 Aphobushaving persisted in demanding that Milyas should be given <lb/>
            up to the question, notwithstanding the evidence which Demosthenes <lb/>
            had put in, showing his opponent'a admission of Milyas being a freeman, <lb/>
            Demosthenes, to confirm and protect the witnesses who deposed to that <lb/>
            admission, took the bold course of summoning Aphobus as a witness in <lb/>
            his action against Demon, which had been sent for trial before an <lb/>
            arbitrator. He wrote a deposition containing the substance of what <lb/>
            Phanus and Philip had proved, which (being, as we may presume, <lb/>
            relevant to the cause against Demon) he required Aphobus to depose <lb/>
            to, or take the oath of disclaimer in the usual way. Aphobus, being <lb/>
            afraid to incur liability as a false witness, deposed to it. His deposi­ <lb/>
            tion to that effect is put in as evidence against him on the present trial; <lb/>
            and it is proved by the production of a challenge which Demosthenes <lb/>
            had given him to question the slave who wrote it out. " I gave this <lb/>
            challenge," says Demosthenes, "not because I could not have proved <lb/>
            the deposition by ordinary witnesses, but that I might deter Aphobus <lb/>
            from bringing a charge for false testimony against Phanus and Philip <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἵνα μὴ</foreign> TOMTOM <foreign xml:lang="grc">αἰτιῷτο τὰ ψευδῆ μαρτυρεῖν</foreign>), when they (Phanus and <lb/>

          <p>These are the tests which he has declined ; all these cir­ <lb/>

            upon you to believe his own witnesses, while he calumniates <lb/>
            and impeaches the veracity of mine. Let me now say a few <lb/>
            words on the probabilities of the case. I am sure you will <lb/>
            all agree, that men who give false testimony are induced by <lb/>
            one of three motives ; either by a bribe to relieve their <lb/>
            poverty, or by friendship, or by enmity to the adverse party. <lb/>
            Not one of these motives can apply to my witnesses. Not <lb/>
            friendship certainly; as they are not men of the same pursuits <lb/>
            or the same age with me, or even with each other. Not <lb/>
            enmity to the plaintiff; for one of them was his brother <lb/>
            and pleaded for him; Phanus was his friend and belonged to <lb/>
            the same tribe; Philip was neither friend nor foe : so it is <lb/>
            clear this motive cannot be alleged against them. Nor was <lb/>
            it poverty; for they are all men of large fortunes, out of <lb/>
            which they defray the charges of public offices, and cheer­ <lb/>
            fully perform the duties imposed on them. Besides, you <lb/>
            know something of them, and what you know is to their <lb/>
            credit, as respectable persons. This being so; the meu <lb/>
            being neither poor, nor friends of mine, nor enemies of my <lb/>
            opponent; what grounds are there to suspect them of giving <lb/>
            false evidence ? I myself cannot imagine any. <note type="footnote"> witnesses, Phanus and Philip, on this account (<foreign xml:lang="grc">καταγνῶναι τῶν μαρτύρων <lb/>

            were present: for the torture of the slave would have been the most <lb/>

            before us : we have a speech for the defence, without that of the <lb/>
            plaintiff. Perhaps Aphobus had commented upon the fact, that on the <lb/>
            former trial, as on the present, the evidence of Phanus was not con­ <lb/>
            firmed by the testimony of witnesses present before the arbitrator : to <lb/>
            which Demosthenes replies in effect—“There is nothing in that; for <lb/>
            when Aphobus declined the challenge, I considered the fact as incon­ <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>The plaintiff knew all this, and had the best reasons for <lb/>
            being satisfied of the truth of their testimony; notwith­ <lb/>
            standing which, he brings an unfounded charge against them, <lb/>
            and not only denies that he ever made the statement, which <lb/>
            I prove him to have made beyond the possibility of a doubt, <lb/>
            but contends also that Milyas is really a slave. In a very <lb/>
            few words I will prove the falsehood of this assertion. Upon <lb/>
            this very point, men of the jury, I offered to let him ques­ <lb/>
            tion my female domestics, who remember that Milyas was <lb/>
            emancipated by my father on his deathbed. Besides, my <lb/>
            mother was willing to make oath, in the presence of my <lb/>
            sister and myself, and with imprecations on us if she spoke <lb/>
            falsely, that my father in his last moments discharged this <lb/>
            man from servitude, and that he was treated by the family <lb/>
            as a freeman.1 We were her only children, for whose sake <lb/>
            she determined to remain a widow ; and I trust none of you <lb/>
            will imagine, that she would thus have called down the <lb/>
            vengeance of heaven upon our heads, if she had not been <lb/>
            certain she should swear to the truth. I have evidence that <lb/>
            we made these proposals, and were ready to abide by them. <lb/>

          <p>You see how many strong points I have to urge, and how <lb/>
            ready I have been to submit the matters in dispute to the <lb/>
            most infallible ordeal. Aphobus declines to meet me on <lb/>
            these grounds, but imagines that he shall induce you to con­ <lb/>
            vict the defendant, by slandering me and impeaching the <lb/>
            result of the late trial. Of all manoeuvres I ever heard of, <lb/>
            this is the most unfair and insidious. He, with the assistance <lb/>
            of his brother-in-law Onetor and Timocrates, has suborned <lb/>
            persons to give false evidence on that subject; we, not fore­ <lb/>
            seeing that he would adopt such a course, and supposing <lb/>
            that the whole contest would be as to the truth or falsehood <lb/>
            of the deposition itself, are not prepared with witnesses to <lb/>
            speak to the guardianship accounts. However, notwithstand­ <lb/>
            ing this artifice, I think I shall be able, by a simple narration <lb/>
            of the facts, to convince you that the verdict was a most <lb/>
            righteous one; that it was given against Aphobus, not be­ <lb/>
            cause I prevented him from putting Milyas to the torture, <note type="footnote"> 1 As to the nature of this oath, see VoL iii. Appendix IX. p. 383. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="128"/>
            nor because he admitted him to be a freeman (as these wit­ <lb/>
            nesses have testified), but because he was shown to have <lb/>
            received large sums of money for which he was account­ <lb/>
            able to me, and because he did not let the estate in the <lb/>
            manner required by the laws and directed by my father's <lb/>
            will, as I will show you clearly. These were things that <lb/>
            everybody could see, the laws I mean, and the sums of <lb/>
            which the guardians had plundered me; but as to Milyas, <lb/>
            no one knew even who he was. You will see by the charges <lb/>
            in the plaint, that it is as I say. For when I brought my <lb/>
            action, men of the jury, against Aphobus, for the fraudulent <lb/>
            account which he had rendered me, I did not lay the <lb/>
            damages in one general sum, as a man would do who made a <lb/>
            vexatious demand, but specified the several items which I <lb/>
            charged him with, stating the sources from which, and the <lb/>
            persons from whom he received them, and also the amount of <lb/>
            each. I make no mention of Milyas as being acquainted <lb/>
            with any of these particulars. The plaint commences thus: <lb/>
            " Demosthenes makes this complaint against Aphobus. <lb/>
            Aphobus is indebted to me for monies had and received by <lb/>
            him as guardian, (that is to say,) eighty minas which he <lb/>
            received as the marriage portion of my mother, in pursuance <lb/>
            of my father's will.”—This is the first item, of which I <lb/>
            aver myself to be defrauded. Now what is the evidence of <lb/>
            the witnesses ? " That they were present before the <lb/>
            arbitrator Notharchus, when Aphobus admitted Milyas to <lb/>
            have had his freedom given him by the father of Demos­ <lb/>
            thenes." Consider for a moment. Do you think you could <lb/>
            find any orator, sophist, or conjuror, with such wonderful <lb/>
            cleverness or power of eloquence, as to be able from this de­ <lb/>
            position to convince a single human being, that his mother's <lb/>
            fortune is in the hands of Aphobus 7 What, in the name of <lb/>
            heaven, could he say ?—" You confess Milyas to be a free­ <lb/>
            man?”—“Well, but how does this show the fund to be in <lb/>
            my possession ?”—You must see it would be no proof at all. <lb/>
            How then was the fact proved 1 First, by the evidence of <lb/>
            his colleague Therippides, who declared that he paid over <lb/>
            the money to him. Secondly, Demon his uncle and all the <lb/>
            witnesses who were present stated, that he agreed to pay <lb/>
            alimony to my mother, whose portion was in his hands. <lb/>
            Against these men he has taken no proceedings; clearly <lb/>
             <pb n="129"/>
            because he knew their statements to be correct. Besides, <lb/>
            ray mother offered to make oath, in the presence of me and <lb/>
            ray sister, and with imprecations on our heads if she spoke <lb/>
            falsely, that Aphobus received her portion according to my <lb/>
            father's will. Are we then, or are we not to say, that he is <lb/>
            liable for these eighty minas ? And was it by this or that <lb/>
            person's evidence, that the verdict against him was obtained ? <lb/>
            I think, it was by the evidence of truth. He has enjoyed <lb/>
            the interest of this fund for ten years, and even after judg­ <lb/>
            ment cannot make up his mind to restore it; yet he asserts <lb/>
            that he has been hardly used, and that he lost the cause by <lb/>
            these witnesses, not one of whom uttered a word to fix him <lb/>
            with the receipt of the marriage portion.</p>
          <p>As to the bottomry loan, the sofa-manufacturers, the iron <lb/>
            and ivory that were left me, and my sister's portion, at the <lb/>
            plunder of which this man connived, that he might himself <lb/>
            be allowed to take what he pleased of my effects—attend and <lb/>
            observe, how just was the verdict pronounced against him, <lb/>
            and how useless it would have been to examine Milyas on <lb/>
            any of these points.</p>
          <p>For the fraud which you connived at, Aphobus, there is an <lb/>
            express law which makes you responsible, in like manner as <lb/>
            if you had yourself reaped the fruits of it. What has this <lb/>
            law to do with the questioning of the slave 1 In the affair of <lb/>
            the bottomry loan, you all leagued with Xuthus, and divided <lb/>
            the money amongst you, and cancelled the agreement; and <lb/>
            now, having arranged everything to suit your own purposes, <lb/>
            and destroyed the documentary evidence, (as you are proved <lb/>
            to have done by Demon,) you endeavour by artful impostures <lb/>
            to mislead the jury. With respect to the sofa-makers; if <lb/>
            you have obtained money and made large profits for yourself <lb/>
            by lending on my securities, when you should rather have <lb/>
            prevented others from doing so, and at last have made away <lb/>
            with them altogether; how can your witnesses help you 1 <lb/>
            These men, at all events, did not prove, that you admitted <lb/>
            having lent money upon my slaves, and having appropriated <lb/>
            them to yourself. The fact was proved by the acknow­ <lb/>
            ledgment in your own account, and confirmed by other <lb/>
            testimony.</p>
          <p>As to the ivory and iron; I say, all my domestics well <lb/>
            know, that Aphobus used to sell these articles; and I am <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> K </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="130"/>
            willing, as I was on the former occasion, to deliver to him <lb/>
            any one of them he chooses, to be examined by the torture. <lb/>
            Should he allege, that I refuse to give up a man who knows <lb/>
            something of the case, and tender him persons who can prove <lb/>
            nothing, he will have made out a stronger reason for accept­ <lb/>
            ing my offer. For if the persons, whom I tendered as com­ <lb/>
            petent to speak to the fact, had said that none of the stock <lb/>
            was in his possession, of course he would have been acquitted <lb/>
            of the charge. However, the fact is not so. He would cer­ <lb/>
            tainly have been convicted of selling the stock and having <lb/>
            received the proceeds. Therefore it was, that he rejected <lb/>
            persons who were on all hands admitted to be slaves, and <lb/>
            desired to examine a freeman by the torture, whom it would <lb/>
            have been a crime in me to give up; his object being, not to <lb/>
            bring to a test the matters in dispute, but that, in case his <lb/>
            demand were not complied with, he might found upon it <lb/>
            the semblance of an argument. To make you understand <lb/>
            all these points—first about the portion—then the con­ <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>That Aphobus has been in no way prejudiced by my <lb/>
            refusal to give up this person to the torture, you may infer <lb/>
            not only from the preceding observations, but from the nature <lb/>
            of the case itself. For let us suppose that Milyas was racked <lb/>
            on the wheel. What would he most desire him to say ? <lb/>
            Would it not be this, " that he is not aware of the plaintiff <lb/>
            having any part of the property in his hands ?” Well; sup­ <lb/>
            pose he says so. Does it follow that he has none ? Far from <lb/>
            it; for I produced witnesses, who spoke to the affirmative from <lb/>
            their own knowledge and eyesight. That some man knows <lb/>
            something to be in his possession, is material evidence ; but <lb/>
            that some one does not know it, is no evidence at all: there <lb/>
            might be plenty of witnesses of that sort.</p>
          <p>Among all these witnesses who appeared against you, tell <lb/>
            me, Aphobus, which have you sued for false testimony? You <lb/>
            cannot mention one. What becomes then of your assertion, <lb/>
            that you have been hardly used and lost the verdict unjustly <lb/>
            because this person was not given up to you ? Do you not <lb/>
            yourself prove its falsehood when, it appears, you made no <lb/>
             <pb n="131"/>
            charge against witnesses, who proved your receipt and pos­ <lb/>
            session of that property, as to which you desired to question <lb/>
            Milyas, to show that it was never left ? They were the per­ <lb/>
            sons against whom (if you were really injured) you ought to <lb/>
            have proceeded; but you have sustained no injury, and your <lb/>
            present charge is vexatious and malicious.</p>
          <p>The roguery of the plaintiff may be seen in many points of <lb/>
            view; but most clearly, by observing his conduct in regard <lb/>
            to the will. My father's will, men of the jury, contained a <lb/>
            specification of everything he left, and a direction to the <lb/>
            guardians to let the estate. For this reason Aphobus never <lb/>
            gave it up to me, lest I should learn from it the amount of <lb/>
            the property. He admitted to be in his possession only what <lb/>
            (on account of its publicity) he could not deny. The will <lb/>
            (according to him) contained these provisions--that Demo­ <lb/>
            phon should immediately receive two talents as a portion <lb/>
            with my sister, whom he was to marry when she arrived at a <lb/>
            proper age, (that would be in ten years;) he himself was to <lb/>
            have eighty minas with my mother, and the house to dwell <lb/>
            in; Therippides was to enjoy the interest of seventy minas <lb/>
            until my majority : the residue which was left to me, and the <lb/>
            clause for letting the estate, these he entirely suppressed; <lb/>
            for it did not suit him to reveal these matters to you. How­ <lb/>
            ever, when Aphobus himself allowed, that my father on his <lb/>
            death-bed gave such large sums of money to each of the <lb/>
            guardians, the jury, who sat on the former trial, considered <lb/>
            this admission to be evidence of the value of the property. <lb/>
            For, when a man had charged his estate with the payment of <lb/>
            four talents and a half in the shape of marriage portion or <lb/>
            legacy, it was plain that he took this from a residue (be­ <lb/>
            queathed to me) of more than double the amount. It could <lb/>
            not be supposed, that he would desire to leave me his son in <lb/>
            poverty, and to heap riches upon these men who were rich <lb/>
            enough already. No. It was because of the magnitude of <lb/>
            my inheritance, that he gave to Therippides the seventy <lb/>
            minas, and to Demophon the interest of the two talents <lb/>
            before the period of his marriage with my sister. That inhe­ <lb/>
            ritance, or that with a small deduction, he was never shown <lb/>
            to have delivered up to me. Some part of it he declared he <lb/>
            had spent, some he had never received, some he knew nothing <lb/>
            about, some was in the hands of this or that individual ; <note type="footnote"> 12 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="132"/>
            some was in the house ; in short, he had all sorts of accounts <lb/>
            to give, except the time and mode of payment.</p>
          <p>As to the story of the money being left in the house ; this <lb/>
            I will clearly show to have been fabricated by him. The <lb/>
            insinuation was artfully made. He saw, as you do, that <lb/>
            the property was large; and ho could not show that he had <lb/>
            delivered it up to me. He sought therefore to make out a <lb/>
            plausible case against me, as if I were attempting to recover <lb/>
            what was already in my hands. But this is quite clear, that, <lb/>
            if my father had felt no confidence in these men, he would <lb/>
            not have made them trustees at all, and then (supposing he <lb/>
            had left money in this way) he would not have mentioned it <lb/>
            to them. How then do they know of its existence ? On the <lb/>
            other hand, if he believed them trustworthy, surely he would <lb/>
            not have placed the bulk of his property under their control, <lb/>
            and kept the remainder out of it. Again, he would never <lb/>
            have left this fund in the custody of my mother, and yet <lb/>
            given her in marriage to Aphobus, one of the guardians; for <lb/>
            it is absurd to suppose, that he would endeavour to secure <lb/>
            the treasure by her agency, and yet put her as well as the <lb/>
            money in the power of one of the persons whom he dis­ <lb/>
            trusted. Further, had there been any truth in this story, do <lb/>
            you imagine that Aphobus would not have made my mother <lb/>
            his wife, in pursuance of my father's will 1 He took her por­ <lb/>
            tion of eighty minas, apparently with an intention of many­ <lb/>
            ing her; but afterwards he made a mercenary match with <lb/>
            the daughter of Philonidas of Melita, that he might get <lb/>
            another eighty minas from him, in addition to what he had <lb/>
            obtained from our family. But had there been four talents <lb/>
            in the house, and in her keeping too, (as he represents,) don't <lb/>
            you think he would have flown to get both her and them <lb/>
            into his possession 1 Or is it likely that, after so shamefully <lb/>
            conspiring with his colleagues to rob me of my visible pro­ <lb/>
            perty, which many of you knew to have been left me, he <lb/>
            would miss the opportunity of seizing a fund, which you <lb/>
            would know nothing about ? Who could believe such a tale ? <lb/>
            It is impossible, men of the jury ; it is impossible. From that <lb/>
            hour indeed was my father's property buried, when it came into <lb/>
            the hands of these men ; and Aphobus, who cannot prove <lb/>
            that he has paid me any of it, seeks by this account to represent <lb/>
            me as a rich man, and so to deprive me of your sympathy.</p><pb n="133"/>
            
          <p>Many other charges might I bring against him ; but 1 <lb/>
            should not be justified in speaking of my own wrongs, while <lb/>
            the witness is in peril of disfranchisement. I will now read <lb/>
            you a challenge; from which you will see, that the statements <lb/>
            in the deposition were true ; that Aphobus, who now says he <lb/>
            required to examine Milyas upon all the items in dispute, at <lb/>
            first demanded him only on a question of thirty minas; and <lb/>
            also that he is not in the least damnified by the evidence. <lb/>
            Being anxious to prove him every way in the wrong, and to <lb/>
            bring his tricks and artifices in a clear light before you, I <lb/>
            asked him, what was the sum, in respect of which, as being <lb/>
            within the knowledge of Milyas, he desired to examine him; <lb/>
            to this he falsely replied, that it was the whole amount. <lb/>
            " Well then," said I, " upon this point you shall question the <lb/>
            slave who has the copy of your challenge: and if, after I have <lb/>
            sworn that you confessed the man to be free and testified to <lb/>
            the same effect against Demon, you will swear to the con­ <lb/>
            trary with imprecations upon your daughter, I release to you <lb/>
            the whole sum, in respect of which it shall appear from the <lb/>
            examination of the slave that you made your first demand <lb/>
            for Milyas; and by that amount I am content that the <lb/>
            damages awarded against you shall be reduced, so that you <lb/>
            may sustain no injury by the witnesses." This challenge, <lb/>
            which many persons saw given, he would not accept. Can <lb/>
            you then, who are upon your oaths, conscientiously convict <lb/>
            my witnesses at the instance of a man, who refused to give <lb/>
            this judgment in his own favour? Can you do otherwise <lb/>
            than look upon him as the most impudent of mankind ? To <lb/>
            prove the truth of my statements, call the witnesses.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[ Witnesses.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Do not suppose that, while I was prepared to take this <lb/>
            course, the witnesses were of a different mind. They proposed, <lb/>
            in confirmation of their testimony, to take a solemn oath in <lb/>
            the presence of their children, and with imprecations on them <lb/>
            if they swore falsely. Aphobus did not choose to let the <lb/>
            oath be sworn either by them or by me. He rests his case <lb/>
            upon an artful speech and witnesses accustomed to perjury ; <lb/>
            and by their aid thinks he shall easily impose on you. Take <lb/>
            and read this deposition to the jury.</p>

          <p>Is it possible to prove, in a clearer manner than I have <unclear/> <lb/>
            ione, the malice of this charge, the truth of the evidence <lb/>
            against my opponent, and the justice of the verdict which <lb/>
            condemned him ? I have shown, that he refused to examine, <lb/>
            as to the truth of the deposition, the very slave who wrote it <lb/>
            down; that his brother Æsius deposed to the very statement <lb/>
            which he declares to be false ; that Aphobus himself, when <lb/>
            called by me as a witness against Demon, his uncle and co­ <lb/>
            trustee,l gave the same testimony as the witnesses whom he <lb/>
            sues; that he declined to examine my female servants as to <lb/>
            the fact of Milyas being a freeman ; that my mother was <lb/>
            willing to make oath on the subject, with imprecations on <lb/>
            her children ; that I tendered for examination all the rest of <lb/>
            my servants, who knew every circumstance of the case better <lb/>
            than Milyas, and he rejected them all; that he has not sued <lb/>
            for false testimony a single one of the witnesses who fixed <lb/>
            him with the receipt of money ; that he did not produce the <lb/>
            will or let the estate, as the laws require; and lastly, that <lb/>
            when, by swearing a solemn oath after myself and the wit­ <lb/>
            news, he might have procured a release to the extent of the <lb/>
            sum as to which he required Milyas to be questioned, he did <lb/>
            not think proper to swear it. I declare to heaven, I could <lb/>
            not devise a surer method of proving my case, than the one <lb/>
            I have adopted. And yet Aphobus, clear as it is that he <lb/>
            calumniates the witnesses, and sustained no damage by their <lb/>
            evidence, and lost the verdict justly, still puts a bold face on <lb/>
            the matter. There would be less reason to wonder at the <lb/>
            style of his present language, if he had not been condemned <lb/>
            in the first instance by his own friends and by the arbitrator. <lb/>
            For you must know that, after inducing me to refer the case <lb/>
            to Archenaus and Dracontides and Phanus, (the last of whom <lb/>
            is defendant in this action,) he revoked their authority, be­ <lb/>
            cause he heard them say that, if they decided on oath, they <lb/>
            should give their award against him; then he went before <lb/>
            the official arbitrator, by whom, as he could make no answer <lb/>
            to my claim, judgment was pronounced for me. From this he <lb/>
            appealed to a jury; who, upon hearing the case, affirmed the <lb/>
            decision of his friends and the arbitrator, and assessed the <note type="footnote"> 1 He was not strictly a trustee, but, being the father of Demophon, <lb/>
            he very likely took a part in the management of the trust, and there­ <lb/>
            fore Demosthenes calls him so. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="135"/>
            damages at ten talents. They gave their judgment, not on <lb/>
            the ground that he had admitted Milyas to be a freeman, (for <lb/>
            this was of no importance ;) but because, an estate of fifteen <lb/>
            talents having been left to me, he would not grant a lease of <lb/>
            it; and because he and his colleagues managed it for ten <lb/>
            years, and he allowed me (then a child) to be assessed to the <lb/>
            property tax at one-fifth of the whole value, the same rate at <lb/>
            which Timotheus the son of Conon and men of the largest <lb/>
            fortunes were assessed; and, after so long managing a pro­ <lb/>
            perty, which he chose to be so highly rated, he delivered to <lb/>
            me, as the balance due from himself, not so much as the <lb/>
            value of twenty minas, and united with his colleagues to <lb/>
            plunder me of my whole substance, the capital as well as the <lb/>
            income. For these reasons the jury, allowing interest on the <lb/>
            whole amount, not at the rate at which estates are usually <lb/>
            let, but at the lowest rate they could, found the loss which I <lb/>
            had sustained by the fraud of'the guardians to exceed thirty <lb/>
            talents altogether; and therefore they assessed the damages <lb/>
            against this man at ten talents.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>APHOBUS, after the judgment obtained against him by .Demosthenes, <lb/>
            made away with almost all of his movable goods, so as to leave little <lb/>
            or nothing that could be seized in execution. Demosthenes, proceed­ <lb/>
            ing to take possession of a house and a piece of land, encounters the <lb/>
            opposition of Onetor, the brother-in-law of Aphobus, who pretends <lb/>
            that the land had been mortgaged to him, to secure a sum of money <lb/>
            given with his sister as a marriage portion. This money (as he <lb/>
            alleges) had become repayable, Aphobus and his wife having sepa­ <lb/>
            rated. The plaintiff, having made entry upon the land in assertion <lb/>
            of his right, is turned off by Onetor, against whom he commences an <lb/>
            action of ejectment.</p>
          <p>The question to be determined in this action is, whether the title of Onetor <lb/>
            is a good one. Demosthenes contends that the mortgage is colourable <lb/>
            and fictitious; that the marriage portion had never been paid to <lb/>
            Aphobus; that his wife had never really been divorced ; and that, in <lb/>
            fact, the whole scheme had been concocted between Aphobus and <lb/>
            Onetor, in order to defeat his execution. To support this charge of <lb/>
            fraud, he produces some direct testimony, but relies mainly upon the <lb/>
            circumstances and probabilities of the case, and upon admissions and <lb/>
            acts of his opponents, inconsistent with their present claim.</p>
          <p>An to the law connected with this case, the reader is referred to <lb/>
            Appendix IV.</p><pb n="136"/>
            
          <p>I WAS most anxious, men of the jury, to avoid my dispute with <lb/>
            Aphobus, and also this in which I am engaged with the de­ <lb/>
            fendant Onetor, his brother-in-law. I therefore made many fair <lb/>
            proposals to both of them ; but nothing like reasonable terms <lb/>
            could I obtain from either. Indeed I have found this man <lb/>
            far more troublesome and more deserving of punishment <lb/>
            than the other. I pressed Aphobus (though in vain) to let <lb/>
            our disputes be settled among friends, and not to try the ex­ <lb/>
            periment of a jury. But this man, when I offered to let him <lb/>
            decide his own cause, to avoid the risk of a trial, treated me <lb/>
            with the utmost contempt, refused to hold any conversation <lb/>
            with me, and in a very insulting manner turned me off the <lb/>
            land, which belonged to Aphobus when I recovered judgment <lb/>
            against him. Now then, since he unites with his brother-in- <lb/>
            law to deprive me of my property, and has come into court <lb/>
            relying on the influence of his friends, the only course left for <lb/>
            me is, to seek redress at your hands. I am aware, men of <lb/>
            the jury, that I have to contend against ingenious pleading <lb/>
            and witnesses prepared to give false evidence. I think how­ <lb/>
            ever, the justice of my cause will give me such advantage in <lb/>
            argument over the defendant,-that, if any of you had a good <lb/>
            opinion of him before, you will learn from his conduct towards <lb/>
            me, that he has all along been (unknown to you) the vilest <lb/>
            and basest of mankind. I will show you, that he has not <lb/>
            only never paid the marriage portion, for which he says the <lb/>
            estate is mortgaged, but has laid a plot from the very begin­ <lb/>
            ning to defraud me; and also that the lady, on whose behalf <lb/>
            he ejected me from this land, has not been divorced; and <lb/>
            that he is now screening Aphobus, and defending this action <lb/>
            with a view to defeat my lawful claims. All this I shall <lb/>
            prove by such clear and strong evidence, that you will at <lb/>
            once see the justice and propriety of the action which I have <lb/>
            brought against him. I shall commence with that part of <lb/>
            the case, which will best give you an insight into the whole.</p>
          <p>It was known, men of the jury, to many of the Athenians, <lb/>
            and it did not escape the observation of the defendant, that <lb/>
            my guardians were grossly neglecting their duty. The dis­ <lb/>
            covery was indeed made very early; numerous meetings and <lb/>
            discussions were held on the subject of my affairs, before the <lb/>
            Arch on as well as other persons. For the value of the pro­ <lb/>
            perty left me was notorious, and it was pretty evident, that <lb/>

            the trustees were leaving it unlet, for the purpose of enjoying <lb/>
            the income themselves. This being so, there was not a single <lb/>
            man acquainted with the circumstances, who did not expect <lb/>
            that I should recover compensation from them, as soon as <lb/>
            I came to man's estate. Among others who continued to <lb/>
            hold this opinion, were Timocrates and Onetor; of which <lb/>
            I can give you the strongest proof. The defendant, seeing <lb/>
            that Aphobus, besides his own patrimony, held mine also (not <lb/>
            a small one) in his possession, was desirous of giving him his <lb/>
            sister in marriage; but he was too wary to part with her <lb/>
            portion ; for he looked on the estate of a guardian as a sort <lb/>
            of security for the ward. Accordingly he gave him his sister, <lb/>
            but the portion it was arranged should remain in the. hands <lb/>
            of Timocrates, her former husband, who was to pay interest <lb/>
            thereon at ten per cent. so long as he retained it. After­ <lb/>
            wards, when I had obtained judgment in the suit against <lb/>
            Aphobus for breach of trust, and he still refused to make <lb/>
            me any satisfaction, Onetor, far from endeavouring to bring <lb/>
            us to terms, pretended that his sister had been divorced, and <lb/>
            that he had paid her portion and could not get it back, <lb/>
            (although at that very moment it was unpaid and at his own <lb/>
            disposal,) and then, saying he had taken a mortgage of the <lb/>
            land, was hardy enough to expel me from it. Such contempt, <lb/>
            did he feel for me, and for you, and for the laws of his <lb/>
            country. This, men of the jury, is the ground of the present <lb/>
            action, and these are the facts upon which you will have to <lb/>
            pronounce your verdict. I will first call before you Timo­ <lb/>
            crates himself, who will state, that he agreed to remain a <lb/>
            debtor for the lady's portion, and continued to pay interest <lb/>
            upon it to Aphobus according to the agreement; then I will <lb/>
            call witnesses to prove, that Aphobus himself confessed he <lb/>
            received the interest from Timocrates. Take the depositions.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Depositions.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>It is admitted, you see, that the portion was not actually paid <lb/>
            to Aphobus in the first instance. And it is highly probable <lb/>
            that, for the very reasons I have mentioned, they chose to defer <lb/>
            the payment, rather than mix it up with the estate of Apho­ <lb/>
            bus, over which so serious a liability impended. They cannot <lb/>
            say it was poverty that prevented their making an immediate <lb/>
            transfer; for Timocrates has an estate of more than teu <lb/>
             <pb n="138"/>
            talents, and Onetor above thirty; this then could not have <lb/>
            been the cause. Nor can they allege, that they had valuable <lb/>
            property, but no ready money ; or that the lady was a widow, <lb/>
            and therefore they hurried on the marriage without paying <lb/>
            her portion at once. For, in the first place, these men lend <lb/>
            a great deal of money to other people ; and secondly, the lady <lb/>
            was not a widow, but was living with Timocrates, and re­ <lb/>
            moved from his house, when they gave her away to Aphobus; <lb/>
            so that this excuse cannot be admitted any more than the <lb/>
            others. And I think, men of the jury, you will all agree upon <lb/>
            this point; that any man, contracting such an alliance, would <lb/>
            rather borrow of another, than not pay his sister's portion to <lb/>
            her husband. For, in the latter case, he is esteemed as a <lb/>
            debtor who is not certain to perform his engagements; <lb/>
            whereas, if he gives away the lady and her money together, <lb/>
            he becomes indeed a brother-in-law and a friend; he has then <lb/>
            acted an honourable part, and is not looked upon with mis­ <lb/>
            trust. This being so, as they were not compelled by any of <lb/>
            the causes just mentioned, and could not have desired, to <lb/>
            leave this debt outstanding, it is impossible to suggest any <lb/>
            other excuse for the nonpayment; it must have been, that <lb/>
            they would not trust Aphobus with the money for the reason <lb/>
            that I say.</p>
          <p>These points I establish beyond all dispute. And I think <lb/>
            I shall easily show from the facts themselves, that they never <lb/>
            paid in the sequel; and you will see that, even if they re­ <lb/>
            tained the money not with the view that I suggest, but with <lb/>
            the intention of speedy payment, they would never actually <lb/>
            have paid or parted with it; so urgent were the necessities <lb/>
            of the case.</p>
          <p>Two years elapsed between the marriage and their declara­ <lb/>
            tion of the divorce. The marriage took place in the archon­ <lb/>
            ship of Polyzelus, in the month of Scirophorion; the divorce <lb/>
            was registered in the month of Poseidon, in the archonship <lb/>
            of Timocrates. Immediately after the marriage I came to <lb/>
            man's estate, made my complaint, and demanded an account; <lb/>
            and, finding myself plundered of all my property, I com­ <lb/>
            menced my action in the last mentioned year. Now, that in <lb/>
            this short interval the debt continued according to the terms <lb/>
            agreed on, is not unlikely ; but, that it was paid, is incredible. <lb/>
            Do you think that a man, who originally preferred to remain <lb/>
             <pb n="139"/>
            in debt and to pay interest for his sister's fortune, in order <lb/>
            that it might not be risked with the husband's property, <lb/>
            would have paid it over when the suit against the husband <lb/>
            had begun ? Surely, men of the jury, you cannot suppose it <lb/>
            possible. Why, even if he had trusted him with the money <lb/>
            in the first instance, he would have sought to recover it then.</p>
          <p>To prove that the lady married at the time I mention, that <lb/>
            the dispute between Aphobus and myself had commenced in <lb/>
            the interval, and that, after I had brought my action, these <lb/>
            men registered the divorce with the Archon; take these <lb/>
            depositions as to each particular :</p>

          <p>After this archon comes Cephisodorus; then Chion. During <lb/>
            their years (being of full age) I continued to press my claim; <lb/>
            and I commenced my action in the archonship of Timocrates. <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>It is thus clear from the evidence, they have taken these <lb/>
            bold measures, never having paid the portion, for the purpose <lb/>
            of preserving to Aphobus his estate. For when in so short a <lb/>
            period of time they say they owed the money, they paid it, <lb/>
            they could not get it back, the lady separated from her <lb/>
            husband, and they became mortgagees of the land; how can <lb/>
            one avoid seeing, that they are acting in collusion, to deprive <lb/>
            me of the fruits of your verdict? I now proceed to show <lb/>
            you from the answers of the defendant himself, and also from <lb/>
            those of Timocrates and Aphobus, that it is impossible for <lb/>
            the portion to have been paid.</p>
          <p>I put questions, men of the jury, to each of these men <lb/>
            before many witnesses. I asked Onetor and Timocrates, if <lb/>
            any persons were present when they paid the marriage <lb/>
            portion; Aphobus I asked, whether any were present when <lb/>
            he received it. They severally answered, that no witness was <lb/>
            present, but that Aphobus got it by instalments in such sums <lb/>
            as he desired from time to time. Now can any one of you <lb/>
            believe, (the portion being a talent,) that Onetor and Timo­ <lb/>
            crates put so large a sum into the hands of Aphobus without <lb/>
            witnesses ? Aphobus! in paying whom—I won't say in this <lb/>
             <pb n="140"/>
            manner, but even in presence of a multitude-one would take <lb/>
            every precaution, so as (in case of dispute) to be able to <lb/>
            recover one's rights before you. In a transaction of such <lb/>
            importance no man would have taken steps without a witness, <lb/>
            whomsoever he had to deal with, much less with such a person <lb/>
            as Aphobus. It is for this reason we hold marriage feasts, and <lb/>
            invite our most intimate friends; because the affair is one <lb/>
            of moment; we are giving to the charge of others the happi­ <lb/>
            ness of our sisters and daughters, for whom we are most <lb/>
            anxious to make safe provision. It stands to reason therefore, <lb/>
            that, if the defendant really paid over the portion to Aphobus, <lb/>
            he settled with him in the presence of the same persons, be­ <lb/>
            fore whom he agreed to become a debtor and pay interest. <lb/>
            For, by so doing, he was discharged from the whole demand ; <lb/>
            whereas, by paying him when no one was by, he left the <lb/>
            persons, who witnessed the agreement, to be witnesses against <lb/>
            him of the continuance of the debt. The matter stood thus. <lb/>
            They could not persuade their friends (more honest than <lb/>
            themselves) to swear to their having paid the money. They <lb/>
            thought, if they produced other witnesses (not relations), you <lb/>
            would disbelieve them. They knew again, if they said the <lb/>
            payment was made all at once, we should demand for exami­ <lb/>
            nation the slaves who brought the money; and in that case, <lb/>
            if they declined to give them up, (as they certainly would if <lb/>
            the payment was never made,) their fraud would have been <lb/>
            detected. On the other hand, by saying they paid without a <lb/>
            witness, and by instalments, they hoped to escape detection. <lb/>
            Thus were they reduced to invent the present story. And <lb/>
            by such tricks and artifices they imagine that, passing for <lb/>
            simple-hearted persons, they can easily deceive you; the <lb/>
            truth being, that in matters affecting their interest, (so far <lb/>
            from simplicity,) they would not do the most trifling act <lb/>
            without all the caution of men of business. Take and read <lb/>
            the depositions of the persons, before whom they gave their <lb/>
            answers.</p>

          <p>Now, men of the jury, I will show to you, that the lady, <lb/>
            though nominally separated, was really living with Aphobus. <lb/>
            I think, if you are satisfied of this, you will feel more inclined <lb/>
            to withdraw your confidence from my opponents, and to re­ <lb/>
             <pb n="141"/>
            dress my wrongs. Some of the facts I shall establish by <lb/>
            direct testimony, others by circumstantial evidence of a <lb/>
            convincing nature.</p>
          <p>When I saw, men of the jury, that after the registration <lb/>
            before the Archon of this lady's divorce, and after Onetor had <lb/>
            declared the farm to be mortgaged for her portion, Aphobus <lb/>
            still occupied and cultivated the land, and dwelt with his <lb/>
            wife, I was sure it was all a pretence to cover the real design. <lb/>
            Wishing to satisfy you of this, I thought it right to convict <lb/>
            him in the presence of witnesses, in case he denied the facts <lb/>
            to be as I have stated. Accordingly I tendered him for the <lb/>
            torture a slave, who was well acquainted with the circum­ <lb/>
            stances; one who had belonged to Aphobus, and whom, <lb/>
            Aphobus being in default,1 I had taken in execution. The <lb/>
            defendant, as to his sister's living with Aphobus, declined the <lb/>
            inquiry which I proposed; the other matter (Aphobus <lb/>
            farming the land) was too notorious to be denied, so he <lb/>
            confessed it.</p>
          <p>But there is further proof that Aphobus lived with his <lb/>
            wife, and held the land, until just before the commencement <lb/>
            of the action. It appears from the manner in which he dealt <lb/>
            with the land after judgment. For, as though he had never <lb/>
            mortgaged, and the property would belong to me as judg­ <lb/>
            ment creditor, he carried off every thing he could, all the <lb/>
            produce and agricultural implements, except the casks; what <lb/>
            he was unable to remove, he left behind of course ; so that <lb/>
            Onetor was at liberty to claim the bare land. Here's a pretty <lb/>
            contrivance ! One says the farm was mortgaged to him, <lb/>
            though the mortgagor was seen cultivating it; and pretends <lb/>
            that his sister has been separated from her husband, when <lb/>
            he is proved to have declined the test of inquiry upon this <lb/>
            very point. The other, not living with his wife, (as the <lb/>
            defendant says,) carries away all the produce and implements <lb/>
            from the farm, while the guardian of the divorced lady, to <lb/>
            secure whom he says the land is mortgaged, shows no resent- <note type="footnote"> 1 If the judgment debtor did not pay by the appointed day, he was <lb/>

            meat at any part of his conduct, but takes it all quietly. Is <lb/>
            it not palpable what this means ? Is it not avowedly a plot <lb/>
            to screen Aphobus ?1 You must think so, if you fairly con­ <lb/>
            sider the facts. I will prove every point-the defendant's <lb/>
            confession that Aphobus farmed the land before I com­ <lb/>
            menced the action against him—his refusal to inquire by the <lb/>
            torture into the fact of his sister's cohabitation-and the <lb/>
            removal, after judgment, of all the agricultural stock except <lb/>
            what was fixed to the soil. Take and read these depositions.</p>

          <p>I have all these proofs that the divorce was not a real one. <lb/>
            But the best proof of all is the conduct of Onetor himself. <lb/>
            He who should have been highly indignant, when, after pay­ <lb/>
            ing (as he says) the portion, he got back (instead of money) <lb/>
            a farm with a disputed title; this very man—as though he <lb/>
            had no quarrel; as though he had sustained no injury; as <lb/>
            though he were on the most friendly terms with Aphobus— <lb/>
            pleaded his cause in the action which I brought against him. <lb/>
            Me, who had done him no wrong whatever, he used every <lb/>
            effort, in conjunction with Aphobus, to deprive of my in­ <lb/>
            heritance ; Aphobus, whom (if any part of their present story <lb/>
            is true) he should have looked upon as a stranger, he sought <lb/>
            to secure in the possession of my property as well as his own. <lb/>
            Nor did he confine his services to the trial; but, after judg­ <lb/>
            ment had been given against Aphobus, he went up to the <lb/>
            jury and supplicated them on his behalf, begging and praying <lb/>
            them, with tears in his eyes, to assess the damages at a talent <lb/>
            only ; and for this he offered to be bail himself. These facts <lb/>
            will hardly be disputed ; the jury who then sat on the bench <lb/>
            and many of the bystanders remember them ; however I will <lb/>
            produce witnesses. Here, take this deposition.</p>

            <title type="sub">[The Deposition.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>There is another strong circumstance, men of the jury, <lb/>
            from which you must see that Aphobus really lived with his <lb/>
            wife, and even to this day has not separated from her. The <lb/>
            lady, before her union with him, did not remain a day single, <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">προστασία</foreign>, according to the grammarians, signifies an attempt to <lb/>

            but left a living husband (Timocrates) to come to him ; and <lb/>
            now, in a period of three years, she does not appear to have <lb/>
            married any other man. Who can believe, that on the former <lb/>
            occasion she went straight from one man to another, to avoid <lb/>
            living single, and that now, (if she is really divorced,) she <lb/>
            would have endured to remain single for so long time, when <lb/>
            it was in her power to get a new husband, her brother pos­ <lb/>
            sessing so large a fortune, and she herself being so young ? <lb/>
            There is nothing probable about it, men of the jury. It is <lb/>
            mere fable. The lady is living with her husband openly, and <lb/>
            makes no secret of it. I will produce the evidence of Pasi­ <lb/>
            phon, who attended her in her illness, and saw Aphobus <lb/>
            sitting by her side, in this very year, after the commencement <lb/>
            of this action against the defendant. Take the deposition of <lb/>
            Pasiphon.</p>

          <p>Knowing, men of the jury, that Onetor, immediately after <lb/>
            the termination of the suit, had received the effects out of the <lb/>
            house of Aphobus, and got possession of all his property as <lb/>
            well as mine; and being assured that Aphobus and his wife <lb/>
            were living together; I demanded three female slaves, who <lb/>
            knew of the husband and wife living together, and of the <lb/>
            effects being in these men's hands, that we might have not <lb/>
            words only upon the subject, but proof by the torture. Onetor, <lb/>
            on my challenging him to this, which all who were present <lb/>
            declared was a fair proposal, dared not have recourse to so <lb/>
            sure a test; but--as if there were some better kind of proof <lb/>
            in such matters than torture and testimony- he would <lb/>
            neither produce witnesses to show that he had paid the <lb/>
            marriage gift, nor surrender the domestics, who knew whether <lb/>
            his sister lived with her husband, to be questioned upon the <lb/>
            fact; and, because I requested him to do so, he most con­ <lb/>
            temptuously and insultingly desired me not to talk to him. <lb/>
            Was ever man so unfeeling, or so determined to affect igno­ <lb/>

          <p>You, men of the jury, hold it as a maxim, both in public <lb/>
            and private, that of all methods of inquiry the torture is the <lb/>
            most certain; and when slaves and freemen are both at hand, <lb/>
             <pb n="144"/>
            and a fact has to be discovered, you do not use the testimony <lb/>
            of the freemen, but question the slaves, and thus endeavour <lb/>
            to ascertain the real truth. And very properly. For there <lb/>
            have been witnesses ere now, who were thought not to have <lb/>
            spoken the truth ; but no slave was ever convicted of giving <lb/>
            false evidence upon examination by torture. Yet the de­ <lb/>
            fendant, after declining so fair an offer, after rejecting so sure <lb/>
            and decisive a test, calling Aphobus and Timocrates, one to say <lb/>
            he paid the portion, the other that he received it, will ask you <lb/>
            to believe him, when he pretends that his business with these <lb/>
            men was transacted without a witness. Such simpletons does <lb/>
            he take you for. That their tale will be neither true nor <lb/>
            like the truth-by their confessing not to have paid the <lb/>
            portion at first-by their pretending to have paid it back <lb/>
            without witnesses—by the dates, which make it impossible <lb/>
            to have paid that money after the title to the property was <lb/>
            in dispute1—by these and all the other circumstances of the <lb/>
            case, I think I have clearly proved.</p>

          <p>ONE circumstance which I omitted in my former speech, <lb/>
            and which is as strong as any that were urged, to prove the <lb/>
            non-payment of the marriage portion by these men to <lb/>
            Aphobus, I will lay before you; and then I will proceed to <lb/>
            expose the falsehoods which you have heard from the de­ <lb/>
            fendant. You must know, men of the jury, when he first <lb/>
            thought of putting in a claim to the property of Aphobus, he <lb/>
            said he had paid, not a talent, (which he now says was the <lb/>
            amount of the portion,) but eighty minas ; and he set up <note type="footnote"> 1 My version of this clause is very similar to that of Pabst —" theils <lb/>
            aus den Zeitverhältnissen, welche offenbar die Annahme nicht gestatten, <lb/>
            dass er, nachdem schon über das Familiengut Streit erhoben worde - <lb/>
            das Geld werde ausgezahlt haben.” </note> <lb/>

            tablets,1 on the house for twenty minas, on the land for a <lb/>
            talent; wishing to preserve to Aphobus both the one and the <lb/>
            other. Seeing however by the issue of the late trial, with <lb/>
            what feelings an unscrupulous rogue is regarded by a jury, <lb/>
            he begins to reflect, and thought how hard my case would <lb/>
            appear, if, after being so grossly plundered, Aphobus having <lb/>
            all my estate, I had nothing of his to levy upon, and could <lb/>
            show that I was hindered from levying by Onetor. What is <lb/>
            it he does? He removes the tablets from the house, and <lb/>
            says the portion is only a talent, and for that the land is <lb/>
            mortgaged. Now it is evident that, if the tablets on the <lb/>
            house were fairly set up and told a true story, those on the <lb/>
            land were fair also. On the other hand, if the former were <lb/>
            false and set up with a fraudulent intention, we may presume <lb/>
            the latter were equally false. Upon this you should form <lb/>
            your judgment, not from my statements, but from the defen­ <lb/>
            dant's own conduct. He took down the tablets of his own <lb/>
            accord; no one compelled him; and thus by his own act he <lb/>
            shows himself to be an impostor. I shall prove my words. <lb/>
            Observe, he still maintains the land to be mortgaged for a <lb/>
            talent; and that he claimed twenty minas also on the house <lb/>
            by his tablets, and took them down again after the trial, I <lb/>
            shall prove by witnesses who know the fact. Here, take the <lb/>
            deposition.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Deposition.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>It is clear then, that having put up tablets on the house <lb/>
            for twenty minas, and on the land for a talent, he intended <lb/>
            to claim a charge upon them for eighty minas. Could you <lb/>
            have stronger proof of the falsity of all he says, than his <lb/>
            varying in his own account of the same transaction ? To me <lb/>
            it seems impossible to find a stronger proof.</p>
          <p>Now mark his impudence. He dared to say in court, that <lb/>
            he leaves me all the land is worth beyond a talent; when by <lb/>
            his own valuation it is worth nothing more. What did you <lb/>
            mean, Onetor, by fixing your tablets to the house for the <note type="footnote"> I To denote that the property was mortgaged. Pabst calls them <lb/>
            ' Verpfandungszeichen.” Auger calls the putting up of the tablets <lb/>
            " saisir la maison," or " faire saisie de la maison;" and to remove them <lb/>
            "lever la saisie." The French word is equivalent to our seizure or <lb/>
            distraint ; and is not very appropriate to this proceeding of Onetor. <lb/>

            twenty extra minas (when eighty minas was your demand), if <lb/>
            the land was really worth more ? Why did you not charge <lb/>
            the land with the twenty minas also ? or is this your plan ?— <lb/>
            when it pleases you to preserve the estate of Aphobus, the <lb/>
            land shall be worth a talent only, and the house be mortgaged <lb/>
            to you for two thousand drachms besides, and the portion <lb/>
            shall be eighty minas, and you insist on having both house <lb/>
            and land ; again, when that is not for your advantage, it <lb/>
            shall be otherwise-the house shall be worth a talent, because <lb/>
            I have it in my possession, and what remains of the farm <lb/>
            shall be worth not less than two talents, that I may appear to <lb/>
            be ill-using Aphobus, and not to be the injured party ? Do you <lb/>
            see that, while you pretend to have paid the portion, you are <lb/>
            proved not to have paid it in any manner whatsoever? Proved, <lb/>
            I say ; for conduct which is true and genuine is just as it was <lb/>
            in the beginning : 1 yours is shown to have been the contrary ; <lb/>
            you have acted with design, to aid the plots of my enemies.</p>
          <p>From this you may see, and it is worth considering, what <lb/>
            sort of an oath he would have sworn, if tendered to him. <lb/>
            For, when he said the portion was eighty minas, if one had <lb/>
            offered to give him that sum, upon his swearing to the truth <lb/>
            of his own statements, what would he have done 1 It is plain, <lb/>
            he would have taken the oath. On what ground can he deny <lb/>
            that he would have sworn it, when he makes such a claim <lb/>
            now ? Well then; he proves out of his own mouth, that he <lb/>
            would have been perjured; for now he tells you it was a <lb/>
            talent, and not eighty minas, that he paid. What reason <lb/>
            then have we to suppose, that he would be more forsworn in <lb/>
            that case than in the present 1 And what opinion can one fairly <lb/>
            entertain of a man, who convicts himself of perjury so easily ? 2</p>
          <p>But perhaps all his conduct is not of a piece, not evident <lb/>
            trickery from beginning to end. How can this be, when you <note type="footnote"> 1 Pabst—“ Denn Diess ist einfach der wahre und unverfälschte Her­ <lb/>
            gang der Sache, wie sie vom Anfang an geschehen ist." </note><note type="footnote"> The application of this maxim is, that Onetor's conduct was genuine, <lb/>
            when he refused to pay his sister's portion to Aphobus; his subsequent <lb/>

            oerted with Aphobus. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 i. e. of being ready to commit perjury: as Pabst expresses it in his <lb/>

            know that he spoke for Aphobus in reduction of damages, <lb/>
            fixing them at a talent, and offering to be bail to me for that <lb/>
            amount ? Here again is proof, not only that Aphobus lived <lb/>
            with his wife, and the defendant was on friendly terms with him, <lb/>
            but also that the marriage portion never was paid. For what <lb/>
            man would be such a fool as first to pay a large sum of money <lb/>
            on the security of an estate with a doubtful title, and then, not <lb/>
            content with his bad bargain, but as though the person who took <lb/>
            him in had done a righteous act, to become his bail for a judg­ <lb/>
            ment debt 1 No man, I should think. It is not rational to <lb/>
            suppose that a person, who was unable to recover a talent <lb/>
            due to himself, should promise to pay that sum to another, <lb/>
            and give bail for it too. No; the very act shows that he has <lb/>
            never paid the portion, but took the mortgage as a friend of <lb/>
            Aphobus, in return for my large property,1 and hoping to <lb/>
            make his sister a partner with him in my inheritance. And <lb/>
            now he endeavours to cheat and deceive you, by saying, that <lb/>
            he set up the tablets before judgment was given against <lb/>
            Aphobus. Yes, Onetor; but not before you had given judg­ <lb/>
            ment against him; at least, if there is truth in your present <lb/>
            story; for it is clear that, when you took these steps, you <lb/>
            were in your own mind satisfied of his guilt. But indeed the <lb/>
            argument is ridiculous; as if you, men of the jury, were not <lb/>
            aware that all rogues consider what they shall say, and no <lb/>
            one ever lost a cause for lack of words, or confessing himself <lb/>
            to be in the wrong. His lies are first detected, and then the <lb/>
            man's character becomes known. Such appears to me to be <lb/>
            the defendant's case. Come tell me, Onetor, how can it be <note type="footnote"> practice of tendering what I have called the evidentiary oath, or wager <lb/>
            of law. (See Vol. ii. Appendix ix. pp. 383—386.) The orator argues <lb/>
            thus—Onetor at first claimed eighty micas : he now admits the false­ <lb/>
            hood of this claim, which ought to have been a talent only : but if I <lb/>
            had offered to give him the eighty minas upon his swearing to the <lb/>
            justice of the claim, it is clear he would have sworn to it: [Quære:] <lb/>
            then he would have perjured himself: therefore he would perjure him­ <lb/>
            self now: and therefore you cannot trust him, &amp;c. </note><note type="footnote"> The argument, if good for anything, tends to show that a man's oath <lb/>
            is no better than his bare word, and that a liar is always ready to <lb/>
            commit perjury. </note><note type="footnote"> 1 Onetor does a good turn to Aphobus in taking the fictitious mort­ <lb/>
            gage. In return for this, his sister is married to a man so much the <lb/>
            richer by the plunder of Demosthenes; and perhaps Onetor himself <lb/>
            comes in for a share of this. </note> <note type="footnote"> L 2 </note> <lb/>

            just, that, if you put up tablets for eighty minas, the portion <lb/>
            shall be eighty minas; and if for more, more ; and if for less, <lb/>
            less ? Or how can it be just, when your sister up to this day <lb/>
            has never lived with another man, or been separated from <lb/>
            Aphobus, and when you have not paid the portion, and have <lb/>
            not chosen to resort to the torture or to any other fair mode <lb/>
            of determining these questions, that, because you say you <lb/>
            have set up tablets, the farm shall be yours 1 I cannot see <lb/>
            the justice of this. We must look to the truth, not to the <lb/>
            contrivances by which men like you patch up a plausible <lb/>

            before he became your brother-in-law ? And was it right <lb/>

          <p>DEMON, for whom Demosthenes composed the speech now before us, <lb/>
            was his uncle by marriage, as the reader has already seen (ante, <lb/>
            page 93). The action, in which he procured the orator’s assistance, <lb/>
            was brought against him under the following circumstances.</p>
          <p>He had entrusted a sum of money, which he held in partnership, to <lb/>
            a corn-merchant, named Protus, who engaged to purchase corn in <lb/>
            Sicily and bring it to Athens. The transaction between Demon and <lb/>
            Protus was probably a loan of a similar character to what we read <note type="footnote"> 1 The risk of having to pay a sixth of the damages, upon failure to <lb/>
            get a fifth part of the votes. This was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπωβελία</foreign>, which is a word <lb/>
            not translatable. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="149"/>
            of in the cases against Phormio and Lacritua, where the capitalist <lb/>
            lends money to the merchant adventurer on a sort of bottomry <lb/>
            speculation. The exact nature of their agreement is not explained. <lb/>
            Certain it is however that, according to the terms, Demon was <lb/>
            entitled to take possession of the cargo upon its arrival in the <lb/>
            Athenian port, and, if not to dispose of it, at least to hold it as <lb/>
            security till the loan with interest was repaid.</p>
          <p>Protus embarked in a vessel belonging to one Hegestratus, bound for <lb/>
            Syracuse, and having arrived at that place, purchased a quantity of <lb/>
            corn and put it on board. While the ship was yet in port, Heges­ <lb/>
            tratus enters into a conspiracy with Zenothemis, who was one of <lb/>
            his passengers, to commit a fraud of a highly criminal nature. Each <lb/>
            of them borrows money in Syracuse, and each refers to the other to <lb/>
            vouch for his responsibility. Hegestratus tells the persons, with <lb/>
            whom Zenothemis was negotiating, that he had a large cargo of goods <lb/>
            on board his vessel; and Zenothemis makes the like representation in <lb/>
            favour of Hegestratus. The money which they contrived to borrow <lb/>
            in this way they send to Maasilia (the modern Marseilles), of which <lb/>
            town they were both natives, and neither of them brings any cargo <lb/>
            on board. Their loans were made on the usual terms, that, if the <lb/>
            ship returned safe to Syracuse, the lenders should receive back <lb/>
            what they had lent with a large premium; if the ship were lost, <lb/>
            they lost their money. To cheat the creditors therefore, Hegestratus <lb/>
            and Zenothemis arranged to sink the vessel, after she had got out <lb/>
            to sea, and save themselves by boat. The third day after leaving <lb/>
            Syracuse, Hegestratus goes down in the night-time, and begins to <lb/>
            cut a hole in the ship's bottom. He is caught in the act by the pas­ <lb/>
            sengers, and, as they are about to inflict summary punishment on <lb/>
            him, he throws himself overboard, misses the boat, which had been <lb/>
            put out to save him, and is drowned. Zenothemis wishes the seamen <lb/>
            to abandon the ship, but Protus, who is anxious to carry his corn to <lb/>
            Athens, offers them a large reward if they will carry her into port, <lb/>
            and by dint of great exertions they get her safe to Cephallenia, one <lb/>
            of the Ionian islands. There, after the ship had undergone repairs, <lb/>
            Zenothemis proposed that she should sail to Marseilles. The matter <lb/>
            was referred to the authorities of the island, who decided that she <lb/>
            should be taken to Athens, her original place of destination.</p>
          <p>Upon the ship's arrival, Protus gives notice to Demon and his partners <lb/>
            that the corn was safe in port, and they immediately come down to <lb/>
            receive possession from him. To their surprise they find, that the <lb/>
            corn is claimed by Zenothemis, under the pretence that it had been <lb/>
            purchased by Hegestratus, and that he had lent money to Heges­ <lb/>
            tratus upon it. Words take place between them, and Zenothemis <lb/>
            proceeds to assert his claim by unlading the cargo; but this is pre­ <lb/>
            vented by Protus and Demon, who lay hands upon him and remove <lb/>
            him. Thereupon he commences an action against each of them. To <lb/>
            the action against Demon the present defensive pleading was pre­ <lb/>
            pared by Demosthenes.'</p>
          <p>The defendant puts in a special plea, alleging that the action is not <lb/>
            maintainable, because there had been no contract between the plain­ <lb/>
            tiff and himself, and the Athenian law only allowed actions of the <lb/>
             <pb n="150"/>
            present kind, where money had been advanced under a written <lb/>
            contract, upon some commercial enterprise from or to the port of <lb/>
            Athens. To make this intelligible, we must bear in mind, that the <lb/>
            suit against Demon was one of that class which the Athenians called <lb/>
            It mercantile actions;" for it was only to such actions that the plead­ <lb/>
            ing in question, and the law upon which it was founded, could have <lb/>
            any application. To suppose that a merchant or a shipowner could <lb/>
            have no legal redress for an injury, because the wrongdoer had not <lb/>
            entered into such a contract with him as that mentioned in the law, <lb/>
            would be manifestly absurd. But what the law meant was, that they <lb/>
            should not be at liberty to bring mercantile actions (properly so <lb/>
            called), unless the above-mentioned conditions were complied with. <lb/>
            Now these were actions of a peculiar kind, and were intended for <lb/>
            the advantage of people engaged in commerce. They were tried <lb/>
            before the Thesmothetæ during the six winter months, from Boed­ <lb/>
            romion to Munychion, while the ships were laid up in harbour. The <lb/>
            Judges were compelled to bring them to a final decision within a <lb/>
            month; and the losing party might be held to bail for the amount <lb/>
            of the judgment recovered. These advantages were reserved for <lb/>
            commercial enterprises to or from Athens; for it was the policy of <lb/>
            the Athenians to encourage their own trade, and particularly the <lb/>
            importation of corn to their own country; and they considered that <lb/>
            they were not bound to lend any extraordinary assistance to the <lb/>
            enforcing of contracts in which Athens had no interest. The con­ <lb/>
            dition that the contract should be in writing was one of obvious <lb/>
            policy, the same indeed which has dictated many similar enactments <lb/>
            in our own and other legal codes.</p>
          <p>That it was a mercantile action which ZenothemiB brought against <lb/>
            Demon, is expressly stated by the author of the Greek argument, <lb/>
            and is to be inferred from the language of the orator. Whether it <lb/>
            was maintainable by law, or whether the objection raised by the <lb/>
            special plea was a valid one, we are not in a condition to determine. <lb/>
            Perhaps the plaintiff might have replied to this effect—“ I satisfy the <lb/>
            requisition of the Athenian law; for I had a contract in writing <lb/>
            with Hegestratus, and I lent him money on an adventure from Syra­ <lb/>
            cuse to Athens. True, I have no contract with Demon; but I am <lb/>
            seeking redress against his tortious act, by which I should lose the <lb/>
            benefit of my contract with Hegestratus. In effect therefore I am <lb/>
            seeking to enforce a contract agreeable to the terms of your statute." <lb/>
            We may conceive that the plaintiff was prepared with some such <lb/>
            argument as this. The defendant does not seem to place great reli­ <lb/>
            ance on his special plea, and, as was usual upon the trial of these <lb/>
            pleadings, he enters fully into the merits of the case, and endeavours <lb/>
            to show that he has a good defence.</p>
          <p>The tortious act complained of, is the defendant's forcible taking of the <lb/>
            plaintiffs corn. The forcible character of the taking, like our trespass <lb/>
            vi et armis, is a fiction of law, technically necessary to support the action, <lb/>
            as explained in the fourth appendix to this volume. The defendant <lb/>
            does not dispute that he has committed the formal trespass, but <lb/>
            justifies it on the ground that he only took his own property, which <lb/>
            it was lawful for him to do. This (on the merits of the case) is the <lb/>
             <pb n="151"/>
            sole question to be tried, whether the right of property was in the <lb/>
            plaintiff or in the defendant.</p>
          <p>In this, as in most of the private speeches of Demosthenes, where we <lb/>
            see only one-sided statements and arguments, it is difficult even to <lb/>
            conjecture on which side lay the truth and justice of the case. Here <lb/>
            we may observe, however, that the defendant is fighting an uphill <lb/>
            battle, owing apparently to the conduct of Protus, who, after sup­ <lb/>
            porting his claim up to a certain point, makes terms (as Demon says) <lb/>
            with the opponent, suffers judgment to go by default in the action <lb/>
            brought against him by Zenothemis, and keeps out of the way to <lb/>
            avoid giving evidence. It is manifest that Protus should have been <lb/>
            Demon's principal witness, for it was he who purchased the corn; <lb/>
            and Demon labours under a difficulty in making out his case without <lb/>
            him. His great point is to show, that the present conduct of Protus <lb/>
            is inconsistent with his original acts; and he is helped to some ex­ <lb/>
            tent by the absence of Protus; for, had he been honestly opposed to <lb/>
            him, he would have given evidence for Zenothemis, which he did not <lb/>
            venture to do. The motives of Protus in going over to Zenothemis <lb/>
            are not made very clear by the orator; but this arises in some mea­ <lb/>
            sure from our not understanding his exact position with respect to <lb/>
            Demon.</p>
          <p>As to the mercantile actions, I refer the reader to Meier and Schömann, <lb/>
            Attic Process, pages 67, 84, 539, 579. Of the practice upon a Para­ <lb/>
            graphe, or special plea, I have given an explanation in Volume III. <lb/>
            Appendix IX. pages 378, 379.</p>
          <p>This speech has come down to us in an imperfect state. We collect <lb/>
            from the fragmentary passage at the end, that it was written some <lb/>
            time after Demosthenes had entered upon his political career. Its <lb/>
            date therefore must have been after B.O. 355.</p>
          <p>As I have pleaded, men of the jury, that the action is not <lb/>
            maintainable, I wish first to say a word about the laws, ac­ <lb/>
            cording to which I put in the plea. The laws, men of the <lb/>
            jury, declare, that actions between shipowners and merchants <lb/>
            shall be upon loans to Athens or from Athens,1 and concern­ <lb/>
            ing which there are contracts in writing; and if any one sues <lb/>
            without being so entitled, his action shall not be maintain­ <lb/>
            able. Now between the plaintiff Zenothemis and myself <note type="footnote"> 1 t. e. Loans for commercial adventures to Athens or from Athens. <lb/>
            Pabst—“ bei dem Verkehre, der von einem andern Orte nach Athen, <lb/>
            and von Athen nach einem andern Orte getrieben wird:" Meier <lb/>
            and Schömann, Att. Proc. p. 540, explain it thus: " über diejenigen <lb/>
            Schuldverschreibungen, welche entweder festsetzten, dass in einem <lb/>
            attischen Emporium Waaren ale Hypothek eingenommen, oder duas <lb/>
            sie in einem solchen abgeladen und verkauft werden sollten, und liber <lb/>
            die hieraus entapringenden Rechtsverhältnisse fUr Kauileute und <lb/>
            Schiffsherren.” See what I have said in the argument </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="152"/>
            there never was any loan or contract in writing, as he him­ <lb/>
            self indeed acknowledges in the plaint. He says he lent <lb/>
            money to Hegestratus a shipowner, and that, after he lost his <lb/>
            life in the sea, we appropriated the freight: this is the charge <lb/>
            in the plaint. I will in the same speech prove to you that <lb/>
            the action is not maintainable, and expose the whole of this <lb/>
            man’s rascally plot. I entreat you, men of the jury, if <lb/>
            you ever did pay attention to any matter, to attend to this. <lb/>
            You will hear a case of .unparalleled audacity and fraud, if <lb/>
            I am only able, as I think I shall be, to explain to you his <lb/>
            proceedings.</p>
          <p>Zenothemis the plaintiff, being an agent of Hegestratus <lb/>
            the shipowner, whom he himself states in his plaint to have <lb/>
            perished in the sea, (how this occurred, he adds not, but I <lb/>
            will tell you), conspired with him to perpetrate the following <lb/>
            fraud. He and the plaintiff borrowed money at Syracuse : <lb/>
            Hegestratus admitted to persons lending to the plaintiff, <lb/>
            when they made any inquiries, that the plaintiff had a large <lb/>
            quantity of corn in the ship; while this man admitted to <lb/>
            persons who were about to lend money to Hegestratus, <lb/>
            that the cargo of the ship belonged to him. As one was <lb/>
            shipowner, and the other passenger, they naturally got credit <lb/>
            for the statements which they made of each other. Imme­ <lb/>
            diately after they got the money, they sent it home to Mas­ <lb/>
            silia, and brought nothing into the ship. The agreement <lb/>
            being, as such agreements usually are,1 to repay the money if <lb/>
            the vessel arrived safe, they, in order to rob their creditors, <lb/>
            laid a plot to sink the ship. Accordingly, when they were <lb/>
            two or three days! voyage from land, Hegestratus went down <lb/>
            at night into the hold of the vessel, and began to cut a hole <lb/>
            in the bottom; the plaintiff, as if he knew nothing about it, <lb/>
            remained above with the other passengers. There being a <lb/>
            noise, the people in the vessel discover that something wrong <lb/>
            is going on in the hold, and run down to prevent it. Heges­ <lb/>
            tratus, when he was caught in the act, expecting that he <lb/>
            should be punished, runs away, and being pursued throws <lb/>
            himself into the sea: it being dark, he missed the boat and <lb/>
            was drowned. Thus he perished in a miserable manner, as <lb/>
            such a scoundrel deserved, meeting the fate which he designed <lb/>
            to infliot on others. The plaintiff, his partner and accomplice, <note type="footnote"> 1 See Appendix V. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="153"/>
            at that moment on board ship, immediately after the criminal <lb/>
            act, affecting to know nothing about it, and to be in as much <lb/>
            consternation as the rest, advised the sailing-master and <lb/>
            mariners to get into the boat and abandon the ship as <lb/>
            quickly as possible, as there was no hope of . saving her and <lb/>
            she was certain to sink almost directly : so he thought their <lb/>
            criminal design might be accomplished, and by the loss of <lb/>
            the ship they might rob the creditors of their money. <lb/>
            Having failed in this attempt—(for it was opposed by our <lb/>
            agent1 who was on board, and who offered large rewards to <lb/>
            the crew if they would save the ship; and the vessel was <lb/>
            brought safe into Cephallenia, chiefly by the favour of the <lb/>
            Gods, and next to them, through the good conduct of the <lb/>
            seamen)—he endeavoured, in conjunction with the Massiliotes, <lb/>
            the fellow-countrymen of Hegestratus, to prevent the ship <lb/>
            returning to Athens, alleging that he himself and the <lb/>
            money came from Massilia,2 and the shipowner and lenders <lb/>
            were of that place. Here too he failed, the magistrates in <lb/>
            Cephallenia ordering that the ship should return to Athens, <lb/>
            from whose port she commenced her voyage ; and thereupon <lb/>
            this man, who, one would have thought, would never have <lb/>
            dared to come here after his wicked acts and contrivances­ <lb/>
            this man, 0 Athenians, is so superlatively impudent and <lb/>
            audacious, that he has not only come here, but has claimed <lb/>
            my corn, and even brought an action against me.</p>
          <p>What then do you suppose is the reason ? What can have <lb/>
            encouraged the plaintiff to come here and commence his <lb/>
            action ? I will tell you, men of the jury : it gives me pain <lb/>
            to do so, I solemnly assure you; but I am compelled. There <lb/>
            are gangs of rascally fellows leagued together in Piræus; <lb/>
            you've only to see them to know who they are. When the <lb/>
            plaintiff was intriguing to prevent the ship returning to <lb/>
            Athens, we got one of these persons to go out as commis­ <lb/>
            sioner : he was a member of the councils slightly known <note type="footnote"> 1 That is, Protus, who had bought the corn with the defendant’s <lb/>
            money, and who, from the nature of his contract, appears to have held <lb/>
            a sort of middle position between an agent and a borrower. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Pabst thinks that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκεῖθεν</foreign> means, from Sicily, or from the west <lb/>

            to us, though we little thought what sort of a creature he <lb/>
            was; indeed it was as great a misfortune, if it is possible to <lb/>
            say so, as our having to deal with scoundrels in the beginning. <lb/>
            This man whom we commissioned-his name is Aristophon ; <lb/>
            the same person who has managed that affair of Miccalion <lb/>
            (so we are now informed)—has sold himself to the plaintiff <lb/>
            and undertaken this job for him ; indeed he is the plaintiff's <lb/>
            factotum in this case. Zenothemis has been only too glad to <lb/>
            accept his services. For when he failed in effecting the de­ <lb/>
            struction of the vessel, not having the means of repaying the <lb/>
            money he had borrowed—(how could he, when he had never <lb/>
            put its value on board ?)—he lays claim to my goods, and <lb/>
            pretends to have lent money to Hegestratus on the security <lb/>
            of that corn which our agent in his vessel purchased. The <lb/>
            lenders, who had been defrauded in the first instance, seeing <lb/>
            that, instead of money, they have only a rascal for their <lb/>
            debtor, are in hopes that, if Zenothemis imposes on you, they <lb/>
            may recover their own out of my property, and so are com­ <lb/>
            pelled for the sake of their own interest to espouse the cause <lb/>
            of this man, who they know is making a fraudulent demand <lb/>
            against me.</p>
          <p>Such (to speak in a short compass) is the matter upon <lb/>
            which you have to give your verdict. I will first produce to <lb/>
            you the witnesses who speak to these facts, and then explain <lb/>
            the rest of the case. Now read me the depositions.</p>

            <title type="sub">[The Depositions.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Upon the arrival of the vessel at Athens-the Cephal­ <lb/>
            lenians having ordered, notwithstanding the plaintiff's re­ <lb/>
            monstrances, that the vessel should return to the port <lb/>
            from which she first sailed-those persons who had lent <lb/>
            money on the ship from Athens took possession of her <lb/>
            immediately; and the purchaser took possession of the corn; <lb/>
            that was the person who had borrowed money of us. After­ <lb/>
            wards came the plaintiff, bringing with him our commissioner, <lb/>
            Aristophon, and laid claim to the corn, saying that he had <lb/>
            lent money to Hegestratus. "What do you say, man?” <lb/>
            exclaimed Protus immediately-that was the name of the <lb/>
            man who imported the corn, and who was our debtor—“You <lb/>
            give money to Hegestratus, whom you helped to deceive <lb/>
            people, that he might obtain credit! and when he was alwayp <lb/>
             <pb n="155"/>
            telling you that those who parted with their money would <lb/>
            lose it! Would you, hearing that, have parted with your <lb/>
            money?” He declared that he did, and brazened it out. <lb/>
            “ Well, granting what you say to be perfectly true”—replied <lb/>
            one of the persons present—“your partner and fellow- <lb/>
            countryman, Hegestratus, has tricked you, as it appears, and <lb/>
            for this he has passed sentence of death upon himself and <lb/>
            perished." " Aye”—said another who stood by—“ and that <lb/>
            this man has been throughout the accomplice of the other, <lb/>
            I’ll give you a proof. Before the attempt was made to bore <lb/>
            a hole in the ship, this man and Hegestratus deposited a <lb/>
            written agreement with one of the fellow-passengers. But, if <lb/>
            you gave your money in confidence, why should you have <lb/>
            taken an assurance before the wicked act ? if you were dis­ <lb/>
            trustful, why did you not, as the others did, get a legal <lb/>
            acknowledgment on land 1” I needn't go into all the par­ <lb/>
            ticulars. We got no result by these speeches. He stuck to the <lb/>
            corn. Protus and Phertatus, the partner of Protus, wanted <lb/>
            to remove him; but he resisted, and declared point blank, <lb/>
            that he would not be put out of possession by any one but <lb/>
            me. After that, Protus and myself challenged him to go <lb/>
            before the authorities at Syracuse; and if it should appear <lb/>
            that he (Protus) bought the corn, and the customs' duties <lb/>
            were entered in his name, and he was the person who paid <lb/>
            the price, then we proposed that the plaintiff should be <lb/>
            punished as a rogue; in the contrary event, that he should <lb/>
            recover his expenses and receive a talent besides, and we <lb/>
            relinquish our claim to the corn. Notwithstanding this <lb/>
            challenge and these declarations by Protus and me, it was of <lb/>
            no use; I had no choice but either myself to remove the <lb/>
            plaintiff by force, or to lose my security when it was safe in <lb/>
            port before my eyes. And Protus again-he protested that <lb/>
            he was willing to do anything-to remove the plaintiff, to <lb/>
            confirm my acts, or go out to Sicily :1 but if, in spite of such <lb/>
            willingness on his part, I chose to abandon the corn to <lb/>
            Zenothemis, he said it didn't matter to him. To prove the <note type="footnote"> 1 I have made the best I could of this obscure and probably corrupt <lb/>
            passage. Pabst, who adopts Schäfer’s emendation, <foreign xml:lang="grc">βεβαιῶν</foreign>, translates <lb/>
            thus: " Denn Protus seinerseits erklärte vor Zeugen, dass er das <lb/>
            Getreide ausschiffen wolle, und versicherte dabei, er Bey bereit, nach <lb/>
            Sicilien zurückzuschiffen.” </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="156"/>
            truth of these statements-that the plaintiff refused to be <lb/>
            put out of possession except by me,1 that he did not accept <lb/>
            the challenge to go out, and that he deposited the agreement <lb/>
            in the vessel-read the depositions:</p>

          <p>When therefore he would neither be removed by Protus, <lb/>
            nor make a voyage to Sicily to get the truth decided, and <lb/>
            when it appeared that he was privy to all the villainies of <lb/>
            Hegestratus, we who had lent our money at Athens, and who <lb/>
            had received our corn from the man who honestly purchased <lb/>
            it out there, had no alternative but to take it from the plain­ <lb/>
            tiff perforce. For what else could we have done ? It had <lb/>
            not occurred to any of us partners to imagine, that you <lb/>
            would ever pronounce the plaintiff to be the owner of <lb/>
            corn, which he advised the mariners to leave, so that it <lb/>
            might be lost by the sinking of the ship. This indeed <lb/>
            is the strongest proof that it in no way belongs to him; <lb/>
            for who would have advised persons willing to save his own <lb/>
            corn to abandon it? Or who would not have accepted <lb/>
            the challenge and made the voyage to Sicily, where these <lb/>
            things might have been clearly ascertained ? Again, I was <lb/>
            not likely to believe this of you, that you would decide <lb/>
            that the plaintiff might enter an action for this cargo, whose <lb/>
            entrance2 into your port he tried in more ways than one to <lb/>
            prevent, first, when he advised the crew to abandon it, <lb/>
            secondly, when in Cephallenia he opposed the ship's being <lb/>
            brought to Athens. For what a shameful and monstrous <lb/>
            thing it would be, after the Cephallenians ordering the ship <lb/>
            to proceed to your port, so that Athenians might get their <lb/>
            property, for you, who are Athenians, to adjudge the property <lb/>
            of your countrymen to persons who wished to throw it into <lb/>
            the sea, and to allow the plaintiff to enter an action for goods, <lb/>
            whose importation he tried wholly to prevent! 0 heavens! <lb/>
            you will surely do nothing of the kind. Now read me what <lb/>
            I have pleaded.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Plea.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p><note type="footnote"> 1 The object of Zenothemis, in insisting upon Demon's removing <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Read me the law.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Law.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>That I have pleaded in accordance with the laws, that the <lb/>
            action is not maintainable, I think has been sufficiently <lb/>
            proved; but you shall hear the contrivance of that cunning <lb/>
            man, Aristophon, who has arranged the whole plot. When <lb/>
            they saw that, according to the facts, they had no ground to <lb/>
            stand upon, they open a treaty with Protus, and persuade <lb/>
            the man to surrender the case to them. They had, it seems, <lb/>
            been trying that from the beginning, as now has become <lb/>
            apparent to us, but they had not been able to prevail on him. <lb/>
            For this fellow Protus, while he expected to get a profit out <lb/>
            of the corn imported, stuck close to it, and thought it better <lb/>
            to make a profit for himself and pay us our just dues, than <lb/>
            to enter into a league with them, and thus to make them <lb/>
            sharers in the advantage and do us an injury. But when, <lb/>
            after his arrival here and some negotiation about these <lb/>
            matters, corn had fallen in price, he suddenly formed other <lb/>
            views. And at the same time, 0 Athenians (for the whole <lb/>
            truth shall be told you), we his creditors began to quarrel and <lb/>
            be harsh with him, as the loss on the corn was about to fall <lb/>
            on us, and we complained that he had brought us a petty­ <lb/>
            fogging rascal instead of our money. For these reasons, and <lb/>
            being by nature (as we may presume) not very honest, he <lb/>
            goes over to these people, and consents to letjudgment go by <lb/>
            default in the action, which Zenothemis brought against him <lb/>
            before they had come to terms. For, had he released Protus, <lb/>
            his demand against us would at once have been shown to be <lb/>
            vexatious : and Protus would not consent to a judgment by <lb/>
            default while he remained at Athens; for then, in case they <lb/>
            performed their agreement with him—well and good-if they <lb/>
            did not, he might set aside the judgment by default. But <lb/>
            why do I dwell on these particulars ? If Protus actually did <lb/>
            what the plaintiff has put in his plaint, he deserves, in my <lb/>
            opinion, not only to have a judgment against him, but to <lb/>
            suffer death. If in the midst of tempest and distress he <lb/>
            was drinking so much wine as to be like madness, what <lb/>
            punishment is too severe for him ? Or if he was stealing <lb/>
            papers, or opening them clandestinely? With respect to <lb/>
            these matters, however, you will form your own private <lb/>
             <pb n="158"/>
            opinions. But don't mix up the proceedings of that action 1 <lb/>
            with mine, Zenothemis. If Protus has done you injury <lb/>
            by word or deed, you have, as it seems, satisfaction: none of <lb/>
            us opposed you, or seeks now to deprecate the consequences. <lb/>
            If, on the other hand, you have proceeded against him vexa­ <lb/>
            tiously, that most surely is no business of ours. But the <lb/>
            man is out of the way. Yes; through you; that he may <lb/>
            avoid giving evidence on my behalf, and that you may now <lb/>
            say against him what you please. For, had not the judgment <lb/>
            by default been your contrivance, you would at the same <lb/>
            time have summoned him and held him to bail before the <lb/>
            Polemarch; and, if he had given bail, he would have been <lb/>
            compelled to stay, or you would have had responsible per­ <lb/>
            sons to look to for your damages; if he had not given bail, <lb/>
            he would have gone to the lodging.1 Now however, having <lb/>
            entered into a combination together, Protus expects by your <lb/>
            assistance to escape payment of the deficiency2 which has <lb/>
            been created, and you by making a charge against him to <lb/>
            obtain possession of my property. Here is the proof—I shall <lb/>
            summon him as a witness : you neither held him to bail, nor <lb/>
            will summon him as a witness now.</p>
          <p>There is yet another way in which they hope to deceive <lb/>
            and impose on you. They will accuse Demosthenes, and say <lb/>
            that I relied on his assistance when I dispossessed the plain­ <lb/>
            tiff, imagining that this charge will obtain credit because he <lb/>
            is an orator and* a person of notoriety. Demosthenes, men <lb/>
            of Athens, is certainly my blood-relation, (I swear by all the <lb/>
            Gods I will tell you the truth)—I went and entreated him <lb/>
            to support and assist me as far as he was able: " Demon," <lb/>
            said he, " I will do as you desire : it would be cruel to refuse. <lb/>
            At the same time you must consider both your own position <lb/>
            and mine. Since I began to speak on public affairs, I have <lb/>
            never interfered in any private cause : and even in politics <lb/>
            I have retired from business of this kind..</p>

          </head>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">THE ARGUMENT.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>APATURIUS, the plaintiff, sues the defendant, whose name does not <lb/>
            appear, for twenty minas, alleged to be due from him upon a <lb/>
            guaranty which he had given for the performance of an award by <lb/>
            one Parmeno. The defendant denies that he ever gave such <lb/>
            guaranty, stating that another person, and not himself, was Parmeno's <lb/>
            surety. He alleges also, that the award given against Parmeno was <lb/>
            illegal and fraudulent, having been made contrary to the terms of <lb/>
            the reference between Apaturius and Parmeno; for the reference <lb/>
            was to three arbitrators, and the award was made by one only, acting <lb/>
            in collusion with Apaturius. The defendant put in three special <lb/>
            pleas: first, a plea similar to that in the last case; secondly, that <lb/>
            there had been a release of all causes of action between the <lb/>
            plaintiff and himself; thirdly, that the action was brought too <lb/>
            late, as guarantees were by an Athenian statute declared to be in force <lb/>
            for one year only. The first of these pleas seems hardly to apply to <lb/>
            the present case, (see the argument to the speech against Zenothe­ <lb/>
            mis). The release appears to have been given previously to the alleged <lb/>
            guaranty, and to have related to other matters. And the defendant <lb/>
            does not strongly insist upon the third special plea. We have not <lb/>
            the Athenian statute (which he refers to) before us, but, as the de­ <lb/>
            fendant intimates that he did not much rely upon it, we may reason­ <lb/>
            ably conjecture that the law afforded some answer to this objection. <lb/>
            The case was brought to a hearing (according to the practice) upon <lb/>
            the special pleas; but the defendant, not much relying upon them, <lb/>
            enters into the general merits of the case; and his chief point of <lb/>
            contention is, that the award was invalid for the reason above men­ <lb/>
            tioned. He gives a history of antecedent transactions between the <lb/>
            plaintiff and himself, partly to explain the origin of his connexion <lb/>
            with him, and partly with a view to show, that the present proceed­ <lb/>
            ing was got up from malicious motives.</p>
          <p>THE law, men of Athens, declares that merchants and <lb/>
            shipowners shall have their actions before the Judges, if any <lb/>
            wrong is done them in their trade, either upon a voyage from <lb/>
            Athens or upon a voyage to Athens; and it enacts, that the <lb/>
            wrongdoers shall suffer imprisonment until they have paid <lb/>
            what is adjudged against them, so that wrong may not lightly <lb/>
             <pb n="160"/>
            be done to commercial people. To those however who are <lb/>
            sued upon non-existent contracts1 the law gives the protec­ <lb/>
            tion of a special plea, so that vexatious demands may be <lb/>
            prevented, and the actions be confined to such merchants <lb/>
            and shipowners as are in reality injured. And many defend­ <lb/>
            ants in mercantile suits have before now pleaded according <lb/>
            to this law, and have come into court before you and shown <lb/>
            that their opponents were making false and vexatious charges <lb/>
            under the pretence of trading. Who the person is that has <lb/>
            conspired with the plaintiff against me and got up the present <lb/>
            proceedings, will in the course of my address become appa­ <lb/>
            rent to you. As Apaturius however is making an unfounded <lb/>
            charge against me and suing me contrary to law, as there has <lb/>
            been a mutual release and discharge from all the engage­ <lb/>
            ments entered into between him and myself, and there is no <lb/>
            other loan transaction between us, either on sea or land secu­ <lb/>
            rity,2 I have pleaded that the action is not maintainable, <lb/>
            according to these laws which I produce :</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Laws.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>That Apaturius has commenced his action against me <lb/>
            contrary to these laws, and has made an unfounded demand, <lb/>
            I shall show you by many proofs. I, men of the jury, have <lb/>
            been for a considerable period engaged in foreign trade, and <lb/>
            up to a certain time I made voyages myself; it is not quite <lb/>
            seven years since I gave up going to sea, and now, having <lb/>
            a moderate capital, I make it my business to lend it on <lb/>
            maritime adventures. As I have been to many places and <lb/>
            constantly attended the marts of commerce, I am ac­ <lb/>
            quainted with most of the seafaring people; and I am <lb/>
            very intimate with these men from Byzantium, through <lb/>
            having stayed so much there. My position being such as I <lb/>
            have told you, about three years ago the plaintiff made a <lb/>
            voyage to Athens with his fellow-countryman Parmeno, who <lb/>
            is a Byzantine by birth, but exiled from his country. The <note type="footnote"> 1 That is, as Pabst expresses it more fully,—“ die man wegen Forder­ <lb/>
            ungen vor Gericht stellt, worüber keine schriftlichen Contrakte vor­ <lb/>
            handen sind.”—See the opening of the last speech, and the argument. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Pabst—“ und ich auch keine neue Verbindlichkeit durch eine <lb/>

             <pb n="161"/>
            plaintiff and Parmeno came to me on tile exchange, and <lb/>
            began to talk about money. It happened that the plaintiff <lb/>
            owed a sum of forty minas on his ship, and the creditors <lb/>
            were pressing for payment, and were about to seize the ship, <lb/>
            as being forfeited by his default1 He being in distress, <lb/>
            Parmeno agreed to give him ten minas, and he requested me <lb/>
            also to advance him thirty minas, alleging that his creditors <lb/>
            (who coveted his ship) had slandered him on the exchange, <lb/>
            their object being to get possession of the ship by reducing <lb/>
            him to absolute insolvency. I happened to have no ready <lb/>
            money by me, but, being on good terms with Heraclides the <lb/>
            banker, I persuaded him to lend the sum required and take <lb/>
            me as surety. Just after the thirty minas had been pro­ <lb/>
            cured, Parmeno had a quarrel with the plaintiff; but having <lb/>
            agreed to advance him ten minas, and having given him <lb/>
            three of them, he was compelled, on account of the money <lb/>
            which he had parted with, to let him have the remainder <lb/>
            also. For the reason mentioned, however, he did not wish to <lb/>
            conclude the loan in his own name, but requested me to <lb/>
            make it as safe for him as I possibly could. So I received <lb/>
            the seven miuas from Parmeno, and for the three, which the <lb/>
            plaintiff had previously obtained from him, I got the plain­ <lb/>
            tiff to transfer his obligation to me;2 then I take a mortgage <lb/>
            of the ship and the slaves, till he should repay as well the <lb/>
            ten minas which he had received through me, as the thirty <lb/>
            for which he had made me his surety to the banker. Hear <lb/>
            the depositions that prove these statements:</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Depositions.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>In this manner Apaturius the plaintiff got rid of his credi­ <lb/>
            tors. Not long afterwards, the bank having been broken, <lb/>
            and Heraclides having been obliged for a time to keep out <lb/>
            of the way, the plaintiff endeavours clandestinely to send the <lb/>
            slaves from Athens and remove the ship out of the harbour. <lb/>
            From this arose my first misunderstanding with him. For <note type="footnote"> 1 Pabst—“legten Beschlag auf das Schiff als Unterpfand, weil der <lb/>
            Zahlungstermin nicht eingehalten worden war." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The commentators have not been happy in their interpretations of <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνθομολογησάμενο</foreign>s <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὸ</foreign>s <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῦτον</foreign>. Reiske, in his Index, imagines there was <lb/>
            a proceeding before the magistrate. Pabst omits these words. Auger <lb/>
            is near the meaning : " mettant sur mon compte lea trois qu'il avoit <lb/>
            déja données.” </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> M </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="162"/>
            Parmeno, discovering that the slaves were about to be carried <lb/>
            off, lays his hands upon them and stops it, and prevented the <lb/>
            removal of the ship; he then sends for me and tells me what <lb/>
            had happened. When I heard of it, I regarded this man as <lb/>
            a consummate scoundrel for his attempt, and I began to con­ <lb/>
            sider what was the best way to free myself from my guaranty <lb/>
            to the bank, and to prevent the foreigner's losing what he <lb/>
            had lent to this man through me. Having placed some <lb/>
            persons to watch the ship, I explained the matter to the <lb/>
            sureties of the bank, and delivered the security to them, <lb/>
            informing them that the foreigner had ten minas on the <lb/>
            ship. After this, I attached the slaves, so that, in case there <lb/>
            were anything short, the deficiency might be made good by <lb/>
            the slaves. In such manner, when I found Apaturius acting <lb/>
            wrong, I secured both the foreigner's rights and my own. <lb/>
            Apaturius however, as if he had been the injured and not the <lb/>
            injuring party, complained of my conduct, and asked if I was <lb/>
            not satisfied with getting quit of my own guaranty to the <lb/>
            bank, but I must attach the ship and the slaves for Parmeno's <lb/>
            money also, and make an enemy of him (Apaturius) on <lb/>
            account of a man in exile. I replied, that I was all the less <lb/>
            inclined to forsake a person who had put trust in me, because <lb/>
            he was in exile and misfortune when this man wronged him. <lb/>
            In short, I used every exertion, incurred the utmost hostility <lb/>
            of the plaintiff, and with difficulty recovered the money, the <lb/>
            ship having been sold for forty minas, the sum for which it <lb/>
            had been mortgaged. The thirty minas having then been <lb/>
            paid to the bank, and the ten minas to Parmeno, we in the <lb/>
            presence of several witnesses cancelled the bond upon which <lb/>
            the money was lent, and released and discharged each other <lb/>
            from our engagements, so that I had nothing further to do <lb/>
            with the plaintiff, nor he with me. Now hear the depositions <lb/>
            to prove the facts I state :</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Depositions.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Since that I have had no transaction with him great or <lb/>
            small. Parmeno sued Apaturius for the blows which he re­ <lb/>
            ceived from him when he stopped the carrying off of the slaves, <lb/>
            and for damages because he had prevented him making a <lb/>
            voyage to Sicily. While the action was pending, Parmeno <lb/>
            tenders an oath to Apaturius concerning some particulars of <lb/>
             <pb n="163"/>
            the plaint, and he accepted it, and gave a deposit, to be for­ <lb/>
            feited if he did not swear the oath. To prove the truth of <lb/>
            these statements, take the depositions :</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Depositions.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>After having accepted the oath, as he was aware that many <lb/>
            persons would know him to be perjured, he did not attend <lb/>
            to swear it, but, as if he could discharge himself of the oath <lb/>
            by bringing an action, he summons Parmeno into court. <lb/>
            While both their actions were pending, under the advice of <lb/>
            persons present they came to a reference, and drawing up <lb/>
            articles of submission, they refer matters to one common <lb/>
            arbitrator, their own countryman Phocritus, and each ap­ <lb/>
            pointed one to act as assessor, the plaintiff choosing Aristooles <lb/>
            of CEa, and Parmeno me. And they agreed in the articles <lb/>
            that, if we were all three unanimous, our judgment should <lb/>
            be binding on them, but, if we were not unanimous, they <lb/>
            should be bound to acquiesce in whatever the two decided. <lb/>
            Having concluded these terms, they gave sureties to one <lb/>
            another for their fulfilment; the plaintiff's surety was Aris­ <lb/>
            tocles, Parmeno's was Archippus of Myrrhinus. And in the <lb/>
            first instance they deposited the agreement of submission <lb/>
            with Phocritus; afterwards, upon Phocritus requesting them <lb/>
            to deposit it with some one else, they deposit it with Aristo­ <lb/>
            cles. In proof of my statements, hear the depositions :</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Depositions.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>That the articles of submission were deposited with Aria­ <lb/>
            tocles, and that the reference was to Phocritus and Aristocles <lb/>
            and me, has been proved to you by the testimony of those <lb/>
            who knew the facts. I entreat you, men of the jury, to hear <lb/>
            from me what occurred afterwards; for from this it will be <lb/>
            manifest to you that the claim made against me by the plain­ <lb/>
            tiff Apaturius is groundless and vexatious. When he per­ <lb/>
            ceived that Phocritus and I were of the same opinion, and <lb/>
            saw that we should give our award against him, wishing to <lb/>
            break off the reference, he attempted, in concert with the <lb/>
            man who held the articles, to destroy them. And he went <lb/>
            so far as to contend, that Aristocles was his arbitrator, and <lb/>
            said that Phocritus and I had no further authority than to <lb/>
            assist in reconciling the parties. Parmeno, indignant at this. <note type="footnote"> x 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="164"/>
            assertion, desired Aristocles to produce the articles of sub­ <lb/>
            mission, adding, that the proof was not far off, if any tricks <lb/>
            were played with the document, for his own servant had <lb/>
            written it out. Aristocles promised to produce the articles, <lb/>
            but he has not given us a sight of them to this hour. He <lb/>
            met us at the appointed day in the temple of Vulcan, and as <lb/>
            an excuse for not bringing the paper stated, that his boy <lb/>
            while waiting for him had fallen asleep and lost it. The <lb/>
            contriver of this plot was Eryxias, the physician from Piræus, <lb/>
            an intimate friend of Aristocles; and he it is who has got up <lb/>
            these proceedings against me, because he has a quarrel with <lb/>
            me. Now for the evidence, that Aristocles pretended he had <lb/>
            lost the paper.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Depositions.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>After this the reference was at an end, the articles of sub­ <lb/>
            mission having been made away with, and the authority of <lb/>
            the arbitrators disputed. They endeavoured to draw up new <lb/>
            articles, but could not agree about them, as the plaintiff <lb/>
            wanted Aristocles, and Parmeno wanted the three, to whom <lb/>
            the reference had been made originally. However, though <lb/>
            there had been no fresh articles drawn, though the original <lb/>
            articles had been made away with, the person who had caused <lb/>
            their disappearance was impudent enough to declare, that he <lb/>
            would pronounce his award alone. Parmeno in the presence <lb/>
            of witnesses, whom he had brought expressly for the purpose, <lb/>
            gave notice to Aristocles not to make an award against him <lb/>
            contrary to the articles without his colleagues. Hear the <lb/>
            evidence of the persons, in whose presence he gave the notice.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Deposition.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>After this, men of the jury, a heavy misfortune befel <lb/>
            Parmeno. He was dwelling in Ophrynium,l on account of <lb/>
            his exile from home, when the earthquake happened in the <lb/>
            Chersonese; his house was shaken down, and his wife and <lb/>
            children perished. As soon as he heard of the misfortune, he <lb/>
            took ship and departed from Athens. Aristocles, notwith­ <lb/>
            standing the man's notice (given in the presence of witnesses), <lb/>
            not to make an award against him without the co-arbitrators, <lb/>
            after Parmeno had left the country on account of his mister- <note type="footnote"> 1 'A town on the Asiatic side of the Hellospont. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="165"/>
            tune, pronounced an award against him for non- appearance. <lb/>
            And, while Phocritus and I, who were nominated in the same <lb/>
            articles, declined to act in the arbitration because the plain­ <lb/>
            tiff disputed our having authority from him, Aristocles, whose <lb/>
            authority was disputed, and who had also been expressly for­ <lb/>
            bidden to act, nevertheless pronounced his judgment; a thing <lb/>
            which not one of you, and indeed no other Athenian, would <lb/>
            venture to do.</p>
          <p>For these proceedings of Apaturius and the arbitrator in <lb/>
            making away with the articles and pronouncing the award, <lb/>
            the injured party, if ever he returns safe to Athens, will ob­ <lb/>
            tain satisfaction from them. As Apaturius however has been <lb/>
            impudent enough to go to law with me, on the alleged ground <lb/>
            that I undertook to pay whatever sum should be awarded <lb/>
            against Parmeno, and as he asserts that I was introduced as <lb/>
            surety into the articles, I will take the proper way to dispose <lb/>
            of such a charge; I will first call witnesses before you, to <lb/>
            prove that it was not I who became surety for Parmeno, but <lb/>
            Archippus of Myrrhinus, and then I will proceed, men of <lb/>
            the jury, to establish my defence by circumstantial proofs.</p>
          <p>In the first place then I consider, that the time is evidence <lb/>
            for me, that the claim is unfounded. For the reference be­ <lb/>
            tween Apaturius and Parmeno and the decision of Aristocles <lb/>
            took place three years ago; and the merchants have their <lb/>
            actions every month from Boedromion to Munychion, so that <lb/>
            they may obtain speedy justice and put to sea. If then I <lb/>
            was in truth a surety for Parmeno, first let me ask, why did <lb/>
            he not compel me to pay what I had guaranteed immediately <lb/>
            after the judgment? He can never say, that he was re­ <lb/>
            luctant to give me offence, on account of his friendly feeling <lb/>
            towards me : for I had rigorously compelled him to pay the <lb/>
            thousand drachms due to Parmeno; and when he was re­ <lb/>
            moving the ship out of port, with intent to run away and <lb/>
            escape payment of the debt to the bank, he was prevented <lb/>
            by me. Therefore, if I had made myself responsible for <lb/>
            Parmeno, he would not have demanded the guaranty three <lb/>
            years afterwards, but would have taken measures to get it <lb/>
            immediately.</p>
          <p>But perhaps he was in easy circumstances, so that he <lb/>
            might conveniently come upon me at a later period, and he <lb/>
            had then no leisure, as he was going to sea. Why, he had <pb n="166"/>
            <unclear/> <lb/>
            seen forced for want of money to part with his effects and <lb/>
            sell his ship. And, supposing even that there was any cause <lb/>
            which prevented his suing me at that moment, why, when <lb/>
            he was in the country last year, did he never venture, I will <lb/>
            not say to go to. law, but even to make a demand ? It was <lb/>
            clearly his business, if judgment had been given for him <lb/>
            against Parmeno and I was surety, to come to me in person <lb/>
            with witnesses, and demand the sum guaranteed, if not the <lb/>
            year before last, at all events in the year following; then, if <lb/>
            I offered payment, to take his money, otherwise to commence <lb/>
            an action. For, upon claims of this sort, all people make <lb/>
            demands before they go to law. Now there is not a witness <lb/>
            who will say he was ever present, either last year or the year <lb/>
            before last, when Apaturius took any legal proceeding against <lb/>
            me, or spoke a single word to me on the subject of the claim <lb/>
            for which he now sues me. To prove that he was in the <lb/>
            country last year when the law-courts were open, please to <lb/>
            take the deposition.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Deposition.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Now take the law which enacts that guaranties shall be in <lb/>
            force for a year.1 And I don't insist under the statute, that <lb/>
            I ought not to pay damages if I became surety, but I say, <lb/>
            the statute is my witness that I never was surety, and so is <lb/>
            the plaintiff himself; for otherwise he would have sued me <lb/>
            on the guaranty in the time specified by the law.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Law.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Let this serve me for an additional proof of the falsehood <lb/>
            of Apaturius. If I had become surety to him for Parmeno, <lb/>
            I should never have incurred the enmity of the plaintiff for <lb/>
            Parmeno's sake, to protect him against losing what he lent to <lb/>
            the plaintiff through me, and yet have allowed Parmeno to <lb/>
            leave me liable on my guaranty to the plaintiff. For what <lb/>
            hope had I that any forbearance would be shown me by the <lb/>
            plaintiff, whom I had myself compelled to do justice to Par­ <lb/>
            meno ? And, when I had been so rigorous in forcing him to <lb/>
            satisfy the guarantee to the bank, what treatment could I <lb/>
            expect from him myself 1 <note type="footnote"> 1 The statute would begin to run, not from the date of the guaranty, <lb/>
            but from the time of default. It may possibly be, that Parmeno'a <lb/>
            absence abroad extended the period of liability. </note> <pb n="167"/>
            </p>
          <p>It is worthy also of your consideration, men of the jury, <lb/>
            that, if I had been surety, I should never have denied the <lb/>
            fact: for my argument was much stronger, if I admitted the <lb/>
            guaranty and appealed to the articles, which contained the <lb/>
            terms of the reference. Evidence has been given to you, that <lb/>
            the reference was made to three arbitrators. If there has <lb/>
            been no decision by the three, for what purpose should <lb/>
            I have denied the guaranty? For, if the judgment was not <lb/>
            given according to the articles, I should not be liable on the <lb/>
            guaranty. Therefore, men of the jury, I should never have <lb/>
            abandoned a good existing defence, if I had been surety, and <lb/>
            had recourse to a denial of the fact.1</p>
          <p>Again, it has been proved to you in evidence, that, when <lb/>
            the articles of submission were made away with by these <lb/>
            men, Apaturius and Parmeno sought to have fresh articles <lb/>
            drawn up, as if their former agreement was of no effect. <lb/>
            Now, when for the judgment that was to be given they <lb/>
            endeavoured to get fresh articles drawn, the existing ones <lb/>
            being lost, how was it possible that without fresh articles <lb/>
            having been drawn there could be either an arbitration or a <lb/>
            guaranty? Their disagreement upon this very point pre­ <lb/>
            vented the drawing up of another writing, as the plaintiff <lb/>
            insisted upon having one arbitrator, and Parmeno required <lb/>
            three. But if the original articles were made away with, by <lb/>
            which he alleges that I became surety, and new articles were <lb/>
            not framed, how can he rightly sue me, against whom he can <lb/>
            produce no agreement ?</p>
          <p>That Parmeno forbade Aristocles to pronounce judgment <lb/>
            against him without his co-arbitrators, has been proved to <lb/>
            you by the testimony of witnesses. When it appears there­ <lb/>
            fore that the same person has made away with the writing, <lb/>
            which contained the terms of arbitration, and says that he <lb/>
            has made an award without his colleagues, in spite of the <lb/>
            prohibitory notice, how can you honestly condemn me upon <lb/>
            the credit of this man ? Consider, men of the jury. Sup­ <lb/>
            pose Apaturius the plaintiff were now proceeding not against <note type="footnote"> 1 This is a weak argument. A man may have two good defences, or <lb/>
            he may set up two false defences. In the first case, there is no reason <lb/>
            why he should abandon either of the strings to his bow; and in the <lb/>
            second case, the truth of one defence cannot in any degree be est <lb/>
            blished by the fact that another is pleaded. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="168"/>
            me, but against Parmeno, to recover the twenty minas, rely­ <lb/>
            ing upon the judgment of Aristocles, and Parmeno were <lb/>
            making his defence here in person, and calling witnesses,. <lb/>
            to prove first, that Aristocles was not appointed single arbi­ <lb/>
            trator, but only one of three, secondly, that he forbade <lb/>
            Aristocles to publish an award against him without his col­ <lb/>
            leagues, and that, after his wife and children had perished by <lb/>
            the earthquake, and he in consequence of that misfortune <lb/>
            had sailed home, the person who had made away with the <lb/>
            articles of submission gave judgment by default against him <lb/>
            in his absence-is there one of you who, on Parmeno's <lb/>
            making such a defence, would have upheld an award so <lb/>
            illegally pronounced ? We will not put the case that every­ <lb/>
            thing was disputed; let us suppose that the articles were in <lb/>
            existence, and that the arbitrator Aristocles was admitted to <lb/>
            possess sole authority, and that Parmeno had not forbidden <lb/>
            him to make an award against him, but the misfortune had <lb/>
            happened to the man before the award was pronounced­ <lb/>
            what adversary or what arbitrator would have been so cruel <lb/>
            as not to postpone the proceedings till the man's return to <lb/>
            this country ? Then, if Parmeno, were it his defence, would <lb/>
            be thought to have in every way a better case than the plain­ <lb/>
            tiff, how can you justly give a verdict against me, who have <lb/>
            no contract whatsoever with this man ?</p>
          <p>That my special plea is a good one, that Apaturius has <lb/>
            made an unfounded claim against me, and brought his action <lb/>
            contrary to the laws, I think, men of the jury, has been made <lb/>
            out to you by many proofs. Upon the main question- <lb/>
            Apaturius will not even venture to assert, that he has any <lb/>
            articles of submission. When he falsely tells you that I was <lb/>
            inserted as surety in the articles with Parmeno, ask him for <lb/>
            the articles; and meet him with this answer, that all people, <lb/>
            when they enter into written agreements with each other, <lb/>
            deposit them under seal with persons whom they can trust <lb/>
            for this express purpose, that, in case of any dispute between <lb/>
            them, they may have the means of referring to the document <lb/>
            and so clearing up the disputed point. And when a man, <lb/>
            removing the evidence out of the way, attempts to deceive <lb/>
            you with words, how can you put any confidence in him? <lb/>
            But perhaps (for that's the easiest course for persons who <lb/>
            mean to cheat and make false claims) some witness will depose <lb/>
             <pb n="169"/>
            for him against me. If then I proceed against the witness, <lb/>
            how will he make out that his testimony was true ? By the <lb/>
            articles of submission ? Then don't let this be postponed; <lb/>
            let the person who has the articles bring them here directly. <lb/>
            If he says they are lost, where can I, oppressed by false <lb/>
            testimony, find the means of refuting it 11 If the writing <lb/>
            had been deposited with me, Apaturius might have alleged <lb/>
            that I had suppressed the articles on account of my guarantee; <lb/>
            but if the articles were deposited with Aristocles, how comes <lb/>
            it, if they have been lost without the plaintiff's knowledge, <lb/>
            that, instead of suing the person who received and does not <lb/>
            produce them, he makes a charge against me, calling as wit­ <lb/>
            ness against me the person who has suppressed the articles, <lb/>
            whom he ought to regard with displeasure, if they were not <lb/>
            conspiring together to play tricks ?</p>
          <p>I have honestly stated my case, to the best of my ability. <lb/>
            It is for you to give a righteous verdict according to the <lb/>
            laws. <note type="footnote"> 1 " If he says it is lost, and his witness gives a false account of its <lb/>
            contents, what means have I of convicting him of falsehood?”—i.e. <lb/>
            " what other means but by showing that it is his business to produce <lb/>
            the writing ! His witness kept it, not L If he will not produce it, you <lb/>
            ought not to believe him." </note><note type="footnote"> Such is the argument. In effect it would go this length, that a person <lb/>
            who loses a document in his custody, ought under no circumstances to <lb/>
            be allowed to give secondary evidence of its contents. We hold that, <lb/>
            on good proof of the loss, secondary evidence may be given; and the <lb/>
            absence of the document is matter of observation, the force of which <lb/>

            <title type="sub">THE ARGUMENT.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>CHRYSIPPUS and his partner lent a sum of twenty minas to Phormio, a <lb/>
            merchant, upon the following terms contained in a written agree­ <lb/>
            ment. Phormio was to take out a cargo of goods (value forty <lb/>
            minas) from Athens, in a ship belonging to one Lampis, which was <lb/>
            bound for Bosporus (or Panticapæum) in the Crimea. From Bosporus <lb/>
            he was to bring a return cargo to Athens, and, if the ship arrived <lb/>
            safe, he was to repay the money lent, together with a premium of <lb/>
            six minas; the return cargo was to be deposited as security with the <lb/>
            lenders, until the twenty-six minas were paid. Phormio bound him­ <lb/>
            self to pay a penalty of fifty minas, in case he did not ship the return <lb/>
            cargo. There appears to have been a clause giving him an option, <lb/>
            instead of shipping a return cargo, to pay the money due under the <lb/>
            contract to Lampis, the shipowner; and it would seem (though <lb/>
            there is a good deal of obscurity in the matter), that in this event he <lb/>
            was bound to pay something over the twenty-six minas by way of <lb/>
            penalty, owing (we may suppose) to the increased risk run by the <lb/>
            lenders, since Lampis, though he had a wife and children at Athens, <lb/>
            was a foreigner and person of doubtful responsibility.</p>
          <p>Such was the substance of this agreement, as far as we can make out <lb/>
            from the statement of the orator. The reader should compare it <lb/>
            with that which is set forth in the speech against Lacritus, <lb/>
            which contains many similar terms. For a breach of this agreement <lb/>
            an action is brought by Chrysippus and his partner against Phormio.</p>
          <p>The plaintiffs in support of their case represent, that Phormio com­ <lb/>
            mitted a fraud upon them in the outset by not taking from Athens <lb/>
            a cargo of the stipulated value; that, when he arrived in Bosporus, <lb/>
            having found no market for his goods, he was unable to purchase <lb/>
            the return cargo, and informed Lampis to that effect; Lampis ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly left Bosporus without him, but suffered shipwreck, losing <lb/>
            his ship and all the goods that he had taken out, but saving his own <lb/>
            life by the boat. When Lampis came to Athens, he reported these <lb/>
            facts to the plaintiffs, and they, relying on his report, sued Phormio <lb/>
            upon the agreement soon after his return to Athens. The parties <lb/>
            agreed to refer the case to an arbitrator, before whom Lampis ap­ <lb/>
            peared as a witness, and, having been previously tampered with by <lb/>
            Phormio, told an entirely different story, representing that Phormio <lb/>
            had paid him in Bosporus the money due to the plaintiffs under the <lb/>
            agreement, and that he was not in his right mind when he made his <lb/>
             <pb n="171"/>
            first report to Chrysippus. The arbitrator, not liking to decide the <lb/>
            case, sent it to be tried by a jury.</p>
          <p>The defence relied on by Phormio may be gathered from what has <lb/>
            been already stated. He alleged that he had satisfied the terms of <lb/>
            the agreement by his payment to Lampis. The plaintiffs say, that <lb/>
            he originally set up the shipwreck as his defence, but afterwards <lb/>
            abandoned this point, because the facts were so notorious; and it <lb/>
            could not be questioned in point of law, that the loss of the ship <lb/>
            would not discharge him from his liability, unless he had shipped a <lb/>
            return cargo. If however the alleged payment to Lampis at Bos­ <lb/>
            porus was a good discharge under the agreement, the loss of the ship <lb/>
            became immaterial, as regards Phormio, though it might perhaps <lb/>
            have been important as affecting the liability (if any) incurred by <lb/>
            Lampis to the plaintiffs. In this case the main question was, whether <lb/>
            the money was really paid to Lampis or not; and the plaintiffs urge <lb/>
            various arguments to prove that the payment never was made.</p>
          <p>The defendant raised also a technical objection by special plea, similar <lb/>
            to that in the case of Zenothemis, viz. that a mercantile action did <lb/>
            not lie under the Athenian law, because there was no subsisting <lb/>
            contract between the plaintiffs and himself. To this the plaintiffs <lb/>
            reply satisfactorily enough, that the objection was admissible only <lb/>
            where there had been no contract at all, not where the defence was <lb/>
            that the terms of the contract had been performed; for such a defence <lb/>
            as that there was no occasion for a special plea.</p>
          <p>As the case was brought to trial upon the special plea, the defendant <lb/>
            began, and the speech which follows was spoken by the plaintiffs in <lb/>
            answer to the defendant's opening. It appears that each of the <lb/>
            plaintiffs addressed the jury in turn, Chrysippus delivering the first <lb/>
            half of the speech, and his partner the latter half.</p>
          <p>We gather from internal evidence, that the date of this oration was <lb/>
            about two or three years after the capture of Thebes by Alex­ <lb/>
            ander, at which time Demosthenes, having no political matters to <lb/>
            attend to, had leisure to resume his old occupation of a speech- <lb/>
            writer.</p>
          <p>I SHALL ask you, men of the jury, only what is just; to hear <lb/>
            us, as we take our turns of addressing you, with good will, <lb/>
            considering that we are persons wholly inexperienced in law, <lb/>
            and, though we have for a long time frequented your mart <lb/>
            of commerce and advanced loans to various people, we have <lb/>
            never until now appeared in any lawsuit before you, either <lb/>
            as plaintiffs or defendants. And be assured, men of Athens, <lb/>
            we should not now have commenced our action against <lb/>
            Phormio, if we believed that the money which we lent him <lb/>
            bad been lost in the shipwrecked vessel: not so devoid are <lb/>
            we of shame, nor so unaccustomed to sustain losses. But <lb/>
            as many people reproached us, and especially the merchants <lb/>
            who were in Bosporus with Phormio, who knew that he had <lb/>
             <pb n="172"/>
            not lost his money in the wreck, we thought it would be <lb/>
            cowardly not to seek redress for the wrong which the de­ <lb/>
            fendant had done us.</p>
          <p>With regard to the special plea, I shall be very brief. <lb/>
            These men do not absolutely deny that there was any con­ <lb/>
            tract on your exchange, but say that there is no contract <lb/>
            still subsisting against them, because they have committed <lb/>
            no breach of the terms in the agreement. Now the laws, <lb/>
            according to which you have to decide, do not use this lan­ <lb/>
            guage : they allow the defence to be pleaded, when there has <lb/>
            been no contract at Athens or to the Athenian port; but if <lb/>
            a man, admitting that there was a contract, contends that he <lb/>
            has performed all the terms of it, they require him to make <lb/>
            his defence on the merits, not to raise an objection by plead­ <lb/>
            ing.1 However, I doubt not that by the facts of the case I <lb/>
            can show the action to be maintainable. Pray consider, 0 <lb/>
            Athenians, what is admitted by these men themselves, and <lb/>
            what is disputed: that will be the best way to try the ques­ <lb/>
            tion. They admit that they borrowed the money and that <lb/>
            they secured the loan by an agreement; but they say that <lb/>
            they paid the gold to Lampis, the servant of Dion, in Bospo­ <lb/>
            rus. We shall show, not only that he never paid, but that it <lb/>
            was not even lawful for him to pay.2 It is necessary to ex­ <lb/>
            plain to you a few things that happened at the outset.</p>
          <p>I, men of Athens, lent to Phormio the defendant twenty <lb/>
            minas upon a voyage to Pontus and back, on the security of <lb/>
            the single cargo,3 and I deposited an agreement with Cittus <note type="footnote"> 1 Literally not to accuse the plaintiff”—because by the practice, <lb/>
            when the defendant raised an objection by plea to the admissibility of <lb/>
            the action, or pleaded (as we might say) to the jurisdiction, he became <lb/>
            a sort of plaintiff or actor. </note><note type="footnote"> See Vol. III. Appendix ix. page 378. </note><note type="footnote"> The reader will perceive how difficult, and often impossible, it is to <lb/>
            convert the legal expressions into our own language. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This they do not show, but seem to admit the contrary. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 If the text be correct, I think that Seager has indicated the true <lb/>
            explanation. The transaction between Chrysippus and Phormio was <lb/>
            this: the loan with interest was to be repaid at Athens if the ship re­ <lb/>
            turned safe, and the goods purchased by Phormio in the foreign port <lb/>
            and brought home to Athens were to be delivered to Chrysippus as <lb/>
            security until payment. The goods taken out by Phormio were not <lb/>
            (strictly speaking) a security, because neither Chrysippus at Athens nor <lb/>
            his agent in the foreign port was to exorcise any control over them, so </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="173"/>
            the banker. The agreement requiring that he should lade <lb/>
            the ship with a cargo of the value of four thousand drachms, <lb/>
            he does a most scandalous thing; he immediately borrows <lb/>
            fresh sums in the Piræus unknown to us, four thousand five <lb/>
            hundred drachms from Theodorus the Phoenician, and a <lb/>
            thousand from the shipowner Lampis. And when he ought <lb/>
            to have purchased at Athens a cargo worth a hundred and <lb/>
            fifteen minas, if he meant to perform to all his creditors the <lb/>
            covenants contained in their agreements, he purchased only a <lb/>
            cargo of five thousand five hundred drachms, including the <lb/>
            victualling; his debts being seventy-five minas. Such was <lb/>
            the commencement of his fraud, men of Athens; he neither <lb/>
            furnished the security, nor put a cargo on board to the amount <lb/>
            of the loan, although the agreement positively required him <lb/>
            to do so. Here, take the agreement:</p>

            <title type="sub">[The Agreement.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p><note type="footnote"> as to prevent Phormio from disposing of them as he pleased, although <lb/>
            the agent was directed by Chrysippus to keep an eye upon them and to <lb/>
            watch Phormio's proceedings. Therefore the money is said to have <lb/>
            been lent on the security of the return cargo only. It is true that the <lb/>
            outward cargo, if duly shipped, was in one sense a security to Chrysip­ <lb/>
            pus, as it showed that his money'a worth was on board, and it enabled <lb/>
            Phormio to purchase the goods to be hypothecated under the agree­ <lb/>
            ment. But it was not a security in the strict sense of the words in the <lb/>
            present clause. </note><note type="footnote"> Schäfer objects that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐτέρα</foreign> cannot be used in this sense without the <lb/>

          <p>When he arrived at Bosporus, having letters from me, <lb/>
            which I gave him to deliver to my servant, who was passing <lb/>

            When therefore the shipowner required him according to the <lb/>

            man who now says he has paid the debt replied, that he could <lb/>
            not ship my goods, because his stuff1 was unsaleable; and <lb/>

          <p>After this, men of Athens, the defendant was left in <lb/>
            Bosporus; Lampis put to sea, and was shipwrecked not far <lb/>
            from the port; for after his ship had already been overloaded, <lb/>
            as I am informed, be took upon the deck a thousand hides, <lb/>
            which in fact caused the loss of the vessel. He himself was <lb/>
            saved in the boat with the other servants of Dion; but he <lb/>
            lost more than three hundred lives,2 besides the cargo. There <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">δῶπος</foreign> is described as " omne genus mercis vilioris," and Reiske's <lb/>

            shipwreck, upon my going and asking him about these <lb/>
            matters, said that Phormio did not ship any goods according <lb/>
            to our agreement, and that he had not received the cash from <lb/>
            Phormio in Bosporus. Read me the deposition of the persons <lb/>

          <p>When the defendant Phormio had returned to Athens, (he <lb/>
            arrived in another ship,) men of the jury, I went to him and <lb/>
            demanded payment of the loan. And at first, men of Athens, <lb/>
            he never made the statement which he now makes, but always <lb/>
            promised to pay: but, after he had been talking with these <lb/>
            people who are now backing and supporting him, he was no <lb/>
            longer the same person, but quite different. When I per­ <lb/>
            ceived that he was endeavouring to cheat me, I went to <lb/>
            Lampis and told him, that Phormio was not doing the right <lb/>
            thing, and not intending to pay his debt; at the same time <lb/>
            I asked him if he knew where Phormio was, that I might <lb/>
            give him a summons. He desired me to follow him, and we <lb/>
            find the defendant by the perfumers' shops; and I, having <lb/>
            witnesses with me, summoned him: and Lampis, men of <note type="footnote"> as close as at present, would feel the weight of a thousand hides. The <lb/>
            loss of the ship is rather to be accounted for by the top-hamper which <lb/>
            a thousand hides being stowed on deck in addition to the cargo would <lb/>
            occasion,-for even now vessels are frequently placed in jeopardy, and <lb/>
            many have been lost, from what is termed the deck load. In this case <lb/>
            the hamper would not arise so much from the weight as the bulk of <lb/>

            Athens, was close by when he was summoned, and never ven­ <lb/>
            tured to say that he had received the cash from the defendant <lb/>
            -never said, as one might have expected-,, Chrysippus, <lb/>
            you're mad! what are you summoning this man for ? he has <lb/>
            paid me the money." And not only did Lampis never open <lb/>
            his lips; but the defendant himself did not think proper to <lb/>
            say a word, though Lampis was present, to whom he now <lb/>
            declares he has paid the money. Surely, men of Athens, it <lb/>
            was natural for him to say—“ What are you summoning me <lb/>
            for, man I have paid the money to this person who is <lb/>
            standing here -and at the same time to call on Lampis to <lb/>
            vouch for him. However, neither of them uttered a syllable <lb/>
            on that occasion. To prove the truth of my statements, take <lb/>
            the deposition of the persons who witnessed the summons :</p>

            <title type="sub">[The Deposition.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Now take the plaint in the action which I commenced <lb/>
            against him last year. It is one of the strongest proofs that <lb/>
            up to that time Phormio never said he had paid the money <lb/>
            to Lampis :</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Plaint.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>This action I commenced, men of Athens, upon no other <lb/>
            ground than the report of Lampis, who denied that Phormio <lb/>
            had shipped the goods or paid him the money. Don't sup­ <lb/>
            pose, men of Athens, that I am so senseless, so utterly mad, <lb/>
            as to have drawn such a plaint as this, when Lampis (who <lb/>
            must have disproved my case) admitted that he had received <lb/>
            the money.</p>
          <p>Again, men of Athens-here is another point. These men <lb/>
            themselves put in a special plea last year, and did not venture <lb/>
            to assert in the plea that they had paid the money to Lampis. <lb/>
            Take this special plea:</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Special Plea.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>You hear, men of Athens. It is nowhere averred in the <lb/>
            special plea, that Phormio had paid the cash to Lampis, <lb/>
            although I had carefully inserted in the plaint, which you <lb/>
            heard just now, that he neither shipped the goods nor had <lb/>
            paid the money. What other witness then need you look <lb/>
            for, when you have so strong a piece of evidence from these <lb/>
            men themselves ?</p><pb n="177"/>
            
          <p>When the cause was near coming on for trial, they begged <lb/>
            me to refer it to some one ; and we referred to Theodotus, a <lb/>
            denizen,1 under articles of submission. And Lampis after <lb/>
            that, thinking it would be safe for him to give any evidence <lb/>
            that he pleased before an arbitrator, having divided my <lb/>
            money with the defendant Phormio, stated in evidence the <lb/>
            very contrary of what he had said before. For it is not the <lb/>
            same thing, men of Athens, to give false testimony face to <lb/>
            face with a jury, and to do so before an arbitrator. With a <lb/>
            jury there is severe displeasure and punishment in reserve for <lb/>
            those who bear false witness; but before the arbitrator they <lb/>
            give what testimony they please without risk or shame. Upon <lb/>
            my expressing strong indignation at the audacity of Lampis, <lb/>
            and producing to the arbitrator the same evidence which I <lb/>
            now produce to you, men of Athens, that of the person who <lb/>
            . originally went to him with me, when he said that he had not <lb/>
            received the cash from Phormio, and that Phormio had not <lb/>
            shipped any goods—Lampis, when so overwhelming a case of <lb/>
            perjury and roguery was made out against him, confessed to <lb/>
            the arbitrator that he had made this statement, but said he <lb/>
            was out of his senses when he made it. Please to read this <lb/>
            deposition.</p>

            <title type="sub">[The Deposition.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Theodotus,2 0 Athenians, having heard us several times, <lb/>
            and believing that Lampis gave false testimony, did not dis­ <lb/>
            miss the suit, but referred us to the court of justice; for he <lb/>
            did not like to decide against Phormio the defendant, on <lb/>
            account of his intimacy with him, as we afterwards heard, <lb/>
            and he was afraid to dismiss the suit, lest he should himself <lb/>
            commit perjury.</p>
          <p>Consider now in your own minds, men of the jury, looking <lb/>
            at the facts of the case, what means the defendant was likely <lb/>
            to have to pay the money. He sailed from hence without <note type="footnote"> 1 See Volume III. Appendix iii. page 253. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Here, according to Libanius, commences the address of the second <lb/>

            having shipped the amount of my loan, and having no equi­ <lb/>
            valent security; in fact, he bad obtained further loans upon <lb/>
            the credit of mine. In Bosporus he found no market for his <lb/>
            cargo, and with difficulty got rid of the creditors who bad <lb/>
            lent on the outward voyage. And Chrysippus lent him two <lb/>
            thousand drachms on the voyage out and home, on the terms <lb/>
            that he should receive at Athens two thousand six hundred <lb/>
            drachms; but Phormio says that he paid to Lampis in Bos­ <lb/>
            porus a hundred and twenty Cyzicene staters,1 (pray attend <lb/>
            to this!) having borrowed them at interest on real security. <lb/>
            Now, interest on real security was sixteen and two-thirds per <lb/>
            cent,2 and the Cyzicene stater was equivalent there to twenty- <lb/>
            eight Attic drachms. You should be informed how large a <lb/>
            sum he says he has paid. A hundred and twenty staters <lb/>
            make three thousand three hundred and sixty drachms, and <lb/>
            the sixteen and two-thirds per cent. land-interest upon <lb/>
            thirty-three minas sixty drachms is five hundred and sixty <lb/>
            drachms, and the whole sum is the amount of the two.s <lb/>
            Now, men of the jury, is there or ever will there be a man in <lb/>
            the world, who, instead of two thousand six hundred drachms, <lb/>
            would prefer to pay thirty-three minas sixty drachms, and <lb/>
            interest on his loan, five hundred and sixty drachms, which <lb/>
            sums Phormio says he has paid to Lampis, amounting in the <lb/>
            whole to three thousand nine hundred and twenty drachms ? <lb/>
            -And when he was at liberty to pay the money at Athens, <lb/>
            it having been lent upon the voyage out and home, has he <lb/>
            paid it in Bosporus, augmented by thirteen minas?—And to the <lb/>
            creditors who lent on the voyage out you could scarcely pay <lb/>
            their principal, though they were at sea with you and con­ <lb/>
            tinually pressing you; yet to this man, who was not present, <lb/>
            you not only returned his principal and interest, but paid <lb/>
            also the penalties of the agreement, when you were under no <lb/>

            their agreements gave the right of demanding payment in <lb/>
            Bosporus; yet pretend to have regarded the claims of this <lb/>
            man, who alleges that you defrauded him in the very outset, <lb/>
            by not shipping his money's worth of goods according to your <lb/>
            agreement from Athens! And now that you are come to the <lb/>
            port where the loan was advanced, you do not scruple to <lb/>
            cheat the lender; yet you pretend that you did more than <lb/>
            justice in Bosporus, where you were not likely to be punished ! <lb/>
            And other people who borrow on the voyage out and home, <lb/>
            when they are about to sail from the port, get witnesses to <lb/>
            attend, and bid them take notice that the goods are shipped <lb/>
            at the risk of the lenders; but you rely upon the single tes­ <lb/>
            timony of your accomplice in fraud; you did not have with <lb/>
            you in Bosporus either my servant or my partner, nor did <lb/>
            you deliver to them the letters which I gave you, and which <lb/>
            contained a direction to watch all your proceedings ! Why, <lb/>
            men of Athens, what is a person not capable of doing, who <lb/>
            has received papers and not delivered them in due and <lb/>
            regular course? Or how can you avoid seeing this man's <lb/>
            knavery from his actions? Surely (0 earth and heaven !) it <lb/>
            was his business, when he paid so large a sum, and more than <lb/>
            he owed, to make it notorious on the Exchange, and call <lb/>
            everybody to be present, especially this man's servant and <lb/>
            his partner. For of course you are all aware, that people <lb/>
            borrow with a few witnesses, but, when they pay, they procure <lb/>
            many witnesses to attend, in order that they may appear <lb/>
            to be honest men in discharging their obligations. But when <lb/>
            you, Phormio, were paying both the debt and the double <lb/>
            interest, after having used the money on the single voyage, <lb/>
            and were giving thirteen minas besides, were you not clearly <lb/>
            bound to have many witnesses in attendance? Had you <lb/>
            done so, no merchant would have been regarded with more <lb/>
            admiration than you. As it is, however, instead of procuring <lb/>
            many witnesses to the transaction, you endeavoured to hide <lb/>
            yourself from all the world, as if you were doing something <lb/>
            wrong. Again, had you been making payment to me your <lb/>
            creditor in person, there was no occasion for witnesses, be­ <lb/>
            cause you would have taken up the agreement and got rid <lb/>
            of the obligation ; but when you were paying not to me, <lb/>
            but to another on my behalf, and not at Athens but in <lb/>
            Bosporus, and when your agreement was deposited at Atheus <note type="footnote"> N 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="180"/>
            and with me, and when the person to whom you paid the <lb/>
            gold was mortal and about to navigate such a length of sea, <lb/>
            do you mean to tell us that you brought no witness, neither <lb/>
            slave nor freeman ? Yes, he will say, because the agreement <lb/>
            required me to pay the cash to the shipowner.1 Aye, but <lb/>
            it did not prevent you from getting witnesses to attend, <lb/>
            or from delivering the letters. And these parties drew up <lb/>
            two agreements2 with you in respect of the loan, implying <lb/>
            that they distrusted you to the utmost: yet you assert that <lb/>
            there was no one else present when you gave the gold to <lb/>
            the shipowner, though you knew that there was an agree­ <lb/>
            ment deposited against you at Athens with this man.</p>
          <p>He says, that the agreement requires him to pay the <lb/>
            money if the ship is brought home safe. Yes, for it requires <lb/>
            you also to put the goods which you have purchased on <lb/>
            board, or, in default, to pay a penalty of five thousand <lb/>
            drachms.3 You do not notice this part of the agreement, <lb/>
            but after having violated its terms from the very beginning, <lb/>
            and failed to ship the goods, you raise a question upon one <lb/>
            expression4 in the agreement, though you have by your own <note type="footnote"> 1 Wolf asks with astonishment, how, if this statement be correct, the <lb/>
            money could have been lent on the voyage out and home, and answers <lb/>
            his own question by suggesting that the statements of orators are never <lb/>
            to be depended upon. I transcribe the concluding part of the note <lb/>
            for the reader's amusement:—“ Me sane (verum ut fatear) pœnitet <lb/>
            tantum opera in rhetorum mendaciis convertendis posuisse. Verum <lb/>
            aliquam excusationem habeo vel ignorantiæ vel inopiæ. Nam quod ad <lb/>

            subolescentibus mihi quam minimum cum eis esse negotii cupio." </note><note type="footnote"> The present difficulty is solved by supposing that Phormio had the <lb/>
            option of paying the money to Lampis, if he did not choose to ship <lb/>
            any goods from Bosporus to Athens. See the Argument. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The agreement was made in duplicate, and a copy given to each of <lb/>
            the plaintiffs. </note><note type="footnote"> 3 This (as I understand it) was the penalty to which Phormio was <lb/>
            bound, in case he neither shipped the goods at Bosporus nor paid the <lb/>

            which attached if the money was paid to Lampis. See the Argument. </note><note type="footnote"> 4 The plaintiff supposes Phormio to be setting up that clause in the <lb/>
            agreement which provided that the money should only be payable if <lb/>
            the ship came home; and he replies: " This clause is not to be taken <lb/>

             <pb n="181"/>
            acts rendered it a nullity. For when you say that you did <lb/>
            not ship the goods in Bosporus, but paid the gold to the <lb/>
            shipowner, why do you talk any further about the ship? <lb/>
            for you have not partaken of the risk, as you put nothing <lb/>
            on board. And at first, men of Athens, he had recourse to <lb/>
            this excuse, pretending that he had shipped the goods; but <lb/>
            as the falsehood was likely to be established in many ways, <lb/>
            as well by the entry of the Harbour-masters in Bosporus, <lb/>
            as by the persons who were staying in the port at the same <lb/>
            time, he changes his tack, enters into a conspiracy with <lb/>
            Lampis, and asserts that he has paid him the money, taking <lb/>
            advantage of the circumstance that the agreement required <lb/>
            it, and thinking that we should not easily disprove a trans­ <lb/>
            action which took place between themselves alone. And <lb/>
            Lampis declares, that what he said to me1 before he was cor­ <lb/>
            rupted by the defendant was spoken in. a fit of derangement; <lb/>
            but since he has divided my money, he is no longer deranged, <lb/>
            he says, but remembers everything perfectly.</p>
          <p>If Lampis had shown contempt for me only, men of the <lb/>
            jury, it would not have been at all surprising; but he has <lb/>
            acted far more shamefully to all of you. For when Parisades <lb/>
            had issued a proclamation in Bosporus, that whoever wished <lb/>
            to carry corn to Athens and into the Athenian port might <lb/>
            export the corn free of duty, Lampis, who was staying then <lb/>
            in Bosporus, got the liberty to export corn and the exemp­ <lb/>
            tion from duty in the name of your state, and having laden <lb/>
            a large vessel with corn, carried it to Acanthus and there <lb/>
            disposed of it, employing my money for the purpose in <lb/>
            concert with the defendant. And this he did, men of the <lb/>
            jury, though he was dwelling at Athens, and had a wife and <lb/>
            children here, and though the laws have denounced the <lb/>
            severest penalties against any person dwelling at Athens, <lb/>
            who carries corn to any other place than to the Attic port; <lb/>
            and he did it on an occasion when such of you as dwelt in the <lb/>
            city were having meal measured out to them in the Odeum, <lb/>
            and those who dwelt in Piræus were receiving loaves at an <lb/>

          <p>It is by the aid of this man as his accomplice and witness, <lb/>
            that Phormio thinks proper to defraud us of our money—us, <lb/>

            who in three critical periods of your commonwealth, in which <lb/>

            more than ten thousand medimns of wheat, and measured it <lb/>

            in the Pompeum.2 And last year my brother and I gave a <lb/>

            me the depositions in proof of these statements.</p>

            <title type="sub">[The Depositions.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>If any further inference may be drawn from these facts, it <lb/>
            was not very likely that we should make donations of such <lb/>
            large sums in order to acquire a good name with you, and <lb/>
            should make a false charge against Phormio, in order to throw <lb/>
            away the honourable character which we had established. It <lb/>
            is right therefore that you should give us redress, men of the <lb/>
            jury. I have shown you that the defendant in the beginning <lb/>
            did not ship goods equivalent to the loans which he had ob­ <lb/>
            tained at Athens, and that out of the goods which were sold <lb/>
            at Bosporus he with difficulty satisfied the creditors who lent <lb/>
            on the voyage out. I have further shown that he was neither <lb/>
            well-off, nor so simple-minded as to pay thirty-nine minas <lb/>
            instead of two thousand six hundred drachms. Besides this, <lb/>
            I have shown that, when he says he paid the money to <lb/>
            Lampis, he did not invite either my servant or my partner <lb/>
            (who was in Bosporus) to be present. Again, Lampis himself <note type="footnote"> 1 The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἡμίεκτον</foreign> was the twelfth part of a <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέδιμνος</foreign>, which was nearly <lb/>
            a bushel and a half. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 This was a public building at Athens, in which the sacred utensils <lb/>

             <pb n="183"/>
            is shown to have been a witness for me that he had not <lb/>
            received the money, before he was corrupted by the defen­ <lb/>
            dant. Really, if Phormio could thus prove his case point by <lb/>
            point, I don't know how he could possibly have made a better <lb/>
            defence. As to the action being maintainable, the law itself <lb/>
            bears witness in my favour, when it declares that mercantile <lb/>
            actions shall lie upon contracts made at Athens and to the <lb/>
            Athenian port, and not only those at Athens, but those also <lb/>
            which are made for the purpose of a voyage to Athens. <lb/>
            Please to take the laws.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Laws.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>That the contract has been entered into between me and <lb/>
            Phormio at Athens, even they themselves do not deny; but <lb/>
            they put in a special plea alleging that the action is not <lb/>
            maintainable. To what tribunal could we bring our case, <lb/>
            men of the jury, except to the tribunal of Athens, where we <lb/>
            entered into the contract ? It would be strange indeed that, <lb/>
            if a wrong had been done me in relation only to a voyage <lb/>
            to Athens, I should be able to obtain justice from Phormio <lb/>
            before you, and yet, when the contract has been made on <lb/>
            your exchange, these men should not submit to your jurisdic­ <lb/>
            tion. And, when he referred to the arbitration of Theodotus, <lb/>
            they admitted that my action against them was maintainable; <lb/>
            but now they assert the opposite to what they have them­ <lb/>
            selves before conceded, as if it were proper that they should <lb/>
            be tried before Theodotus the denizen without a special plea, <lb/>
            but, when we enter the court of the Athenian state, the <lb/>
            action is no longer maintainable. I am thinking, what in <lb/>
            the world he would have inserted in his plea, if Theodotus <lb/>
            had dismissed the suit, when, Theodotus having desired us to <lb/>
            go to the court, he says that the action is not maintainable <lb/>
            before you, to whom Theodotus sent the case. I should <lb/>
            indeed be most cruelly treated, if, when the laws declare that <lb/>
            actions upon contracts made at Athens shall be brought <lb/>
            before the Judges, you, who have sworn to decide according <lb/>
            to the laws, should dismiss the suit.</p>
          <p>That I lent the money is proved, you see, both by the <lb/>
            agreement and by the defendant himself; that he has paid <lb/>
            me is testified by no one besides Lampis his accomplice. <lb/>
            And the defendant vouches no one but Lampis to prove the <lb/>
             <pb n="184"/>
            payment; I vouch both Lampis himself and those who heard <lb/>
            him, to prove that he denied having received the money. <lb/>
            Phormio then is at liberty to bring my witnesses to trial, if <lb/>
            he disputes the truth of their testimony; but I have no <lb/>
            means of dealing with his witnesses, who say they know that <lb/>
            Lampis testified to having received the money. If the depo­ <lb/>
            sition of Lampis had been put in the box, these men might <lb/>
            have said perhaps, that I ought to proceed against him for <lb/>
            false testimony; as it is, however, I have not this deposition, <lb/>
            and the defendant thinks fit to secure his own impunity, by <lb/>
            leaving no pledge for the verdict which he urges you to pro­ <lb/>
            nounce. Would it not be absurd, when Phormio himself <lb/>
            confesses to have borrowed and pretends to have paid, that <lb/>
            you should make a nullity of what he himself confesses, and <lb/>
            give effect to what he disputes? and when Lampis, on <lb/>
            whose testimony the defendant relies, after originally deny­ <lb/>
            ing that he had received the money, now gives evidence to <lb/>
            the contrary; that you, who know that he has never received <lb/>
            payment, should not be witnesses to the fact ? and that you <lb/>
            should not accept for proof what he spoke truly, but rather <lb/>
            place reliance upon the false statements which he made after <lb/>
            he was corrupted ? It is far more just, men of Athens, to <lb/>
            draw your conclusions from the statements made in the first <lb/>
            instance, than from those fabricated afterwards. The former <lb/>
            he made not designedly, but under the impulse of truth; the <lb/>
            later are fictions devised for his own advantage.</p>
          <p>Remember, 0 Athenians, that Lampis himself never denied <lb/>
            having said that he had not received the money, but, while <lb/>
            he admitted that he said it, declared that he was not in his <lb/>
            right senses at the time. It would be out of reason that <lb/>
            you should credit that part of his testimony which favours <lb/>
            the cheat, and refuse credence to that which favours the <lb/>
            party cheated. I implore you, men of the jury, not to act <lb/>
            thus. You are the same persons who punished with death, <lb/>
            after his impeachment before the popular assembly, a man <lb/>
            who had obtained fresh loans1 to a large amount upon your <note type="footnote"> I I. e. new loans on the security of property already pledged. This <lb/>
            was considered at Athens to be a fraud upon the prior, as well as the <lb/>
            subsequent lender; for it increased the risk to both. And it was com­ <lb/>
            monly provided against by express stipulation. See the agreement in <lb/>
            the case against Lacritus; and see what Demosthenes says, with </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="185"/>
            exchange and did not provide for his creditors their securities, <lb/>
            although he was a citizen of Athens and the son of a man <lb/>
            who had been a General. For you hold that persons of that <lb/>
            kind not only injure those who chance to deal with them, but <lb/>
            do a public damage to your place of trade; and you hold <lb/>
            thus with justice. For the trading community thrive not <lb/>
            so much by the borrowers as by the lenders of money, and <lb/>
            neither ship nor shipowner nor passenger can put to sea <lb/>
            without the assistance of the lenders. The laws have many <lb/>
            excellent regulations for their protection. It is your duty to <lb/>
            come forward in aid of the laws, and give no encouragement <lb/>
            to roguish people, so that you may derive the utmost advan­ <lb/>
            tage from your trade-market. You will do so, if you protect <lb/>
            the persons who risk their money, and do not suffer them to <lb/>
            be defrauded by such monsters as these.</p>
          <p>I have said all that was in my power to say, and I will <lb/>
            call another of my friends, if you desire it.</p>

            <title type="sub">THE ARGUMENT.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE present case arose out of a written agreement entered into between <lb/>
            Androcles, an Athenian, and Nausicrates, of Carystus in Eubœa, of the <lb/>
            one part; and Artemo and Apollodorus, both of Phaselis in Pamphylia, <lb/>
            and brothers of the defendant Lacritus, of the other part. It was an <lb/>
            agreement of loan on a mercantile adventure, upon the terms fol­ <lb/>
            lowing : .</p>
          <p>Androcles and Nausicrates lend thirty minas to Artemo and Apollo­ <lb/>
            dorus, on condition that they should sail in a certain vessel from <lb/>
            Athens to Mende or Scione (towns in the peninsula of Pallene), and <lb/>
            there purchase three thousand casks of Mendæan wine; from thence <lb/>
            proceed to the Thracian Bosporus, or, if they pleased, along the left <lb/>
            coast of the Euxine as far as the mouth of the Borysthenes (or <lb/>
            Dnieper); and, after selling their cargo of wine, purchase a return- <lb/>
            cargo, to be brought in the same vessel to Athens. The loan was to <lb/>
            be repaid with interest, in case the cargo was brought safe. to <note type="footnote"> reference to a pledge actually deposited, in the speech against Aphobus <lb/>
            (ante, page 100). But the securities given on these maritime adventures <lb/>
            were not like pledges accompanied with possession, or mortgages with <lb/>
            delivery of title-deeds. They afforded but scanty protection against <lb/>
            bad faith and neglect of duty. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="186"/>
            Athens, within twenty days after its arrival, the interest to be <lb/>
            twenty-two and a half per cent. unless they returned from the Euxine <lb/>
            to Hierum in Bithynia after the rise of Arcturus (early in Septem­ <lb/>
            ber), in which case it was to be thirty per cent. No abatement was <lb/>
            to be allowed except for jettison made with the consent of all the <lb/>
            passengers, or for compulsory payments made to enemies. The <lb/>
            return-cargo was to be delivered as security to the lenders, to be <lb/>
            held by them until payment of all that was due; and in default of <lb/>
            payment, they were to be at liberty, both or either of them, not only <lb/>
            to sell the security, but to recover any deficiency by distraining the <lb/>
            other property of the borrowers. If, instead of entering the Euxine <lb/>
            sea, they remained in the Hellespont for ten days after the rise of <lb/>
            the Dog-star, (at the end of July,) and there discharged their cargo, <lb/>
            which they were at liberty to do in any friendly port, it was agreed <lb/>
            that they should pay the lower rate of interest. There was the usual <lb/>
            declaration by the borrowers, that the security which they gave was <lb/>
            not encumbered with any previous hypothecation, and an engage­ <lb/>
            ment that they would not take up any further loan upon it,</p>
          <p>It is stated by Androeles, the speaker, that this agreement was violated <lb/>
            in several ways by the borrowers; that they failed to ship the stipu­ <lb/>
            lated quantity of wine; that they took up a further loan upon the <lb/>
            security given to himself and his partner; that they did not purchase <lb/>
            a sufficient return-cargo; that, instead of entering into the regular <lb/>
            port of Athens, they put into a creek used only by thieves or <lb/>
            smugglers; and, when the creditors demanded their money, they <lb/>
            and their brother Lacritus falsely represented that the vessel had <lb/>
            been wrecked.</p>
          <p>Artemo having died shortly after this, and Lacritus having (as the <lb/>
            plaintiff asserts) inherited his property, and therefore succeeded to <lb/>
            his obligations, Androcles, either on his own behalf or on behalf of <lb/>
            himself and partner, commences an action against Lacritus, as heir <lb/>
            to his brother, to recover what was due to him under the agreement. <lb/>
            This is the principal, but not the only ground, on which the plaintiff <lb/>
            founds his claim against Lacritus; for he alleges also that Lacritus <lb/>
            guaranteed the performance of the agreement by his brothers, and <lb/>
            asserts that he joined in the sealing of it.</p>
          <p>Lacritus puts in a special plea, objecting that there was no contract, or <lb/>
            at least no contract in writing between the plaintiff and himself. <lb/>
            There does not appear to have been any law at Athens, as there is <lb/>
            with us, requiring guarantees to be in writing; but the defendant <lb/>
            relied upon the law concerning mercantile actions, of which an <lb/>
            account has already been given in the argument to the case of Zeno­ <lb/>
            themis. (See ante, p. 150.) Whether the plea would be available in <lb/>
            suck a case as this is very doubtful. One would rather suppose that <lb/>
            the heir or the surety of the contracting party would be liable to the <lb/>
            same sort of action as the deceased or the principal.</p>
          <p>It is observable that the evidence produced by the plaintiff is confined <lb/>
            entirely to the proceedings of Artemo and Apollodorus, the original <lb/>
            parties to the agreement, and not a particle of evidence is offered to <lb/>
            fix Lacritus with liability either as heir or surety. Lacritus has <lb/>
            already spoken; he has admitted that he was his brother. heir, but <lb/>
             <pb n="187"/>
            has denied that he succeeded to any property, that he had any assets <lb/>
            (as we should say). The plaintiff asserts that he actually took pos­ <lb/>
            session of his brother's estate, and administered it, and only pre­ <lb/>
            tended to renounce the inheritance when a demand was made on <lb/>
            him by creditors. But of this important fact, on which, perhaps, <lb/>
            the whole case turned, no proof is offered. The guaranty also rests <lb/>
            upon loose assertion. The speech is altogether rather abusive than are <lb/>
            gumentative. It has been surmised that Demosthenes may have been <lb/>
            severe upon Lacritus because he was an orator and pupil of lacerates. <lb/>
            He is probably the same person whom Plutarch mentions in the Life <lb/>
            of Demosthenes, as having been the instructor of that Archias who <lb/>
            was employed by Antipater to capture the Athenian orators.</p>
          <p>I have taken it for granted that Nausicrates, the joint-creditor men­ <lb/>
            tioned in the agreement, was not a co-plaintiff with Androcles, as it <lb/>
            is nowhere stated that he was so; and I think it by no means clear <lb/>
            that the joint-debtor Apollodorus was sued with Lacritus, notwith­ <lb/>
            standing one passage in the oration which seems to indicate the <lb/>
            contrary. If the reader should think this strange, let him remember <lb/>
            that by the terms of the agreement it appears that the contract <lb/>
            between the parties was joint and several; it was competent for <lb/>
            either or both of the lenders to take legal proceedings against either <lb/>
            or both of the borrowers; and therefore it may be inferred that <lb/>
            either or both of the lenders might sue the surety of the borrowers, <lb/>
            or the heirs of either.</p>
          <p>A full explanation of the agreement will be found in Böckh's Public <lb/>
            Economy of Athens, and a compendium, taken from Böckh, in the <lb/>
            Archaeological Dictionary, title Fenus. Some information illustrative <lb/>
            of the subject will be found in Appendix V.</p>
          <p>From this and the foregoing cases the reader may perceive what risk <lb/>
            was run by the Athenian capitalist who lent his money on maritime <lb/>
            speculations, and how little dependence could be placed on such <lb/>
            persons as Protus, Phormio, Artemo, and Apollodorus, who traded <lb/>
            on borrowed money, with little or no property of their own to fall <lb/>
            back upon.</p>
          <p>THE Phaselites are doing nothing new, men of Athens, but <lb/>
            only what they are in the habit of doing. They are famous <lb/>
            people for borrowing money cn your exchange, but, when <lb/>
            they have got it and drawn up a maritime contract, they <lb/>
            immediately forget both their contract and the laws, and also <lb/>
            that it is their duty to repay what they have had, and con­ <lb/>
            sider that, if they pay their debts, it is like losing something <lb/>
            of their own, and, instead of paying, they invent artifices <lb/>
            and pleadings and excuses, and are the greatest rogues and <lb/>
            rascals in the world. Here is the proof. Out of the multi­ <lb/>
            tude of persons, Greeks and barbarians, who frequent your <lb/>
            exchange, the Phaselites alone have more lawsuits year after <lb/>
            year than all the rest put together. So much for their <lb/>
             <pb n="188"/>
            character. I, men of the jury, having lent money to Artemo, <lb/>
            the defendant's brother, according to the commercial laws, on <lb/>
            an adventure from Athens to Pontus and back, as he died <lb/>
            without having repaid me the money, have brought the <lb/>
            present action, according to those same laws under which I <lb/>
            entered into the contract, against the defendant, as being <lb/>
            brother of Artemo and having possession of all his property, <lb/>
            both what he left here and what he had at Phaselis, and as <lb/>
            being heir to his whole estate; and because the defendant can <lb/>
            show no law which enables him to keep possession of his <lb/>
            brother's property and to have administered it as he pleased, <lb/>
            and yet to refuse payment of what is due to other persons, <lb/>
            and to say now that he is not heir but renounces the inherit­ <lb/>
            ance. Such is the base conduct of Lacritus the defendant. <lb/>
            I entreat you, men of the jury, to give me a fair hearing <lb/>
            upon this matter; and, if I prove that he has wronged us his <lb/>
            creditors and you as well, to give us the redress that we are <lb/>
            entitled to.</p>
          <p>I myself, men of the jury, had not the least knowledge of <lb/>
            these men; but Thrasymedes, the son of Diophantus, the <lb/>
            Sphettian, and Melanopus, his brother, are friends of mine, <lb/>
            and we are as intimate as it is possible to be : they came to <lb/>
            me with Lacritus, the defendant, having become acquainted <lb/>
            with him some way or other (I don't know how), and asked <lb/>
            me to lend a sum of money upon an adventure to Pontus to <lb/>
            Artemo, the defendant's brother, and Apollodorus, so that <lb/>
            they might be profitably employed; Thrasymedes, men of <lb/>
            the jury, knowing nothing of the roguery of these persons, <lb/>

            do all that Lacritus, the defendant, promised and undertook <lb/>
            that they should do. He was completely deceived, and had <lb/>
            no idea with what monsters he was associating: I, by the <lb/>
            persuasion of Thrasymedes and his brother, and, upon an <lb/>
            undertaking being given to me by the defendant Lacritus, <lb/>
            that his brothers would do all that was right, in conjunction <lb/>
            with a certain friend of mine, a Carystian, lent thirty minas <lb/>
            in money. I wish you, men of the jury, first to hear the <lb/>
            agreement, which contains the terms on which we lent the <lb/>
            money, and the witnesses who were present when it was lent; <lb/>

            explained by Captain Smyth :—' The difference in the rising of Arc­ <lb/>

            between the summer and autumnal Etesian winds being precursed by <lb/>
            eight or ten days of squally weather, the prodromi of old, was ascribed <lb/>
            to the direct power of Arcturus, instead of the alternation consequent <lb/>
            upon the solar march. The times of the periodical changes of the <lb/>

            jury, when he wished to get the money from us, he said he <lb/>
            was both the brother and the partner of Artemo, and used <lb/>
            wonderfully persuasive language; but, as soon as they had <lb/>
            got the money into their hands, that they divided, and con­ <lb/>
            verted it to what use they pleased ; but not in any point, <lb/>
            great or small, did they execute the articles of the maritime <lb/>
            contract, under which they obtained the money, as the facts <lb/>
            themselves prove. Lacritus, the defendant, was their adviser <lb/>
            in all their proceedings. I will take the terms of the agree­ <lb/>
            ment, one by one, and show you that they have done nothing <lb/>
            in fulfilment of them.</p>
          <p>First it is written, that they borrowed the thirty minas <lb/>
            from us upon three thousand casks1 of wine, as if they pos­ <lb/>
            sessed security for another thirty minas, so that the price of <lb/>
            the wine would amount to a talent in money, including the <lb/>
            expenses which had to be incurred for the vesselling and <lb/>
            stowage of the wine; 2 and these three thousand casks were <lb/>
            to be conveyed to Pontus in the twenty-oared ship of which <lb/>
            Hyblesius was owner. Such, men of the jury, are the <lb/>
            terms contained in the agreement which you have heard. <lb/>
            These men however, instead of three thousand casks, put <lb/>
            less even than five hundred on board the ship; instead of <lb/>
            having bought the quantity of wine which they were bound <lb/>
            to do, they made what use of the money they pleased; in <lb/>
            fact, they never meant or intended to ship the three thousand <lb/>
            casks according to the agreement. In proof of my state­ <lb/>

          <p>With respect to the quantity of the wine which they were <lb/>

            they began from this, the very first clause in the agreement, <lb/>
            to violate and commit a breach of its terms. The next con­ <lb/>
            dition of the agreement is, " that they pledge these goods <lb/>
            free from incumbrances, and owing nothing upon them to <lb/>
            any one; and that they will not borrow further sums of money <lb/>
            npon them from any one." This is expressly provided, men <lb/>
            of the jury. But what have these persons done ? Disregarding <lb/>
            the terms of the contract, they borrow money from a certain <lb/>
            young man, under a false pretence that they were not indebted <lb/>
            to any one; so that they not only cheated us and borrowed <lb/>
            money upon our security, unknown to us, but they deceived <lb/>
            also that young man who lent them the further sum, leading <lb/>
            him to suppose that the property on which they borrowed his <lb/>
            money was unencumbered. Such are the tricks of these men, <lb/>
            and they are all the clever contrivances of Lacritus the de­ <lb/>

            should not himself have lent the money to Apollodorus."</p>
          <p>Such are the knaveries of these men. It is next written in <lb/>
            the agreement, men of the jury, that, when they have sold in <lb/>
            Pontus the goods which they bring there, they shall purchase <lb/>
            other goods in lieu of them, and ship them as a return cargo, <lb/>
            and bring such cargo to Athens; and, when they have <lb/>
            arrived at Athens, they shall within twenty days pay us the <lb/>
            money in current coin, and that, until they have paid, we <lb/>
            shall hold the goods under our control, and they shall deliver <lb/>
            them to us entire, until we have received all our money. <lb/>
            Such are the terms, clearly so expressed in the agreement. <lb/>
            Here, men of the jury, these persons have most signally dis­ <lb/>
            played their outrageous impudence, and their utter disregard <lb/>
            of the articles contained in the agreement, as if they looked <lb/>
            upon the agreement as mere trash and nonsense. For they <lb/>
            neither purchased any other goods in Pontus, nor shipped <lb/>
            any return cargo to bring to Athens; and we who had lent <lb/>
            the money, when these men had returned themselves from <lb/>
            Pontus, had nothing which we could seize or keep possession <lb/>
            of as security for our dues ; for these men brought nothing <lb/>
            whatever into your harbour. We have suffered the most <lb/>
            unheard-of cruelty, men of the jury. In our own city, with­ <lb/>
            out having done any wrong, without their having recovered <lb/>
            any judgment against us, we have been robbed of our pro­ <lb/>
            perty by these men who are Phaselites, as if reprisals had <lb/>
            been given to Phaselites against Athenians. For, when they <lb/>
            do not choose to pay what they have borrowed, what other <lb/>
            name can one give to such persons than that they commit a <lb/>
            robbery upon other people? For my part, I have never <lb/>
            heard of a more brutal act than what these men have done <lb/>
            to us, even while they acknowledge having received our <lb/>
            money. Those contracts which are disputed require a judicial <lb/>
            decision, men of the jury; but those which are admitted by <lb/>
            both the contracting parties, and concerning which there are <lb/>
            subsisting nautical agreements, are considered by all to be <lb/>
            binding, and it is the duty of parties to abide by what is <lb/>
            written. That they have performed not a single article of the <lb/>
            agreement, that from the very first beginning they meditated <lb/>

            fraud and intended to evade their obligations, is thus clearly <lb/>
            proved against them both by witnesses and by themselves.</p>
          <p>The most scandalous thing which the defendant Lacritus <lb/>
            has done I must now tell you; for it was Lacritus who <lb/>
            managed the whole thing. When they arrived here, they do <lb/>
            not land in your port, but put into Thieves' Harbour, which <lb/>
            is without the limits of your commercial port; and to put <lb/>
            into Thieves' Harbour is the same as if one was to land at <lb/>
            Ægina or Megara; for a man may sail away from that <lb/>
            harbour where he likes and at what moment he pleases. <lb/>
            And the vessel lay at anchor there more than five-and-twenty <lb/>
            days, and these men continued to walk about on our ex­ <lb/>
            change, and we went up and talked with them, and we <lb/>
            requested them to provide for settling with us as soon as <lb/>
            possible. They promised to do so, and said they were taking <lb/>
            measures for that very purpose. While we thus addressed <lb/>
            ourselves to them, we watched to see whether they unladed <lb/>
            anything from the ship or paid any customs duty. When <lb/>
            they had been several days in the city, and we found that <lb/>
            they had not unshipped any goods, and that no duty had <lb/>
            been paid in their name, we then became more urgent in our <lb/>
            demand of payment; and at length, as we became very <lb/>
            troublesome, the defendant Lacritus, the brother of Artemo, <lb/>
            replied that they were unable to pay, for all their goods were <lb/>
            lost; and Lacritus said that he could assign good ground of <lb/>
            excuse. We, men of the jury, expressed indignation at this <lb/>
            statement, but it did us no good to be indignant; for these <lb/>
            men gave themselves no trouble about it: however, we asked <lb/>
            them in what manner the goods had been lost. The defen­ <lb/>
            dant Lacritus said, that the vessel had been wrecked in <lb/>
            coasting from Panticapæum to Theudosia, and that, the vessel <lb/>
            being wrecked, the goods of his brothers which were on board <lb/>
            were lost; there was on board some salt fish and Coan wine, <lb/>
            and some other things ; this they said was the return cargo, <lb/>
            and they intended to bring it to Athens, had it not been lost <lb/>
            in the vessel. Such was their statement. It is worth your <lb/>
            while to learn the wickedness and the mendacity of those <lb/>
            men. They had no contract in reference to the vessel which <lb/>
            was wrecked,1 but it was another person who had lent from <note type="footnote"> 1 Because their engagement depended not on the safety of the ship, <lb/>

            and the Coan wine was eighty jars of wine that had turned <lb/>
            sour, and the salt fish carried in the vessel from Panticapæum <lb/>
            to Theudosia was consigned to a certain farmer for a supply <lb/>
            of his farming labourers. Why then do they allege these <lb/>

          <p>Please to take the depositions; first that of Apollonides, <lb/>
            showing that it was Antipater who lent upon the vessel, and <lb/>
            that these men had no concern whatever in the shipwreck; <lb/>
            then that of Erasicles and that of Hippias, to show that only <lb/>
            eighty casks of wine were carried in the vessel.</p>

          <p>“ Apollonides of Halicamassus' deposes, that he knows <lb/>
            that Antipater, a Citian by birth, lent money to Hyblesius, <lb/>
            to Pontus, on the ship of which Hyblesius was the owner, and <lb/>
            on the freight to Pontus; and that he was partner in the <lb/>
            ship with Hyblesius, and that his own servants were fellow- <lb/>
            passengers in the ship, and that, when the ship was lost, his <lb/>
            servants were present, and they reported it to him, and <lb/>
            reported also that the ship was lost empty, as it was coasting <lb/>
            to Theudosia from Panticapæum.”</p>
          <p>" Erasicles deposes, that he sailed with Hyblesius as pilot <lb/>
            of the ship to Pontus, and, when the ship was coasting to <lb/>
            Theudosia from Panticapæum, he knows that the ship was <lb/>
            empty, and that Apollodorus, the person who is now defen­ <lb/>
            dant in the suit,2 had no wine in the vessel, but that there <note type="footnote"> Schäfer supposes that only one ship is spoken of, the ship, namely, of <lb/>
            Hyblesius; which, after being wrecked on its passage to Theudosia, <lb/>
            was repaired, and brought the Phaselite merchants home. The word <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">διεφθάρη</foreign> in the deposition is a little against his hypothesis. However <lb/>

            to maintain. This is the only passage where there is any distinct <lb/>

            person of Theudosia."</p>
          <p>" Hippias, son of Athenippus, of Halicarnassus, deposes, <lb/>
            that he sailed with Hyblesius as supercargo of the ship, and, <lb/>
            when the ship was coasting to Theudosia from Panticapæum, <lb/>
            Apollodorus put on board one or two vessels of wool, and <lb/>
            eleven or twelve casks of salt fish, and some goat-skins, two <lb/>
            or three bundles, and nothing else."</p>
          <p>" In addition to these witnesses, Euphiletus, son of Damoti­ <lb/>
            mus, of Aphidna, Hippias, son of Timoxenus, of Thymæ­ <lb/>
            tadæ, Sostratus, son of Philip, of Histiæa, Archenomides, son <lb/>
            of Strato, of Thria, Philtiades, son of Ctesicles, of Xypete, <lb/>
            have given absent testimony."</p>
          <p>Such is the impudence of these men. I beg you, men of <lb/>
            the jury, to think in your minds, whether you ever knew or <lb/>
            heard of any people importing wine from Pontus to Athens, <lb/>
            and especially Coan wine. Surely it's just the reverse : wine <lb/>
            is carried to Pontus from the places about us, from Pepare­ <lb/>
            thus and Cos and Thasus and Mende, and from a variety of <lb/>
            other countries ; and quite different things are imported here <lb/>
            from Pontus.</p>
          <p>I still pressed them, and asked if any of the effects in <lb/>
            Pontus were saved. Lacritus the defendant replied, that a <lb/>
            hundred Cyzicene staters were saved, and that his brother <lb/>
            had lent the gold in Pontus to a certain ship-owner of <lb/>
            Phaselis, a fellow-countryman and friend of his own, and was <lb/>
            not able to recover it, in fact, that this also might be con. <lb/>
            sidered as lost. These statements were made by Lacritus <lb/>
            the defendant: but the agreement, men of the jury, says <lb/>
            something different; it requires these men to ship a return <lb/>
            cargo and bring it to Athens; not to lend our property <lb/>
            without our consent to whom they please in Pontus, but to <lb/>
            deliver it entire to us at Athens, till we have received back <lb/>
            the whole sum that we lent. Please to read the agreement <lb/>
            again.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The agreement is read again by the officer of the court.]</title>

          <p><note type="footnote"> rather inclined to suspect that instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτοῦ</foreign> we should read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀδελφοῦ</foreign>. <lb/>
            We know that by the terms of the agreement the plaintiff already <lb/>
            possessed power to seize the property of Apollodorus; and there could <lb/>
            have been no great advantage in bringing an action against him except, <lb/>
            perhaps, for the purpose of holding him to bail. </note> <pb n="198"/>
            </p>
          <p>Does the agreement, men of the jury, require these men <lb/>
            to lend our property, and lend it to a man whom we don't <lb/>
            know and have never seen, or does it require them to ship a <lb/>
            return cargo and bring it to Athens, and produce it to us, <lb/>
            and deliver it to us entire ? The agreement declares that <lb/>
            nothing shall have more force than the terms contained in it, <lb/>
            and that neither law nor decree nor anything else shall be <lb/>
            admitted to supersede the agreement; yet these men, from <lb/>
            the very beginning, never troubled themselves about the <lb/>
            agreement, but made use of our money as if it had been their <lb/>
            own ; such mischievous sophists are they and dishonest men. <lb/>
            For my own part, I swear by Jupiter the king and all the <lb/>
            Gods,1 I never had a grudge and never uttered a reproach <lb/>
            against any one, men of the jury, because he wished to be a <lb/>
            sophist and pay money to Isocrates; I should be mad, if <lb/>
            anything of the sort gave me concern. At the same time I <lb/>
            don't think that men who have an overweening opinion of <lb/>
            their own cleverness ought to covet the property of other <lb/>
            people, or seek to plunder them, relying upon their eloquence ; <lb/>
            that is the part of a good-for-nothing sophist, who should be <lb/>
            made to smart for it. Lacritus, the defendant, men of the <lb/>
            jury, has not come into court relying on the justice of his <lb/>
            case, but knowing perfectly well what has been done by <lb/>
            himself and his brothers in the matter of this loan, and, <lb/>
            considering that he is clever at speaking and can easily pro­ <lb/>
            vide arguments for a bad cause, he imagines he can mislead <lb/>
            you as he pleases. This is the talent which he professes, and <lb/>
            he asks money and collects pupils, engaging to instruct them <lb/>
            in these very things. And he has begun by instructing his <lb/>
            own brothers in an art, which you, men of the jury, feel to <lb/>
            be wicked and dishonest-the art of borrowing money on the <lb/>
            exchange upon a maritime adventure, and cheating the credi­ <lb/>
            tors instead of paying them. Can any men be baser than <lb/>
            either the teacher or the learners of such an art as this? <lb/>
            However, since he is so clever, and relies upon his power of <lb/>
            speaking and upon the thousand drachms which he has given <lb/>
            to his preceptor, bid him show you either that they never <lb/>
            obtained the money from us, or that they have paid what <lb/>
            they borrowed, or that maritime agreements ought not to be <note type="footnote"> 1 This oath was probably one which the speaker was in the habit of <lb/>
            using, as Libanius remarks. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="199"/>
            binding, or that people ought to employ the money for some <lb/>
            other purpose than that for which they obtained it under the <lb/>
            agreement. Let him convince you of the truth of any of <lb/>
            these propositions. And if he can so convince you, who are <lb/>
            sitting in judgment upon commercial contracts, I concede <lb/>
            that he is preeminently clever. But I am quite sure that he <lb/>
            will not be able to satisfy or convince you upon any of these <lb/>
            points. But, apart from these considerations-suppose, by <lb/>
            heavens, men of the jury, that the reverse had happened, <lb/>
            and that it was not this man's deceased brother who owed me <lb/>
            the money, but I who owed the brother a talent, or eighty <lb/>
            minas, or more or less; do you think, men of the jury, that <lb/>
            Lacritus the defendant would use the same language which <lb/>
            he has now been dinning in our ears,1 or would say that he <lb/>
            is not heir, and renounce his brother's inheritance, and would <lb/>
            not exact the debt from me with the utmost severity, as he <lb/>
            has exacted from other persons what was owing to the <lb/>
            deceased either in Phaselis or in other places ? And if any <lb/>
            one of us, being sued by the defendant, bad dared to plead a <lb/>
            special plea suggesting that the action was not maintainable, <lb/>
            I am sure he would have been indignant and complained <lb/>
            bitterly to you, and called it scandalous and unlawful usage <lb/>
            of him, if any one voted that his action, being a mercantile <lb/>
            one, was not maintainable. Then, Lacritus, if you consider <lb/>
            this just for yourself, why should it not be just for me ? Are <lb/>
            not the same laws enacted for all ? Have not all the same <lb/>
            rights in regard to mercantile actions ? Is there any one so <lb/>
            odious, so surpassing all mankind in baseness, as to advise <lb/>
            you to decide that this mercantile action does not lie, when <lb/>
            you are sitting now in judgment upon mercantile causes ?</p>
          <p>What do you require, Lacritus ? Are you not content that <lb/>
            we are deprived of the money which we lent you, but would <lb/>
            you have us also consigned to prison for non-payment of the <lb/>
            penalty adjudged against us 12 Would it not be atrocious <lb/>
            and cruel and disgraceful to you, men of the jury, if people <lb/>
            who have lent money on a maritime adventure in your port, <lb/>
            and who are defrauded of it, should be carried to prison by <lb/>
            the fraudulent debtors? Is it this, Lacritus, which you <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατ ακέχρηται</foreign>. Pabst :-" die er jetzt missbrauchsweise führt." <lb/>
            Auger:—"dont il abuse." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπωβελἱα</foreign>. </note> <lb/>

            would persuade the jury to sanction? Where are we to <lb/>
            obtain justice, men of the jury, for commercial contracts ? <lb/>
            Before what magistrate, or at what time ? Before the Eleven ? <lb/>
            They bring into court housebreakers and thieves, and other <lb/>
            malefactors who are charged with capital crimes. Before the <lb/>
            Archon ? But the Archon is enjoined to take charge of <lb/>
            heiresses and orphans and parents. Perhaps before the King- <lb/>
            archon ? But we are not gymnasiarchs, nor are we indicting <lb/>
            any one for impiety. Or perhaps the Polemarch will bring <lb/>
            us into court. Yes, for neglect of a patron, or residence with­ <lb/>
            out a patron. There remain the Generals. But they intro­ <lb/>
            duce and bring to trial the cases of the trierarchs ;they <lb/>
            bring no mercantile cause into court. I am a merchant, and <lb/>
            you are the brother and heir of a merchant, who has obtained <lb/>
            from me a mercantile loan. Before what tribunal then am I <lb/>
            to take this action ? Show me, Lacritus; but show it con­ <lb/>
            formably to law and justice. That you can't do. No man <lb/>
            I don't care how clever he is) can say anything just upon a . <lb/>
            case like yours.</p>
          <p>These are not the only wrongs, men of the jury, which <lb/>
            I have suffered from the defendant Lacritus. Besides being <lb/>
            deprived of my money, he would have brought me (as far as <lb/>
            it lay in his power) into the utmost peril, had not the agree­ <lb/>
            ment with these men done me good service, testifying that I <lb/>
            lent the money to Pontus and back to Athens. For of <lb/>
            course you are aware, men of the jury, how severe the law is, <lb/>
            if any Athenian carry corn to any other place than Athens, <lb/>
            or lend money to any other port than that of Athens. You <lb/>
            know what penalties there are for such offences, and how <lb/>
            heavy and stringent they are. However, read them the law, <lb/>
            that they may have more certain information.</p>

          <p>The law, men of the jury, is thus severe. Yet these <lb/>
            rascally fellows, though it is expressly mentioned in the <lb/>
            agreement that the money's worth shall come back to Athens, <lb/>
            allowed the money which they borrowed from us at Athens <lb/>
            to be carried to Chios. For when the shipowner of Phaselis <lb/>
            wanted to borrow other money in Pontus from a certain <lb/>
            Chian, and the Chian said he would not lend it, unless he <lb/>
            received as security all that the shipowner had with him on ' <lb/>
            board, and unless the previous lenders gave their assent, they <lb/>
            allowed that which belonged to us to be given in pledge to <lb/>
            the Chian, and put the whole of it at his disposal; then they <lb/>
            sailed away from Pontus with the shipowner of Phaselis and <lb/>
            the Chian creditor, and put into Thieves' Harbour, and never <lb/>
            anchored their vessel in your port. And now, men of the <lb/>
            jury, money which was lent from Athens to Pontus, and back <lb/>
            from Pontus to Athens, has been carried to Chios by these <lb/>
            men. It comes therefore to what I started with in the <lb/>
            beginning-you are injured fully as much as we who ad­ <lb/>
            vanced the money. Only consider, men of the jury. Is it <lb/>
            not plain that you are injured, when a man endeavours to <lb/>
            place himself above your laws, and invalidates and annuls <lb/>
            nautical agreements, and has sent off money lent in our port <lb/>
            to Chios ? Is it not plain that such a person injures you as <lb/>
            well as us ?</p>
          <p>I, men of the jury, address myself to these persons only; <lb/>
            for to them I advanced my money. They will have to deal <lb/>
            with that shipowner of Phaselis, their own countryman, to <lb/>
            whom they say they lent the money without our consent and <note type="footnote"> that this cannot be, for Reiske forgets that this was not spoken by the <lb/>
            party, but read by the clerk. But in this Schäfer forgets, that what <lb/>
            the clerk read was not from any authenticated copy, but from extracts <lb/>
            which had been taken and put into the echiuus by the party; and so, if <lb/>
            Androcles or Demosthenes had copied the law in this compendious <lb/>
            form, the clerk would of course read it accordingly." </note><note type="footnote"> Pabst is not satisfied either with Reiske's view or with Schäfer's, but <lb/>
            thinks the passage corrupt. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="202"/>
            contrary to the agreement; we know nothing of their trans­ <lb/>
            actions with their countryman; that is a matter within their <lb/>
            own knowledge. Such we consider to be a just view of the <lb/>
            case; and we entreat you, men of the jury, to give redress to <lb/>
            us who are the injured parties, and to punish people who <lb/>
            resort to trickery and sophistry, as these men do. If you <lb/>
            take this course, your decision will be in accordance with <lb/>
            your own interests, and you will deprive the swindlers of <lb/>
            those artifices by which some of them contrive to evade <lb/>
            nautical contracts.</p>

            <title type="sub">THE ARGUMENT.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>PHORMIO, on whose behalf the present speech was composed, is (as the <lb/>
            readers will easily discern) a different person from the defendant in <lb/>
            the action by Chrysippus. The defendant in the present action was <lb/>
            at an early period a slave of Pasion the banker, whose business for a <lb/>
            long time he managed, and from whom as a reward for his good <lb/>
            conduct he received his freedom.</p>
          <p>Pasion died leaving a widow, Archippe, and two sons, Apollodorus and <lb/>
            Pasicles, the younger of whom was a minor. He left a will, by <lb/>
            which he directed that Phormio should marry his widow and receive <lb/>
            with her a certain marriage portion; and he appointed him one of <lb/>
            the guardians of his younger son, Pasicles. The bulk of his property <lb/>
            was inherited by his two sons; between whom, soon after their <lb/>
            father's death, a division was made by the guardians of all the inherit­ <lb/>
            ance, except the bank and a shield-manufactory, of which Pasion in <lb/>
            his lifetime had granted a lease to Phormio, and the rents of which <lb/>
            he continued to pay to the children until Pasicles came of age. At <lb/>
            that time they came to a settlement; Phormio was discharged from <lb/>
            the lease; and the brothers divided the two properties, Apollodorus <lb/>
            taking the shield-manufactory, and Pasicles the bank. Upon the <lb/>
            death of Archippe, Apollodorus made certain claims upon Phormio <lb/>
            for property alleged to be in his possession; their dispute was referred <lb/>
            to private arbitrators, under whose advice a compromise was agreed <lb/>
            to, and Apollodorus gave to Phormio a release of all demands. A <lb/>
            long time after this, and more than eighteen years after Pasion'a <lb/>
            death, Apollodorus preferred the claim, which is the subject of the <lb/>
            present action, against Phormio, for a sum of banking stock, alleged <lb/>
            to have been left by Pasion in the bank, and to have been fraudu­ <lb/>
            lently appropriated by Phormio to his own use. Phormio indignantly <lb/>
            denies the charge, asserting that Pasion possessed no banking stock, <lb/>
            but, on the contrary, owed eleven talents to the bank when he took <lb/>
            a lease of it. He contends that the charge was trumped up by <lb/>
             <pb n="203"/>
            Apollodorus in order to extort money, he having brought himself <lb/>
            into difficulties by litigation and extravagance.</p>
          <p>Such is the case for the defence, stated to the jury by the friend who <lb/>
            speaks on Phormio's behalf. Besides this answer on the merits, he <lb/>
            pleads two pleas in bar of the action ; first, a release of all demands <lb/>
            by the plaintiff; secondly, the statute of limitations.</p>
          <p>The result of the trial we learn from the speech against Stephanua, <lb/>
            (page 1103,) where it is stated, that the speech for the defence made <lb/>
            such an impression on the jury, that they would not hear a word <lb/>
            that Apollodorus had to say, and the verdict passed against him by <lb/>
            so large a majority, that he had to pay the Epobelia, or a sixth of <lb/>
            the damages.</p>
          <p>This speech, instructive and important as it is on other accounts, <lb/>
            acquires an additional interest from the charge, to which it has given <lb/>
            rise, against the character of the orator; who here attacks and <lb/>
            bitterly inveighs against the character of a man, whom he had sup­ <lb/>
            ported by his counsel and advocacy for a long series of years, and <lb/>
            whom he again assisted in the suit against Stephanus, which arose <lb/>
            out of this very proceeding. For Apollodorus our orator had <lb/>
            composed the speeches against Timotheus, Callippus, Nicostratus, <lb/>
            Polycles; that for the Naval crown, and several others. These <lb/>
            indeed were in no way connected with the present case ; and, unless <lb/>
            Apollodorus was the personal friend of Demosthenes, he could hardly <lb/>
            be censured for having undertaken the cause of a new client who <lb/>
            was opposed to him. The case of Stephanus however stands on a <lb/>
            different footing. Stephanus gave evidence for Phormio to establish <lb/>
            Pasion's will, which was disputed. Apollodorus sued him for false <lb/>
            testimony, and Demosthenes composed in his defence the two extant <lb/>
            speeches against Stephanus, in which he contends that the will which <lb/>
            Phormio produced at the trial was a forgery, and gives a totally <lb/>
            different complexion to the family history of Apollodorus, and the <lb/>
            proceedings therewith connected, from that which is given in the <lb/>
            present speech. It is by this act that Demosthenes has laid himself <lb/>
            open to censure.</p>
          <p>We may regard as mere calumny the unsupported assertion of <lb/>
            Machines, that Demosthenes betrayed his client's secrets to the <lb/>
            adversary. Plutarch simply observes, that Demosthenes damaged <lb/>
            his reputation by writing speeches for both sides, which, he says, <lb/>
            was like supplying two adversaries with weapons from the same <lb/>
            workshop. Reiske, Auger, and many other modern critics have <lb/>
            expressed similar opinions. The suggestion of Albert Gerhard <lb/>
            Becker, that the speech for Phormio may have been wrongly <lb/>
            ascribed to Demosthenes, is opposed to the current of authority. <lb/>
            Ranke conceives, that, as some time must have elapsed between the <lb/>
            first trial and the proceeding against Stephanus, the orator may in <lb/>
            the meantime have found reason to change his opinion, and gone <lb/>
            over to Apollodorus because he thought the merits of the case were <lb/>
            on his side. This would hardly justify him according to our English <lb/>
            notions ; for we hold that it is not the province of the advocate to <lb/>
            set himself up as a judge between the contending parties, much less <lb/>
            to desert from one to the other upon any such ground. Pabst <lb/>
             <pb n="204"/>
            adopts a view, to which Thirlwall also inclines; that the double- <lb/>
            dealing of Demosthenes in relation to Apollodorus and his opponent <lb/>
            is not to be ascribed to any professional love of gain, but that he <lb/>
            was tempted to take up the different sides of a question as a rhetori­ <lb/>
            cal exercise, and felt less scruple to do so in the case of persons like <lb/>
            Apollodorus and Phormio, who were citizens of late creation. It is <lb/>
            very possible that we are not in possession of the circumstances <lb/>
            which might tend to justify or excuse the course taken by the orator. <lb/>
            An English counsel would consider himself at liberty to accept an <lb/>
            engagement against his former client, even in a case arising out of <lb/>
            one in which he had been his advocate, if the client had not thought <lb/>
            proper to secure his services by retaining him beforehand. It seems <lb/>
            not unreasonable to apply a similar rule of right to the practice of <lb/>
            an Athenian speech-writer. Apollodorus, in commencing his action <lb/>
            against Phormio, may in the first instance have thought it un­ <lb/>
            necessary to employ Demosthenes; yet afterwards may have repented <lb/>
            of not having done so. Phormio may in the subsequent proceeding <lb/>
            have been guilty of similar neglect, and thus given the advantage to <lb/>
            his opponent. Demosthenes of course knew the weak points of <lb/>
            Phormio's case, and, being engaged on the other side, did not hesitate <lb/>
            to expose them. He may, as I have intimated, have been justified <lb/>
            in doing so by an understood course of practice, or possibly by some <lb/>
            peculiar circumstances unknown to us. The reader should by all <lb/>
            means compare the present speech with those against Stephanus. <lb/>
            The date of this speech is said to have been B.c. 350.</p>
          <p>PHORMIO'S inexperience in speaking and utter incapacity you <lb/>
            see yourselves, men of Athens. It is necessary for us his <lb/>
            friends to state and explain to you those particulars, which, <lb/>
            from having heard him so often relate them, have become <lb/>
            known to us; that, when we have rightly informed and put <lb/>
            you in possession of. the case, you may give a just and con­ <lb/>
            scientious verdict. We have put in the special plea to the <lb/>
            action, not for the sake of evasion and delay, but in order <lb/>
            that, if the defendant can show by the facts that he has com­ <lb/>
            mitted no wrong, he may obtain in this court a final acquittal. <lb/>
            What with other people settles and determines disputes with­ <lb/>
            out a trial by jury, Phormio the defendant has done ; he has <lb/>
            conferred many benefits on the plaintiff Apollodorus, he has <lb/>
            honestly paid and delivered up everything belonging to the <lb/>
            plaintiff which was left under his control, and has since that <lb/>
            been released from all demands; yet, as you see, because he <lb/>
            is not able to endure this man's treatment,1 he has com- <note type="footnote"> I i.e. because Phormio cannot submit to the vexatious and extor­ <lb/>
            donate demands of Apollodorus. Pabst. "Da dieser sich seine Zudring. <lb/>
            lichkeiten nicht mehr gefallen lassen konnte." </note> <lb/>

            menced against him this vexatious action for twenty talents. <lb/>
            I will begin at the beginning, and endeavour to explain to <lb/>
            you in as short a compass as possible all the transactions <lb/>
            which the defendant has had with Pasion and Apollodorus. <lb/>
            From this, I am sure, you will clearly see the vexatious con­ <lb/>
            duct of the plaintiff, and from the same statement you will <lb/>
            learn that the action is not maintainable.</p>
          <p>First he shall read you the articles of agreement, according <lb/>
            to which Pasion let the bank and the shield-manufactory to <lb/>
            the defendant. Please to take the articles of the agreement <lb/>
            and the challenge and these depositions.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Articles of Agreement, the Challenge, the Depositions.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>These, men of Athens, are the articles, according to which <lb/>
            Pasion let the bank and the shield-manufactory to the defen­ <lb/>
            dant, when he had become his own master. You must hear <lb/>
            and understand, in what way Pasion came to owe the eleven <lb/>
            talents to the bank. He owed that sum not on account of <lb/>
            poverty, but on account of his industry in business. For the <lb/>
            landed property of Pasion was about twenty talents, and, in <lb/>
            addition to that, he had money of his own lent at interest, <lb/>
            amounting to more than fifty talents. With these fifty talents <lb/>
            there were eleven talents from the deposits of the bank pro­ <lb/>
            fitably invested. When Phormio therefore became lessee of <lb/>
            the bank business, and received the deposits, seeing that, <lb/>
            while he did not enjoy the rights of Athenian citizenship, he <lb/>
            should not be able to get in the monies that Pasion had lent <lb/>
            on land and lodging-houses, he chose that Pasion himself <lb/>
            should owe him those sums rather than the other debtors to <lb/>
            whom he had lent them. And so on this account Pasion was <lb/>
            set down in the lease as owing eleven talents, as you have <lb/>
            heard stated in evidence.</p>
          <p>In what way the lease was made, evidence has been given <lb/>
            to you by the manager of the bank. Pasion became ill after <lb/>
            that, and see how he made his will. Take the copy of the <lb/>
            will, and this challenge, and these depositions, made by the <lb/>
            persons with whom the will is deposited.</p>

          <p><note type="footnote"> 1 See what Apollodorus says as to this mode of proving the will in <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Pasion died leaving this will; and Phormio the defendant <lb/>
            takes his widow according to the terms of the will, and under­ <lb/>
            took the guardianship of his son. As the plaintiff was helping <lb/>
            himself, and not scrupling to take large sums out of the com­ <lb/>
            mon fund for his own private expenditure, the guardians, cal­ <lb/>
            culating among themselves that, if it should become necessary <lb/>
            to deduct from the common fund an equivalent to what the <lb/>
            plaintiff had spent and then divide the residue, there would <lb/>
            be no surplus left, determined on behalf of the infant to <lb/>
            make a partition of the effects. And they divide the rest of <lb/>
            the property except what the defendant had taken a lease <lb/>
            of; and of the revenue arising therefrom they paid a moiety <lb/>
            to the plaintiff. Up to this time then how is it possible for <lb/>
            him to make any complaint in respect of the leased He <lb/>
            should have expressed his dissatisfaction at the time, and not <lb/>
            waited till now. Nor again can he say that he has not <lb/>
            received the rents which afterwards became due. Had that <lb/>
            been so, Apollodorus, you and your brother would never have <lb/>
            released Phormio from all demands, when he gave up the <lb/>
            lease upon Pasicles coming of age; on the contrary, if he <lb/>
            had owed you anything, you would have demanded it that <lb/>
            instant.</p>
          <p>To prove the truth of my statements-to show that the <lb/>
            plaintiff made partition with his brother while yet a minor, <lb/>
            and that they discharged Phormio from his liability under <lb/>
            the lease and from all other demands--take this deposition.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Deposition.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Immediately after they had discharged the defendant from <lb/>
            the lease, men of Athens, they divide between them the bank <lb/>
            and the shield-manufactory, and Apollodorus, having the <lb/>
            selection, chooses the shield-manufactory in preference to the <lb/>
            bank. Now, if the plaintiff had any private capital in the <lb/>
            bank, what could possibly have induced him to prefer <lb/>
            the other property ? The income was not greater, but less; <lb/>
            for the manufactory produced a talent, while the bank yielded <lb/>
            a hundred minas; nor was the property more agreeable, if <lb/>
            there was a private fund of his own in the bank. But there <lb/>
            was no such fund. The plaintiff therefore acted wisely iv <lb/>
            choosing the shield manufactory; for that is a property <lb/>
             <pb n="207"/>
            without risk, whereas the bank is a business yielding a pre­ <lb/>
            carious revenue from other people's money.</p>
          <p>It might in many ways be clearly shown, that this claim <lb/>
            of the plaintiff's to a sum of banking stock is false and frau­ <lb/>
            dulent. The strongest proof of all, that Phormio received no <lb/>
            banking stock when he took to the business, is this, I take <lb/>
            it; that Pasion has been set down in the lease aa debtor to <lb/>
            the bank, not as having given banking stock to the defendant. <lb/>
            The second proof is, that the plaintiff does not appear to have <lb/>
            made any demand at the time of the partition. The third, <lb/>
            that, when afterwards he let 1 the same establishment to other <lb/>
            persons for the same sum, he will be shown not to have let <lb/>
            any private fund of his own with it Surely, however, if he <lb/>
            was deprived by the defendant of a fund which his father <lb/>
            bequeathed, he ought himself to have provided it from some <lb/>
            other source, and delivered it to the lessees.</p>
          <p>To prove the truth of these statements-find that he after­ <lb/>
            wards let the bank to Xeno and Euphræus and Euphron and <lb/>
            Callistratus, and that they also had no private banking stock <lb/>
            delivered to them, but took a lease only of the deposits and <lb/>
            the profits arising from them-please to take the deposition <lb/>
            proving these matters; and also that he chose the shield- <lb/>
            manufactory.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Deposition.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>It has been proved to you in evidence, men of Athens, <lb/>
            that they granted a lease to these persons also, and did not <lb/>
            deliver to them any private banking stock, and that they <lb/>
            gave them a complete discharge, as if they had received great <lb/>
            benefits from them, and did not go to law either with them <lb/>
            or with Phormio at that time. As long indeed as his mother <lb/>
            lived, who was perfectly acquainted with all these particulars, <lb/>
            Apollodorus never made any complaint against Phormio the <lb/>
            defendant; but after her death he claimed three thousand <lb/>
            drachma in money, besides two thousand which she had given <lb/>
            to his children, and a certain tunic and maid-servant, and <lb/>
            for this false claim he went to law. Even here, as will be <lb/>
            shown, he made no mention of the demand which he now <note type="footnote"> I " Non potest hoc nisi de Apollodoro intelligi Qui autem factum <lb/>

            makes. Upon his referring the matter to the father of his <lb/>
            wife and the husband of his wife's sister and Lysinus and <lb/>
            Andromenes, they persuaded the defendant Phormio to make <lb/>
            him a present of the three thousand drachms and the addi­ <lb/>
            tional articles, and to make a friend of the plaintiff rather <lb/>
            than be at enmity with him on such an account: the plaintiff <lb/>
            then received in the whole five thousand drachms, went to <lb/>
            the temple of Pallas, and a second time released Phormio <lb/>
            from all demands. Notwithstanding this, he sues him, as <lb/>
            you see, again, getting up all kinds of accusations, and raking <lb/>
            from the whole history of the past charges (this is the worst <lb/>
            of all) which he never made before.</p>
          <p>To prove the truth of these statements, please to take the <lb/>
            award that was made in the Acropolis, and the deposition of <lb/>
            the persons who were present, when Apollodorus upon the <lb/>
            receipt of this money gave a release of all his claims.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Award. The Deposition.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>You hear the award, men of the jury, which was given by <lb/>
            Dinias, whose daughter the plaintiff has married, and Nicias, <lb/>
            who has married his wife's sister. Notwithstanding that he <lb/>
            has received this money and given a release from all claims, <lb/>
            he dares to bring an action for so many talents, just as if <lb/>
            all these persons were dead, or as if the truth would not be <lb/>
            disclosed.</p>
          <p>All the dealings and transactions between Phormio and <lb/>
            Apollodorus you have heard, men of Athens, from the be­ <lb/>
            ginning. I imagine that Apollodorus the plaintiff, having <lb/>
            nothing to urge in support of his claim, will say what he <lb/>
            ventured to assert before the arbitrator, that his mother has <lb/>
            made away with the papers at the defendant's instigation, <lb/>
            and that, these being lost, he has no means of proving his <lb/>
            case strictly. As to this statement and the charge which it <lb/>
            involves, see how plainly he may be convicted of falsehood. <lb/>
            In the first place, men of Athens, who would have made a <lb/>
            partition of his patrimony, without having documents to <lb/>
            ascertain the amount of the property left ? No man surely. <lb/>
            Well; it is eighteen years, Apollodorus, since you made the <lb/>
            partition, and you cannot show that you ever complained <lb/>
            about the papers being lost. In the next place, when Pasicles <lb/>
            had come to man's estate antI was receiving from his guar­ <lb/>
             <pb n="209"/>
            dians their trust account, what man, if he scrupled with his <lb/>
            own mouth to accuse his mother of having destroyed papers. <lb/>
            would not have disclosed the thing to his brother, so that by <lb/>
            his assistance it might have been brought to light ? 1 Thirdly, <lb/>
            from what papers did you get the materials for the actions <lb/>
            that you brought 1 You must know that the plaintiff has <lb/>
            brought actions against many of our citizens, and recovered <lb/>
            large sums of money, inserting in his plaints—" Such a party <lb/>
            has injured me by not paying me the money, which he owed <lb/>
            to my father at his death, as appears by my father's papers." <lb/>
            But, if the papers had been made away with, from what <lb/>
            paper did you commence your actions ?</p>
          <p>In proof of these statements of mine, you have heard the <lb/>
            partition which he made, and the evidence which proves it. <lb/>
            He shall now read you the depositions verifying the plaints. <lb/>
            Please to take the depositions.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Depositions.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>You see, in these plaints he has confessed having received <lb/>
            his father's papers; for of course he would not say that he <lb/>
            made false charges or sued those parties for what they did <lb/>
            not owe.</p>
          <p>Many strong proofs are there, men of Athens, that Phormio <lb/>
            the defendant is not liable; but I think this is the strongest <lb/>
            of all, that Pasicles, though he is the brother of the plaintiff <lb/>
            Apollodorus, has commenced no action, and makes none of <lb/>
            the complaints which this man does. Surely it. is not likely <lb/>
            that he would have forborne to injure one who was left a <lb/>
            minor by his father, and of whose property he had the con­ <lb/>
            trol as testamentary guardian, and yet would have done an <lb/>
            injury to you, who at your father's death were a man of four- <lb/>
            and-twenty, and who, if any wrong had been done you, would <lb/>
            speedily and without difficulty have obtained justice. That <lb/>
            is a thing impossible.</p>
          <p>To prove the truth of these statements, and that Pasicles <lb/>
            makes no complaint, please to take the deposition which <lb/>
            proves it. <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">τούτῳ</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="grc">τούτου</foreign>. "Redeunt ad Pasiclem."-Reiske. "Immo at! <lb/>

          <p>There are points which you have now to consider in rela­ <lb/>
            tion to my plea in bar of the action; please to recall these <lb/>
            to your minds from what has already been stated. We, men <lb/>
            of Athens-there having been a statement of accounts and a <lb/>
            discharge from the lease of the bank and the shield-manufac­ <lb/>
            tory-there having also been an award, and again a release <lb/>
            of all demands-as the laws do not allow people to bring <lb/>
            actions for demands which they have once released, and as <lb/>
            the plaintiff was making a vexatious claim and suing contrary <lb/>
            to the laws—we, under these circumstances, put in a special <lb/>
            plea in bar of his action. Now then, that you may under­ <lb/>
            stand the point on which you have to pronounce your verdict, <lb/>
            he shall read you this statute and the depositions, one after <lb/>
            the other, of the persons who were present when Apollodorus <lb/>
            discharged Phormio from the lease and from all other claims. <lb/>
            Please to take these depositions and the law.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Depositions. The Law.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>You hear the law, men of Athens, mentioning, among <lb/>
            other matters for which there shall be no right of action, <lb/>
            those of which a man has given a release or discharge. And <lb/>
            with reason. For if it is just, that people shall not bring <lb/>
            fresh actions for causes which have once been tried, it is far <lb/>
            juster that there shall be no action for claims which have <lb/>
            been released. For a man who has lost his cause by your <lb/>
            verdict may possibly say that you were deceived ; but when a <lb/>
            man has plainly decided against himself, and given a release <lb/>
            and discharge, what complaint can he prefer against himself <lb/>
            to entitle him to sue over again for the same matter ? None <lb/>
            surely. Therefore the framer of the statute, among the cases <lb/>
            in which there is to be no right of action, first mentions those, <lb/>
            in which a man has given a release or discharge : both of <lb/>
            which have been given by this man, for he has released and <lb/>
            discharged the defendant. That my statement is true, men <lb/>
            of Athens, has already been proved to you in evidence.</p>
          <p>Now please to take the statute of limitations.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Law.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>The law, men of Athens, has thus clearly prescribed the <lb/>
            time. Yet the plaintiff Apollodorus, after a lapse of more <lb/>
             <pb n="211"/>
            than twenty years, calls upon you to pay more respect to his <lb/>
            calumnious charges than to the laws, according to which you <lb/>
            are sworn to give judgment. You are bound to pay regard <lb/>
            to all the laws, but especially to this, men of Athens. For, <lb/>
            as it seems to me, Solon framed it for no other purpose but <lb/>
            to prevent your being harassed with false claims. He con­ <lb/>
            sidered that five years was a sufficient time for injured parties <lb/>
            to recover what was due to them; and he thought that <lb/>
            length of time would be the plainest proof against those who <lb/>
            came with false stories. And knowing also, that it was im­ <lb/>
            possible for the contracting parties and their witnesses to live <lb/>
            for ever, he put the law in their place, that it might be a <lb/>
            witness of truth in favour of the destitute.</p>
          <p>I wonder, men of the jury, what arguments Apollodorus, <lb/>
            the plaintiff, can possibly urge in reply to these. He can <lb/>
            hardly suppose that you, without finding him to have sustained <lb/>
            any pecuniary injury, will be indignant at Phormio's having <lb/>
            married his mother. For he is not ignorant of this-it is no <lb/>
            secret to him or to a good many of you—that Socrates the <lb/>
            banker, having got his freedom from his masters, did what <lb/>
            the plaintiffs father did, gave his wife to Satyrus, who formerly <lb/>
            belonged to him. Socles, another banker, gave his wife to <lb/>
            Timodemus, who is yet alive and in being, and formerly be­ <lb/>
            longed to him. And it is not here only, men of Athens, that <lb/>
            people in this line of business so act; but in Ægina Stry­ <lb/>
            modorus gave his wife to Hermæus, his own slave, and again, <lb/>
            upon her death, he gave him his daughter. And many <lb/>
            such examples could be quoted, and no wonder. For, <lb/>
            although to you, men of Athens, who are citizens by birth, it <lb/>
            would be disgraceful to prefer wealth, however great, to <lb/>
            honourable descent, yet those persons who have obtained <lb/>
            citizenship as a gift either from you or from others, and who <lb/>
            owed that honour originally to their good fortune, to their <lb/>
            having prospered in business and made more money than <lb/>
            their neighbours, are obliged to preserve these advantages. <lb/>
            Therefore it was that your father Pasion did what he has <lb/>
            done : he was not the first nor the only person that ever did <lb/>
            such a thing: he did it not to disgrace himself or you his <lb/>
            sons; but seeing that the only way to keep up his business <lb/>
            . was to attach this man to you by a binding connexion, for <lb/>
            that reason he gave his own wife, your mother, to him in <note type="footnote"> p2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="212"/>
            marriage. If you examine his conduct then by the standard <lb/>
            of utility, you will find that he has determined wisely : but <lb/>
            if you spurn Phormio as a father-in-law from family pride, <lb/>
            see if it is not ridiculous in you. to allege such a ground. <lb/>
            For, if you were asked, what sort of a person you consider <lb/>
            your father to have been, I am sure you would say, he was a <lb/>
            good man. Now, which do you think more resembles Pasion <lb/>
            in character and mode of life-yourself or Phormio ? I am <lb/>
            sure you think Phormio does. Then do you spurn a man who <lb/>
            more resembles your father than you yourself do, because he <lb/>
            has married your mother ? That the thing took place by your <lb/>
            father's desire and direction, not only appears from the will, <lb/>
            (observe this, men of Athens,)—but you yourself are witness <lb/>
            to the fact. For when you claimed to take your share of <lb/>
            your mother's inheritance, she having left children by the <lb/>
            defendant Phormio, you then confessed that she had been <lb/>
            regularly affianced by your father and married according to <lb/>
            the laws. For if the defendant took her, and made her his <lb/>
            wife wrongfully, without any one giving her in marriage, his <lb/>
            children would not have been heirs, and those not heirs could <lb/>
            have had no share in the property. In proof of these state­ <lb/>
            ments it has been shown in evidence, that he received a <lb/>
            fourth share and gave a release of all demands.</p>
          <p>Having nothing to say for himself on any single point, <lb/>
            men of Athens, he ventured to make before the arbitrator <lb/>
            the most impudent assertions, of which it is best to warn you— <lb/>
            first, that there never was any will at all, but that it was alto­ <lb/>
            gether a fiction and a forgery-secondly, that in previous <lb/>
            years he forbore to dispute it or go to law, because Phormio <lb/>
            was willing to pay and promised to pay him a large rent; <lb/>
            "but now," says he, " I go to law, because Phormio does not <lb/>
            perform his promise." That both these assertions, if he <lb/>
            makes them, will be false, both inconsistent with his own <lb/>
            conduct, I am about to show you; pray, attend. When he <lb/>
            denies the will, ask him how it came that he got the lodging- <lb/>
            house under the will by right of primogeniture. He will <lb/>
            hardly maintain, that those parts of the will are valid, by <lb/>
            which his father gave him a benefit, and that the other parts <lb/>
            are invalid. When he says that he was seduced by the <lb/>
            defendant's promises, remember that we have brought as <lb/>
            witnesses before you the persons, who, long after the defend <lb/>
             <pb n="213"/>
            ant's retirement, took a lease under Apollodorus and his <lb/>
            brother of the bank and the shield-manufactory. At the <lb/>
            time when he granted the lease to those men, he ought <lb/>
            at once to have made his charge against the defendant, it <lb/>
            there was any justice in the demands, of which he then gave <lb/>
            a release and for which he now sues.</p>
          <p>To prove the truth of these statements-that he took the <lb/>
            lodging-house by right of primogeniture according to the <lb/>
            will-and that he not only thought it right to make no corn­ <lb/>
            plaint against the defendant, but expressed approbation of <lb/>
            his conduct--take the deposition.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Deposition.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>That you may know, men of Athens, what large sums of <lb/>
            money he has received from the rents and from the debts, <lb/>
            although he will presently bewail his destitution and utter <lb/>
            ruin ; let me mention a few things to you. The plaintiff has <lb/>
            collected out of the debts twenty talents altogether, from the <lb/>
            papers which his father left, and of this amount he has kept <lb/>
            more than half to himself; for in many cases he cheats his <lb/>
            brother out of his share. From the leases, for eight years <lb/>
            during which Phormio had the bank, he has received eighty <lb/>
            minas a year, the moiety of the whole rent; that makes ten <lb/>
            talents forty minas; and for ten years after that, for which <lb/>
            they leased to Xeno and Euphræus and Euphron and Callis­ <lb/>
            tratus, a talent a year. Besides this, he has had the income <lb/>
            for about twenty years of the property originally divided, <lb/>
            which he managed himself, more than thirty minas. If you <lb/>
            put all these sums together, what he got by the division, <lb/>
            what he collected, what he has received as rent, he will ap­ <lb/>
            pear to have received more than forty talents, besides what <lb/>
            Phormio has made him a present of, and the maternal in­ <lb/>
            heritance, and what he has had from the bank and does not <lb/>
            return, four talents and a half and six hundred drachms.</p>
          <p>Ob, but I suppose the state has had these monies, and you <lb/>
            are cruelly treated because of your large expenditure on the <lb/>
            public services. Nay. What you gave to the public out of <lb/>
            your property before it was divided, you and your brother <lb/>
            expended in common; and what you gave afterwards amounts <lb/>
            not to the income, I won't say of two talents, but of twenty <lb/>
            minas. Do not then accuse the state; do not say that the <lb/>
             <pb n="214"/>
            state has received the property which you have wickedly and <lb/>
            shamefully wasted.</p>
          <p>That yon may see, men of Athens, both the amount of <lb/>
            property which he has received, and the public charges which <lb/>
            he has defrayed, he shall read you the particulars. Please to <lb/>
            take this schedule and this challenge and these depositions:</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Schedule. The Challenge. The Depositions.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>He has received all these monies; he has many talents' <lb/>
            worth of debts, some of which he gets paid voluntarily, some <lb/>
            he recovers by action; all of which were owing to Pasion, <lb/>
            (besides the rent of the bank and the other property which <lb/>
            he left,) and which Apollodorus and his brother have now <lb/>
            received: he has spent only what you have heard, (being <lb/>
            an inconsiderable portion of the income—I needn't say the <lb/>
            capital,) upon the public services; and yet he will play the <lb/>
            braggart, and talk of trierarchal and choragic expenses. That <lb/>
            his assertions will be untrue, I have already shown; yet, <lb/>
            even were they all true, I think it is more honourable and <lb/>
            just that the plaintiff should defray public charges out of his <lb/>
            own means, than that you should give the defendant's pro­ <lb/>
            perty to the plaintiff, and, while you yourselves get but a <lb/>
            small share of the whole, should see the defendant in extreme <lb/>
            indigence, and the plaintiff behaving himself with arrogance <lb/>
            and spending his money in the accustomed manner.</p>
          <p>With respect to Phormio's affluence, Apollodorus, and his <lb/>
            having got it from your father's estate, and the questions <lb/>
            which you said you would put, how Phormio has acquired his <lb/>
            property—you of all men, Apollodorus, are the least entitled <lb/>
            to talk in this way. For Pasion your father did not acquire <lb/>
            his property, any more than Phormio did, by good luck 1 or <lb/>
            by inheritance from his father; but while he was with his <lb/>
            masters, Antisthenes and Archestratus, the bankers, he gave <lb/>
            proof that he was honest and just in his dealings, and won <lb/>
            their confidence. In the commercial world and the money <lb/>
            market it is thought a wonderful thing, when the same <lb/>
            person shows himself to be both honest and diligent.2 Pasion <note type="footnote"> 1 Schäfer—"fortuitu." Pabst—"durch Erwerb." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 Pabst—" Es ist aber an einem Handelsplatze und bei Leuten, welche <lb/>
            Geldgeschäfte treiben, etwas ganz auaserordentlich Wichtiges, wenD <lb/>

             <pb n="215"/>
            aid not derive this quality from his masters, for he was <lb/>
            honest by nature : no more did Phormio derive it from your <lb/>
            father; for, had it been in your father's power, he would <lb/>
            have made you honest in preference to Phormio. If you are <lb/>
            ignorant of this, that trustworthiness is the best capital for <lb/>
            money-getting, you must be ignorant of everything. And <lb/>
            besides this, Pbormio has in many ways been useful as well <lb/>
            to your father as to you, and to your affairs generally. But <lb/>
            indeed such is your covetousness, such your disposition, that <lb/>
            no language could come up to it.1 I am astonished you don't <lb/>
            reflect, that Archestratus, to whom your father formerly <lb/>
            belonged, has a son here, Antimachus, in a condition unbe­ <lb/>
            fitting his rank; who does not go to law with you and say <lb/>
            he is cruelly treated, because you wear a mantle, and have <lb/>
            redeemed one mistress and given another in marriage, and <lb/>
            do these things notwithstanding that you have a wife, and <lb/>
            take three footboys about with you, and live so indecently <lb/>
            that even people meeting you in the streets perceive it, while <lb/>
            he himself is in a state of wretched destitution. Nor is <lb/>
            Phormio's position unknown to him. If you think you have <lb/>
            a claim to Phormio's property on this account, because he <lb/>
            once belonged to your father, Antimachus has a greater claim <lb/>
            than you; for your father also belonged to that house, so <lb/>
            that both you and Phormio belong to Antimachus according <lb/>
            to your argument. But you are so lost to proper feeling, <lb/>
            that, what you ought to detest any one for saying, you <lb/>
            yourself compel people to say of you, and, while you disgrace <lb/>
            yourself and your deceased parents, you treat the state with <lb/>
            contumely, and, instead of cherishing and making much of <lb/>
            the good fortune, which your father and afterwards the <lb/>
            defendant Phormio obtained by the kindness of these men, <lb/>
            so that it might have reflected the utmost credit both upon <lb/>
            the givers and you the receivers, you bring it into public <lb/>
            view, you point your finger at it, you call it in question, and <lb/>
            all but reproach the Athenians for naturalising such a person <lb/>
            as yourself. Nay, at such a pitch of madness are you <lb/>
            arrived—(for what else can one call it ?)—you don't perceive, <lb/>
            that at this very moment we, who insist that, as Phormio <lb/>
            has received his freedom, the fact of his having once belonged <lb/>
            to your father should not be remembered to his disadvantage, <note type="footnote"> 1 Pabst—" wer könnte genügend schildern ?" </note> <lb/>

          <p>The man then who originally upheld the business, who <lb/>
            made himself in various ways useful to the plaintiff's father, <lb/>
            who has conferred on the plaintiff himself all the benefits <lb/>
            which you have heard, he thinks proper, by means of a <lb/>
            judgment with such heavy damages, to cast out unjustly <lb/>
            from house and home. It is this only that you will be able to <lb/>
            accomplish, Apollodorus. For, if you look closely at the <lb/>
            nature of the property, you will see to whom it belongs,1 in <lb/>
            case the jury should be misled ; which heaven forbid ! Do <lb/>
            you see Archilochus, the son of Charidemus ? he once owned <lb/>
            some land ; and now it has many owners; for, when he pur­ <lb/>
            chased it, he was indebted to a great number of persons. <lb/>
            You know also Sosinomus and Timodemus and the other <lb/>
            bankers, who, when they were obliged to settle with their <lb/>
            creditors, gave up their whole property. You however dou't <lb/>
            choose to take anything into consideration, not even the <lb/>
            prudential measures taken by your father, a better and a <lb/>
            wiser man in all things than yourself. He-by Jupiter and <lb/>
            the Gods !-regarded the defendant as so much more valuable <lb/>
            than you, both to yourself and to him and to your affairs, <lb/>
            that, although you had come to man's estate, he left the <lb/>
            defendant, and not you, to be the manager of his leases, and <lb/>
            gave him his wife in marriage, and honoured him in his life­ <lb/>
            time. Justly, men of Athens. For other bankers, not paying <lb/>
            rents, but trafficking on their own account, have all come to <lb/>
            ruin ; while the defendant, paying you a rent of two talents <lb/>
            and forty minas, maintained the bank. For this Pasion was <lb/>
            thankful to him, but you make no account of it; you, in <note type="footnote"> 1 I.e. to the creditors of the bank, who will soon come upon it, if <lb/>

            defiance of the will and the imprecations pronounced therein <lb/>
            by your father, harass, persecute, and calumniate him. My <lb/>
            good sir—if one can thus address you—will you not be quiet <lb/>
            -will you not understand that to be honest is a more pro­ <lb/>
            fitable thing than a heap of gold ? Your own is a case in <lb/>
            point, if you tell the truth; for, after receiving all this money, <lb/>
            you have lost it all, as you say: but, if you had been a sober­ <lb/>
            minded man, you would not have spent it.</p>
          <p>By Jupiter and the Gods ! Looking at the matter in every <lb/>
            point of view, I can see no reason why you should prevail <lb/>
            upon the jury to give a verdict against Phormio. Is this <lb/>
            the ground-that your charge comes soon after the offence ? <lb/>
            No; you are accusing him years and years after. Or because <lb/>
            during the interval you were not a litigious person ? Why, <lb/>
            who does not know how incessantly you have been engaged <lb/>
            in litigation, not only prosecuting private suits of no less im­ <lb/>
            portance than the present, but trumping up public charges <lb/>
            and bringing people to trial? Did you not accuse Timo­ <lb/>
            machus ? Did you not accuse Callippus who is now in Sicily? <lb/>
            Again, did you not accuse Menon—Autocles—Timotheus— <lb/>
            and many others ? But is it credible that such a person as <lb/>
            you, Apollodorus, would demand satisfaction for public <lb/>
            wrongs, a portion of which only pertained to yourself, sooner <lb/>
            than for the private wrongs of which you now complain, <lb/>
            especially when they were so serious as you now pretend ? <lb/>
            How came it that you accused those men and let Phormio <lb/>
            alone ? You were not wronged, I presume; and your present <lb/>
            claim is false and vexatious. I consider then, men of Athens, <lb/>
            that it will be eminently to the purpose to produce witnesses <lb/>
            to these facts; for what can one expect now from a person <lb/>
            who is always making groundless charges ? And in truth, <lb/>
            men of Athens, I think that whatever serves for an index <lb/>
            of Phormio's character, and a proof of his rectitude and <lb/>
            humanity, is a relevant matter to bring before you. For a <lb/>
            roan who is dishonest on all occasions might possibly have <lb/>
            wronged the plaintiff, among others; but a man who has <lb/>
            never wronged any one-who, on the contrary, has rendered <lb/>
            services spontaneously to many-how is it likely that be <lb/>
            should have wronged the plaintiff alone of all mankind ? <lb/>
            When you have heard these depositions, you will know the <lb/>
            character of each.</p><pb n="218"/>

            never done harm to any one either publicly or privately, and <lb/>
            is guilty of no offence to Apollodorus the plaintiff, begs and <lb/>
            beseeches and implores you to save him, and we his friends <lb/>
            join in the same petition to you. Another thing too you <lb/>
            must hear. It has been read to you, men of Athens, that <lb/>
            he has acquired such a heap of money as neither he nor any <lb/>
            one else possesses. Yet Phormio has credit with those that <lb/>
            know him for this and for a greater amount, and by means <lb/>
            of such credit he benefits both himself and you. Do not <lb/>
            give this away from him ; do not suffer this odious man to <lb/>
            destroy it; do not establish a disgraceful precedent, that the <lb/>
            property of men in business, who live respectable lives, may <lb/>
            be obtained from you by miscreants and pettifoggers: indeed <lb/>
            it is much more useful to you while it remains in the de­ <lb/>
            fendant's possession; for you see yourselves and you hear <lb/>
            from the witnesses, how he behaves to those who need his <lb/>
            assistance. And he has not done any of these acts for the <lb/>
            sake of pecuniary advantage, but all out of humanity and <lb/>
            goodness of heart. It is not right, men of Athens, that you <lb/>
            should abandon such a man to the mercy of the plaintiff. <lb/>
            You must not pity him at a time when it will be of no ad­ <lb/>
            vantage to him, but now, when you have it in your power to <lb/>
            save him; for I see no fitter opportunity than this to lend <lb/>
            him assistance. The mass of what Apollodorus will say you <lb/>
            should regard as mere talk and calumny; but bid him show <lb/>
            you, either that his father did not make this will, or that <lb/>
            there is another lease than the one which we produce, or that <lb/>
            he did not after stating an account release Phormio from all <lb/>
             <pb n="219"/>
            the claims which his father-in-law decided with the plaintiff's <lb/>
            own concurrence, or that the laws allow people to bring <lb/>
            actions for matters which have been so settled-bid him <lb/>
            show something of the kind, at all events. If, for lack of <lb/>
            argument, he resorts to calumny and foul language and <lb/>
            abuse, do not attend to him; do not let his clamour and <lb/>
            impudence deceive you ; but keep in mind and remember all <lb/>
            that you have heard from us. If you act in this manner, <lb/>
            you will at the same time satisfy your own consciences and <lb/>
            preserve the defendant, as justice requires, and as, by Jupiter <lb/>

          <p>THE present speech was delivered in a mining cause, and, in order to <lb/>
            understand it fully, the reader must know something about the <lb/>
            Athenian law relating to mining property.</p>
          <p>The silver mines of Laurium, which in ancient times contributed. so <lb/>
            greatly to the prosperity of the Athenian republic, comprised a hilly <lb/>
            district not far from the promontory of Sunium, and stretching from <lb/>
            coast to coast in a line of about sixty stadia, from Anaphlystus in the <lb/>
            south-west to Thoricus or the north east sea. The district was popu. <lb/>
            lous, including the village of Laurium and several others, inhabited <lb/>
            chiefly by mining labourers. Mining is said to have been carried on <lb/>
            from an early period, though the scarcity of silver in Solon's age <lb/>
            proves that no good system of working had then been adopted. In <lb/>
            the time of Themistocles the mines had become very productive, and <lb/>
            the Athenians, under the advice of that statesman, applied the revenues <lb/>
            obtained from them (amounting annually to thirty or forty talents), <lb/>
            to the fitting out of a large fleet for the Æginetan war. In the age <lb/>
            of Socrates, though a greater number of labourers was employed by <lb/>
            the mine-owners, the public revenue, and therefore the quantity of <lb/>
            silver obtained from the mines, had diminished. In the age of <lb/>
            Demosthenes the profits had considerably fallen off; and before that <lb/>
            of Strabo (who wrote in the first century of the Christian era) the <lb/>
            mines had been almost entirely exhausted.</p>
          <p>The mines were worked either by shafts or adits, and sometimes by <lb/>
            the removal of large masses, pillars being left for the support of the <lb/>
             <pb n="220"/>
            overlying rock. The removal of the ore appears to have been effected <lb/>
            partly by men and partly by machines. The stamping at the foundries, <lb/>
            to facilitate its separation from the useless mass, was commonly per­ <lb/>
            formed with the pestle and mortar. With respect to the processes of <lb/>
            smelting or fusion in the Attic foundries, we have little direct infor­ <lb/>
            mation from ancient authors; the treatises of Theophrastus and <lb/>
            others upon this subject having been lost. It is the opinion of <lb/>
            Boeckh, from whose Dissertation on the silver-mines of Laurium we <lb/>
            derive most of our information, that the smelting processes used by <lb/>
            the Athenians were pretty much the same as those employed in <lb/>
            other ancient mines. A few extracts from Boeckh, relating to these <lb/>
            matters, will be found among the notes to this oration. What the <lb/>
            reader however is more immediately concerned with is, to under­ <lb/>
            stand the tenure of mining property at Athens, and the laws and <lb/>
            regulations regarding it. To these I proceed to draw his attention.</p>
          <p>The mines were the property of the Athenian state; which however <lb/>
            did not work them at the public cost and risk, but granted them out <lb/>
            on perpetual leases to various private speculators, in consideration of <lb/>
            a premium, and a reserved rent of a twenty-fourth part of the gross <lb/>
            produce, which was paid in bullion. A certain share or district was <lb/>
            assigned to each tenant, or company of tenants, the boundaries being <lb/>
            described as accurately as possible in the conveyance. Upon payment <lb/>
            of the premium or purchase-money, the tenant was regarded as virtual <lb/>
            owner, subject to the payment of his rent; and his title was trans­ <lb/>
            missible by descent or purchase. No alien however was capable of <lb/>
            holding property in the mines. Whoever wished to open a new mine <lb/>
            and obtain a grant of it, applied to the Poletæ, who superintended the <lb/>
            sales of all public property. It is likely enough, as Boeckh thinks, <lb/>
            that the immediate payment of the premium was not always insisted <lb/>
            upon, but that the applicant for a mine was sometimes allowed to <lb/>
            dig in an unopened part of the mountain, to ascertain whether a <lb/>
            profitable ore was likely to be found, before he took his lease, or <lb/>
            before he paid his purchase-money. The premiums were paid <lb/>
            directly into the state treasury; the rents were paid to a farmer- <lb/>
            general.</p>
          <p>The number of mine proprietors was very considerable in the flourish­ <lb/>
            ing times. The shares, into which the mine district was divided, <lb/>
            were unequal in extent and value, but not greatly unequal; the <lb/>
            ordinary price of one is said to have been a talent. Sometimes a <lb/>
            mine was worked by two or more persons in partnership; and some­ <lb/>
            times a company was formed for opening new works, who afterwards, <lb/>
            if they were fortunate enough to find plenty of ore, divided the space <lb/>
            into different compartments, which they worked independently, each <lb/>
            taking a separate share. Thus they ran the risk in common until <lb/>
            such time only as they found a remunerative vein of metal. Such a <lb/>
            plan was first suggested by Xenophon in his treatise on the Revenue, <lb/>
            and it appears to have been acted upon.</p>
          <p>The labour of mining, like most other productive labour among the <lb/>
            Athenians, was performed by slaves, either belonging to the pro­ <lb/>
            prietors, or (which was less usual) hired for the purpose. Mining <lb/>
            slaves were of inferior quality, and thoU' labour was therefore cheaply <lb/>
             <pb n="221"/>
            procured; but it is manifest that the employment of such persons <lb/>
            was unfavourable to great success or improvement in mining art. <lb/>
            Nicias, the celebrated general, who was a large mine owner, employed <lb/>
            a thousand slaves; Hipponicus, six hundred; and they are said to <lb/>
            have let their mines and slaves to contractors, Nicias receiving a <lb/>
            mina and two-thirds per day.</p>
          <p>The mines being a regular source of income to the state, though the <lb/>
            amount was continually fluctuating, depending on the greater or less <lb/>
            number of mines that were taken, upon the quality of the ores, an <unclear>A</unclear> <lb/>
            the greater or less activity and success with which they were worked; <lb/>
            it was important for the Athenians to make careful regulations to <lb/>
            preserve the property, and render it as productive as possible. <lb/>
            Special laws were passed relating to them, as well to protect the <lb/>
            republic against frauds, as to encourage mining speculations among <lb/>
            respectable capitalists, and to secure the tenants in the peaceful <lb/>
            occupation of their allotments.</p>
          <p>The clandestine opening of a mine, without the permission of the <lb/>
            Poletse, and without the name of the party opening being entered in <lb/>
            the public register, subjected him to criminal proceedings: this <lb/>
            being regarded as a political offence, the charge was brought by <lb/>
            Probole before the popular assembly, to obtain its sanction for the <lb/>
            prosecution. If the purchase-money of a mine was not paid into the <lb/>
            treasury by the appointed time, the tenant became liable to pay the <lb/>
            double amount, and to the other penal consequences which fell upon <lb/>
            state-debtors. If he failed to pay his rent, the farmer-general was <lb/>
            empowered to proceed against him; but the extreme penalty in this <lb/>
            case was the forfeiture of his mine to the state, unless the default <lb/>
            was attended with aggravating circumstances. For other public <lb/>
            offences relating to the mines a Phasis might be preferred, upon <lb/>
            which the punishment was discretionary with the court.</p>
          <p>For private mining causes the law provided a special method of trial, <lb/>
            in the same manner as it did for mercantile causes, appointing them <lb/>
            to be tried within a month before the Thesmothetæ. This had been <lb/>
            one of the suggestions made by Xenophon in the treatise already <lb/>
            referred to. Demosthenes in this oration mentions four cases to <lb/>
            which the privilege extended: 1. Ejectment of a mine-owner from <lb/>
            his occupation : 2. Incendiarism : 3. An attack with arms : 4. Cutting <lb/>
            into another owner's boundaries. I am disposed to think, as Meier <lb/>
            seems to have thought, that Demosthenes has not exhausted all the <lb/>
            cases comprised in the law which he cites to the jury; but that <lb/>
            either the law itself put these by way of example only, and contained <lb/>
            also a general clause including other offences ejusdem generis ;or <lb/>
            that the orator only cited an extract, which was sufficient for his <lb/>
            own purpose. The intention of the law must have been, to provide <lb/>
            a speedy remedy for all injuries which prevented the beneficial work­ <lb/>
            ing of the mines, which concerned the public as well as the party <lb/>
            wronged. Such would be not merely the burning of a mine, or of its <lb/>
            chambering and supports, but any other act of destruction or mischief <lb/>
            -such would be not only the absolute ejectment of a tenant, but <lb/>
            any obstruction or interference continued for a length of time; <lb/>
            again, any injury to a neighbouring proprietor, whether by armed <lb/>
             <pb n="222"/>
            invasion, or perforation into his boundaries, or any other unlawful <lb/>
            encroachment upon his works or his rights—and again, acts of negli­ <lb/>
            gence ;as where a man, by neglecting to maintain his own supports, <lb/>
            rendered those of his neighbours unsafe, or improperly drained or <lb/>
            diverted water into an adjacent district-and a multitude of wrongful <lb/>
            acts may be conceived, to which the objects of the Athenian law <lb/>
            would equally apply. It is probable however that those only were <lb/>
            mining causes within the scope of the law, where the dispute <lb/>
            directly concerned a mine and was between mining people, or parties <lb/>
            interested in mining property; for example, between neighbouring <lb/>
            owners, or claimants for possession, or partners, or (it may be) <lb/>
            persons standing in the relation of vendor and purchaser, or mort­ <lb/>
            gagor and mortgagee. For example; if a stranger had destroyed the <lb/>
            supports of a mine, this would not give rise to a mining cause; <lb/>
            otherwise, if an adjoining owner had done so. Again, if the mort­ <lb/>
            gagee of a mine sued for his money, it would not be a mining cause <lb/>
            merely because the mortgage of the mine was an incidental topic; <lb/>
            but, if the mortgagee had illegally taken possession of the security, <lb/>
            he might be sued before the mining tribunal. The reader may turn <lb/>
            to what I have said with respect to the analogous case of a mercantile <lb/>
            cause (ante, page 150). Questions of this kind, with such scanty <lb/>
            materials for solution, are necessarily attended with much uncer­ <lb/>
            tainty; and I am the more diffident in the opinion which I venture <lb/>
            to express, because it does not quite accord with that of Boeckh. <lb/>
            That the question here discussed was a doubtful one, may perhaps <lb/>
            be inferred from this very oration, where the defendant by his plea <lb/>
            raises the point of law, whether his adversary was entitled to sue <lb/>
            him in the mining court. And now we come to consider the imme. <lb/>
            diate subject of the speech.</p>
          <p>Pantænetus, the plaintiff in the cause, purchased from one Telemachus <lb/>
            a mine in the district of Maronea for ninety minas. It seems to have <lb/>
            been a mine but lately opened, or perhaps transferred by Telemachus <lb/>
            before it was opened ; for the purchase-money had not been paid to <lb/>
            the state. About the same time, and most likely for the purpose of <lb/>
            this speculation, Pantænetus borrowed a hundred and five minas, <lb/>
            that is to say, a talent from Mnesicles, and forty-five minas from <lb/>
            Phileas and Pleistor. To secure Mnesicles, Telemachus conveyed to <lb/>
            him, in his own name, the mine in question, together with thirty <lb/>
            slaves. Pantænetus afterwards, having occasion to pay off these <lb/>
            creditors, borrows a hundred and five minas from Euergus and Nico­ <lb/>
            bulus, the latter of whom is the defendant in the present action. Of <lb/>
            this sum a talent was advanced by Euergus, and forty-five minas by <lb/>
            Nicobulus. The mine and slaves are then transferred to them by <lb/>
            Mnesicles, by direction of Pantænetus ;and they, being thus consti­ <lb/>
            tuted the proprietors, grant a lease of the mine and slaves to Pantæ­ <lb/>
            netus, reserving to themselves as rent the interest of the hundred <lb/>
            and five minas, i. e. a hundred and five drachms a month, or twelve <lb/>
            per cent. per annum. There was a clause in the lease giving to Pan­ <lb/>
            tænetus a power of redemption within a certain time.</p>
          <p>The reader will not fail to see, that this transaction, which was ostensibly <lb/>
            a purchase, was really a loan of money, secured by the conveyance of <lb/>
             <pb n="223"/>
            the mine and slaves. Boeckh thinks that this fiction was resorted to, <lb/>
            oecause the mortgagee of a mine was not permitted, on default of <lb/>
            payment, to take possession of his security, until he had obtained <lb/>
            the judgment of a court of law; Considering the interest which the <lb/>
            state had in the mines, it is not improbable that the title of a mort­ <lb/>
            gagee might be thus far defective. Perhaps however Boeckh takes <lb/>
            it too easily for granted, that the contrivance, which was in this case <lb/>
            resorted to, of a sale accompanied with a lease and power of redemp­ <lb/>
            tion, would enable the parties to evade the legal difficulty. Whether <lb/>
            the Athenian law allowed such a fiction to prevail, may possibly have <lb/>
            been one of the questions to which this affair gave rise. It is true <lb/>
            that Nicobulus gives no hint in his speech, that there was any doubt <lb/>
            as to the extent of his rights as purchaser; but it would hardly have <lb/>
            suited his purpose to do so; and this being the opening speech in the <lb/>
            cause, he perhaps waited until the question was raised by his adversary, <lb/>
            and reserved his argument upon it for the reply.</p>
          <p>Immediately after the conclusion of this transaction Nicobulus went <lb/>
            abroad. During his absence, Pantænetus having failed to pay the <lb/>
            interest of the borrowed money, Euergus proceeded to exercise his <lb/>
            rights under the deed of sale. It appears-at least we may infer so <lb/>
            much from the plaint in this case-that he entered upon and took <lb/>
            possession of the mine and works, that he carried on the works for <lb/>
            some time on his own account, obtained some ore, and appropriated <lb/>
            it to his own use; and in particular, that he seized some silver which <lb/>
            one of the labourers was bringing to Pantænetus for the express <lb/>
            purpose of being paid into the state-treasury, and thereby caused <lb/>
            Pantænetus to be a defaulter in his debt to the state, and have to <lb/>
            pay double the amount. For these acts Pantænetus afterwards <lb/>
            brought an action against Euergus, and got a verdict with two <lb/>
            talents damages. What were the grounds of this verdict-whether <lb/>
            it was that Euergus had no right of entry under the deed, or whether <lb/>
            he had exercised his right in an illegal and oppressive manner; <lb/>
            whether (as Nicobulus asserts) a prejudice was created against him <lb/>
            by the introduction of irrelevant charges, or whether there were any <lb/>
            other special circumstances in the case—we cannot determine.</p>
          <p>Euergus was still in possession of the works, when Nicobulus returned <lb/>
            to Athens. Nicobulus, seeing the position of things, and finding also <lb/>
            that there were other creditors of Pantænetus who protended to <lb/>
            have claims upon the mine, was desirous to get out of the affair and <lb/>
            have his money back as soon as possible. After some negotiation, it <lb/>
            was arranged, that he and Euergus, upon receiving their hundred <lb/>
            and five minas, should transfer the mine and slaves to the nominees <lb/>
            of Pantænetus, giving a conveyance and warranty of title in their <lb/>
            own names. Nioobulus stipulated for himself, that Pantænetus <lb/>
            should give him a release of all demands. This agreement was <lb/>
            carried out. Pantænetus afterwards brought his action against <lb/>
            Euergus, who appears not to have taken the precaution of obtaining <lb/>
            a release. His success in that proceeding encouraged him (as the de. <lb/>
            fendant says) to commence the present action; the main ground of <lb/>
            which seems to have been, that Euergus had employed a slave of <lb/>
            Nicobulus to do the illegal nets complained of, and therefore it was <lb/>
             <pb n="224"/>
            to be inferred that Nicobulus acted in combination with him. <unclear>Divore</unclear> <lb/>
            extracts from the plaint are quoted in the course of the speech; <lb/>
            from which we see that the plaint (or rather the first part of it) ran <lb/>
            as follows:</p>
          <p>" Nicobulus has done me damage-in that he laid a plot to injure me <lb/>
            and my property, and ordered Antigenes his servant to take away <lb/>
            from my servant the silver, which he was bringing for a payment to <lb/>
            the state in respect of the mine, which I purchased for ninety minas, <lb/>
            and he caused me to be registered as a state-debtor for double the <lb/>
            amount-and in that, after I had incurred the penalty to the state, <lb/>
            he placed Antigenes his servant in my pit near Thrasyllus, and put <lb/>
            him in possession of my works, although I forbade him to do so­ <lb/>
            and in that he persuaded my servants to sit in the foundry to my <lb/>
            prejudice-and in that he refined the silver-earth, which my servants <lb/>
            had obtained from the works, and he retains in his possession the <lb/>
            silver from that silver-earth-and in that he sold my pit and servants <lb/>
            contrary to the agreement which he entered into with me—"</p>
          <p>In addition to these grounds of action, there were charges of assault <lb/>
            and battery and other acts of outrage; all included in a single <lb/>
            plaint, preferred in a mining action before the Thesmothetæ.</p>
          <p>The defendant, in answer to these charges, denies all complicity with <lb/>
            Euergus, contends that it was not likely that he should have ordered <lb/>
            a slave to commit the alleged acts of violence, and that his absence <lb/>
            abroad at the time when they were committed is a proof of his inno­ <lb/>
            cence. He contends also, without arguing the point very distinctly, <lb/>
            that the proceedings of Euergus were authorised by the deed of sale. <lb/>
            The verdict which had been found against Euergus compels him to <lb/>
            speak somewhat cautiously on this point, and, not venturing directly <lb/>
            to blame the jury, he attributes the plaintiff's success to his having <lb/>
            surprised Euergus by irrelevant charges, and thereby created an <lb/>
            unfair prejudice against him.</p>
          <p>It is partly owing to this caution on the part of the defendant, or of <lb/>
            the orator who composed his speech, that it throws so little light <lb/>
            upon the relative positions created between these parties by their <lb/>
            contract. It was not necessary however for the defendant to enter <lb/>
            fully into the merits of the case, this being the trial of the Para­ <lb/>
            graphe; and he seems to have placed his main reliance upon the <lb/>
            special pleas in bar of the action, which were three in number: 1. <lb/>
            That the plaintiff had given him a release of all claims : 2. That he <lb/>
            had joined in one plaint various causes of action, which could not be <lb/>
            tried together before the same tribunal: 3. That the subject of the <lb/>
            dispute did not authorise a mining action. The second of these ob­ <lb/>
            jections may be compared to our demurrer for misjoinder of counts. <lb/>
            The defendant complains that it had been improperly struck out of <lb/>
            the pleadings; he does not say by whom; but we may fairly presume <lb/>
            that he alludes to the presiding magistrate, who perhaps thought <lb/>
            that the inadmissible charges might be treated as surplusage, and <lb/>
            did not altogether vitiate the plaint. It is remarkable also, that the <lb/>
            speaker insists upon his objection, notwithstanding that it did not <lb/>
            appear on the face of the record, and asks the jury to give him the <lb/>
            benefit of it.</p><pb n="225"/>
            
          <p>As the laws, men of the jury, have allowed a special plea <lb/>
            in bar of the action, where a man sues after having given -a <lb/>
            release and discharge, and as both these have been given to <lb/>
            me by Pantænetus the plaintiff, I have pleaded, as you heard <lb/>
            just now, that the action is not maintainable. I did not <lb/>
            choose to forego this right, or that, when I had proved (among. <lb/>
            other things) that the plaintiff had released me and with­ <lb/>
            drawn his claim, it should be open to him to charge me with <lb/>
            falsehood, and to use the argument, that, if anything of this sort <lb/>
            had taken place, I should have pleaded in bar of his action. <lb/>
            I determined to take my stand before you upon this ground, <lb/>
            and to prove, both that I have never wronged the plaintiff, <lb/>
            and that he sues me contrary to the law. If indeed Pantæ­ <lb/>
            netus had suffered any of the wrongs which he now complains <lb/>
            of, he would clearly have sued me at that period, when the <lb/>
            contract between us took place, as these actions last only for <lb/>
            a month, and we were both in the country,1 and it is usual <lb/>
            with all men to vent their wrath soon after the offence, rather <lb/>
            than after a long interval of time. Since however, without <lb/>
            having sustained any injury, (as I am sure you will all agree, <lb/>
            when you have heard the facts,) but elated by the success of <lb/>
            his action against Euergus, he prefers a groundless and vex­ <lb/>
            atious complaint, the only thing left for me, men of the jury, <lb/>
            is, to prove before you that I have done no wrong, to produce <lb/>
            witnesses confirming my statements, and endeavour to save <lb/>
            myself I shall only make this fair and reasonable request to <lb/>
            you, namely, that you will kindly listen to what I have to <lb/>
            urge in support of my special plea, and give your attention <lb/>
            to the whole case : for, in all the multitude of causes tried at <lb/>
            Athens, I think it will appear that no man ever commenced <lb/>
            so impudent and vexatious a one, as this which the present <lb/>
            plaintiff has ventured to bring into court. I will give you a <lb/>
            history of all the facts from the beginning in the shortest <lb/>
            possible compass.</p>
          <p>Euergus and myself, men of the jury, lent a hundred and <lb/>
            five minas to Pantænetus the plaintiff upon a pit 2 at the <note type="footnote"> 1 I.e. Nicobulus and Euergua. </note><note type="footnote"> 2 '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εργαστήριον</foreign> signifies any factory, workshop, or place of business; <lb/>

             <pb n="226"/>
            works in Maronea and thirty slaves. Of this loan forty-five <lb/>
            minas belonged to me, and a talent to Euergus. The plaintift <lb/>
            (it so happened) owed a talent to Mnesicles of Colyttus, and <lb/>
            forty-five minas to Phileas of Eleusis and Pleistor. Mnesicles <lb/>
            becomes the vendor to us of the mine-pit and the slaves; for <lb/>
            he had bought them for the plaintiff from Telemachus the <lb/>
            former owner; and we then lease them to the plaintiff at a <lb/>
            rent equalling the interest of the money, a hundred and five <lb/>
            drachms a month. And we enter into an agreement, in which <lb/>
            the conditions of the lease were stated, and the plaintiff had <lb/>
            the power of redemption from us within a given period. This <lb/>
            transaction took place in the month of Elaphebolion in the <lb/>
            archonship of Theophilus; after which I set sail immediately <lb/>
            for Pontus, while the plaintiff and Euergus remained at Athens. <lb/>
            What occurred between them during my absence, I am un­ <lb/>
            able to state; for they tell different stories, and the plaintiff <lb/>
            himself'does not keep to his own story, but sometimes says <lb/>
            that he was forcibly ejected from his tenancy by Euergus <lb/>
            contrary to the agreement; sometimes, that he caused him <lb/>
            to be entered as debtor to the state; sometimes he gives <note type="footnote">Eöckh writes thus: </note><note type="footnote"> " The mines at Laurium were worked either by shafts (<foreign xml:lang="grc">φρέατα</foreign>, putei) <lb/>
            or adits (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπόνομοι</foreign>, cumei) ;and by neither of these two modes of working <lb/>
            did they in the time of Xenophon arrive at the termination of the <lb/>
            ore: for the chambering of the mines timber was probably imported <lb/>
            by sea, which according to Pliny was the case also in Spain. Hobhouse <lb/>
            mentions that one or two shafts have been discovered in a small <lb/>
            shrubby plain not far from the sea on the eastern coast; and if the <lb/>
            hole which Chandler saw upon Mount Hymettus was really, as he con­ <lb/>
            jectures, a shaft, it follows that some at least had a considerable width, <lb/>
            for the circular opening was of more than forty feet in diameter; at <lb/>
            the bottom of the hole two narrow passages led into the hill in opposite <lb/>
            directions. It was also the practice, according to Vitruvius, to make <lb/>
            large hollows in the silver-mines. The pillars, which were left standing <lb/>
            for the support of the superjacent mountain, were called <foreign xml:lang="grc">δρμοι</foreign>, and <lb/>
            more commonly <foreign xml:lang="grc">μεσοκρινεῖς</foreign>, as. they at the same time served for the <lb/>
            divisions between the different compartments, or (as they were called) <lb/>
            workshops, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐργαστήριμ</foreign>.) As these pillars contained ore, the proprietors <lb/>
            were tempted by their avarice to remove them, although by law they <lb/>
            were strictly forbidden so to do; in the time of the orator Lycurgus <lb/>
            the wealthy Diphilus was condemned to death for this offence. Tho <lb/>
            opening of new mines was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">καινοτομεῖν, καινοτομία</foreign>, and, on account <lb/>
            of the great expense and risk, few would venture to undertake it. If <lb/>
            the speculator was successful, he was amply remunerated; if unsuccess­ <lb/>
            ful, he incurred all his cost and trouble for nothing." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="227"/>
            Another account, just as it suits him. Euergus simply says <lb/>
            that, as he did not get his interest, and as the plaintiff did <lb/>
            not perform any other part of the agreement, he went and <lb/>
            took what belonged to him from the plaintiff with his con­ <lb/>
            sent ; that the plaintiff went away, and afterwards brought <lb/>
            persons to make a claim to the property; that he (Euergus) <lb/>
            would not relinquish his right to those persons, but did not <lb/>
            object to the plaintiff's holding what he had taken a lease of, <lb/>
            provided he would perform the terms of his contract. Such <lb/>
            are the accounts I get from these men. I am sure however <lb/>
            of this, that, if Pantænetus speaks the truth, and has been <lb/>
            hardly treated, as he says he has been, by Euergus, he has <lb/>
            recovered the sum at which he laid his damages; for he came <lb/>
            into court before you and obtained judgment against him; <lb/>
            and surely he ought not to get compensation for the same <lb/>
            injury as well from the guilty party, as from me, who was not <lb/>
            even in the country. On the other hand, if Euergus speaks the <lb/>
            truth, it would appear that he has been harassed by vexatious <lb/>
            proceedings; yet even in that case I ought not to be sued for <lb/>
            the same matter.</p>
          <p>I will first prove these statements, and produce the witnesses <lb/>
            before you.</p>

          <p>That the same man who had originally purchased this <lb/>
            property was the vendor of it to us—that the plaintiff by <lb/>
            virtue of the agreement became lessee of the mine-pit and the <lb/>
            slaves, they being our property-that I was not present at <lb/>
            the transaction which took place afterwards between Euergus <lb/>
            and the plaintiff, and indeed that I was not even in the <lb/>
            country-that he commenced an action against Euergus, and <lb/>
            never made any complaint against me—all this you hear <lb/>
            from the witnesses, men of the jury. When I returned <lb/>
            home, after having lost almost all that I sailed out with, I <lb/>
            heard, and found it was the fact, that Pantænetus had left <lb/>
            the works,1 and that Euergus had taken absolute possession <lb/>
            of what we had purchased. I was vastly annoyed, seeing <lb/>
            that the thing had come to a pretty pass; for I must either <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφεστηκότα</foreign>. Reiske—" destitisse ab exercendû. officind metallicd." <lb/>

            carry on and manage the business in partnership with <lb/>
            Euergus, or have Euergus for my debtor instead of the <lb/>
            plaintiff, and draw up a new lease and enter into a contract <lb/>
            with him ; and neither of these alternatives was agreeable to <lb/>
            me. Being displeased at the state of things which I tell you <lb/>
            of, and happening to see Mnesicles who had sold us the <lb/>
            property, I went up to him and complained that he had <lb/>
            introduced such a person to me, and I asked him about the <lb/>
            claimants and what it all meant. On hearing this, he laughed <lb/>
            at the claimants, but said they wished to meet and confer <lb/>
            with me, and he himself would bring us together and would <lb/>
            advise the plaintiff to do everything that was right in <lb/>
            regard to me, and he thought he should prevail on him. <lb/>
            When we met—I need not go into particulars—the men <lb/>
            came, who pretended to have lent money to the plaintiff on <lb/>
            the mine-pit and the slaves which we bought from Mnesicles; <lb/>
            and there was nothing straightforward or honest about them. <lb/>
            As all their statements were shown to be false, and Mnesicles <lb/>
            established the fact of our purchase, they give us a challenge, <lb/>
            thinking we should not accept it, proposing that we should <lb/>
            either take all our money from them and withdraw, or pay <lb/>
            them their demands; for (they said) the security which we <lb/>
            held was worth far more than what we had lent. The moment <lb/>
            I heard this proposal, without even taking time for consider­ <lb/>
            ation, I agreed to take my money, and I persuaded Euergus <lb/>
            to do the same. After the thing had gone thus far, and the <lb/>
            time had come for us to receive our money, the persons who <lb/>
            had made that offer said they would not pay it unless we <lb/>
            would be the vendors of the property to them; in this at <lb/>
            least showing some sense, men of Athens; for they saw the <lb/>
            pettifogging tricks which this man was playing us.</p>
          <p>To prove the truth of these statements, please to take <lb/>
            these further depositions.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>When the thing stood in this way, and the persons whom <lb/>
            the plaintiff had introduced would not part with the money, <lb/>
            and it was manifest that we were rightfully in possession of <lb/>
            what we had purchased, he begged, prayed, and entreated us <lb/>
            to become the vendors. As he begged me so strongly, and <lb/>
            was so pressing and urgent, I gave way upon this point also. <lb/>
             <pb n="229"/>
            Seeing however, men of Athens, that he was an ill-conditioned <lb/>
            person—that at first he abused Mnesicles to me, and had <lb/>
            afterwards quarrelled with Euergus, with whom he was on <lb/>
            terms of the closest friendship — that immediately after <lb/>
            my return he pretended to have been glad to see me, but <lb/>
            again, when it became necessary to do what was right, he <lb/>
            lost his temper with me-that he was friendly with all men <lb/>
            until he got some advantage and attained his objects, but <lb/>
            afterwards fell out and was at enmity with them—I required <lb/>
            that, if I withdrew and assumed the character of vendor in <lb/>
            respect of his property, I should come to a final settlement <lb/>
            with him and be discharged and released from all demands. <lb/>
            This being agreed to, the plaintiff gave me a full discharge, <lb/>
            and I, in pursuance of his request, became vendor of the <lb/>
            property, to the same extent as I had myself purchased it <lb/>
            from Mnesicles. Having then got back my money, and <lb/>
            having done not a tittle of wrong to the plaintiff, by the <lb/>
            Gods, I never imagined that, happen what might, he would <lb/>
            bring an action against me.</p>
          <p>These, men of the jury, are the facts, upon which you will <lb/>
            have to give your verdict; these are the circumstances, under <lb/>
            which I have pleaded a special plea in bar of this pettifogging <lb/>
            action. I will produce witnesses, who were present when I <lb/>
            was released and discharged by the plaintiff; and after that <lb/>
            I will show, that the action is by law not maintainable. <lb/>
            Please to read this deposition.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Deposition.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Now read the deposition of the purchasers-to show you <lb/>
            that I sold the things at the plaintiff's request, to the per­ <lb/>
            sons whom he desired.</p>

            <title type="sub">[The Deposition.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Not only are these my witnesses, that I have been released <lb/>
            and am now sued vexatiously; but Pantænetus himself is <lb/>
            my witness also. For, when he brought his action against <lb/>
            Euergus without suing me, he bore witness that he had no <lb/>
            further claim against me; for surely, when the same wrongs <lb/>
            had to be dealt with,1 if he had the like claim against both, <note type="footnote"> 1 Pabst: " wo es sich um gleiche Vergehungen handelte, wenn er <unclear>una</unclear> <lb/>
            Beide wirklich rechtmässig hätte anklagen können." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="230"/>
            he would not have sued the one, and forborne to sue the <lb/>
            other. That the laws allow no fresh actions in cases which <lb/>
            have been thus settled, you are aware, I presume, without <lb/>
            my telling you : however-read them this law.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Law.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>You hear the law, men of the jury, expressly declaring, <lb/>
            that there shall be no further actions in cases where any one <lb/>
            has given a release and discharge. That both these1 have <lb/>
            been effected between the plaintiff and me, you have heard <lb/>
            from the witnesses. In no cases where the laws have for­ <lb/>
            bidden it ought people to sue, but especially not in these. <lb/>
            Of things done by public authority it may be said, that they <lb/>
            have been done unjustly or improperly ; and of the decisions <lb/>
            of a court of justice it may be alleged, that the court was <lb/>
            led into error; and, with respect to the other cases mentioned <lb/>
            in the law, a plausible objection may be raised to every one <lb/>
            of them. But when a man has himself yielded and released <lb/>
            his claim, it does not lie in his mouth surely, to object to his <lb/>
            own act, and charge himself with injustice. People who <lb/>
            sue contrary to any other of these provisions fail to abide <lb/>
            by a settlement which others have made; but he who <lb/>
            commences fresh proceedings for a claim of which he has <lb/>
            given a release, fails to abide by his own settlement. Such <lb/>
            a person therefore deserves the utmost severity.</p>
          <p>I have thus shown you that he released me from all de­ <lb/>
            mands when I became vendor of the slaves ; and the statute <lb/>
            which you have just heard read proves that actions for such <lb/>
            demands are not allowed by the laws. However, that none <note type="footnote"> 1 Pabst says in a note, that, as the Greek words <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφῆκεν</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπήλλαξεν</foreign> <lb/>
            signify nearly the same thing, the meaning must be that " Pantænetus <lb/>
            had not only released him from all demands, but brought an action not. <lb/>
            withstanding." </note><note type="footnote"> He must have forgotten the similar passage in the last oration (orig. <lb/>
            p. 952), where it is manifest that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμφότεα</foreign> relates only to the words <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφῆκεν</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπήλλαξεν</foreign>. The orator there says : a <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῷδε γέγονεν ἀμφότερα·</foreign> <lb/>

            distinct meanings; and there is little or no point in the phrase adopted <lb/>

            take it that Athenian lawyers, like English, occasionally used superfluous <lb/>

            of you, men of Athens, may suppose that I have recourse to <lb/>
            this plea because I have the worst of it on the merits of the <lb/>
            case, I will proceed to show you, that every particular of his <lb/>
            charge against me is false. Read the record of the plaint:</p>

          <p>" Nicobulus hath done me damage, for that he laid a plot <lb/>

            servant to take away from my servant the silver which he <lb/>
            was bringing to be paid to the state for the mine which I <lb/>
            purchased for ninety minas,l and for that he caused me to be <lb/>
            registered as debtor to the treasury for double the amount."</p>
          <p>Stop. All these charges, which he has now preferred <lb/>
            against me, he made before against Euergus and got judgment <lb/>
            in the cause. It has been proved to you in evidence at the <lb/>
            commencement of my address, that I was out of the country <lb/>
            when the quarrel took place between these men ; however, it <lb/>
            is apparent also from this plaint. For he has nowhere stated, <lb/>
            that I have done any of these things, but, after premising <lb/>
            that I laid a plot against him and his property, he says that <lb/>
            I ordered my slave to do these acts, which is false; for how <lb/>
            could I give such an order, when at the time that I sailed <lb/>
            from Athens I could not possibly have any knowledge of <lb/>
            what was going to take place here ? Besides, what an absurdity <lb/>
            it is, when he says that I laid a plot to disfranchise him and <lb/>
            bring him to ruin, to have declared that I ordered a servant <lb/>
            to do things which even a citizen would not venture to do to <lb/>
            another citizen ! What then is the meaning of this ? I take <lb/>
            it that, having no means of fastening any of these things on <lb/>
            me on account of my absence abroad, as he wished to go on <lb/>
            with his pettifogging action, he inserted a charge that I gave <lb/>
            the order; for there was not the shadow of a case, if he had <lb/>
            not done this. Read the next clause.</p>

          <p>" And for that, after I had incurred the penalty to the state, <lb/>
            he placed Antigenes his servant in my pit near Thrasyllus <note type="footnote"> 1 This was most probably (as Böckh supposes) the premium or <lb/>
            purchase-money for the mine. But Böckh is in error when he says <lb/>

            from Telemachus, who had probably just taken his lease from the <lb/>
            State, and the premium was not paid till after the transfer, and some <lb/>

            him to do so."</p>
          <p>Stop. All this likewise will be shown by the facts of the <lb/>
            case to be a fabrication. He has declared that I placed the <lb/>
            servant and he forbade me. This is impossible, when I was <lb/>
            not in the country. Neither did I place any one, when I <lb/>
            was in Pontus, nor did he forbid me, when I was not in the <lb/>
            country. It is impossible. What drove him then to the <lb/>
            necessity of thus declaring ? I imagine that Euergus, when <lb/>
            he was committing those trespasses for which he has given <lb/>
            satisfaction, being on friendly and intimate terms with me, <lb/>
            took my servant from my house, and placed him at his <lb/>
            own works to keep guard. If then the plaintiff had inserted <lb/>
            the truth in his plaint, it would have been ridiculous; for <lb/>
            how do I wrong you because Euergus placed the servant <lb/>
            there ? To avoid this difficulty, he has been compelled to <lb/>

            which it was mixed in small proportions; and the early Athenians had <lb/>
            so slight a knowledge of the working of ore, that not only was that <lb/>
            which had been thrown away as useless stone subsequently used, but <lb/>
            the old scoriae were again employed for the purpose of extracting <lb/>
            silver. According to Pliny, the ancients could not smelt any silver <lb/>
            without some mixture of lead; he appears however only to mean ore <lb/>
            in which the silver was combined with some other metal to which it <lb/>
            has a less powerful affinity than to lead. At Laurium it was not neces­ <lb/>
            sary in general to add any lead, it being already present in the ores. <lb/>
            Pliny states the manner in which argentiferous lead-ores were treated, <lb/>
            and there can bo no doubt this was the method adopted in Attics. <lb/>
            The ore was first melted down to stannum, a composition of pure silver </note> <pb n="233"/>

            of it is manifest, not only from my challenging him to deliver <lb/>
            up those servants and his refusal to deliver them, but from <lb/>
            every circumstance in the case. For what purpose did I per­ <lb/>
            suade them ? Perhaps, that I might get them into my own <lb/>
            service. But, when the option was given me either to have <lb/>
            them or to receive back my own money, I preferred to receive <note type="footnote"> and lead; then this material was brought to the refining oven, where <lb/>
            the silver was separated, and the lead appeared half glazed in the form <lb/>
            of litharge, which, as well as grey lead, the ancients called galena and <lb/>
            molybdaena: this last substance was afterwards cooled, and the lead was <lb/>

            of the flower of copper. For, when copper has been smelted, and the <lb/>

            by this means an efflorescence is formed upon the surface of the metallic <lb/>
            cake, which was called the flower of copper. This process is the same <lb/>
            in reference to copper as that of which Harpocration speaks in refer­ <lb/>
            ence to silver; and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κέγχρος</foreign> produced in the silver foundries must <lb/>
            have been an efflorescence, in shape like the pod of a vegetable, arising <lb/>
            from the cake of silver. In the last stage of the refining of copper, <lb/>
            particularly of the inferior kinds, something similar is formed according <lb/>
            to the process now in use. It is probable therefore that this <foreign xml:lang="grc">κεγχρὼν</foreign> <lb/>
            at Laurium was the foundry where the silver which had been already <lb/>
            fused was refined : the impurity detached in this stage was called <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κέγχρος</foreign>, and perhaps consisted chiefly of glazed lead; and here the <lb/>

            with the plaint. <note type="footnote"> 1 The ore from which the silver was obtained is generally called <lb/>
            silver earth (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀργυρῖτις γῆ</foreign> or simply <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀργυρῖτις</foreign>) ; but, that by this we are <lb/>
            not to understand soft earth, may be collected from an expression of <lb/>
            Xenophon, who says that the enemy could make no more use of the <lb/>
            ores from these mines than of stones. The word earth in Greek is of <lb/>
            very general application, and may include ores even of solid stone; the <lb/>
            Romans also applied the same term to silver ore. The quality of the <lb/>
            ore in the mines of Laurium is nowhere expressly stated; it is possible <lb/>
            however to throw some light upon the subject by a few incidental <lb/>
            accounts. As the works of Laurium are always called silver-mines, and <lb/>
            as neither lead, copper, nor any other mineral is ever mentioned, it is <lb/>
            evident that in early times at least they must have afforded ores ex­ <lb/>
            tremely abundant in silver, more particularly as the ancients, from their <lb/>
            imperfect knowledge of chemistry, could not make use of ores in which <lb/>
            the proportion of silver was inconsiderable. This is also proved by the <lb/>
            fact of the ore being called silver earth, and not lead or copper earth. <lb/>
            Mines of the precious metals are usually more productive near to the <lb/>
            surface of the soil than at a greater depth, and the quantity of silver <lb/>
            contained in many ores diminishes in proportion as they recede from <lb/>
            the surface; therefore, when the mining penetrated farther into the <lb/>
            interior of the mountain, it is not impossible that they met with ores <lb/>
            of inferior quality; which partly explains the diminution in the profit <lb/>
            already alluded to. The ore of these mines appears moreover to have <lb/>
            occurred for the most part in thick layers, since otherwise the whole <lb/>
            mountain would not have been so far excavated that nothing was left <lb/>
            but supports for the purpose of safety; whereas ores, in which the <lb/>
            silver composes the larger part of the substance, usually occur in veins. <lb/>
            Other less distinct traces would seem to prove that a considerable part <lb/>
            of the ore was lead-ore containing a portion of silver. </note> <pb n="235"/>

          <p>This statute has clearly defined in what cases a mining <lb/>
            action is the appropriate remedy. Let us see. The statute <lb/>
            makes a man liable, who ejects another from his occupation : <lb/>
            but I, so far from ejecting the plaintiff, put him in the pos­ <lb/>
            session and dominion of that, which another person was de­ <lb/>
            priving him of, and I became the vendor of it at his request. <lb/>
            Yes—says he-but actions lie in other cases where injuries <lb/>
            are done concerning mines. Quite right, Pantænetus : but <lb/>
            what are those cases? Where a man fills your pit with <lb/>
            smoke2—where he attacks you with arms in hand-where <lb/>
            he perforates within your boundaries. These are the other <note type="footnote"> 1 Auger—" on ne poun-a effacer de vos esprits lea idées de justice <lb/>

            cases; but surely I have done nothing of this sort to you <lb/>
            and yours, unless you regard people who get back the money <lb/>
            which they have rashly lent you as making an armed attack. <lb/>
            If that is your belief, you have a mining action against every­ <lb/>
            body who parts with his money to you. But that is hardly <lb/>
            just. For example-shall any man who purchases a mine <lb/>
            from the state be allowed to sue in a mining court, disre­ <lb/>
            garding the general laws, according to which all people are <lb/>
            bound both to render and to obtain justice ? How, if one <lb/>
            man borrows money from another ? How, if a man be slan­ <lb/>
            dered ? if he receives blows ? if he makes a charge of theft ? <lb/>
            if he does not get back an advance for property-tax ? if any­ <lb/>
            thing else, in short, should occur ? shall he sue in the mining <lb/>
            court ? I hardly think so. I take it that mining actions lie <lb/>
            against persons who have shares in mines,1 persons who bore <lb/>
            through a strange mine, and get into their neighbours' boun­ <lb/>
            daries ; and generally, against persons engaged in mining <lb/>
            operations, who do any of the things mentioned in the statute: <lb/>
            but a man who has lent money to Pantænetus, and has had <lb/>
            the utmost difficulty and trouble to get it back from him, is <lb/>
            not to have the further infliction of being made defendant <lb/>
            in a mining cause ; most decidedly not.</p>
          <p>That I have done no wrong to the plaintiff, and that the <lb/>
            action by the laws is not maintainable, is easy to be seen <lb/>
            from what I have already stated. As the plaintiff had no <lb/>
            ground whatever to support his charges, as he had inserted <lb/>
            falsehoods in his plaint, and was suing for claims of which he <lb/>
            had given a release, last month, men of Athens, when I was <lb/>
            about to come into court, just as the jurors had been assigned <lb/>
            by lot, he came up and surrounded me with his friends, (the <lb/>
            gang of persons who are in league with him,) and does a most <lb/>
            atrocious thing.2 He reads to me a long challenge, requiring <note type="footnote"> I Böckh supposes the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">κοινωνοῦσ</foreign>, to designate partners in mines. <lb/>
            And so Pabst translates it—"welche gomeinschaftlich Bergwerke be­ <lb/>
            sitzen." I am not clear that it means anything more than " concerned in <lb/>
            mines or mining business." </note><note type="footnote"> 2 The defendant complains that the following trick was played him by <lb/>
            his adversary. Just before the trial was coming on, Pantænetus, the <lb/>
            plaintiff, brings him a challenge, drawn up in writing in the usual way, <lb/>
            and reads it out, but does not show it to him. The terms which it <lb/>
            proposed were, that the defendant shouldof give up a slave to the torture; <lb/>
            that, if the slave admitted the truth the plaintiff's assertions, the </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="238"/>
            that a certain slave, who, he said, was acquainted with the <lb/>
            facts, should be put to the question, and that, if the facts <lb/>
            which he alleged were true, I should be bound to pay him his <lb/>
            damages without assessment; if they were false, the questioner, <lb/>
            Mnesicles, should estimate the value of the slave. After he <lb/>
            had received sureties to the agreement from me, and after I <lb/>
            had sealed the challenge—(not that I thought it was fair; for <lb/>
            how could it be fair, that upon the body and life of a servant <lb/>
            it should depend, whether I should be condemned to pay two <lb/>
            talents, or the pettifogging plaintiff escape with impunity! <lb/>
            but I, desiring to prevail by a great preponderance of justice, <lb/>
            gave my consent)—after that, he summons me in the action <lb/>
            again, as soon as he had taken back the deposits ; 1 making it <lb/>
            thus plain at the outset, that he would not abide even by <lb/>
            terms of his own arranging. When we had come before the <lb/>
            questioner, instead of opening the challenge, showing the <note type="footnote"> defendant should pay the two talents, the damages laid in the plaint; if <lb/>
            not, he (the plaintiff) would pay for the injury done to the slave, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to the valuation of Mnesicles, who was to apply the torture and <lb/>
            superintend the examination. Nicobulus accepted this challenge, dis­ <lb/>
            advantageous as it was for him; seals the paper containing the terms, <lb/>
            which thus became an agreement between the parties; and gave <lb/>
            sureties (as was usual) for its performance. Notwithstanding this, the <lb/>
            plaintiff immediately gives him a new summons in an action, apparently <lb/>
            for the same cause, and in violation of the agreement, which had put <lb/>
            an end to the original action; for the whole cause was staked upon <lb/>
            the questioning of the slave. This was the beginning of the fraud. <lb/>
            Afterwards, when they went before Mnesicles to examine the slave, <lb/>
            Pantænetus produces a challenge containing different terms from those <lb/>
            which he had read to the defendant; different at least in this respect, <lb/>
            that it authorised the plaintiff himself to apply the torture, instead of <lb/>
            Mnesicles. He had been enabled to play this trick by the hurry and <lb/>

            and misbehaved himself most grossly. And I reflected in my <lb/>
            own mind, men of the jury, what an immense advantage it is <lb/>
            to intimidate people by your style of conduct.2 For it seemed <lb/>
            to me, that I was suffering these indignities because I lived <lb/>
            in a plain and straightforward manner, and that I was paying <lb/>
            an enormous penalty for submitting to such treatment. <lb/>
            However, as I should have been compelled, contrary to my <lb/>
            views of propriety, to give a counter-challenge, I offered even <lb/>
            to deliver up the slave.</p>

          <p>I wish to explain to you the trick by which he misled the <lb/>
            former jury and obtained his verdict against Euergus, that <note type="footnote"> 1 The ring was for sealing the challenge; not for a pledge, as Hudt­ <lb/>

            you may. see he'll not stick at any sort of falsehood or impu­ <lb/>
            dence on the present occasion. Besides, you will find that <lb/>
            the causes of action for which he now sues me have the same <lb/>
            justification; which is the clearest proof, that Euergus has <lb/>
            on the former occasion been the victim of fraud. The plain­ <lb/>
            tiff, in addition to the rest of his charges, alleged that Euergus <lb/>
            came to his house in the country and intruded into the <lb/>
            apartments of his daughters (who were heiresses) and his <lb/>
            mother; and he brought the laws concerning heiresses to the <lb/>
            court. Not to this day has he ever appeared before the <lb/>
            Archon, whom the laws appoint to attend to such matters, <lb/>
            and before whom the offender is in peril either of corporal <lb/>
            punishment or pecuniary fine, while the prosecutor seeks <lb/>
            redress without any risk to himself; nor has he impeached <lb/>
            either me or Euergus of any offence of this kind, but he made <lb/>
            the accusation in court and got a verdict for two talents. <lb/>
            It would have been easy, I take it, for Euergus, had he <lb/>
            been aware beforehand (as by the laws he should have been) <lb/>
            of the charge on which he was tried, to show the real justice <lb/>
            of the case and obtain an acquittal; but in a mining cause, <lb/>
            when accused of things which he could never have expected, <lb/>
            it was difficult on the spur of the moment to clear himself of <lb/>
            ihe calumny; and the indignation of the jurors, who were <lb/>
            deceived by the plaintiff, found him guilty of the charge upon <lb/>
            which they sat in judgment. Do you suppose that the man <lb/>
            who deceived those jurors will hesitate to deceive you ?—or <lb/>
            that he comes into court relying upon the facts, and not <lb/>
            rather upon his words and the witnesses who are leagued <lb/>
            with him, (that dirty blackguard Procles, the tall fellow, and <lb/>
            Stratocles, that most smooth-tongued and basest of mankind.) <lb/>
            and on the whining face and the tears that he can assume so <lb/>
            recklessly and so impudently ? You, however, are so far from <lb/>
            deserving any compassion, that you ought above all men to <lb/>
            be detested for your proceedings—you who, after owing a <lb/>
            hundred and five minas and not being able to pay the money, <lb/>
            and then finding persons to lend it and enable you to satisfy <lb/>
            your original creditors, have not only broken your engage­ <lb/>
            ments to them in relation to the loan itself, but seek even to <lb/>
            deprive them of their civic franchise ! In general, one may <lb/>
            observe the borrowers of money giving up their property: in <lb/>
            your case the creditor is in this condition; having lent a <lb/>
             <pb n="241"/>
            talent, he has been condemned to pay two talents at the suit <lb/>
            of a pettifogger. And I, who have lent forty minas, am <lb/>
            defendant in this action for two talents. And upon a pro­ <lb/>
            perty, on which you have never been able to borrow more <lb/>
            than a hundred minas, and which you have sold out and out <lb/>
            for three talents and twenty minas, you have sustained <lb/>
            damage, as it appears, to the amount of four talents. From <lb/>
            whom ? From my servant! that's what he means to say! <lb/>
            Why, what citizen would give up possession of his property <lb/>
            to a servant ? Who would contend that my slave ought to <lb/>
            be responsible for acts, for which the plaintiff has brought an <lb/>
            action against Euergus and obtained a verdict ? And besides <lb/>
            -the plaintiff has himself released him from all charges of <lb/>
            this kind. For the proper course was, not to bring such <lb/>
            charges forward now, nor to insert them in the challenge in <lb/>
            which he demanded him for the torture, but to commence <lb/>
            the action against him and carry it on against me as his <lb/>
            guardian.1 As it is, he has commenced the action against me, <lb/>
            and accuses the slave. The laws however do not allow this; for <lb/>
            who ever commenced an action against the master, and charged <lb/>
            the facts against the slave, as if he were his own guardian ?</p>
          <p>When any one asks him—" What case shall you be able to <lb/>
            make out against Nicobulus?"—he says, " The Athenians hate <lb/>
            money-lenders; Nicobulus is an odious person ; he walks <lb/>
            fast, talks loud, and carries a stick: all these things" (says <lb/>
            he) " are in my favour." And he is not ashamed to talk in <lb/>
            this style, and imagines his hearers don't understand that this <lb/>
            is the reasoning not of an injured party, but of a false accuser. <lb/>
            For my part, 1 don't look upon a money-lender as a wrong­ <lb/>
            doer, though I think you may fairly regard with displeasure <lb/>
            certain persons of that class, who make a trade of it, and who <lb/>
            care neither for humanity nor anything else but the lust of <lb/>
            gain. For, as I have often borrowed money as well as lent it <note type="footnote"> 1 For what the slave did by command of his master, of course the <lb/>
            master would be responsible in his own name. For what the slave did <lb/>
            without such authority, Demosthenes says he ought to be sued in <lb/>
            his own name, though the master would have to be joined as his <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">κύριο</foreign>s, that is, his guardian and representative in law. We have but <lb/>
            tittle information on this point, and cannot be certain whether De­ <lb/>
            mosthenes states the law correctly, or whether, supposing him to state <lb/>
            it correctly, the point is a technical or a substantial one. The reader <lb/>
            may refer to what is said by Schömann in the Attic Process, page 572. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> B </note> <lb/>

            to the plaintiff, I am myself not ignorant of that class of <lb/>
            people, and I don't much like them; at the same time I <lb/>
            never defraud nor bring vexatious actions against them. I <lb/>
            cannot see however why a man who has traded as I have, <lb/>
            going to sea and incurring risk, and who has lent at interest <lb/>
            his small profits, in order to accommodate his friends, and <lb/>
            that his money may not be imperceptibly frittered away, <lb/>
            should be set down as belonging to that class: unless you, <lb/>
            Pantænetus, contend, that whoever lends money to you ought <lb/>
            to incur the detestation of the public.</p>
          <p>Please now to read the depositions, and let the jury see <lb/>
            what sort of a person I am to those who lend me money and <lb/>
            to those who ask my assistance.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Depositions.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Such is the character which I, the fast walker, bear; and <lb/>
            such is yours, Pantænetus, Who walk gently. However, with <lb/>
            respect to my gait or my address, men of the jury, I will <lb/>
            speak the whole truth to you unreservedly. I am fully <lb/>
            sensible-it has not escaped me—that I am not one of a class <lb/>
            who are favoured by nature in these respects, and possess <lb/>
            qualities advantageous to themselves. If I annoy people by <lb/>
            doing what is of no use to myself, it is a misfortune, as far as <lb/>
            it goes, undoubtedly. But what is to be the consequence ? <lb/>
            If I lend money to this or that person, must I be sentenced <lb/>
            to a penalty for it, in addition to my other loss ? Heaven <lb/>
            forbid! The plaintiff cannot show that there is anything <lb/>
            base or vicious about me; and among you all there is not <lb/>
            one who knows anything of the sort against me. As to these <lb/>
            external qualities, each of us, I imagine, is as nature happened <lb/>
            to make him; and it is hard to contend with nature, when <lb/>
            one has these defects, (or there would be no difference between <lb/>
            man and man,) though it is easy enough to remark and cri­ <lb/>
            ticise them in another. But what has all this to do with our <lb/>
            dispute, Pantænetus ? You have sustained many cruel in­ <lb/>
            juries. Well; you have had satisfaction. Not from me ? <lb/>
            No; for I did you no wrong: otherwise you would never <lb/>
            have released me, nor forborne to sue me when you deter­ <lb/>
            mined on commencing proceedings against Euergus, nor re­ <lb/>
            quested the man who had so cruelly and grievously wronged <lb/>
            you to take on himself the character of vendor. And besides, <lb/>
             <pb n="243"/>
            how is it possible that I, who was not present and not in the <lb/>
            country, can have done injury to you ?</p>
          <p>But let it be granted to him, that he has sustained the <lb/>
            utmost possible injustice, and that all his present allegations <lb/>
            are true-this, I presume, you will all acknowledge, that <lb/>
            other people have suffered wrongs before now, of a more <lb/>
            grievous nature than pecuniary wrongs; (for example, unin­ <lb/>
            tentional homicides, and outrages on what is sacred, and <lb/>
            many similar things, are perpetrated;) yet in all these cases <lb/>
            the injured parties are finally and conclusively barred, when <lb/>
            they have come to a settlement and given a release And <lb/>
            this rule of justice is so universally binding, that, when a man <lb/>
            has convicted another of intentional homicide and clearly <lb/>
            proved him to be tainted with pollution, yet, if he afterwards <lb/>
            condones the crime and releases him, he is no longer entitled <lb/>
            to force the same person into exile. Nor again, where the <lb/>
            murdered man has released his murderer before he died, is it <lb/>
            lawful for any of the relations to prosecute; but those whom <lb/>
            the laws sentence, upon conviction, to banishment and exile <lb/>
            and death, if they have been released, are by that word <lb/>
            " release" at once absolved from all penal consequences. <lb/>
            Then upon questions of life and all that is most precious <lb/>
            shall a release be valid and binding, but on questions of <lb/>
            money and claims of minor importance shall it be of no <lb/>
            effect ? Surely you will never allow this ! The worst would <lb/>
            be, not my failing to obtain justice before you, but your <lb/>
            abolishing in our time a sound rule of practice, established <lb/>
            ages ago.</p>

          <p>ARISTÆCHMUS, one of the guardians of Nausimachus and Xenopithes, <lb/>
            was sued by them, after they attained their majority, for rendering <lb/>
            a false account and breach of his trust. He compromised the dispute <lb/>
            with his wards for three talents, and received from them a release. <lb/>
            Soon after this he died. Fourteen years afterwards the wards made <lb/>
            a claim upon his four sons, alleging (as it would seem) that the <lb/>
            release did not extend to such part of their estate as was received <lb/>
            subsequently to the compromise, and that certain outstanding debts <lb/>
            had been subsequently got in by Aristæchmus, or by the person <lb/>
            whom he left to be guardian of his children. The total sum <lb/>
            claimed from the four children was four talents ; but, in commencing <note type="footnote"> R 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="244"/>
            legal proceedings, this demand was split by the claimants into eight, <lb/>
            each of them bringing an action against each of their guardian's sons <lb/>
            for thirty minas. The particular claim, which forms the subject of <lb/>
            the present action, appears to have been a debt of one hundred <lb/>
            staters, alleged to have been paid by a person in Bosporus, and <lb/>
            which, together with the interest, might be estimated as equivalent <lb/>
            to thirty minas. This view of the matter does not agree with that <lb/>
            which is taken by Reiske and Schäfer; as the reader will see from <lb/>
            the first of my notes to the oration.</p>
          <p>Of the circumstances of the case we have but a meagre account; as <lb/>
            the defendant, for whom this present speech was composed, relies <lb/>
            mainly upon his special pleas, setting up 1, the release given to his <lb/>
            father; 2, the statute of limitations. He shows however some <lb/>
            reasons for inferring, that no part of the ward's estate had been got <lb/>
            in by his father or guardian after the compromise, and that the <lb/>
            demand is altogether unfounded and vexatious.</p>
          <p>As the laws, men of the jury, have allowed a special plea, <lb/>
            where a man sues after having given a release and discharge, <lb/>
            and as my father has had both of these from Nausimachus <lb/>
            and Xenopithes, who have commenced proceedings against us, <lb/>
            we have pleaded, as you heard just now, that the action is <lb/>
            not maintainable. I shall ask of you all what is just and <lb/>
            reasonable ; first, that you will give me a fair hearing; se­ <lb/>
            condly, if you think that I am wronged and made defendant <lb/>
            in an unfounded action, that you will give me the support <lb/>
            which I am entitled to.</p>
          <p>The damages laid in the action are, as you have heard, <lb/>
            thirty minas; but the sum for which we are actually sued is <lb/>
            four talents. For, there being two of them, they have com­ <lb/>
            menced four actions against us, all for the same amount, each <lb/>
            for three thousand drachms damages: and now, upon a <lb/>
            nominal demand (in the plaint) of thirty minas, we are <lb/>
            brought to trial for that large sum of money.1 <note type="footnote"> 1 Reiske's explanation of this, (which, strange to say, has been <lb/>

            pleaded our plea in bar of the action. Please to read these <lb/>

          <p>That they commenced actions against their guardian for <lb/>
            breach of duty, and that they released those actions, and <lb/>
            have received the sums of money agreed upon, you hear, men <lb/>
            of the jury, from the witnesses. That the laws do not allow <lb/>
            people to sue over again for matters which have been thus <lb/>
            settled, I take it, you are all aware without my telling you; <lb/>
            however, I should like to read you the statute itself. Read <lb/>
            the law.</p>

          <p>You hear the law, men of the jury, plainly declaring the <lb/>
            several cases in which there shall be no actions. One of them <lb/>
            (quite as obligatory as the rest) is, that no man shall sue for <lb/>
            claims of which he has given a release and discharge. Yet, <lb/>
            although the release has been thus given in the presence of <lb/>
            divers witnesses, and although the law plainly absolves us, <note type="footnote"> fratres instituebant, et litem unicuique praeterea semitalenta aesti­ <lb/>

            commentators not having observed, what is undoubtedly to be col­ <lb/>
            lected from the text of Demosthenes, that each of the sons of Nausi­ <lb/>
            crates brought an action against each of the sons of Aristæchmus; <lb/>
            making eight actions in all, and not four, as Reiske supposes. That this <lb/>
            is so, is indeed apparent from the passage now before us; but is made <lb/>
            abundantly clear by the words of the record cited in page 988—<foreign xml:lang="grc">παρα­ <lb/>

            these men have arrived at such a pitch of impudence and <lb/>
            audacity, that after the lapse of fourteen years from the time <lb/>
            when they released our father, and twenty-two years from <lb/>
            the commencement of the proceedings against him,1 and after <lb/>
            the death of our father, with whom they made the compromise, <lb/>
            of the guardians, who after his death had the management <lb/>
            of our property, of their own mother, who was acquainted <lb/>
            with all these particulars, of arbitrators and witnesses and (I <lb/>
            may say) almost everybody, looking on our inexperience and <lb/>
            necessary ignorance of the facts as a godsend for themselves, <lb/>
            they commenced these actions against us, and dare to make <lb/>
            an assertion which is neither true nor honest. They say <lb/>
            that they did not sell their patrimony for the money which <lb/>
            they received, nor did they give up their estate, but that all <lb/>
            the debts and furniture, and indeed all the money that was <lb/>
            left to them, is still theirs. I know by report, that Xeno­ <lb/>
            pithes2 and Nausicrates3 left their whole property in out­ <lb/>
            standing debts, and possessed very little tangible property; <lb/>
            and that, after the debts had been got in, and a few articles <lb/>
            of furniture and some slaves had been sold, their guardians <lb/>
            purchased the lands and lodging-houses, which these men <lb/>
            received from them. If there had been no dispute about <lb/>
            these matters before, if there had been no legal proceedings <lb/>
            for mal-administration of this property, it would have been a <lb/>
            different case : but as these men charged our father with <lb/>
            general breach of his guardianship trust, and, after taking <lb/>
            legal proceedings upon such charge, recovered compensation, <lb/>
            all these matters have been released. For of course these <lb/>
            men did not prosecute their actions for the mere name of <lb/>
            " breach of trust," but for the money; nor did the guardians <lb/>
            buy off the name only, but the claims, for the money which <lb/>
            they paid.</p>
          <p>That for not a particle of the debts which my father got in <lb/>
            before the discharge, or (in short) of the money which he <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">γεγραμμένοι</foreign>-Reiske—"patrem male gestœ tutelœ detulerunt ad <lb/>

            received under the guardianship, have these men a right of <lb/>
            action against us, after having withdrawn from their claims, <lb/>
            I think you have all clearly learned from the laws themselves <lb/>
            and the release. That the sums in question could never have <lb/>
            been collected afterwards, (for that is the fabrication by which <lb/>
            they seek to mislead you,) I will proceed to prove. They <lb/>
            will hardly venture to allege that my father received them; <lb/>
            for he died three or four months after his arrangement with <lb/>
            my opponents : and I will show that it is impossible for the <lb/>
            money to have been received by Demaretus, our testamentary <lb/>
            guardian ; (for his name also they have inserted in the plaint.) <lb/>
            Our strongest witnesses are the complainants; for it will <lb/>
            appear that they have never brought an action against Dema­ <lb/>
            retus in his lifetime: but, independently of that, any one who <lb/>
            looks attentively at the case itself will see, not only that <lb/>
            Demaretus never received the money, but that it is impossible <lb/>
            he ever should have received it. For the debt was in Bos­ <lb/>
            porus ; and Demaretus never went to that place; how then <lb/>
            could he have got it paid ? It may be said perhaps, he sent <lb/>
            some one to collect it. Just look at the matter in this way- <lb/>
            Hermonax owed these men a hundred staters, which he had <lb/>
            received from Nausicrates. Aristeechmus was their guardian <lb/>
            and curator for sixteen years. Well then; the debt which <lb/>
            Hermonax paid with his own hand after these men had <lb/>
            attained their majority, he did not discharge when they were <lb/>
            minors; for of course he did not pay the same money twice. <lb/>
            Now would any man be so foolish as voluntarily to pay a debt <lb/>
            (upon a demand by letter) to a person not entitled to it, <lb/>
            after having for so long a period evaded payment to the <lb/>
            rightful owners ? I should hardly think so.</p>
          <p>To prove the truth of these statements-that our father <lb/>
            died immediately after the arrangement-that our opponents <lb/>
            never brought an action against Demaretus for this money­ <lb/>
            and that Demaretus did not go at all to sea and never made <lb/>
            a voyage to Bosporus—take the depositions.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[ The. Depositions. ]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>It has thus been made clear to you from the dates and the <lb/>
            depositions, that our father did not get payment after the <lb/>
            release-that no one would have paid the money voluntarily, <lb/>
            if Demaretus had sent a person out for it--and that he was <lb/>
             <pb n="248"/>
            not likely to make a voyage or go to Bosporus. I wish now <lb/>
            to show you, that their whole statement of the case is a false­ <lb/>
            hood. They have inserted in the plaint which they are now <lb/>
            prosecuting, that we owe the money, inasmuch as our father <lb/>
            received payment of it and passed it over to them as an out­ <lb/>
            standing debt in his guardianship account. Take the record, <lb/>
            if you please, and read it.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Plaint.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>You hear it stated in the plaint—" inasmuch as Aristæch­ <lb/>
            mus passed the debt over to me in his guardianship account." <lb/>
            But, when they brought an action against my father for breach <lb/>
            of his trust as guardian, they stated the contrary to this; for <lb/>
            they treated him as not having rendered an account, and <lb/>
            made that specific charge. Read the plaint in the action <lb/>
            which they then brought against my father.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Plaint.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>In what account do you charge that he gave up the debt <lb/>
            to you, Xenopithes and Nausimachus ? For at one time you <lb/>
            brought actions against him and demanded money, on the <lb/>
            ground that he refused to render an account: at another time <lb/>
            you sue on the plea that he handed over something to you. <lb/>
            If you may bring your pettifogging actions on both grounds, <lb/>
            first demanding compensation because he did not give some­ <lb/>
            thing up to you, and then suing because he did give it up, <lb/>
            there's nothing to prevent your looking out hereafter for <lb/>
            some third ground, to commence fresh proceedings upon. <lb/>
            But the laws do not allow this: they say, that actions shall <lb/>
            only be brought once against the same party for the same <lb/>
            cause.</p>
          <p>To show you, men of the jury, that they have not only <lb/>
            sustained no wrong on the present occasion, but are suing us <lb/>
            contrary to all the laws, I will cite to you also this statute, <lb/>
            which expressly declares, that, if five years have elapsed, and <lb/>
            the orphans have brought no action, their right of action for <lb/>
            all claims arising out of the guardianship shall be barred. He <lb/>
            shall read you this law.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Law.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>You hear the law, men of the jury, declaring positively <lb/>
            that, if they bring no action within five years, their right of <lb/>
             <pb n="249"/>
            action shall be barred. Well, we commenced an action; they <lb/>
            may say. Yes, and you settled it too : therefore you have no <lb/>
            right to take any further proceedings. It would indeed be <lb/>
            monstrous, when for the original injury the law does not <lb/>
            allow actions to be brought after five years by orphans against <lb/>
            their unrel eased guardians, that you should now in the twen­ <lb/>
            tieth year maintain an action against us, the children of your <lb/>
            guardians, for matters upon which you gave them a release.</p>
          <p>I hear however, that they will avoid all argument upon <lb/>
            the laws or the facts of the case, but are prepared to assert, <lb/>
            that a large property was left them and they were defrauded <lb/>
            of it; and for proof of this they will refer to the magnitude <lb/>
            of the damages claimed in their original suit, and will deplore <lb/>
            their orphan state, and go through the details of the guard­ <lb/>
            ianship accounts : these and such as these are the points on <lb/>
            which they rely, and by means of which they think to impose <lb/>
            on you. For my part, I think that the magnitude of the <lb/>
            damages claimed in those actions is a stronger proof for us, <lb/>
            that our father was sued vexatiously, than for them, that <lb/>
            they were defrauded of a large property. For no one, if he <lb/>
            could establish a claim for eighty talents, would have taken <lb/>
            three talents to withdraw ; but any guardian, defending an <lb/>
            action for such heavy damages for breach of trust, would <lb/>
            have given three talents, to buy off the risk and the natural <lb/>
            advantages which then belonged to these men. For they <lb/>
            were orphans and young, and their characters were unknown; <lb/>
            things that with you, as every one says, outweigh a multi­ <lb/>
            tude of arguments.</p>
          <p>I think also I can show, that you ought not to listen to a <lb/>
            word from them on the subject of the trust. For let it be <lb/>
            conceded to them, that they have sustained the utmost pos­ <lb/>
            sible injustice, and that all their present allegations are true <lb/>
            - this, I presume, you will all acknowledge, that other people <lb/>
            have suffered wrongs before now, of a more grievous nature <lb/>
            than pecuniary wrongs; (for example, unintentional homi­ <lb/>
            cides, and profane outrages, and many similar offences, are <lb/>
            perpetrated;) yet in all these oases the injured parties are <lb/>
            finally and conclusively barred, when they have come to a <lb/>
            settlement and given a release. And this rule of justice is <lb/>
            so universally binding, that, when a man has convicted <lb/>
            another of intentional homicide, and clearly proved him to <lb/>
             <pb n="250"/>
            be tainted with pollution, yet, if he afterwards condones the <lb/>
            crime and releases him, he has no longer the right. to force <lb/>
            the same person into exile. Nor again, where the murdered <lb/>
            man has released his murderer before he died, is it lawful for <lb/>
            any of the relations to prosecute; but those whom the laws <lb/>
            sentence, upon conviction, to banishment and exile and <lb/>
            death, if they have been released, are by that word " release " <lb/>
            at once absolved from all penal consequences. Then, upon <lb/>
            questions of life and all that is most precious shall a release <lb/>
            be valid and binding, but on questions of money and claims <lb/>
            of minor importance shall it be of no effect ? Surely you <lb/>
            will never allow this. The worst part of it would be, not <lb/>
            that I should fail to obtain justice before your tribunals, but <lb/>
            that. a sound rule of practice, established time out of mind, <lb/>
            would now be abolished.</p>
          <p>" They did not let our property -perhaps our opponents <lb/>
            will say. No ; because your uncle Xenopithes did not wish <lb/>
            it let, but, after the prosecution had been instituted by <lb/>
            Nicidas,l persuaded the jury to allow him to manage it, as <lb/>
            everybody knows. " The guardians plundered us grossly." <lb/>
            Well; you have received from them the compensation which <lb/>
            you agreed to take; and surely you are not to get it <lb/>
            again from me. But, that you may not suppose for a mo­ <lb/>
            ment, men of the jury, that there is anything in the point- <lb/>
            although it is manifestly inequitable that, after having settled <lb/>
            with the offending parties, they should accuse persons who <lb/>
            know nothing about the matter—notwithstanding this, Xeno­ <lb/>
            pithes and Nausimachus, if you believe that your case is so <lb/>
            wonderfully good, return us the three talents and then go on <lb/>
            with it. As you got so much for not pressing these charges, <lb/>
            you are bound to hold your tongues until you have returned <lb/>
            the money: you must not make the charges and keep the <lb/>
            money too; that is the extreme of unfairness.</p>
          <p>Very possibly also they will talk of the galleys which they <lb/>
            have equipped, and say that they have expended their pro­ <lb/>
            perty for your benefit. That they will assert what is false­ <lb/>
            that they have wasted a considerable part of their substance, <lb/>
            while the state has had but a trifling portion of it, and that <lb/>
            they will claim at your hands a gratitude which they have <note type="footnote"> 1 See the second Appendix to this volume. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="251"/>
            not earned or merited-all this I will pass by, men of the <lb/>
            jury. I hold myself, that you ought to have a feeling of <lb/>
            gratitude to all who bear the public burdens. But to whom <lb/>
            should you be most grateful ? To those who, while they <lb/>
            perform that service which is useful to the state, do not <lb/>
            create what every one will say is a shame and a reproach. <lb/>
            Now those persons, who in serving the public offices have <lb/>
            dissipated their private property, bring odium upon the state <lb/>
            instead of advantage; for no one ever blames himself, but <lb/>
            says that the state has deprived him of his substance. Those <lb/>
            on the other hand, who discharge cheerfully the duties which <lb/>
            you assign to them, and at the same time preserve their pro­ <lb/>
            perty by the general prudence of their lives, are not only <lb/>
            preferable to the other class in this respect, that they both <lb/>
            have been useful and will be so again, but also because you <lb/>
            get their services without reproach. It will appear, that we <lb/>
            have so conducted ourselves in relation to you : of these <lb/>
            men I shall say nothing, for fear they should charge us with <lb/>
            calumniating them.</p>
          <p>I shall not be surprised if they try to shed tears and move <lb/>
            your compassion. I conjure you all on the other hand to <lb/>
            remember, that it is infamous, or rather iniquitous, after <lb/>
            having wasted their substance in gluttony and debauchery <lb/>
            with Aristocrates and Diognetus and men of that sort, in a <lb/>
            scandalous and profligate manner, to come now with crying and <lb/>
            whining, in order to get the property of other people. You <lb/>
            had reason to weep for your former conduct: this is not the <lb/>
            time to weep, but to show that you never gave a release, or <lb/>
            that you can sue again for the matters released, or that it is <lb/>
            right to commence an action twenty years afterwards, when <lb/>
            the law has prescribed five years as the limit. These are the <lb/>
            points which the jury have to determine. If they are unable <lb/>
            to show these things, as they will be unable, we entreat you <lb/>
            all, men of the jury, not to abandon us to the mercy of our <lb/>
            opponents, not to give them a fourth property in addition to <lb/>
            three others which they have mismanaged-that namely which <lb/>
            they received from their guardians without dispute, that <lb/>
            which they got to compromise their actions, that which they <lb/>
            lately wrested from Æsius by a judgment-but suffer us, as <lb/>
            we are entitled, to retain what is our own. It is of greater <lb/>
            service to you, remaining in our hands, than if it was in <lb/>
             <pb n="252"/>
            theirs; and surely it is more just that we should have what <lb/>
            belongs to us, than that they should have it.</p>
          <p>I see no reason to add anything more; as you seem fully <lb/>
            to understand what has been said. Pour out the water.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>THE proceeding which gave rise to the present speech was one of a <lb/>
            singular nature, for which no parallel can be found in our own law, <lb/>
            but for which the usages of Attic life seem to have afforded a reason­ <lb/>
            able ground.</p>
          <p>Mantias, the father of the plaintiff, was a citizen of the Acamantian <lb/>
            tribe and township of Thoricus. He married a daughter of Polya­ <lb/>
            ratus, a widow, with whom he received a portion of a talent, and by <lb/>
            whom he had two sons, the plaintiff, and another who died young. <lb/>
            The plaintiff was brought up in his father's house, named Mantitheus, <lb/>
            and registered in that name in his township. Mantias at the same <lb/>
            time had a mistress, named Plangon, the daughter of Pamphilus, an <lb/>
            Athenian citizen. By her he had two sons, whom for many years he <lb/>
            did not acknowledge; but after his wife's death he seems to have <lb/>
            married Plangon, and her eldest son, (the present defendant,) soon <lb/>
            after he had grown to manhood, took legal proceedings to establish <lb/>
            his own and his brother's birthright.</p>
          <p>The claim was resisted, and the dispute referred to arbitration; when <lb/>
            Plangon resorted to an extraordinary artifice to procure a judgment <lb/>
            in her son's favour. She persuaded Mantias to stake the cause upon <lb/>
            an oath to be tendered to her before the arbitrator, on the terms <lb/>
            that, if she swore the children were his, he should adopt them, if she <lb/>
            declined to swear it, he should be quit of them altogether; and she <lb/>
            gave him a solemn promise on oath, that she would decline the oath <lb/>
            when tendered to her, stipulating to receive a sum of money, which <lb/>
            was deposited for her in the hands of a third party. Notwithstand­ <lb/>
            ing this promise, when the oath was tendered to her before the <lb/>
            arbitrator, she accepted it, fathered the children on Mantias, and <lb/>
            caused the award to be pronounced against him.</p>
          <p>(As to the tendering of oaths, the reader is referred to VoL III. Ap­ <lb/>
            pendix X. page 384.)</p>
          <p>The award being under the circumstances conclusive against him, <lb/>
            Mantias took the sons of Plangon to the meeting of his clansmen at <lb/>
            the Apaturia in the usual way, and entered them in the register, the <lb/>
            elder in the name of Bœotus, the younger in that of Pamphilus. A <lb/>
            few years after, and before he had introduced them to the members <lb/>
            of his township, Mantias died. Bœotus, dissatisfied with the name <lb/>
            given to him by his father, which was that of his maternal uncle, <lb/>
            took the step which led eventually to the present action. He went <lb/>
             <pb n="253"/>
            to the tewnsmen of Thoricus, and got them to register him in the <lb/>
            name of Mantitheus, alleging that he, being the eldest brother, was <lb/>
            entitled to the name of his paternal grandfather. The exact time <lb/>
            when this took place is not mentioned; nor is the sequence of events <lb/>
            by any means clear.</p>
          <p>(On the subject of Attic names, see Becker's Charicles, Excursus I. <lb/>
            page 219. As to the registers of the clan and the township, tee Vol. <lb/>
            III. page 274, and the first Appendix to this volume.)</p>
          <p>Mantitheus, the present plaintiff, after his father's death, received his <lb/>
            half-brothers into the house, and consented to share the inheritance <lb/>
            with them. He claimed however a talent out of the estate, as the <lb/>
            marriage portion of his mother. Thereupon Bœotus set up a counter- <lb/>
            claim of a hundred minas, as the portion which Mantias had received <lb/>
            with his mother Plangon. Under the advice of friends, they divided <lb/>
            among them the bulk of the effects, and left the house as a reserve <lb/>
            fund, to abide the issue of this dispute.</p>
          <p>I have said that Plangon seems to have been married to Mantias after <lb/>
            his first wife's death, which happened many years before his own. <lb/>
            This fact is not indeed mentioned anywhere in the plaintiff's speech; <lb/>
            he says on the contrary, that even after his mother's death he would <lb/>
            not bring Plangon into his house, and he insinuates that there never <lb/>
            was any marriage between them; but he does not expressly deny it, <lb/>
            and from the absence of any express denial, as well as from the con­ <lb/>
            cessions of the plaintiff himself, the fact of Plangon's marriage must, <lb/>
            as I conceive, be inferred. For, had she never been more than a <lb/>
            concubine, her sons could have had no heritable rights.</p>
          <p>Mantitheus having commenced a suit against his half-brothers for his <lb/>
            mother's portion, and they a similar one against him, both were <lb/>
            referred to the arbitration of one Solon. A good deal of time having <lb/>
            been wasted, through the wilful delays (as the plaintiff Mantitheus <lb/>
            alleges) of his opponents, Solon died without having made any award. <lb/>
            The causes were then referred to another arbitrator, who gave judg­ <lb/>
            ment in both for Mantitheus. In that where Bœotus was plaintiff <lb/>
            he had attended, but offered no evidence to support his case; in the <lb/>
            other he suffered judgment to be given against him by default. He <lb/>
            disputed however the legality of the latter judgment, on the ground <lb/>
            that he had been sued in the wrong name; and Mantitheus found <lb/>
            himself compelled to commence a fresh suit against him in the name <lb/>
            which he had improperly assumed. This (as we learn from the <lb/>
            second speech against Bœotus, p. 1013,) occurred in the eleventh <lb/>
            year after the father's death.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile Mantitheus had been annoyed in various ways by Bœotus <lb/>
            and his brother. They had made other pecuniary demands upon <lb/>
            him, and succeeded in recovering them. Bœotus, having on one <lb/>
            occasion come to blows with him, cut himself afterwards in the head, <lb/>
            and charged his brother before the Areopagus with having ma­ <lb/>
            liciously wounded him. He conducted himself so profligately, and <lb/>
            kept such bad company, that Mantitheus, having a grown-up <lb/>
            daughter, was compelled to leave the house which the father had left <lb/>
            them. The identity of names had been attended with some un­ <lb/>
            pleasant occurrences, besides that already mentioned. Mantitheua <lb/>
             <pb n="254"/>
            having been elected to a military command, Bœotus pretended it had <lb/>
            been conferred on himself. A judgment having been recovered <lb/>
            against Bœotus in the assumed name, he gave out that his brother <lb/>
            was the party liable. A charge of desertion had been preferred <lb/>
            against Bœotus, and the plaintiff had been summoned upon it. And <lb/>
            the defendant's general conduct was so extravagant and reckless, <lb/>
            that his brother was in continual fear of being mistaken for him.</p>
          <p>Under these circumstances Mantitheus commenced an action against <lb/>
            Boeotus, in order to compel him to abandon the name which he had <lb/>
            assumed. The arguments in the plaintiff's speech are chiefly upon <lb/>
            the law of the case, to show that the assumption of his name was a <lb/>
            wrongful act, which subjected Bœotus to an action.</p>
          <p>He contends on general grounds, that a son had no right to assume a <lb/>
            different name from that which his father had given him : that such <lb/>
            a thing as two brothers having the same name was wholly unprece­ <lb/>
            dented; this being so, as the facts of the case established that he <lb/>
            (the plaintiff) had by the gift of his father a prior title to the name <lb/>
            of Mantitheus, the defendant's usurpation of it was illegal. Even <lb/>
            were Bœotus the elder by birth, which the plaintiff denied, the <lb/>
            seniority in regard to name belonged to the plaintiff; for Boeotus <lb/>
            was only to be regarded as the son of Mantias from the time of his <lb/>
            introduction to the clansmen.</p>
          <p>There were reasons both of a public and a private nature, why the <lb/>
            action ought to be maintainable. It was manifest, as both plaintiff <lb/>
            and defendant were sons of the same father, if their personal names <lb/>
            were the same, there would be no means of distinguishing them. <lb/>
            Each would be called "Mantitheus son of Mantias of Thoricus." <lb/>
            This would lead to ambiguity and confusion. If either of them were <lb/>
            nominated to any public office, such as that of Choragus or Gymnasi­ <lb/>
            arch, it would be uncertain which of the brothers was intended; <lb/>
            each might endeavour to shift the burden on the other, and the <lb/>
            public service would be neglected. Some of the most important <lb/>
            departments of the administration might suffer in this way; as the <lb/>
            collection of the property-tax, or the musters of troops. When <lb/>
            the nomination was to an office of honour or profit, as to that of <lb/>
            Archon or Juror, mischief would follow from the opposite endeavour. <lb/>
            Each would contend that he himself was the party chosen; and this <lb/>
            would lead to unseemly wrangling and contests at law.</p>
          <p>The mischiefs of a purely private character were no less serious. The <lb/>
            pseudo-Mantitheus might commit offences or get into scrapes, of <lb/>
            which the blame or the penalty might fall upon the real Mantitheus. <lb/>
            Nothing was more likely, when they looked at the persons with <lb/>
            whom Bœotus associated, and his vicious and profligate course of <lb/>
            life. Should a civil or criminal charge be brought against him, his <lb/>
            brother, from the confusion of names, might become amenable to <lb/>
            legal process. If a judgment were recorded against the pseudo. <lb/>
            Mantitheus, the real Mantitheus might be liable to execution, or <lb/>
            become a state-debtor; or supposing it to be known at the time who <lb/>
            the real debtor was, after the lapse of some years, if the debt were <lb/>
            not paid, the two brothers might be confounded, and the debt of <lb/>
            Bœotus might be enforced against the plaintiff's children. Again, <lb/>
             <pb n="255"/>
            some private enemy of Boeotus, knowing how his affiliation had been <lb/>
            procured, might hereafter denounce him as an alien, and indict him <lb/>
            for usurping civic rights. Many similar cases might be supposed. <lb/>
            The plaintiff, so long as he had the same name, was continually liable <lb/>
            to be implicated in the defendant's misconduct or misfortune. Some <lb/>
            annoyances had already occurred; others were likely to occur again; <lb/>
            and it was not just that he should be exposed to such perils.</p>
          <p>The modern reader may be surprised, that a complaint of this kind <lb/>
            should have been brought before the Athenian tribunal. In our <lb/>
            own times it is easy to designate an individual in such a way that he <lb/>
            cannot be mistaken. John Smith is distinguished from numerous <lb/>
            others who bear the same name by being described as " John Smith <lb/>
            of number 100 Cheapside in the City of London tailor." But in <lb/>
            Athens the custom was to describe a man only by his own name and <lb/>
            that of his father and his township. This was his address, his legal <lb/>
            title and addition; this, and nothing further, was entered in the <lb/>
            public records and documents. (See the first Appendix to this <lb/>
            Volume.) It became desirable therefore to avoid the multiplication <lb/>
            of names; and there was no great difficulty in avoiding them in a <lb/>
            small community, such as that of an Athenian township.</p>
          <p>Although there is no parallel in OUt. own law for an action such as the <lb/>
            present, there are proceedings to prevent acts of injustice of a some­ <lb/>
            what similar character. I allude to applications for an injunction to <lb/>
            prevent the adoption of a name or title for a journal or periodical, <lb/>
            which has already been assumed by another journal or periodical; <lb/>
            or to restrain the piracy or imitation of labels to a patent medicine, <lb/>
            or the like.</p>
          <p>The form in which this action was presented to the court does not <lb/>
            appear. I conceive however, that there was a demand for compen­ <lb/>
            sation in damages, which were laid at a small amount, as the plain­ <lb/>
            tiffs main object was to compel the defendant to drop the name of <lb/>
            Mantitheus. A verdict for the plaintiff would have had the desired <lb/>
            effect; for, if Boeotus had continued to use the name, another action <lb/>
            might have been brought; and so on, toties quoties, with an increase <lb/>
            of damages for contumacy.</p>
          <p>Reiske infers from a passage in the second action against Boeotus, (page <lb/>
            1013,) that the plaintiff lost the verdict in this action. But this, as <lb/>
            Schäfer observes, does not prove it.</p>
          <p>I ASSURE you by the Gods, men of the jury, it is out of no <lb/>
            litigious spirit that I commenced this action against Boeotus: <lb/>
            I was aware, it would seem strange to many people, that I <lb/>
            should commence an action because a person chose to have <lb/>
            the same name as myself: but the consequences that would <lb/>
            result, if I did not bring this matter to a settlement, made it <lb/>
            necessary to have the case tried before you. Had the de­ <lb/>
            fendant claimed to be the son of another father, and not of <lb/>
            mine, I might well have been regarded as a meddling body, <lb/>
            for caring by what name a person called himself. But <lb/>
             <pb n="256"/>
            he commenced legal proceedings against my father, and <lb/>
            leaguing himself with a gang of pettifoggers, Mnesicles, <lb/>
            whom probably you all know, and Menecles, the man who <lb/>
            convicted Ninus,l and some others of the same description, <lb/>
            contended in the suit that he was my father's son by the <lb/>
            daughter of Pamphilus, and that he was cruelly treated and <lb/>
            excluded from his civic rights. My father-for the whole <lb/>
            truth shall be told you, men of the jury-fearing to come <lb/>
            into court, lest some one to whom he had given offence by <lb/>
            his political acts should take this opportunity of attacking <lb/>
            him, and at the same time being deceived by the defendant's <lb/>
            mother-for she had sworn that, if he tendered her an oath 2 <lb/>
            upon the subject, she would not swear it, and in that case <lb/>
            their dispute would come to an end, and she had bargained <lb/>
            for a sum of money to be deposited with a third person 3—on <lb/>
            these conditions, I say, my father tenders her the oath. She <lb/>
            accepted it. and swore that not only the defendant but hill <lb/>
            brother also, her other son, was mv father's child. As sne <lb/>
            had done this, it became necessary to introduce them to the <lb/>
            clansmen, and there was no excuse left. He introduced <lb/>
            them, he adopted them as his children; (to pass over what <lb/>
            intervened,) he enters the defendant at the Apaturia* by the <lb/>
            name of Bœotus in the register of his clansmen, and the other <lb/>
            one by the name of Pamphilus : I had been registered by the <lb/>
            name of Mantitheus. It happened that my father died before <lb/>
            the entries were made in the register of the townsmen; and <lb/>
            the defendant went and entered himself in the township register <lb/>
            by the name of Mantitheus instead of Bœotus. How greatly <lb/>
            this damages not only me but you, I will explain, when I <lb/>
            have produced witnesses to confirm my statements. <note type="footnote"> 1 " Ulpien, dans sea commentaires sur In. harangue de Demosthene <lb/>

          <p>The manner in which my father entered us in the register <lb/>
            you have heard from the witnesses: I will now show you, <lb/>
            that, as the defendant did not choose to abide by these entries, <lb/>
            I have brought the action necessarily and justly. Surely I <lb/>
            am not so wrong-headed and unreasonable, as, after having <lb/>
            consented (since my father adopted these men) to take only <lb/>
            a third part of the inheritance, the whole of which was mine, <lb/>
            and after acquiescing in that arrangement, to engage in a <lb/>
            family quarrel1 about a name, unless for this reason, that for <lb/>
            ine to change my name would draw with it the deepest <lb/>
            degradation and the reproach of cowardice, while for the <lb/>
            defendant to have the same name as myself would on many <lb/>
            accounts be impossible.</p>
          <p>In the first place, (to begin with public matters before <lb/>
            private,) in what manner will the state give its command to <lb/>
            us, if anything is required to be done ? I suppose the tribes­ <lb/>
            men will nominate us in the same way as they nominate <lb/>
            others. Well then; they will nominate me as Mantitheus the <lb/>
            son of Mantias of Thoricus, if they propose me for choragus <lb/>
            or gymnasiarch or feaster of the tribe, or for any other office. <lb/>
            By what then will it appear, whether they nominate you or <lb/>
            me You will say they have appointed me, and I shall say <lb/>
            it is you. Suppose, after this, the Archon summons us, or <lb/>
            any other magistrate before whom the case is brought: we <lb/>
            do not comply, we do not perform the duty: which of us will <lb/>
            be amenable to the legal penalties? And in what manner <lb/>
            will the Generals enter our names, if they put us in a board <lb/>
            of tax-payers, or if they appoint either of us a trierarch ? Or <lb/>
            if there be any military expedition, how will it appear which <lb/>
            of us is the person on the muster-roll ? How, if any other <lb/>
            functionary impose a public charge; for example, the Archon, <lb/>
            the King-archon, the Umpires of prizes-what sign will dis­ <lb/>
            tinguish the person intended ? Perhaps they will affix " the <lb/>
            son of Plangon," if they enter your name, and the name of <lb/>
            my mother, if they enter mine. And who ever heard of such <lb/>
            a thing ? By what law can such a description be appended, <note type="footnote"> 1 <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ϛυγομαχεῖν</foreign>—Reiske in his Index—" cum aliquo contendere, cujus <lb/>

          <p>Again-suppose Mantitheus son of Mantias of Thoricus <lb/>
            were summoned as juror : what should we do! Should we <lb/>
            both go to the bench ? By what token will it be known <lb/>
            whether he has summoned you or me Or, by Jupiter, sup­ <lb/>
            pose the state elects to any office by lot; as to that of Coun­ <lb/>
            cillor, Judge, or any of the rest: how will it be known which <lb/>
            of us is appointed ?-unless a mark is to be attached to the <lb/>
            brass plate,1 as there might be to anything else; and even <lb/>
            then the people will not know to which of us it belongs. He <lb/>
            then will say he is appointed, and I shall say I am; and the <lb/>
            only thing left will be to go before the court. So in each <lb/>
            of these cases the state will impanel a jury for us; and of <lb/>
            that right, which is common to all, namely, to hold the office <lb/>
            to which one is chosen by lot, we shall be deprived; instead <lb/>
            of this, we shall abuse one another, and the successful talker <lb/>
            will get the office. And which would be most advantageous <lb/>
            for us—to get rid of our existing dissensions, or to begin <lb/>
            quarrelling and wrangling afresh ; which we must inevitably <lb/>
            do, when we have a dispute about an office or anything else ? <lb/>
            But how will it be-for we must examine every imaginable <lb/>
            case-if either of us, before he goes to the ballot, should per­ <lb/>
            suade the other to give him up the office, in case of his being <lb/>
            drawn for it? And what is this but one man balloting with <lb/>
            two balls ? And shall it be in our power to do with impunity <lb/>
            a thing which by law is punishable with death ? Aye, but <lb/>
            we shall not do it. I know that; at least I can speak for <lb/>
            myself: but it is not right that there should be individuals <lb/>
            exposed to such a penalty, when it may be easily avoided.</p>
          <p>Well: I have shown the damage which the state suffers. <lb/>
            What is my own private damage ? Observe how serious it is, <lb/>
            and consider if there is reason in what I say. In fact, the <lb/>
            damage done to me is far more grievous than what you <lb/>
            have heard. You all know that he was intimate with Mene­ <lb/>
            cles and his set in that person's lifetime, and now he associates <lb/>
            with others who are no better, and has the same pursuits and <lb/>

            perhaps he is one. Suppose in course of time he commences <lb/>
            the same kind of proceedings as those persons—I mean in­ <lb/>
            dictments, presentments, informations, arrests--and in any <lb/>
            such proceeding—(for the accidents in human life are <lb/>
            numerous, and even the cleverest people, when they are too <lb/>
            arrogant, you know how to keep within bounds on all occa­ <lb/>

            recorded against him more than against me Perhaps, it <lb/>
            may be said, because everybody will know which of the two <lb/>
            was amerced. Very good : but suppose (what may easily <lb/>
            happen) that time has elapsed and the debt is not paid; why <lb/>
            will it be entered against his children more than against <lb/>
            mine, when the name and the father and the tribe and all <lb/>
            particulars are the same ? Again---suppose a man sues him <lb/>
            in ejectment, not pretending to have any claim against me, <lb/>
            and afterwards, when he has established his right in the suit, <lb/>
            enters the record of the judgment:1 why will the judgment <lb/>
            be entered against Bœotus rather than me ? How will it be, <lb/>
            if he fails to pay any of the property taxes ? how, if any other <lb/>
            suit be commenced, or (to speak generally) if any unpleasant <lb/>
            report be spread, concerning the name ? Which of the people <lb/>
            will know whether it is I or whether it is he, when there are <lb/>
            two named Mantitheus by the same father ?</p>
          <p>Now take another case. Suppose he were prosecuted for <lb/>
            evading military service, dancing as a chorister when he should <lb/>
            be campaigning-as on this late occasion, when the rest went <lb/>
            over to Tamynæ, he was left behind here and celebrated the <lb/>
            feast of Cups,2 and stayed and danced in the chorus at the <lb/>
            Dionysia, as all you that were at home witnessed ; and, after <lb/>

            desertion, and I, who commanded the division of my tribe, <lb/>
            was compelled to receive the indictment, as it was against my <lb/>
            own name coupled with my father's; 1 and, if pay had been <lb/>
            provided for the juries, they would undoubtedly have brought <lb/>
            me into court. If the affair had not occurred after the sealing <lb/>
            of the boxes, I should have called witnesses to prove it.</p>
          <p>So much for that. Now suppose he were summoned for <lb/>
            usurpation of civic rights. He makes many enemies, and the <lb/>
            way in which my father was compelled to adopt him is no <lb/>
            secret. You certainly, at the time when my father refused <lb/>
            to acknowledge him, thought that his mother spoke the <lb/>
            truth; but when, with his birth thus established, he begins <lb/>
            to make himself disagreeable, you'll change your minds some <lb/>
            day and believe my father's story. How if, in fear of being <lb/>
            convicted of perjury for the aid which he lends to his asso­ <lb/>
            ciates, he should allow judgment to go by default against <lb/>
            him in such a proceeding ? Do you think it is a trifling dis­ <lb/>
            advantage, men of Athens, to be for one's whole life the <lb/>
            partner of this man's character and conduct ?</p>
          <p>I beg you to observe, that my alarm even on these last­ <lb/>
            .nentioned grounds is not imaginary. Bœotus has already, <lb/>
            men of Athens, had some indictments preferred against him; <lb/>
            and the obloquy extends to me, who am wholly innocent. <lb/>
            And he laid claim to the office, to which you elected me; <lb/>
            and many unpleasant things have occurred to us through the <lb/>
            name. I shall produce witnesses, and give you fall proof of <lb/>

          <p>You see the consequences, men of Athens; you perceive <lb/>
            the annoyance which the thing occasions. Even if there <lb/>
            were no disagreeable results-if it were not wholly impos­ <lb/>

            and without any compulsion. I cannot see the justice of <lb/>

          <p>You hear, men of Athens, that I have always borne the <lb/>
            name of Mantitheus; but the defendant was entered in the <lb/>
            clan-register, when my father was compelled to enter him, <lb/>
            under the name of Bœotus. I should be glad then to ask <lb/>
            him in your presence--If my father had not died, what <lb/>
            should you have done at the meeting of the township? <lb/>
            Would you not have allowed yourself to be registered in the <lb/>
            name of Bœotus ? It would have been absurd to enforce the <lb/>
            registry, and yet afterwards to prevent it. But my father, if <lb/>
            you had allowed him, would have entered you in the town­ <lb/>
            ship register by the same name as he had entered you in the <lb/>
            clan-register. By earth and heaven ! it is monstrous, that he <lb/>
            should say Mantias was his father, and yet dare to disaffirm <lb/>
            the acts done by him in his lifetime.</p>
          <p>He ventured before the arbitrator to make a most impu­ <lb/>
            dent assertion-that my father kept the tenth day for him <lb/>
            as he had kept it for me, and gave him the name of Manti­ <lb/>
            theus—and he produced some witnesses, with whom my <lb/>
            father was never known to have any acquaintance. You <lb/>
            must all be aware that, in the first place, no man would have <lb/>
            kept the tenth day for a child, whom he did not believe to <lb/>
            be rightfully bis own; and in the next place, no one, after <lb/>
            keeping the day and showing a parent's fondness for the <lb/>
            child, could have brought himself afterwards to repudiate <lb/>
            him. My father, though he might have quarrelled with the <lb/>
            mother of these children, would not have hated them, if he <lb/>
            believed them to be his own: it is far more usual for man <lb/>
            and wife, when they are at variance, to become reconciled for <lb/>
            their children's sake, than to hate their children for the in­ <lb/>
            juries which they have done to one another. This however <lb/>
            is not the only proof that his assertion, if he repeats it, will <lb/>
            be false. For, before he pretended to be our relation, he <note type="footnote"> x This was the christening, as we should say; when the name was <lb/>
            given to the infant, and the parents gave a feast and sacrifice to which <lb/>
            they invited their friends and relations. Proof that such a feast was <lb/>
            given was important on questions of pedigree and citizenship. See <lb/>

            used to go to the training-school1 of the Hippothoontian tribe, <lb/>
            to dance in the chorus of boys. Is there one of you who <lb/>
            believes, that his mother would have sent him to that tribe, <lb/>
            when she had been cruelly used (as she says) by my father, <lb/>
            and when she knew that he had kept the tenth day and after­ <lb/>
            wards denied it ? I should think not a man would believe <lb/>
            this. For you might just as well have gone to the training- <lb/>
            school of the Acamantian tribe, and then the tribe would <lb/>
            have been in conformity with the giving qf the name.</p>

          <p>Clear as it thus is, that by his mother's oath and the <lb/>
            simplicity of the person who tendered her the oath he has <lb/>
            obtained a father and established a birth in the Acamantian <lb/>
            tribe instead of the Hippothoontian, Bœotus the defendant is <lb/>
            not content, but has even commenced two or three actions <lb/>
            against me for money, in addition to the vexatious actions <lb/>
            which he brought against me before. You must all know, <lb/>
            what my father was as a man of business. I will say no <lb/>
            more about it; but, if the mother of these men has sworn <lb/>
            truly, the vexatious character of these proceedings is palpably <lb/>
            demonstrated. For if my father was so extravagant, that, <lb/>
            after having espoused my mother in lawful wedlock, he kept <lb/>
            another woman, of whom you are the offspring, and main­ <lb/>
            tained two establishments, how with such expensive habits <lb/>
            could he have left money ?</p>
          <p>I am aware, men of Athens, that Bœotus the defendant <lb/>

            charge which he is always making, that my father spited him <lb/>
            at my instigation; and he claims to be entitled, as if he were <lb/>
            the elder, to have the name of his paternal grandfather. As <lb/>
            to this point, it is better that you should have a little infor­ <lb/>
            mation. I recollect, before he became a member of our <lb/>
            family, I just saw him as I might see any one else, and <lb/>
            thought him younger than myself, a good bit younger, to <lb/>
            judge from appearance; however I lay no great stress upon <lb/>
            that, for it would be silly to do so. But if the defendant <lb/>
            Bœotus, when be thought proper to join the chorus of the <lb/>
            Hippothoontian tribe, before he pretended to be my father's <lb/>
            son, had been asked this question—“ what name do you say <lb/>
            you are entitled to ? "-had he said " Mantitheus," I would <lb/>
            reply—“you can't claim it on the plea that you are older <lb/>
            than I am : for, as formerly you supposed you had no con­ <lb/>
            nexion even with my tribe, how could you have claimed <lb/>
            relationship to my grandfather ?” Besides, men of Athens, <lb/>
            though none of you know the number of years-for I shall <lb/>
            say that I am the elder, and he will say that he is—you all <lb/>
            understand the reckoning of justice. What is that ? That <lb/>
            Bœotus and his brother should be considered my father's <lb/>
            children from the time when he adopted them. He entered <lb/>
            me in the township-register under the name of Mantitheus, <lb/>
            before he introduced Bœotus to the clansmen. I therefore <lb/>
            have a right to this name as the senior, not only in point of <lb/>
            time, but in point of justice.</p>
          <p>Again, suppose you were asked this question-" tell me, <lb/>
            Bœotus, how comes it that you now belong to the Acaman­ <lb/>
            tian tribe and are a member of the Thorician township and <lb/>
            the son of Mantias, and that you have a share of the pro­ <lb/>
            perty left by him ? ”—you could only reply, that Mantias in <lb/>
            his lifetime acknowledged you as one of his children. If you <lb/>
            were asked, what proof or evidence you had of this, you <lb/>
            would say—“ he introduced me to his clansmen." • If you <lb/>
            were asked, under what name he registered you, you would <lb/>
            say " Bœotus; ” for by that name you were introduced. It <lb/>
            is monstrous then, when through the name of Bœotus you <lb/>
            enjoy the civic franchise and a share of my father's inherit­ <lb/>
            ance, that you should choose to discard that name and take <lb/>
            another. Suppose my father were to rise from the grave, <lb/>
            and require you either to keep to the name in which he. <lb/>
             <pb n="264"/>
            adopted you, or to call yourself the son of another father, <lb/>
            would not his demand be thought a reasonable one ? I then <lb/>
            make the same demand upon you—either to sign yourself as <lb/>
            another man's son, or to keep the name which Mantias gave <lb/>
            you.</p>
          <p>Oh! but that name was given you by way of contumely <lb/>
            and insult. Nothing of the kind. These men, when my father <lb/>
            refused to acknowledge them, used repeatedly to say that the <lb/>
            defendant's maternal kindred were quite as good as those of <lb/>
            my father. Bœotus is the name of his mother's brother. <lb/>
            And when my father was compelled to introduce them to the <lb/>
            clansmen, I having been previously introduced as Mantitheus, <lb/>
            he introduces the defendant under the name of Bceotus, and <lb/>
            his brother under the name of Pamphilus. Show me, if you <lb/>
            can, what Athenian ever gave the same name to two of his <lb/>
            children. If you can, I will concede that my father gave <lb/>
            you that name by way of indignity. However, if your <lb/>
            nature was such that you could compel him to adopt you <lb/>
            and yet not study to please him, you were not what a true <lb/>
            son ought to be to his parents, and not being such, you <lb/>
            deserved, I don't say to be treated with indignity, but to be <lb/>
            put to death. Shocking indeed would it be, if the laws con­ <lb/>
            cerning parents should be binding on children whom the <lb/>
            father himself considers to be his own, but of no force against <lb/>
            those who push themselves into the family by means of a <lb/>
            compulsory affiliation.</p>
          <p>You most tiresome Bœotus! I would wish you, if possible, <lb/>
            to renounce all your bad ways : but, if that is asking too <lb/>
            much, do pray oblige me to this extent-cease to give your <lb/>
            self annoyance ; cease to harass me with litigation; be con <lb/>
            tent that you have gained a franchise, a property, a father. <lb/>
            No one seeks to dispossess you, nor do I. If, as you pretend <lb/>
            to be a brother, you do the acts of a brother, people will <lb/>
            believe that you are my kinsman. But if you plot against <lb/>
            me, go to law with me, envy me, slander me, it will be <lb/>
            thought that you have intruded into a strange family and <lb/>
            treat the members as if they were alien to you.1 As to me <note type="footnote"> 1 Pabst perhaps more literally—“ Du seyest in ein frendes Eigenthum <lb/>
            gekommen, und behandelst es als eine Sache, die Dir nicht gehöre.” <lb/>
            Auger—“ On vous croira un intrus dans notre familIe, un usurpateur do <lb/>

            personally-however wrong my father might have been in <lb/>
            refusing to acknowledge you—I certainly am innocent. It <lb/>
            was not my business to know who were his sons; it was for <lb/>
            him to show me whom I was to regard as brothers. So long <lb/>
            therefore as he forbore to acknowledge you, I also held you <lb/>
            to be no relation: ever since he acknowledged you, I have <lb/>
            regarded you as he did. What is the proof of this ? You <lb/>
            have had your portion of the inheritance after my father's <lb/>
            death; you participate in our religious worship, in our civil <lb/>
            rights; no one excludes you from these. What would you <lb/>
            have!</p>
          <p>If he says he is cruelly treated, if he weeps and whines <lb/>
            and accuses me, don't believe what he says; it is not right <lb/>
            that you should, as the question is not about these matters <lb/>
            now; but remember, that he may obtain justice quite as <lb/>
            easily if he is called Bœotus. Why are you so obstinately <lb/>
            contentious ? Do desist: do not cherish these malignant <lb/>
            feelings towards me I I have none such towards you : nay, <lb/>
            I must tell you, even now I am speaking more on your <lb/>
            behalf than my own, when I insist that we should not have <lb/>
            the same name. For whoever hears it pronounced must at <lb/>
            all events ask, which of us is meant, if there are two persons <lb/>
            called “ Mantitheus son of Mantias:" then, if the person <lb/>
            means you, he will reply—“ the one whom Mantias was com­ <lb/>
            pelled to adopt." How can you desire this ?</p>
          <p>Take and read, if you please, these two depositions, show­ <lb/>
            ing that my father gave to me the name of Mantitheus, and <lb/>
            to the defendant that of Boeotus.</p>

            <title type="sub">[The Depositions.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I have now to show you, I believe, men of the jury, not <lb/>
            only that you will satisfy your oaths if you pronounce the <lb/>
            verdict which I ask, but that by the confession of the defen­ <lb/>
            dant himself it appears, that he ought to be called Bœotus <lb/>
            and not Mantitheus. For, after I had commenced this action <lb/>
            against him as Bœotus son of Mantias of Thoricus, at first he <lb/>
            defended the action, and put in an affidavit for delay, as if <lb/>
            he was Bœotus, but at last, when evasion became no longer <lb/>
            possible, he suffered an award to be given against him for <lb/>
            non-appearance, and just see, by the Gods, what he did!­ <lb/>
            he gets a rule to set aside the award for non-appearance, <lb/>
             <pb n="266"/>
            entitling himself Bœotus. But, if he had really nothing to do <lb/>
            with that name, he should in the first instance have allowed <lb/>
            the suit to proceed to its termination against Bœotus, and <lb/>
            not afterwards have himself obtained a rule in that name to <lb/>
            set aside the award. When he has thus by his own adjudi­ <lb/>
            cation declared his name to be Bœotus, what can he call upon <lb/>
            you sworn jurors to decide ?1</p>
          <p>To prove the truth of these statements, please to take the <lb/>
            rule to set aside the award, and this plaint.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>If now the defendant can produce a law, which empowers <lb/>
            children to choose their own names, you will do right to pro­ <lb/>
            nounce the verdict which he asks : but if the law, which you <lb/>
            all know as well as myself, authorises parents not only to <lb/>
            give the name in the first instance, but also to cancel and <lb/>
            publicly revoke it, if they please ; and if I have proved that <lb/>
            my father, who had such authority by the law, gave to the <lb/>
            defendant the name of Bœotus and to me that of Mantitheus; <lb/>
            how is it competent for you to pronounce any other verdict <lb/>
            than that which I ask ? On questions, upon which there are <lb/>
            no written laws, you are sworn to decide according to what <lb/>
            is right and equitable; so that, even had there been no <lb/>
            statute upon this point, you would have been bound to give <lb/>
            your decision in my favour. For what Athenian ever gave <lb/>
            the same name to two of his children ? What Athenian, who <lb/>
            is yet without children, ever will do so ? Surely none. What <lb/>
            then you consider in your judgment to be right for your own <note type="footnote"> 1 Perhaps Bœotus might have treated the summons to appear, and <lb/>
            all the subsequent proceedings against him in that name, as a nullity; <lb/>
            just as a person may do in our country, who is sued in a wrong surname, <lb/>
            by which he has never been known. On the other hand, as Bœotus had <lb/>
            formerly passed by that name, and as this was a suit instituted for <lb/>
            the very purpose of compelling him to keep that name, it might have <lb/>
            been dangerous to treat the whole process as a nullity, for fear of his <lb/>
            being concluded by the judgment. The safest course might have been to <lb/>
            appear and defend the action, under protest that he was sued by the <lb/>
            wrong name; and, for aught we know, this was the course that Bœotus <lb/>
            adopted. Schäfer pronounces the point to be a mere quibble. Such <lb/>
            points however are frequently taken by lawyers; and a case like the <lb/>
            present, for which perhaps the Attic law furnished no precedent, was <lb/>
            likely enough to lead both to quibbles and to difficulties. See the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing speech, page 1013 (orig.), and the argument to this. As to <lb/>

            children, you are bound in conscience to decide in our case. <lb/>
            It appears therefore, having regard to what is right and <lb/>
            equitable, having regard to the statute laws, to your oaths, <lb/>
            and to the defendant's own confession, that I, men of Athens, <lb/>
            am asking you what is fair and reasonable, while the defen­ <lb/>
            dant asks what is not only unfair, but contrary to the practice <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>THIS is the action brought by the same plaintiff against the same defendant <lb/>
            to establish his title to the marriage portion of his mother. The cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances which led to it have already been explained in the argu­ <lb/>
            ment to the preceding oration, and need not be here repeated. As <lb/>
            Bœotus disputed the fact of the plaintiff's mother having received a <lb/>
            portion on her marriage, Mantitheus calls his maternal relations to <lb/>
            prove it; and in answer to the counter-claim set up by Bœotus for the <lb/>
            portion of his mother Plangon, in support of which no direct testimony <lb/>
            had been offered, he shows by the facts and probabilities of the case, <lb/>
            that Plangon was portionless, and that the defendant's account of the <lb/>
            matter is a fabrication. The decision of the arbitrator, which had not <lb/>
            been appealed against, is insisted on by the plaintiff as affording a <lb/>
            strong presumption in his favour. He enters, as in the previous case, <lb/>
            into the topics of their family history, shows how ungratefully Bœotus <lb/>
            had treated him, and appeals to the sympathies of the jury.</p>
          <p>IT is the most grievous thing in the world, men of the jury, <lb/>
            when any one is by name called brother of persons whom in <lb/>
            reality he regards as enemies, and when, on account of cruel <lb/>
            injuries which they have heaped upon him, he is compelled <lb/>
            to come into a court of justice; as is my case now. I have <lb/>
            not only had the misfortune in the beginning, that Plangon, <lb/>
            the mother of these men, deceived my father, and by manifest <lb/>
            perjury forced him against his will to acknowledge them, and <lb/>
            consequently I was deprived of two thirds of my patrimony: <lb/>
            but, in addition to this, I have been driven by my opponents <lb/>
            out of my paternal house, in which I was born and bred, and <lb/>
            in which I received them after my father's death, though he <lb/>
            in his lifetime would never admit them to it; and I am de­ <lb/>
            prived of the marriage portion of my own mother, for which <lb/>
             <pb n="268"/>
            I am now suing. I have myself given them satisfaction for <lb/>
            all the demands which they made upon me, except a few <lb/>
            cross-demands which they have vexatiously brought against <lb/>
            me on account of this action, as will be perfectly clear to <lb/>
            you; yet from them in a period of eleven years I have not <lb/>
            been able to obtain anything that is reasonable, and at length <lb/>
            I have recourse to you for protection. I beseech you then, <lb/>
            men of the jury, to give me a favourable hearing while I <lb/>
            address you to the best of my ability, and, if it shall appear <lb/>
            to you that I have been shamefully treated, to forgive my <lb/>
            coming here to recover what is my own, the more especially <lb/>
            as it is for a portion to give with my daughter; for I married <lb/>
            when only eighteen at my fathers request, and so it happens <lb/>
            that I have a daughter already marriageable. It is just <lb/>
            therefore on many accounts that you should redress the <lb/>
            wrongs which have been done to me; and it is meet that <lb/>
            you show resentment against these men ; who (0 earth and <lb/>
            heaven!) when they might by doing justice have avoided <lb/>
            coming into court, are not ashamed to remind you of any­ <lb/>
            thing which our father may have done amiss or any offence <lb/>
            which they committed against him, and actually force me <lb/>
            into litigation with them. To make you clearly understand, <lb/>
            that it is not I, but my opponents, who are the cause of this <lb/>
            proceeding, I will relate the facts of the case to you from the <lb/>
            beginning in as short a compass as possible.</p>
          <p>My mother, men of the jury, was the daughter of Polyaratus <lb/>
            of Cholargus, and sister of Menexenus and Bathyllus and <lb/>
            Periander. Her father having given her in marriage to <lb/>
            Cleomedon, the son of Cleon, with a portion of a talent, she <lb/>
            lived with him as his wife, and bore him three daughters and <lb/>
            one son, named Cleon; her husband then died, and she left <lb/>
            his family and received back the portion. Her brothers <lb/>
            Menexenus and Bathyllus (Periander being yet a minor) gave <lb/>
            her in marriage again with the talent for her portion, and <lb/>
            she lived in wedlock with my father. They had issue myself <lb/>
            and a younger brother, who died in infancy. I will first call <lb/>
            witnesses, to prove to you that I am stating these facts <lb/>
            correctly.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[Witnesses.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>My father, having thus espoused my mother. lived with <lb/>
            her in his own house and treated her as his wife; me he <lb/>
             <pb n="269"/>
            brought up, and showed a fatherly affection to me, such as <lb/>
            you all show to your children. With Plangon, the mother <lb/>
            of these men, he had intercourse of some kind or other; (it <lb/>
            is not for me to say what:) his passion however was so far <lb/>
            under restraint, that even after my mothers death he did not <lb/>
            choose to receive her into his house as an inmate, nor could <lb/>
            he be persuaded that these men were his children; and they <lb/>
            lived all the rest of the time without being regarded as my <lb/>
            father's sons, as most of you are aware; but after Bœotus <lb/>
            had grown up and had leagued himself with a gang of petti­ <lb/>
            foggers, at the head of whom were Mnesicles and Menecles, <lb/>
            the person who convicted Ninus, with whose assistance he <lb/>
            went to law with my father, pretending that he was his son <lb/>
            -many meetings took place about these affairs, and my <lb/>
            father said, nothing could convince him that these men were <lb/>
            his children; at length Plangon, men of the jury, (for the <lb/>
            whole truth shall be told you,) conspiring with Menecles <lb/>
            against my father, and deceiving him by an oath which <lb/>
            among all mankind is held to be the most solemn and awful, <lb/>
            agreed that upon receipt of thirty minas she would get her <lb/>
            brothers to adopt these men, and that, if my father would <lb/>
            challenge her before the arbitrator to swear that the children <lb/>
            were his, she would decline the challenge; so, she said, while <lb/>
            her children would not be deprived of their civic rights, they <lb/>
            would no longer have it in their power to annoy my father, <lb/>
            their mother having refused the oath. These terms being <lb/>
            assented to—I needn't make a long story of it-he attended <lb/>
            before the arbitrator, and Plangon, in violation of all her <lb/>
            engagements, accepts the challenge, and swears in the Del­ <lb/>
            phinium an oath directly contrary to her former oath, as <lb/>
            most of you are aware; for the transaction was much talked <lb/>
            about.</p>
          <p>My father was thus by reason of his own challenge under <lb/>
            the necessity of submitting to the award; at the same time <lb/>
            he was indignant at what had occurred, and took it much to <lb/>
            heart, and would not even then receive these persons into his <lb/>
            house, although he was compelled to introduce them to his <unclear/> <lb/>
            clarsmen. And he entered this one in the register under <lb/>
            the name of Bœotus, his brother under the name of Pam. <lb/>
            philus. As I was about eighteen years of age, he persuaded <lb/>
            me at once to marry the daughter of Euphemus, wishing to <lb/>
             <pb n="270"/>
            Bee children born to me, I, men of the jury-considering <lb/>
            that I was always bound to please my father, and that, when <lb/>
            these men were vexing him by litigation and annoyance, it <lb/>
            was my special duty to take the opposite course, and to <lb/>
            console him by every means in my power-complied with <lb/>
            his request, and married accordingly. He lived to see my <lb/>
            daughter born, and a few years afterwards fell sick and died. <lb/>
            Though in my father's lifetime, men of the jury, I did not <lb/>
            choose to thwart him in anything, after his death I received <lb/>
            these men into the house, and allowed them to share the <lb/>
            whole property with me; not that I regarded them as <lb/>
            brothers, (for it is almost universally known in what way <lb/>
            they have become such,) but because I considered that, as <lb/>
            my father had been taken in, it was necessary for me to obey <lb/>
            your laws. They being thus received by me into the house, <lb/>
            we proceeded to divide the inheritance; and, upon my de­ <lb/>
            manding the return of my mother's marriage portion, these <lb/>
            men advanced a counter-claim, and alleged that a portion of <lb/>
            the like amount was repayable to their mother. Under the <lb/>
            advice of persons who were present, we divided all the rest <lb/>
            of the property, but reserved the house and the domestic <lb/>
            slaves of my father, so that, whichever party established his <lb/>
            title to the marriage portion, might receive its value out of <lb/>
            the house, and, the slaves being common to both, should <lb/>
            these men want to search for any of our father's effects, they <lb/>
            might get information from the slaves, either by the torture <lb/>
            or by any kind of investigation which they preferred. That <lb/>
            these statements are correct, as well as the others which I <lb/>
            have made, you shall see from the depositions which I put in.</p>

          </ab>
          <p>After this my brothers commenced actions against me for <lb/>
            their demands, and I sued them for the marriage portion. <lb/>
            And in the first instance we nominated1 Solon of Erchia as <note type="footnote"> 1 Literally caused him to be inserted”—either in the agreement of <lb/>
            reference, (in tabulis pacti, as Reiske has it in his Index,) or, which is <lb/>
            more probable, in the margin, or at the foot, of the record: for I rather <lb/>
            apprehend that Solon was a public arbitrator, to whom the magistrate <lb/>
            sent the case in the first instance, perhaps at the nomination of both <lb/>
            parties. The arbitrator afterwards appointed was undoubtedly a public <lb/>
            one; for the plaintiff intimates that an appeal lay from his decision. <lb/>
            See Vol. III. Appendix X. page 398, &amp;c. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="271"/>
            arbitrator, and submitted our mutual claims to his decision. <lb/>
            My brothers however, instead of attending the reference, <lb/>
            shirked the hearing altogether, so that a great deal of time <lb/>
            was wasted, and Solon died without having given judgment: <lb/>
            they then commence their actions against me over again, and <lb/>
            I commence a fresh action against the defendant, summoning <lb/>
            him in the name of Bœotus and so entitling the plaint; for <lb/>
            my father had given him that name. In their suit against <lb/>
            me Boeotiis appeared and fought the case, but, as he was <lb/>
            unable to give any proof of his claim, the arbitrator pro­ <lb/>
            nounced in my favour; and Bœotus, knowing that he had <lb/>
            made an unfounded demand, did not appeal to a jury, and <lb/>
            has not now commenced any action against me for these <lb/>
            matters, but for some others, thinking to defeat this judgment <lb/>
            of mine by his new claims. In the suit which I then pro­ <lb/>
            secuted against Boeotus for the marriage portion, he being in <lb/>
            the country and not having attended before the arbitrator, <lb/>
            judgment was given against him for non-appearance. Bœotus, <lb/>
            men of the jury, neither appeared then to contest the cause, <lb/>
            nor allowed that I had obtained the judgment of the arbitra­ <lb/>
            tor against him : for he said that his name was not Boeotus <lb/>
            but Mantitheus, and thus, by disputing about a name, he in <lb/>
            point of fact deprives me of my mother's marriage portion. <lb/>
            As I scarcely knew how such a case was to be dealt with, I <lb/>
            commenced this same action against him afresh in the name <lb/>
            of Mantitheus, and now in the eleventh year I am come to <lb/>
            you for protection.</p>
          <p>To prove the truth of these statements, he shall read you <lb/>
            the depositions which relate to them.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The depositions.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>That my mother lived with my father in wedlock, that she <lb/>
            brought him a marriage portion of a talent, and was affianced <lb/>
            by her brothers, as the laws require-the manner also in <lb/>
            which I received these persons into the house after my <lb/>
            father's death, and that I obtained judgment in the actions <lb/>
            which they brought against me—all this, men of the jury, <lb/>
            has been proved to you and given in evidence. Now, if you <lb/>
            please, take this law concerning the marriage portion.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The law.]</title>
          </ab><pb n="272"/>
          
          <p>Such being the enactments of the law, I imagine that <lb/>
            Bœotus or Mantitheus, or whatever other name it pleases <lb/>
            him to be called by, will have no true and just defence to <lb/>
            offer, but, relying on his boldness and audacity, will try to <lb/>
            shift the misfortunes of his own family on my shoulders, as <lb/>
            he is accustomed to do in private society, and will say, that <lb/>
            upon the confiscation of the property of Pamphilus, who was <lb/>
            the father of Plangon, my father received the surplus monies <lb/>
            out of the Council-chamber :1 so he will endeavour to make <lb/>
            out, that his own mother brought a fortune of more than a <lb/>
            hundred miuas, while my mother (as he pretends) was a por­ <lb/>
            tionless wife. He will tell you this story, men of the jury, <lb/>
            without having put a single deposition in the box to prove <lb/>
            it, and knowing there is not a syllable of truth in it, because <lb/>
            he is perfectly aware, that no man was ever acquitted before <lb/>
            you who confessed his guilt, but people have sometimes <lb/>
            escaped punishment by lies and shuffling excuses.</p>
          <p>In order that you may not be deceived by him, I think it <lb/>
            is better to give you a little information upon the subject. <lb/>
            Should he say, that my mother did not bring a marriage <lb/>
            portion and their mother did, remember that this is a trans- <lb/>
            parent falsehood. For, in the first place, Pamphilus, the <lb/>
            father of their mother, died owing five talents to the public <lb/>
            treasury, and, so far from there being any surplus for his <lb/>
            children after his property had been scheduled and confiscated, <lb/>
            even his debt has not been entirely discharged, but Pamphilus <lb/>
            at this very moment stands in the register as indebted to the <lb/>
            treasury. How then is it possible that my father received <lb/>
            money from the estate of Pamphilus, which was not even <lb/>
            sufficient to satisfy his debt to the commonwealth ? In the <lb/>
            next place, men of the jury, consider this-were it ever so <lb/>
            true, that there was the surplus which these men pretend, <lb/>
            my father would not have got it, but the sons of Pamphilus, <lb/>
            namely, Boeotus and Hedylus and Euthydemus, persons who <lb/>
            would go all lengths to get the property of others, as you all <lb/>
            know, and of course would never have allowed my father to <lb/>
            receive what belonged to them.</p>
          <p>That the mother of my opponents did not bring a marriage <lb/>
            portion, but that this is a pure invention of their own, I think <note type="footnote"> 1 As to the financial duties of the Council, see Böckh, Publ. Econ. of <lb/>
            Athens, Translation, Vol. I. page 237. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="273"/>
            you are sufficiently informed. That my mother did bring <lb/>
            one, I can easily show. In the first place, she was the <lb/>
            daughter of Polyaratus, who was honoured by the people of <lb/>
            Athens and possessed a large estate. Secondly, it has been <lb/>
            proved to you by witnesses, that her sister brought a portion <lb/>
            of the like amount to her husband Eryximachus, the brother- <lb/>
            in-law of Chabrias. In addition to this it is shown, that my <lb/>
            mother was first given in marriage to Cleomedon, whose <lb/>
            father Cleon, as we are told, commanded the troops of your <lb/>
            ancestors, and captured a large number of Lacedæmonian <lb/>
            prisoners in Pylus, and acquired a higher reputation than <lb/>
            any of his countrymen; so it was hardly proper that his son <lb/>
            should wed my mother portionless, nor is it likely that <lb/>
            Menexenus and Bathyllus, who had a large fortune them­ <lb/>
            selves, and who after Cleomedon's death received back the <lb/>
            portion, deprived their sister of it; on the contrary, it is <lb/>
            more likely, that they added to it when they gave her in <lb/>
            marriage to my father, as they themselves and her other <lb/>
            relations have testified to you. And besides this, just con­ <lb/>
            sider, if it were true that ray mother was not an affianced <lb/>
            wife and brought no marriage portion, while the mother of <lb/>
            these men did bring one, what could possibly induce my <lb/>
            father to deny that these were his sons, and to acknowledge <lb/>
            me and bring me up ? Perhaps, as these men pretend, be­ <lb/>
            cause he dishonoured them to gratify me and my mother. <lb/>
            But she died leaving me quite a little child, whereas their <lb/>
            mother Plangon, who was a handsome woman, had inter­ <lb/>
            course with him both before and after that: so it was far <lb/>
            more likely that on account of the living lady, of whom he <lb/>
            was enamoured, he would dishonour the son of the deceased, <lb/>
            than that for the sake of me and my deceased mother he <lb/>
            should refuse to acknowledge the children of her who was <lb/>
            living and having intercourse with him.</p>
          <p>Bœotus however has reached such a pitch of audacity, as <lb/>
            to say that my father gave a feast for him on the tenth day. <lb/>
            And in support of this assertion he has put in the depositions <lb/>
            only of Timocrates and Promachus, who are no way related <lb/>
            to my father by blood, and were no friends of his. So <lb/>
            manifestly false is their testimony, that, like witnesses to a <lb/>
            summons, a pair of them only depose, that a man, who, as <lb/>
            every one knows, was compelled by the legal proceedings of <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> T </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="274"/>
            Bœotus to adopt him against his will, gave a feast for him on <lb/>
            the tenth day! Which of you will believe such a story I <lb/>
            He can't say this, that my father acknowledged him when a <lb/>
            little child, but, after he had grown up, refused to notice him <lb/>
            on account of some quarrel with his mother. For surely it <lb/>
            is much more usual for man and wife to make up their <lb/>
            private differences for the sake of their children, than to <lb/>
            hate their children on account of their own quarrels. If he <lb/>
            attempts therefore to say this, don't listen to so impudent an <lb/>
            assertion.</p>
          <p>Should he talk about the actions which they brought, and <lb/>
            which the arbitrator decided in my favour, and should he say <lb/>
            that he was taken by me unprepared, remember first, that <lb/>
            he had not a short time only to prepare himself, but many <lb/>
            years; secondly, that he was the plaintiff, so that it was <lb/>
            much more likely for me to be taken unprepared by him, <lb/>
            than for him to be so taken by me. And further, all the <lb/>
            persons who were before the arbitrator have stated to you in <lb/>
            evidence, that Boeotus was himself present, when the arbi­ <lb/>
            trator decided in my favour, and that he did not appeal to <lb/>
            the court, but acquiesced in the award. It would be strange, <lb/>
            I take it, when other men, who consider themselves wronged, <lb/>
            carry the most trifling causes on appeal to you, that this <lb/>
            man, who had sued me for a marriage portion to recover <lb/>
            a talent, and had an award in the suit given against him (as <lb/>
            he himself says) unjustly, should acquiesce in that award. <lb/>
            Oh, but perhaps he is a quiet sort of person, not fond of <lb/>
            litigation. I should have been glad indeed, men of the jury, <lb/>
            if he had been such. But it is quite otherwise. While you <lb/>
            are so liberal and humane, that you would not banish from <lb/>
            the country even the sons of the thirty tyrants; Bœotus, <lb/>
            conspiring against me with Menecles, who is the architect of <lb/>
            all these plots, upon some dispute between us contrived from <lb/>
            words to come to blows ; then he cut his own head and sum­ <lb/>
            moned me on a charge of wounding before the Areopagus, <lb/>
            with the intention of driving me into exile from Athens. <lb/>
            And if Euthydicus the physician, whom these persons went <lb/>
            to in the first instance and asked to cut the head of Bœotus, <lb/>
            had not of his own accord disclosed the whole truth to tho <lb/>
            Council of Areopagus, this man would have taken such <lb/>
            vengeauce on me who never wronged him, as you would <lb/>
             <pb n="275"/>
            not attempt to inflict even on the greatest offenders. That <lb/>
            it may not be thought I am slandering him, read me the <lb/>
            depositions.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Depositions.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>To get up so serious and formidable a charge against me <lb/>
            was the act, not of a good-natured person, but of a conspirator <lb/>
            and a ruffian. After this, instead of the name of Bœotus <lb/>
            which my father gave him, as the witnesses have proved to <lb/>
            you, upon my father's death he entered his name as Manti­ <lb/>
            theus in the register of our fellow-townsmen, and then, <lb/>
            having for his address the same father aud the same town­ <lb/>
            ship as myself, be not only set aside the judgment in this <lb/>
            action in which I am now suing him, but, when you had <lb/>
            elected me to command the division of my tribe, he came <lb/>
            himself to the court to pass his probation, and, when a judg­ <lb/>
            ment had been given against him in an ejectment suit, he <lb/>
            gave out that the judgment was not against him but against <lb/>
            me. To sum it up briefly—he annoyed me so much, that I <lb/>
            was compelled to bring an action against him for the name, <lb/>
            not with a view to get money from him, men of the jury, but <lb/>
            in order that, if it appeared to you that I was cruelly used <lb/>
            and grievously injured, the defendant might be enjoined to <lb/>
            use the name of Boeotus, which my father gave him.</p>
          <p>To show that these statements are equally true with the <lb/>
            rest, please to take the depositions which relate to them.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Depositions.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Here is another thing he has done. I was out on service, <lb/>
            and had enlisted mercenaries with Aminias ; I raised money <lb/>
            from various quarters, and (among others) from Mytilene, <lb/>
            where I received from your state-friend Apollonides and from <lb/>
            other partisans of our commonwealth three hundred Phocaio <lb/>
            staters, which I expended upon the troops, in order that some <lb/>
            action might be performed to your and their advantage. <lb/>
            For this Bœotus goes to law with me, alleging that I had <lb/>
            recovered a debt due to my father from the Mytilenean state ; <lb/>
            his object being to serve Cammes, the tyrant of Mytilene, <lb/>
            who is both my private enemy and also the enemy of Athens. <lb/>
            That the reward which the Mytileneans voted to my father <lb/>
            was received by him in person at the time, and that no debt <note type="footnote"> T 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="276"/>
            was owing to him in Mytilene, I will prove by producing <lb/>
            a deposition of your friends.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Deposition.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I could mention many other shameful acts of which Bœotus <lb/>
            has been guilty, towards myself as well as towards some of <lb/>
            you, men of the jury; but, as the water in my glass is scanty, <lb/>
            I am compelled to pass them over. I think indeed that I <lb/>
            have already given you abundant proof, that the same man <lb/>
            who got up a prosecution against me involving the risk of <lb/>
            exile, and sued me for wholly unfounded demands, is not <lb/>
            likely to have attended before the arbitrator unprepared. If <lb/>
            therefore he attempts to say anything upon this point, J <lb/>
            expect that you will not listen to him.</p>
          <p>Should he say however, that he requested me to refer all <lb/>
            matters in difference to Conon son of Timotheus, and that I <lb/>
            was not willing to refer them, be assured that he will be <lb/>
            trying to impose on you. For my part, I was ready to refer <lb/>
            those matters which had received no judicial determination <lb/>
            either to Conon or to any other impartial arbitrator whom he <lb/>
            chose ; but questions which the arbitrator had decided in my <lb/>
            favour after three attendances of Boeotus before him, and <lb/>
            after hearing him in support of his claim, and upon which he <lb/>
            acquiesced in the award, as has been proved to you in <lb/>
            evidence, I thought could not with fairness be opened again. <lb/>
            For what definitive settlement could we ever have come to, <lb/>
            if I had set aside an award pronounced according to law, and <lb/>
            referred the same causes of action to another arbitrator, <lb/>
            especially when I knew so well, that, even if it is not equit­ <lb/>
            able to insist on awards against other people, it is perfectly <lb/>
            fair to deal in such a way with Bœotus. For let me ask one <lb/>
            question-If any one were to indict him as an alien for <lb/>
            assuming the rights of citizenship, alleging that my father <lb/>
            denied upon his oath that this man was his son; in answer <lb/>
            to the charge, what else could he rely upon but this, that, in <lb/>
            consequence of their mother's oath and the arbitrator's deci­ <lb/>
            sion, my father was compelled to abide by the award ? It <lb/>
            would be monstrous then, when this man has himself by <lb/>
            virtue of an arbitrator's judgment become a citizen of Athens <lb/>
            and shared the inheritance with me and obtained everything <lb/>
            which is fair and reasonable, that he should receive any <lb/>
             <pb n="277"/>
            countenance from a jury in seeking to reverse a judgment <lb/>
            against his own claim, which I obtained against him after <lb/>
            appearance and argument, and in which he has acquiesced; <lb/>
            as if, when it is for this man's advantage, awards ought to be <lb/>
            valid, but when it is not for this man's advantage, his judg­ <lb/>
            ment ought to have more effect than decisions pronounced <lb/>
            according to your laws! He is such a designing person, that <lb/>
            even this reference he did not propose with a view to ter­ <lb/>
            minate our disputes, but his object was that, as he bad <lb/>
            already carried on his knavish tricks for eleven years, so, by <lb/>
            setting aside the judgment of nonsuit pronounced for me by <lb/>
            the arbitrator, he might renew his vexatious proceedings <lb/>
            against me and elude the present action. I can give you the <lb/>
            strongest proof. He did not accept the challenge which I <lb/>
            gave him according to the laws; and before that, when I had <lb/>
            referred. the cause about the name to Xenippus, whom he <lb/>
            proposed as arbitrator, he gave him notice not to pronounce <lb/>
            an award. That my last statements are true, you shall see <lb/>
            from the deposition and the challenge.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Deposition. The Challenge.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Having declined this challenge, his purpose being to en­ <lb/>
            snare me and to delay this action for as long a time as pos­ <lb/>
            sible, he will (as I am informed) accuse not only me but my <lb/>
            father also, saying that he did him injustice in many ways to <lb/>
            gratify me. Now, men of the jury, my first request to you <lb/>
            is this-As you yourselves would deem it scandalous to be <lb/>
            defamed by your own children, on the same principle permit <lb/>
            not Bœotus to speak evil of his father. It would be shameful <lb/>
            indeed, when you yourselves abide, as honourable men should <lb/>
            do, by your convention of amnesty with persons who under <lb/>
            the oligarchy put to death without trial a large number of <lb/>
            your countrymen, that you should allow this man, who made <lb/>
            it up with my father in his lifetime and acquired advantages <lb/>
            far beyond what he was entitled to, to rip open the quarrel <lb/>
            and calumniate him. I entreat you, men of the jury, to <lb/>
            do nothing of the kind. If possible, prevent his taking this <lb/>
            course; but, if he abuse my father in spite of you, remember <lb/>
            that he proves by his own testimony that he is not the son of <lb/>
            Mantias. For true-born children, though they have dif­ <lb/>
            ferences with their fathers in their lifetime, praise them at all <lb/>
             <pb n="278"/>
            events after their death: those who pass for sons, but are not <lb/>
            the real issue of their supposed parents, easily quarrel with <lb/>
            them while they are alive, and don't scruple to speak ill of <lb/>
            them after they are dead. And besides this, consider how <lb/>
            absurd it is, that Boeotus should abuse my father for having <lb/>
            failed in his duty towards himself, when it is by my father's <lb/>
            failings that he has become a citizen of Athens. And while <lb/>
            I, who through their mother have been deprived of two-thirds <lb/>
            of my property, have still too much respect for you to speak <lb/>
            of her offensively; Bœotus is not ashamed in your presence <lb/>
            to disparage the man whom he compelled to become his <lb/>
            father: and so lost is he to all sense of propriety, that, <lb/>
            although the laws forbid the calumniating even of other <lb/>
            mens' fathers after their death, he will vilify the man whose <lb/>
            son he pretends to be-he who should have shown indig­ <lb/>
            nation if any other person had defamed him.</p>
          <p>I expect, men of the jury, that, when he is at a loss for <lb/>
            other topics, he will endeavour to abuse me and try to raise <lb/>
            a prejudice against me, by recounting how I was reared and <lb/>
            educated and married in my father's house, while he enjoyed <lb/>
            none of these advantages. I beg you to remember, that my <lb/>
            mother died leaving me a child, so that the interest of her <lb/>
            marriage portion was sufficient to rear and educate me; <lb/>
            whereas Plangon, the mother of these men, brought them up <lb/>
            at home and kept a multitude of female domestics and herself <lb/>
            lived expensively, having my father (who was under the <lb/>
            influence of his passion) to furnish the means, and she led <lb/>
            him into all kinds of extravagance ; so she must have spent <lb/>
            far more of his property than I have. I then had much more <lb/>
            reason to complain of them than they of me. Besides this, I <lb/>
            in conjunction with my father borrowed two thousand drachms <lb/>
            from Blepæus the banker for the purchase of some mines, <lb/>
            and after my father's death I shared the mines with these <lb/>
            men, but was myself compelled to pay the debt. I borrowed <lb/>
            another thousand drachms for my father's funeral from <lb/>
            Lysistratus of Thoricus, and I have paid them out of my own <lb/>
            pocket. That these statements also are true, you will see <lb/>
            from the depositions which I now put in.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Depositions.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>When in so many points they have clearly had the advantage <lb/>
            over me, shall Bœotus now, by making a fuss and a clamour <lb/>
             <pb n="279"/>
            about his grievances, deprive me also of my mother's marriage <lb/>
            portion 1 I entreat you, men of the jury, by Jupiter and the <lb/>
            Gods, not to be confounded by the clamour of my opponent. <lb/>
            He is vehement in manner, vehement and audacious, and such <lb/>
            a crafty knave, that, what he has no witnesses to prove, he <lb/>
            will say is well known to you, men of the jury ; a trick which <lb/>
            all people resort to, who have no good argument to offer. <lb/>
            Should he attempt such a trick, put him down ; expose him: <lb/>
            What any one of you does not know, don't let him fancy his <lb/>
            neighbour knows : require Bœotus to give clear proof of <lb/>
            everything he asserts, and don't let him shirk the truth by <lb/>
            saying that you know things which he is unable in the least <lb/>
            degree to substantiate. I myself, men of the jury, though <lb/>
            all of you were aware of the manner in which my father was <lb/>
            compelled to adopt these men, have sued them at law never­ <lb/>
            theless, and have produced witnesses responsible for their <lb/>
            testimony. Our risk however is not the same: for, should <lb/>
            you be imposed upon by these men, I shall not be at liberty <lb/>
            to sue again for the marriage-portion; whereas, if my <lb/>
            opponents think that the arbitrator, to whom their actions <lb/>
            were referred, was wrong in deciding for me, as at the time <lb/>
            they might have appealed to a jury, so now again they will <lb/>
            have the opportunity, if they please, of recovering their rights <lb/>
            from me before your tribunal. And I, if you abandon me, <lb/>
            (which Heaven forbid!) shall have no means of giving a <lb/>
            marriage-portion to my daughter, whose father I actually am, <lb/>
            though, if you could see her figure, you would think she was <lb/>
            not my daughter but my sister; while my opponents, if you <lb/>
            grant me redress, will pay nothing out of their own property, <lb/>
            but will return me my own out of the house, which, though <lb/>
            by our common agreement it was reserved to satisfy the <lb/>
            marriage-portion, these men have for some time past been <lb/>
            occupying alone. For it is not proper that, having a <lb/>
            marriageable daughter, I should dwell with persons of this <lb/>
            description, who not only live a profligate life themselves, but <lb/>
            bring many other persons of the same character into the <lb/>
            house; nor indeed do I consider it safe for me to abide under <lb/>
            the same roof with them; for when they have thus openly <lb/>
            conspired against me in getting up a charge before the <lb/>
            Areopagus, what poisoning or other criminal device do you <lb/>
            think they would scruple to employ ?</p><pb n="280"/>
            
          <p>Among other things-for this I just remember-they are <lb/>
            so outrageously impudent, as to have put in a deposition of <lb/>
            Crito, stating that he has purchased from me the third part <lb/>
            of the house ;the falsehood of which you will easily perceive. <lb/>
            For, in the first place, Crito does not live so economically as <lb/>
            to purchase another man's house, but with such reckless <lb/>
            extravagance that he spends other men's property as well as <lb/>
            his own. In the next place, he is not so much this man's <lb/>
            witness as my adversary on the present occasion. For, as <lb/>
            every one knows, those are witnesses, who are not concerned <lb/>
            in the subject matter of the suit; those are adversaries, who <lb/>
            have an interest in the questions upon which one goes to law <lb/>
            with them ; as is the case with Crito. Besides, men of the <lb/>
            jury, out of all your numbers, out of the multitude of people <lb/>
            living at Athens, not a single other witness has said that he <lb/>
            was present at this transaction : Timocrates only, as if he <lb/>
            were brought on the stage by a machine, deposes, that my <lb/>
            father gave a feast for Bœotus on the tenth day, he (the <lb/>
            witness) being a person of the same age as the defendant; <lb/>
            Timocrates says that he knows absolutely everything which <lb/>
            is for the advantage of these men; Timocrates now declares, <lb/>
            that he alone was with Crito when he purchased the house <lb/>
            from me. Which of you will believe this story ? No one, I <lb/>
            am sure; especially when the question in this cause is not <lb/>
            about the house, whether Crito has purchased it or not, but <lb/>
            about the marriage-portion which my mother brought to my <lb/>
            father, and which therefore the laws enable me to recover. <lb/>
            As I then have proved to you by a mass of testimony and <lb/>
            circumstantial evidence, that my mother brought a marriage- <lb/>
            portion of a talent, that I have not received it out of my <lb/>
            father's estate, and that the house was reserved by us as <lb/>
            security for its repayment, so also require the defendant to <lb/>
            prove to you, either that I do not speak the truth, or that I am <lb/>
            not entitled to recover the marriage-portion ; for these are <lb/>
            the questions upon which you have to give your verdict. If <lb/>
            Bœotus has neither credible witnesses nor proofs of any other <lb/>
            kind to offer on the matters upon which he is sued, and there­ <lb/>
            fore introduces irrelevant topics for the purpose of deceit; if <lb/>
            he blusters and talks of hardships and uses language foreign <lb/>
            to the occasion; by Jupiter and the Gods! do not tolerate <lb/>
            such behaviour; give me that redress which all the reasons I <lb/>
             <pb n="281"/>
            have urged show me to be entitled to ; and remember, that <lb/>
            it is far more just that you should by your verdict give my <lb/>
            mother's fortune to my daughter for her dowry, than that <lb/>
            Plangon and her sons, adding another injury to those which <lb/>
            they have already inflicted, should, contrary to every <lb/>
            principle of justice, deprive me of the house, which was <lb/>
            specially reserved as a security for the marriage portion.</p>

            <title type="sub">THE ARGUMENT.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE plaintiff, whose name does not appear, had married one of the two <lb/>
            daughters of Polyeuctus, an Athenian. By the marriage contract he <lb/>
            was to receive with his wife a portion of forty minas. Thirty minas <lb/>
            were given to him in ready money; the remaining ten were to be <lb/>
            paid after the death of his father in law; and Leocrates, who had <lb/>
            married the other sister and been adopted by Polyeuctus, agreed to <lb/>
            be responsible for the payment. Polyeuctus afterwards quarrelled <lb/>
            with Leocrates; an arrangement was with some difficulty effected <lb/>
            between them, Leocrates retiring out of the family, and agreeing to <lb/>
            a separation from his wife, who was transferred with her marriage <lb/>
            portion to Spudias, the present defendant. Polyeuctus then, to <lb/>
            secure the ten minas to the plaintiff, mortgaged his house to him, <lb/>
            and subsequently by his will directed that tablets of mortgage should <lb/>
            be put up. (As to these see ante, p.. 145, and also Appendix II. in <lb/>
            this Volume.)</p>
          <p>Upon the death of Polyeuctus without male issue, his estate descended <lb/>
            to his two daughters as co-heiresses. The plaintiff however, in his <lb/>
            own and in his wife's right, had certain demands upon the defendant, <lb/>
            which by this action he sought to enforce. In the first place, he <lb/>
            claimed the ten minas, the residue of his wife's portion, secured by <lb/>
            the mortgage of the house. He claimed also half a mina, as the <lb/>
            defendant's contribution to a funeral sacrifice, offered in honour of <lb/>
            their father in law. Further, he required that two several sums of <lb/>
            eighteen minas and two minas, one of which Spudias had borrowed <lb/>
            of his mother in law, and the other he owed to Polyeuctus for the <lb/>
            purchase of a slave, should be paid by him to the estate, or brought <lb/>
            into the general account; together with certain articles of property <lb/>
            which he had borrowed and never returned.</p>
          <p>The plaintiff supports his claim by the production of various depo' <lb/>
            sitions, by the will of Polyeuctus, and by certain sealed papers which <lb/>
            had been left by his mother in law. We collect in some measure <lb/>
            from the plaintiff's speech, what the defendant's answer to the claim <lb/>
            was. Spudias contended that Polyeuctus and his wife were acting <lb/>
            under undue influence, and gave an unjust preference to the plaintiff <lb/>
             <pb n="282"/>
            He denied the truth of the charges made against himself, as well as <lb/>
            the plaintiff's title to the ten miuas, and with respect to that part of <lb/>
            the claim he alleged in particular, that he himself had only received <lb/>
            thirty minas in money as his wife's portion, the rest being made up <lb/>
            of dress and ornaments, to which the plaintiff had received an equi­ <lb/>
            valent in value, and therefore, if the plaintiff's demand were allowed, <lb/>
            he (Spudias) would not have his equal share of the inheritance. The <lb/>
            plaintiff's arguments are partly directed to meet these points of <lb/>
            defence, which (he contends) are false in fact and bad in law.</p>
          <p>SPUDIAS the defendant and I, men of the jury, are married to <lb/>
            two sisters, the daughters of Polyeuctus. He having died <lb/>
            without male issue, I am compelled to go to law with the <lb/>
            defendant about the property which has been left. And if, <lb/>
            men of the jury, I had not been perfectly willing and made <lb/>
            every endeavour to come to a settlement and refer our dif­ <lb/>
            ferences to friends, I should have blamed myself for not sub­ <lb/>
            mitting to a trifling loss rather than engaging in a trouble­ <lb/>
            some lawsuit. But, the more kindness and forbearance I <lb/>
            showed in discussing the matter with Spudias, the more con­ <lb/>
            temptuously he treated me. And now, I apprehend, I am <lb/>
            not in the same position that he is with regard to the present <lb/>
            trial. The defendant takes it easily, being accustomed to <lb/>
            come often before you here : I am afraid that, through my <lb/>
            inexperience, I may not be able even to explain the case to <lb/>
            you. However, men of the jury, I pray your attention.</p>
          <p>Polyeuctus was a member of the Thriasian township ; per­ <lb/>
            haps some of you may have heard of him. This Polyeuctus, <lb/>
            as he had no male issue, adopts Leocrates, the brother of his <lb/>
            wife. Having two daughters by the sister of Leocrates, he <lb/>
            gives the elder to me with a portion of forty minas, and the <lb/>
            younger to Leocrates. So things stood, when a quarrel took <lb/>
            place between Polyeuctus and Leocrates, the nature of which <lb/>
            there is no need to mention, and Polyeuctus takes away his <lb/>
            daughter and gives her to Spudias the defendant. Leocrates, <lb/>
            in high dudgeon, commenced actions against Polyeuctus and <lb/>
            Spudias, and they were called upon to meet all the claims <lb/>
            that he advanced against them. At length however they <lb/>
            came to a settlement, upon the terms that Leocrates should <lb/>
            receive back all that he had brought into the estate, that he <lb/>
            should be reconciled to Polyeuctus, and that they should give <lb/>
            mutual releases from all demands. Why, men of the jury, <lb/>
            have I stated these facts to you ? Because I did not receive <lb/>
             <pb n="283"/>
            the whole of my wife's portion, but a thousand drachms were <lb/>
            left unpaid, with the assurance that I should have them on <lb/>
            the death of Polyeuctus; and, so long as Leocrates was the <lb/>
            heir of Polyeuctus, he was responsible to me for the payment <lb/>
            of the debt; but, when Leocrates had quitted the family, and <lb/>
            Polyeuctus was dangerously ill, then, men of the jury, I got a <lb/>
            mortgage for ten minas upon this house, of which Spudias <lb/>
            prevents me receiving the rents.</p>
          <p>I will first produce the witnesses who were present, when <lb/>
            Polyeuctus contracted to give me his daughter with a por­ <lb/>
            tion of forty minas: then I will prove that I received it less <lb/>
            a thousand drachms; and further, that Polyeuctus always <lb/>
            admitted that he owed me that sum, and introduced Leo­ <lb/>
            crates to me as a party jointly liable,1 and that at the last he <lb/>
            directed by his will, that tablets should be put on the house <lb/>
            for a thousand drachms owing to me in respect of my wife's <lb/>
            portion. Call me the witnesses.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">[The Witnesses.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>This, men of the jury, is one of the claims which I make <lb/>
            against Spudias. And in support of it what stronger or more <lb/>
            convincing argument could I have brought before you than <lb/>
            the law, which expressly declares, that there shall be no right <lb/>
            of action for property which people have mortgaged, neither <lb/>
            for them nor for their heirs? Nevertheless Spudias is come <lb/>
            here to contest this point of law. My next claim, men of <lb/>
            the jury, is the following. Aristogenes has deposed, that <lb/>
            Polyeuctus on his death-bed claimed two minas as owing to <lb/>
            him from Spudias, with interest; (it was the price of a <lb/>
            domestic servant, whom the defendant had purchased of <lb/>
            Polyeuctus, but neither paid him the money nor has brought <lb/>
            it now into the general account: 2) and there are also eighteen <lb/>
            hundred drachms, as to which I have not the least idea what <lb/>
            he can nave to say. He had borrowed the money from the <lb/>
            wife of Polyeuctus, and there are some papers which she left <note type="footnote"> 1 Or, as guarantee; or the party to whom I was to look for payment <lb/>

            as to every particular, that there might be no unpleasantness <lb/>
            between us. It is shameful and cruel, men of the jury, when <lb/>
            for everything which I either bought of Polyeuctus or had <lb/>
            from his wife I have paid the price with interest, and when <lb/>
            now I bring everything which I owed into the general ac­ <lb/>

            nor the will of Polyeuctus nor the papers which have been <lb/>
            left nor the witnesses who know the facts, but should have <lb/>
            come in the face of all this to contest my demand.</p>

            shall be no right of action for mortgaged property against <lb/>

          <p>I will now, men of the jury, explain to you the particulars <lb/>
            of my other claims. They received from the wife of Polyeuc­ <lb/>
            tus a plate, which they pawned with some jewellery, and this <lb/>
            they have not redeemed and brought into the account, as <lb/>
            Demophilus, to whom it was pawned, will testify. And a <lb/>
            parasol1 which they have taken-this they don't account <lb/>
            for; and there are some more articles of the same kind. <lb/>
            And lastly, though my wife advanced a mina in silver, to <lb/>
            defray the expenses of a funeral offering 2 for her father, even <lb/>
            of this he refuses to contribute his share: but this is the way <lb/>
            he proceeds-what is justly his own he has either had before­ <lb/>
            hand, or will receive in the partition of the property; his <lb/>
            liabilities he openly refuses to discharged <note type="footnote"> 1 So Harpocration interprets <foreign xml:lang="grc">σκηνὴν</foreign> in this passage. Pabst and <lb/>

          <p>Perhaps, men of the jury, Spudias will not contest these <lb/>
            facts; indeed he will not be able, clever as he is: but he will <lb/>
            accuse Polyeuctus and his wife, and say that they did all <lb/>
            these things to favour me and under my influence, and that <lb/>
            in fact he has been seriously injured in other ways, and has <lb/>
            brought an action against me: for this he attempted to say <lb/>
            before the arbitrator. I beg to say, men of the jury, that, in <lb/>
            the first place, I don't consider a defence of this kind to be <lb/>
            legitimate: it is not proper, when a case is clearly made out <lb/>
            against a party, that he should shift the ground and resort to <lb/>
            recrimination and calumny: for his cross-demands, if he has <lb/>
            any cause of complaint, he will of course recover satisfaction; <lb/>
            for the claims made on him he is to give satisfaction. How <lb/>
            could I now defend myself against the slanders of my oppo­ <lb/>
            nents, and pass by the questions upon which you have to <lb/>
            give your verdict? In the next place, I wonder, if he had a <lb/>
            true and just demand, how it happened that, when our <lb/>
            friends wished to reconcile us and many discussions took <lb/>
            place on the subject, he could not agree to abide by their <lb/>
            decision. Who could so easily have exposed what was <lb/>
            frivolous either in his claims or in mine, as persons who were <lb/>
            present at all these transactions, who knew the facts as well <lb/>
            as ourselves, and who were impartial judges and friends of <lb/>
            both 1 But it evidently did not suit the defendant's interest, <lb/>
            to come to a settlement in this way, and be exposed and <lb/>
            convicted by our friends. For don't imagine, men of the jury, <lb/>
            that the persons who knew all these facts, and who now at the <lb/>
            risk of their responsibility give testimony in my favour, had <lb/>
            formed any different opinion then, when they were not even <lb/>
            on their oaths.1 <note type="footnote"> example, his wife's marriage portion: <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν δὲ τὰ μέρη κομίζεται</foreign>, the <lb/>

            father's estate: <foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ δὲ οὐκ ἀποδίδωσιν</foreign>, the claims made on him by the <lb/>
            plaintiff; viz. the ten minas and a half due to himself, and the twenty <lb/>

            estate. </note><note type="footnote"> I Schäfer condemns the reading of <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδ᾽ ὀμόσαντας</foreign>, on the ground <lb/>
            that arbitrators were always sworn, and himself adopts the reading </note> <pb n="286"/>
             </p>
          <p>Supposing I had none of these points to help my case, <lb/>
            even then it is easy to see which of us gives the true account <lb/>
            of the matter. With respect to the house, if he says that it <lb/>
            was under my influence that Polyeuctus ordered the hypothe­ <lb/>
            cation for the thousand drachms—well, Spudias! but surely <lb/>
            I did not influence the witnesses to give false testimony for <lb/>
            me—those witnesses who were present when he promised me <lb/>
            his daughter, who knew that I did not receive the whole of <lb/>
            the marriage-portion, who heard him acknowledge himself in <lb/>
            my debt and also introduce the party who was to pay, and <lb/>
            who lastly were present at the making of the will. With all <lb/>
            these persons the question was no longer whether they would <lb/>
            favour me, but whether they would risk a charge of false <lb/>
            testimony by deposing to what never occurred.</p>
          <p>But let us have done with that matter. What will you <lb/>
            say to this, Spudias ? Mind that you give a satisfactory ex­ <lb/>
            planation to the jury. If he does not, demand it of him, one <lb/>
            and all of you. I say that, when Polyeuctus gave this testa­ <lb/>
            mentary direction, the defendant's wife was present, and of <lb/>
            course she reported to him the will of her father, especially if <lb/>
            he did not take an equal share, but it was to his disadvantage <lb/>
            in all respects. And the defendant himself was invited to <lb/>
            attend, so that he cannot say it was a clandestine transaction <lb/>
            and contrived by us behind their backs. When he was asked <lb/>
            to come, he said he was engaged himself, but it would be <lb/>
            sufficient for his wife to be there. What further have I to <lb/>
            mention 1 Aristogenes gave him a full report of what had <lb/>
            been done, and even then he made no remark about it, but, <lb/>
            though Polyeuctus lived after that more than five days, he <lb/>
            neither expressed dissatisfaction when he went to the house, <lb/>
            nor made any remonstrance, nor did his wife, who was present <note type="footnote"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁμολογήσαντας</foreign>, translating " aliud quid consensu pronuntiâsse.” But <lb/>
            Schäfer is in error in supposing that there was an award pronounced. <lb/>
            Assuming that there was a reference to private arbitration, which is <lb/>
            not quite certain, (for these meetings of friends, <foreign xml:lang="grc">βουλομένων διαλύειν</foreign>, <lb/>
            may have been without any formal reference,) at all events the sub­ <lb/>
            mission was revoked before any award was given, as is clear from the <lb/>
            words <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐχ οἷός</foreign> r' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἦν ἐμμένειν οἷς ἐκεῖνοι ϒνοῖεν</foreign>. There was indeed a <lb/>
            hearing before a public arbitrator, <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὸς</foreign> To <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαιτητῇ</foreign>, (1031,) but that is <lb/>
            another affair. </note><note type="footnote"> In my opinion <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐδ' ὀμόσαντας</foreign> is the true reading; otherwise there is <lb/>

             <pb n="287"/>
            at all of it from the beginning. It appears then now, this <lb/>
            was not an act done by Polyeuctus under my influence to <lb/>
            favour me; it was the act rather of you yourselves. Bear <lb/>
            these facts clearly in your minds, men of the jury, and, if he <lb/>
            should attempt to give a false colour to the affair, oppose <lb/>
            them to his calumnies. First however, that you may be per­ <lb/>
            fectly convinced of the accuracy of my statements, hear the <lb/>
            witnesses. Read.</p>

            <title type="sub">[The Witnesses.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>You see, men of the jury, with respect to the thousand <lb/>
            drachms—that Polyeuctus mortgaged the house to me bond <lb/>
            fide, and for an existing debt to that amount, I have the <lb/>
            testimony, not only of the other witnesses whose depositions <lb/>
            are put in, but of the defendant himself and his wife, by their <lb/>
            acquiescing at the time, and making no objection either to <lb/>
            Polyeuctus, who survived so many days, or to Aristogenes <lb/>
            when they first heard of the will. If the house however was <lb/>
            honestly mortgaged, it is impossible that, having regard to <lb/>
            the law, you can acquit Spudias as to this part of the case. <lb/>
            Now look at the question of the twenty minas, which he does <lb/>
            not bring into the account. Here again the defendant him­ <lb/>
            self will be my strongest witness, not by words indeed, as <lb/>
            now, when he is making out a case for his defence 1 —(words <lb/>
            are a poor criterion of the truth)—but by an unmistakeable <lb/>
            act. By doing what, men of the jury? Pray give your <lb/>
            attention to this, so that, if he should dare to utter any <note type="footnote"> 1 I am not satisfied with any of the interpretations hitherto given of <lb/>
            this obscure passage, and I offer my own with diffidence. The orator <lb/>
            seems to have sacrificed clearness to brevity. The full expression of <lb/>
            his meaning (as I take it) should have been—<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὥσπερ νῦν μάρτυς ἔστα. <lb/>
            ἑαυτψ̑</foreign>, and the meaning is as follows — Spudias has given evidence for <lb/>
            me by his acts, not by his words merely. There is not much in words; <lb/>
            a man may say one thing at one time, and another at another: As <lb/>
            Spudias may formerly have made statements in my favour, so now he <lb/>
            may make statements to support his own case, and probably will do so, <lb/>
            for want of other witnesses. But acts are evidence which he cannot <lb/>
            alter or get rid of. </note><note type="footnote"> Such is the best sense that I can make of it. Pabst translates <lb/>
            it thus: </note><note type="footnote"> " Hier nämlich wird er mir selbst wieder den vollgiiltigsten Zeugen <lb/>
            abgeben, zwar nicht durch förmliche Aussage, indem er ja mein Gegner <lb/>

            calumnies about the mother of our wives or about the docu­ <lb/>
            ments, your acquaintance with the facts may prevent your <lb/>
            being deceived by his representations. These papers were <lb/>
            left by the wife of Polyeuctus, as I said just now. The seals <lb/>
            being acknowledged by the defendant's wife as well as by <lb/>
            mine, we, being both present, opened them and took copies, <lb/>
            then sealed them again and deposited them with Aristogenes. <lb/>
            Now mark this, men of the jury—mark this, I entreat you. <lb/>
            There was mention in the papers of the two minas, the price <lb/>
            of the servant; and it was not only Polyeuctus who had <lb/>
            claimed it on his death-bed. There was mention also of the <lb/>
            eighteen hundred drachms. When he read that entry, if it <lb/>
            had nothing to do with him and was untrue, why, I ask, did <lb/>
            he not immediately complain ? Why did he join in sealing <lb/>
            up again papers which were false and of no value ? Surely <lb/>
            no one would do this, who did not assent to all the state­ <lb/>
            ments. But surely, men of the jury, it is monstrous, if these <lb/>
            persons are allowed to dispute now what they have themselves <lb/>
            assented to, and you are not influenced by this consideration, <lb/>
            that it is the custom with all of us, when demands are made <lb/>
            which are unjust and untrue, not to be silent, but to dispute <lb/>
            them on the instant, and those who fail to do so, if they con­ <lb/>
            test them afterwards, are thought to be rogues and shufflers. <lb/>
            Spudias knows this as well as I do; nay, he must know it a <lb/>
            great deal better, because he comes much more frequently to <lb/>
            your tribunal; and yet he is not ashamed to make assertions <lb/>
            inconsistent with all his acts. It often happens that you, on <lb/>
            discovering a single piece of fraud, treat it as evidence against <lb/>
            the whole case : but the defendant is convicted by himself of <lb/>
            falsehood in every point.</p>
          <p>Please to take the depositions, showing that the seals of the <lb/>
            papers were acknowledged at the time by this man's wife, and <lb/>
            that they are now deposited sealed by Spudias.</p>

          <p>As these facts have been so fully established, there is no <lb/>
            necessity, I should, think, to add another word : for, when I <lb/>
            am able to produce both laws and witnesses in support of all <lb/>
            my statements, and also an admission in my favour made by <lb/>
            my adversary himself, what further need can there be for a <lb/>
            long speech? However, if Spudias complains about the <lb/>
             <pb n="289"/>
            marriage portion, and says that he should be losing his fail <lb/>
            share if I got the thousand drachms, he will tell you an un­ <lb/>
            truth : for, while he disputes my right to that money, he <lb/>
            has received more, and not less, than I have, as you will see <lb/>
            in a minute. Supposing him even to be correct in his <lb/>
            assertions, surely, if the laws are good for anything, I ought <lb/>
            not to lose the marriage portion which was promised me; nor <lb/>
            can it be just, if Polyeuctus chose to give a larger fortune to <lb/>
            one daughter and a smaller to the other, that his purpose <lb/>
            should now be thwarted: for it was in your own power, <lb/>
            Spudias, not to marry his daughter, unless he gave the thou­ <lb/>
            sand drachms to you as well as me. However, you received <lb/>
            as much as I did with your wife, as I will show.</p>
          <p>Please first to take the deposition, showing the terms of <lb/>
            the marriage contract.</p>

            <title type="sub">[The Deposition.]</title>
          </ab>
          <p>How has he received as much as I have, (it may be asked,) <lb/>
            if in his case the valuation of the jewellery and apparel <lb/>
            (taken at a thousand drachms) was included in the forty <lb/>
            minas,1 while I get the ten minas as a distinct and additional <lb/>
            payment ? This I am now going to explain. Spudias, men <lb/>
            of the jury, received his wife from Leocrates with the <lb/>
            jewellery and apparel, which Polyeuctus valued to Leocrates <lb/>
            at something more than a thousand drachms. What I have <lb/>
            had sent to me by Polyeuctus independently of the marriage <lb/>
            portion, if you will only set it down against the articles <lb/>
            given to Spudias, you will find to be pretty nearly equal to <lb/>
            them, independently of those valued at the thousand drachms.2 <note type="footnote"> 1 Pabst construes this sentence differently— </note><note type="footnote"> " Wenn ihm das Goldgeschmeide zu vierzig Minen, und die Kleider <lb/>

            to her, and for which Polyeuctus paid to Leocrates their estimated <lb/>
            value, a little more than ten minas. In addition to this he received <lb/>
            from his father in law certain marriage presents, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ τούτψ</foreign> <unclear>δoθτα</unclear>,) <lb/>
            equal in value to what I received independently of the dowry. The <lb/>
            result is that, when I receive the ten minas, which were left unpaid, I <lb/>
            shall have no more than Spudias, and indeed less, as the ornaments <lb/>
            given up by Leocrates cost Polyeuctus somewhat more than the tell. <lb/>

            It was but fair therefore that the valuation of these articles <lb/>
            should be included in the forty minas, as he had paid <lb/>
            Leocrates for them, and they exceeded what were given <lb/>

          <p>Is it not manifest, that the defendant has received forty <lb/>
            minas for his wife's portion long ago, whilst I have received <lb/>
            thirty minas, as he has, but, so far from having afterwards <lb/>
            got the thousand drachms, I am now contesting the question <lb/>
            whether I have not received them wrongfully? It was for <lb/>
            this reason, men of the jury, that Spudias would not leave <lb/>
            the settlement of our disputes to the decision of friends, be­ <lb/>

            for, as they were present at all these transactions and knew <lb/>

            have laid my whole case before you as clearly as I was able <lb/>

            acquainted with the facts, thinking that it would have been <lb/>
            out of his power to give them a false account. Don't you <lb/>
            permit him any more than they would have done, to give <lb/>
            utterance to lies and calumnies; but keep in mind what <lb/>

          <p>THIS was a proceeding arising out of that remarkable regulation of the. <lb/>
            Athenian law, called the Exchange of estates; whereby a person <lb/>
            burthened with one of the public offices, as the trierarchy, or in­ <lb/>
            cluded in one of the higher classes of tax-payers, or in the select <lb/>
            body of Three-hundred, was enabled to obtain relief, by requiring <lb/>
            some richer person than himself either to take the public burden in <lb/>
            his stead or to exchange properties with him. A summary of the <lb/>
            law upon the subject has been given in the first Volume of this <lb/>
            Translation, Appendices IV and V. The reader will find it more <lb/>
            fully discussed in Böckh’s Public Economy of Athens, and may <lb/>
            compare what I have said upon one branch of the subject in the note <lb/>
            to page 116 of this Volume.</p>
          <p>The complainant in the present case, whose name does not appear, had <lb/>
            for some time been included in the select body of Three-hundred, <lb/>
            who were not only subject to the highest rate of assessment to the <lb/>
            property-tax, but were called upon, in case of necessity, to pay the <lb/>
            whole tax in advance. Having lost three talents by the forfeiture of <lb/>
            a mine, and sustained other misfortunes in his business, it became <lb/>
            necessary for him to seek the relief which the law afforded. Ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly, at the court held by the Generals in the month of <lb/>
            Metagitnion, he applied for relief, and named Phænippns as a person <lb/>
            who ought to be substituted in his stead. Notice of the intended <lb/>
            appeal had of course been given to Phænippus; and he attended at <lb/>
            the court, and disputed his liability. To determine whether he was <lb/>
            liable or not, (which question, if not amicably settled, must in due <lb/>
            course be brought before a jury,) an account had to be taken of the <lb/>
            estates of both parties, of what they respectively consisted, and their <lb/>
            comparative values. Each was obliged to give to the other a schedule <lb/>
            or inventory of all that he possessed; and each had a right to inspect <lb/>
            and examine the lands, goods, and chattels of his opponent, so that <lb/>
            no fraud, by way of removal or otherwise, might be practised in the <lb/>
            interval before the final hearing of the case. The complainant <lb/>
            availed himself of this right without delay, and proceeded to a farm <lb/>
            which Phænippus possessed in the district of Cytherus. It was of <lb/>
            considerable extent, being more than five miles in circumference. <lb/>
            He went all round it with witnesses, and bade them take notice, that <lb/>
            there were no tablets of mortgage put up on the land. At the <lb/>
            mansion or farm-house he put his seals on the doors, got the neces­ <lb/>
            sary information about the farming stock; finding that there was a <note type="footnote"> U 2 </note> <pb n="292"/>
             <unclear/><lb/>
            arge quantity of timber on the land, he gave special notice that <lb/>
            none should be carried away, left some servants of his own to keep <lb/>
            watch on the premises, and desired Phænippus to make a similar <lb/>
            examination of his (the complainant's) property.</p>
          <p>On the eleventh day of the following month (Boedromion) the parties <lb/>
            were sworn to furnish true accounts. They were bound by law to <lb/>
            deliver their inventories in three days after. Phænippus however <lb/>
            made some overture for an accommodation, and obtained an enlarge­ <lb/>
            ment of the time. It was arranged that the parties should meet on the <lb/>
            twenty-third of Boedromion, to see if they could come to a settlement, <lb/>
            and that Phænippus should deliver his inventory on the twenty-fifth <lb/>
            This arrangement was not carried out; for Phænippus failed to <lb/>
            attend the meeting, or to deliver his inventory on the day appointed; <lb/>
            consequently there was no alternative but to prepare for trial. A day <lb/>
            was appointed for it, and Phænippus gave in a schedule of his effects <lb/>
            three days before.</p>
          <p>At the trial the important thing to be shown on behalf of the com­ <lb/>
            plainant was, that his adversary's estate so far exceeded his own in <lb/>
            value, as to give him an equitable right to the interference of the <lb/>
            court. If he could not establish this satisfactorily, the complaint <lb/>
            would be dismissed: if he did establish it, then, as we know, the <lb/>
            respondent would have the option, either to take the petitioner's <lb/>
            place among the Three-hundred, or to make an exchange of proper­ <lb/>
            ties with him. If he chose the former, it was a simple affair; if the <lb/>
            latter, a variety of questions might arise as to the best mode of <lb/>
            carrying out the exchange, and with respect to the accounts which <lb/>
            each party had given in, whether they were full and correct, or <lb/>
            whether there had been any mistake or misrepresentation or conceal­ <lb/>
            ment. In our dearth of information upon these points, we are <lb/>
            unable to ascertain how far the same court which first decreed relief <lb/>
            was competent to decide upon these ulterior questions; or whether <lb/>
            it was the practice to grant adjournments, or impanel another jury, <lb/>
            for the purpose of any further direction. It is, not improbable how­ <lb/>
            ever, that the disclosure of facts which took place upon the first <lb/>
            inquiry, or the expression of an opinion thereupon by the jury, <lb/>
            would frequently induce the parties to come to a settlement out of <lb/>
            court.</p>
          <p>In the present case the speaker labours to show that the property of <lb/>
            Phaenippus was considerably greater than his own, and that he had <lb/>
            resorted to illegal and unfair devices to conceal its amount. He had <lb/>
            delayed the trial, and kept back his inventory until the last three <lb/>
            days, evidently for a dishonest purpose. In the meantime he had <lb/>
            broken the seals which had been placed on the doors of the farm- <lb/>
            house; he had carried away corn, wine, timber, and other things; he <lb/>
            had set up notices of mortgage on the land, which were not there when <lb/>
            the complainant first examined it, and he had made out a fraudulent <lb/>
            inventory, pretending that his estate was subject to debts, all of <lb/>
            which were purely fictitious.</p>
          <p>The complainant urges his claim to relief on account of the misfortunes <lb/>
            which he had incurred in his mining speculations. While the mining <lb/>
            interest had been greatly depressed, the agriculturist class, to which <lb/>
             <pb n="293"/>
            Phænippus belonged, had been enjoying a high degree of prosperity <lb/>
            It was but fair that the burden should be transferred from a dis­ <lb/>
            tressed party to one who was better able to bear it. Phænippus had <lb/>
            inherited two estates, each of which had formerly done duty to the <lb/>
            commonwealth; since he had become possessed of them, though he <lb/>
            had himself lived in luxury, he had contrived to shirk the taxes and <lb/>
            official services. Public policy required, that he should be compelled <lb/>
            to contribute, in respect of his property, to the public charges; and <lb/>
            he should not be allowed to escape by means of such tricks as he had <lb/>
            endeavoured to practise on the complainant.</p>
          <p>Phænippus appears to have brought counter-charges against his oppo­ <lb/>
            nent, and (among other things) objected that he had omitted from <lb/>
            his inventory the mines, which should have been offered with the <lb/>
            rest of his effects for the exchange. The complainant answers, that <lb/>
            this was in accordance with the Athenian law, as mines, being the <lb/>
            property of the state, were not subject to property-tax, and not <lb/>
            transferable under the exchange. In proof of this he cites the <lb/>
            statute itself (upon which the reader will find Böckh’s and Becker's <lb/>
            observations in a note). As there was an appearance of unfairness in <lb/>
            this regulation, and the complainant feared perhaps that a prejudice <lb/>
            might be raised against him in the minds of the jury, he seeks to <lb/>
            remove this by making an equitable proposal. “If”—says he­ <lb/>
            " Phænippus will give me his land free from the pretended incum­ <lb/>
            brances, and will bring back the things which he has fraudulently <lb/>
            removed from the farm, I will include my mine-property in the <lb/>
            exchange." The very making of this offer seems to show the uncer­ <lb/>
            tainty of the Athenian law; or perhaps it implies a doubt in the <lb/>
            speakers mind as to his ability to prove the charges which he had <lb/>
            made against Phænippus; and it may have been a bold stroke to <lb/>
            drive him to a compromise.</p>
          <p>The speech, though valuable for the light which it throws upon a very <lb/>
            obscure subject, is feeble in its composition, and the best critics <lb/>
            have refused to recognise it as one of the genuine works of De­ <lb/>
            mosthenes.</p>
          <p>BLESSINGS, men of the jury, upon all of you, and in par­ <lb/>
            ticular upon Solon, who established the law respecting the <lb/>
            exchange of estates. For if he had not clearly defined to us <lb/>
            what is the first thing to be done by persons who tender the <lb/>
            exchange, what the second, and so on, I cannot tell how far <lb/>
            the audacity of the respondent Phænippus would have gone, <lb/>
            when even now, notwithstanding that everything is pre­ <lb/>
            scribed to us by the law, he has disregarded its just enact­ <lb/>
            ments, and instead of giving me the inventory of his property <lb/>
            according to law within three days after he was sworn, or, if <lb/>
            he did not like that, giving it at least on the twenty-fifth <lb/>
            day of the month Boedromion, which he got me to appoint <lb/>
            and on which he promised to deliver the inventory-instead <lb/>
             <pb n="294"/>
            of doing either the one or the other, he treated both me <lb/>
            and the law with contempt, and delivered it in the second <lb/>
            month, only two or three days before the cause was brought <lb/>
            into court, and kept out of the way all the remainder of the <lb/>
            time: and again, instead of leaving the seals which I had <lb/>
            put upon the buildings undisturbed, he went into the coun­ <lb/>
            try and opened them, and carried away the barley and other <lb/>
            things, as if the law had given him liberty to do whatever <lb/>
            he pleases, not that which is right and just.</p>
          <p>For my own part, men of the jury, I should have been <lb/>
            only too glad to see myself in prosperous circumstances, as I <lb/>
            used to be, and remaining in the body of Three-hundred: <lb/>
            but, since I have shared the general misfortunes of all those <lb/>
            engaged in the works, and have also incurred special losses <lb/>
            of a ruinous nature in my own business, and now on this <lb/>
            last occasion I have to pay to the state three talents, a talent <lb/>
            for every share—(for I was a partner, I am sorry to say, in <lb/>
            the confiscated mine)1—I am under the necessity of endea­ <lb/>
            vouring to substitute in my place a man who is richer than <lb/>
            myself, and indeed always was richer, and who has never <lb/>
            served any public office or contributed anything to the pro­ <lb/>
            perty tax. I therefore entreat of you all, men of the jury, <lb/>
            that, if I prove the respondent Phænippus to have trans­ <lb/>
            gressed the regulations of the law and to be a richer person <lb/>
            than myself, you will afford me relief, and place him in my <lb/>
            stead in the list of the Three-hundred: for it is on this <lb/>
            account that the laws every year allow the tendering of the <lb/>
            exchange, because it is a rare thing that any of our citizens can <lb/>
            permanently maintain their prosperity. I will tell you all that <lb/>
            has taken place concerning the exchange from the beginning.</p>
          <p>On the second day of the month Metagitnion, men of the <lb/>
            jury, the Generals.held a court for proposing the exchanges <lb/>
            to the Three-hundred. At this court I cited the re­ <lb/>
            spondent Phænippus according to law. Having cited him, <lb/>
            I took with me some of my friends and relations and pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded to Cytherus, to his farm on the borders.2 And first <note type="footnote"> 1 The mine having been forfeited to the state, probably for non­ <lb/>
            payment of rent, the speaker had to pay this money to obtain a <lb/>
            re-grant of it. </note><note type="footnote"> See Böckh, on the Silver Mines of Laurium, pages 467, 479 (trans­ <lb/>

             <pb n="295"/>
            I led them round the farm, a circuit of more than forty <lb/>
            furlongs, and I pointed but to them in the presence of Phæ­ <lb/>
            nippus, and requested them to take notice, that there was no <lb/>
            tablet of mortgage on the boundary; and I required Phæ­ <lb/>
            nippus, if he said there was any, to declare it at once and <lb/>
            show it to us; for I was anxious that no debt should rise <lb/>
            up on the estate at a later period. Then I sealed the <lb/>
            buildings, and required Phsenippus to come and inspect my <lb/>
            property. After that I asked him, where his threshed corn <lb/>
            was; for, by the Gods and Goddesses,1 men of the jury, <lb/>
            there were two barns on the farm, each of them nearly a <lb/>
            hundred feet in circumference. He replied, that part of the <lb/>
            corn was sold, part laid up in the granary. At length— <lb/>
            that I may not be tedious—I put some persons inside to <lb/>
            watch, and, by Jupiter, I gave notice to the ass-drivers, and <lb/>
            stopped them carrying timber off the land; (for, among <lb/>
            other sources of wealth which Phænippus enjoys, this also <lb/>
            brings him a large revenue, men of the jury; he has six <lb/>
            asses carrying wood all the year round, and he receives more <lb/>
            than twelve drachms a day;) I told the ass-drivers, as I say, <lb/>
            not to touch the wood, and then, after giving notice to <lb/>
            Phænippus to attend the sacrifice 2 according to law, I went <lb/>
            back to the city.</p>
          <p>I will first produce to you the evidence in support of these <lb/>
            statements, and then you shall hear the other facts of the <lb/>
            case fully and accurately. You will find, men of the jury, <lb/>
            that Phænippus began from the very first day to set justice <lb/>
            at defiance. I sealed up the buildings, as the law had <lb/>
            allowed me; he unsealed them. And he acknowledges <lb/>
            having removed the seal, but does not acknowledge that he <lb/>
            opened the door, as if he removed the seals for any other <lb/>
            purpose but to open the doors.</p>
          <p>Again, I gave notice that no wood should be carried <lb/>
            away; he carried it away every day except that on which <lb/>
            I gave the notice. There was no debt charged upon the <note type="footnote"> 1 “Formula jurisjurandi non magis, opinor, Demosthenica, quam <lb/>

          <p>The wrongs which Phænippus began to do me on the very <lb/>
            first day after the citation you have heard, men of the jury, <lb/>
            both from me and from the witnesses. His subsequent con­ <lb/>
            duct goes beyond this; it is an offence not only against me <lb/>
            but against the laws, which you are all bound to vindicate.</p>
          <p>After he had sworn on the eleventh of the month Boe­ <lb/>
            dromion to give a true and just inventory of his effects, the <lb/>
            law expressly declaring that the inventory shall be given <lb/>
            within three days after the day of the oath, he came up to <lb/>
            me at the court, with Polyeuctus of Crioa and some other <lb/>
            persons, and requested me, first, to meet him and see if we <lb/>
            could settle the matter, assuring me that he would do every­ <lb/>
            thing that was right; secondly, to give him time for making <lb/>
            out the inventory, but he only asked a few days, for he was <lb/>
            aware of my position. As I considered it became a respectable <lb/>
            citizen, who eschewed quarrels and offences, not to rush head­ <lb/>
            long into a court of law, I gave my consent, (for I need not <lb/>
            dwell upon the details,) that the meeting for a settlement <lb/>
            should be on the twenty-third of the month Boedromion, and <lb/>
            the inventory of effects should be given on the twenty-fifth.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding that he had obtained both his requests <lb/>
            from me, Phænippus did not attend on either of those days; <lb/>
            and now he appears before you as the violator not of one law <lb/>
            only, but of two laws : first, that which requires a man to <lb/>
            deliver the inventory of his effects within three days after he <lb/>
            has been sworn, secondly, that which declares that mutual <lb/>
            covenants, entered into in the presence of witnesses, shall be <lb/>
            valid. Why, there is not one of you, men of the jury, who <lb/>
            does not know, that the day prescribed by law and the day <lb/>
            agreed to by the parties are equally necessary to be observed. <lb/>
            It frequently happens that, although the thirtieth day is <lb/>
            prescribed by statute, we appoint another for ourselves by <lb/>
            consent, and in every office the magistrates put off trials and <lb/>
            other proceedings for the parties, upon their mutually con- <lb/>
             <pb n="297"/>
            Benting.1 Should any party think proper to repudiate such <lb/>
            an arrangement, you would regard him as a most odious <lb/>
            pettifogger. Yet Phænippus, as if the law commanded people <lb/>
            to perform nothing that they have agreed to, from the day <lb/>
            when he promised to meet for a settlement and to give me <lb/>
            his inventory and receive mine, never made his appearance. <lb/>
            I, when I saw that he was paying no regard either to me or <lb/>
            to the laws, gave in my inventory at the office of the Gene­ <lb/>
            rals : Phænippus, as I said a little while ago, gave me a <lb/>
            paper just before the trial; his sole object being, that he <lb/>
            might appear to have delivered his inventory, without my being <lb/>
            able to make any use of its contents. You ought, men of <lb/>
            the jury, not to give an undue advantage to those persons, <lb/>
            who deem their own brutality to be stronger than the laws; <lb/>
            if you do, you'll multiply the number of people who mock <lb/>
            at all legal ordinances : you ought rather to assist those who <lb/>
            regard the voice of the laws as yours, and who believe that <lb/>
            this your voice, which is heard in the court of justice,2 is <lb/>
            raised to protect the injured, not the doers of injury.</p>

            and the laws.</p>

          <p>By the Gods and demons, men of the jury, how else is one <lb/>
            to prove that Phænippus is amenable to the laws which have <lb/>
            been read, than in the manner in which I now prove it! <lb/>
            Phtenippus however has made a counter-charge against me, <lb/>
            that I do not give a just description of my property: (so <lb/>
            readily will persons like him misstate the facts to you:) and <note type="footnote"> 1 In some cases the law expressly provided that the trial should <lb/>
            take place on the thirtieth day after action brought. In other cases <lb/>
            it was left to the magistrates to appoint days for appearance, trial, &amp;c. <lb/>

            he complains of the oath which I swore before making out <lb/>
            the inventory, saying that I undertook to set forth all the <lb/>
            rest of my property besides that in the works; as if to swear <lb/>
            according to the laws were a ground of complaint. You <lb/>
            know, men of the jury, for you enacted, the law which <lb/>
            expressly so declares, that the parties to an exchange, when <lb/>
            they take the oath before making out their inventories, shall <lb/>
            swear in manner following—“ I give a true and correct in­ <lb/>
            ventory of all my property, except that in the silver-works; <lb/>
            which the laws have made exempt from duty." But I would <lb/>
            rather you read the law itself.1 <note type="footnote"> 1 Respecting this law Böckh writes in his Dissertation on the silver <lb/>
            mines thus: </note><note type="footnote"> " One of the chief advantages enjoyed by the mine owners was the <lb/>
            immunity from taxes, which the laws had allowed to property vested in <lb/>
            the mines. The fact itself is unquestionable; but, as it occurs in the <lb/>
            speech against Phænippus, in which mention is made of relief granted <lb/>
            by the State to the mine-proprietors, it might be thought that nothing <lb/>
            more was meant than a temporary alleviation for the year in which <lb/>
            they had sustained a severe loss; a supposition which is apparently <lb/>
            confirmed by 'the assertion of AEschines, that Timarchus had sold his <lb/>
            estates, including two mines, in order to escape serving the liturgies by <lb/>
            the concealment of his property. But, as AEschines is not accustomed <lb/>
            to weigh his words with great exactness, the fear of the liturgies enter­ <lb/>
            tained by Timarchus perhaps extended only to his other estates, to­ <lb/>
            gether with which the mines were only accidentally mentioned; and <lb/>
            even if mines did not oblige the possessor to perform liturgies, yet the <lb/>
            possession of them strongly confirmed the idea entertained of a man's <lb/>
            wealth, and the public opinion on this subject had no slight influence <lb/>
            upon his nomination to an official charge. In the speech against <lb/>
            Phænippus, however, the orator would not have omitted to remark <lb/>
            that the immunity of the mines was only introduced a short time <lb/>
            before for the purpose of relieving the possessors, if such had been the <lb/>
            case; for, as the complainant is particularly earnest in urging the <lb/>
            welfare of the people in opposition to that of the mine-owners, it would <lb/>
            have suited his purpose to mention the privilege recently accorded to <lb/>
            them; but, instead of this, he speaks in a general manner of the laws <lb/>
            by which immunity had been granted to the possessors of mines. It is <lb/>
            necessary therefore to consider this immunity as established by laws of <lb/>
            ancient standing; but whether intended as an encouragement to mining <lb/>
            or not, is another question. Are we to suppose that the people of <lb/>
            Athens, from no other motive than that of favouring a particular <lb/>
            \ department of industry, would have exempted a large number of their <lb/>
            citizens from liturgies and taxes ? * * * What renders this the more <lb/>
            improbable is, that a large portion of the mine-owners were extremely <lb/>
            wealthy in certain times; and any person might, when he pleased, have <lb/>
            withdrawn himself from the public services, by purchasing and working <lb/>
            mines. My opinion is, that this immunity could not have been con-</note> <pb n="299"/>
             </p>
          <p>Stop one moment, if you please. I made this proposal <lb/>
            before to Phænippus, and now again, men of the jury, I <lb/>
            offer it him again of my own accord—I will surrender to <lb/>
            him the whole of my property, including that in the works, <lb/>
            if he will only deliver up to me his piece of border-land free <lb/>
            from incumbrances, as it was when I first went to it with <lb/>
            witnesses, and if he will replace again the corn and wine and <lb/>
            other things which he has carried away from the farm-build­ <lb/>
            ings after removing the seals from the doors. Why do you <lb/>
            go on talking and clamouring, Phænippus ? I have in former <lb/>
            times by my own bodily labour and exertions reaped con­ <lb/>
            siderable profits from the silver-works—I acknowledge it; <lb/>
            but I have lost all my gains, except a small fraction. You, <lb/>
            who are now selling from your farm barley at eighteen <lb/>
            drachms and wine at twelve drachms, are a rich man, as one <lb/>
            might expect, when you make more than fifteen hundred <lb/>
            bushels of corn and above seven thousand gallons of wine. <lb/>
            Ought I then to continue in the same class, if the same <lb/>
            fortune does not attend me as in former days ? Never allow <note type="footnote"> ceded as an encouragement to mining, but only upon a legal principle. <lb/>
            The mine-proprietor was a tenant in fee-farm, who was permitted the <lb/>
            use of public property in consideration of the payment of a sum of <lb/>
            money, and of a portion of the yearly produce as rent. But the <lb/>
            property-taxes and liturgies only fell upon freehold property, while the <lb/>
            mines, being conveyed by the people subject to the payment of rent, <lb/>
            were for this reason tax-free. Whether slaves were included among <lb/>
            the property vested in mines, I do not venture to determine: there <lb/>
            being however no reason of any cogency why a tax should not have <lb/>
            been imposed upon them, it appears to me more probable that by the <lb/>
            property in the silver-mines, we are only to understand the mines <lb/>
            which had been granted. A legal consequence of the exemption of the <lb/>
            mines from taxes was their exclusion from the property which was <lb/>
            made over in the exchange." </note><note type="footnote"> The following are the remarks of A. G. Becker in reference to this <lb/>
            provision of the Athenian law, and to the tricks practised on one <lb/>
            , another by the parties to an exchange. </note><note type="footnote"> “ Phænippus made the same kind of charges against his opponent <lb/>
            as had been made against himself, as one sees from page 1044; and <lb/>
            nothing indeed was easier, than that a person intending to offer the <lb/>
            exchange to another should contrive some time before to invest his <lb/>
            money in mines, which by Solon'a law (singularly enough) were not <lb/>
            included in the property that passed by the exchange. From all this <lb/>
            it is clear, that the regulation in question, though it tended to maintain <lb/>
            equality among the citizens of Athens, must in a degenerate age have <lb/>
            led to a corruption of their morals." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="300"/>
            such a thing as this; it would be contrary to justice! Take <lb/>
            your turn, Phænippus ; enter for a short time into the rank <lb/>
            of those who serve the public offices; since the people in the <lb/>
            works have been unfortunate, and you agriculturists enjoy <lb/>
            more than your fair share of prosperity. You have been for <lb/>
            a pretty long period receiving the income of two estates, that <lb/>
            of your natural father Callippus, and that of him who adopted <lb/>
            you, Philostratus the orator ; and you have never done any­ <lb/>
            thing for your countrymen. The inheritance which my <lb/>
            father left to each of us, my brother and myself, was only <lb/>
            forty-five minas, on which it is not easy to live: but your <lb/>
            fathers possessed such riches, that there stands a tripod <lb/>
            offered by each of them in honour of their choragic victories <lb/>
            at the Dionysia. And I do not grudge the honour; for men <lb/>
            of wealth ought to make themselves useful to their fellow- <lb/>
            citizens. Show, Phænippus, that you have expended a single <lb/>
            copper coin for the benefit of the state—you who have in­ <lb/>
            herited two properties liable to public charges! You cannot <lb/>
            show it; for you have learnt the trick of concealment and <lb/>
            evasion and doing everything to escape the public service. <lb/>
            I, on the contrary, will show that I have expended large <lb/>
            sums of money—I who received so slender an inheritance <lb/>
            from my father!</p>
          <p>First however read me that law which declares that no <lb/>
            mining property shall be included in the inventory. Read <lb/>
            also the challenge, and the depositions showing that the re­ <lb/>
            spondent Phænippus has inherited two estates liable to public <lb/>
            charges.</p>

          <p>There is one thing, men of the jury, and one thing only, <lb/>
            in which Phænippus the respondent can be shown to have <lb/>
            displayed public spirit. He is a clever and spirited breeder <lb/>
            of horses, being young, rich, and strong. What is the positive <lb/>
            proof of this ? He has given up riding on horseback, and in <lb/>
            lieuof his war-horse, which he has sold, has purchased for <lb/>
            himself a chariot, (young as he is,) that he may not travel <lb/>
            on foot; so luxurious is he become. He has put down the <lb/>
            chariot for me in his schedule, but of the barley and the wine <lb/>
            and the rest of the farm-produce not a tenth part. He <lb/>
            deserves to be let off now, (doesn't he 1) when he has been <lb/>
             <pb n="301"/>
            so public-spirited and useful both in his person and in his <lb/>
            property. He deserves something very different, I should <lb/>
            say. While it is the duty of an honest jury to give a respite, <lb/>
            in case of need, to those citizens who in their time of pros­ <lb/>
            perity cheerfully serve public offices and remain in the list <lb/>
            of the Three-hundred ; you should deal otherwise with those <lb/>
            who regard all money spent in the public service as lost; you <lb/>
            should bring them into the foremost class of tax-payers, and <lb/>
            not suffer them to run away from their obligations.</p>

          <p>Never mind that. True it is, men of the jury, Phænippus <lb/>
            carried away many things from the buildings, opening the <lb/>
            chambers that were sealed, as has been proved in evidence, <lb/>
            and leaving just what he liked; and two months afterwards <lb/>
            he gave me the inventory of his property. However, no more <lb/>
            of that. Read from the words—“ upon this property I owe <lb/>
            the debts following "—</p>

          <p>Stop, This Aristonoe, men of the jury, is the daughter of <lb/>
            Philostratus, and mother of the respondent. He says that a <lb/>
            debt is owing to her for her marriage portion, of which the <lb/>
            laws make him the owner; he tells a falsehood therefore, <lb/>
            and makes out his inventory incorrectly.. How is it, Phæ­ <lb/>
            nippus, that I, although my mother is alive and remains a <lb/>
            member of our family and brought a marriage portion into <lb/>
            it, do not schedule the portion as a debt to her and try to <lb/>
            impose on the jury, but allow my mother to share what I <lb/>
            possess, whether I have my own estate or that of Phænippus ? <lb/>
            The reason, my good sir, is, that the laws so command me. <lb/>
            But you violate the laws in everything. Read another.</p>

          <p>You hear, men of the jury. He says that he owes upon <lb/>
            the land a talent to Pamphilus and Phidolaus of Rhamnus <lb/>
            jointly, and four thousand drachms to Æantides of Phlyus, <lb/>
            and fourteen minas to Aristomenes of Anagyrus. How comes <lb/>
            it, Phænippus, when I asked you in the presence of witnesses <lb/>
            if you owed anything upon your border-farm, and when I <lb/>
            requested you to show me any tablet of mortgage that was <lb/>
             <pb n="302"/>
            upon it, and protested against any fictitious creditors spring­ <lb/>
            ing up afterwards to my prejudice1—how comes it that you <lb/>
            did not disclose any of these debts then, but that now, when <lb/>
            you have given me your inventory two months after the <lb/>
            time, the law requiring it to be given within three days, <lb/>
            creditors have made their appearance, and debts of more than <lb/>
            three talents 1 The reason, my good sir, is plain. You are <lb/>
            simply contriving, that you may have private debts to the <lb/>
            same amount as the debt which I have incurred to the state. <lb/>
            That your account is false, Phænippus, and that you have <lb/>
            come into court a perjured man, I will prove this very <lb/>
            minute beyond a doubt.</p>
          <p>Please, Usher, to take the deposition of Æantides and <lb/>
            Theoteles, whom the respondent has falsely entered as his <lb/>

            those private agreements which we are accustomed to con­ <lb/>
            sider as equally binding-who, further, has broken the seals <lb/>
            of the buildings and carried away the corn and the wine that <lb/>
            was stowed inside-who, in addition to this, has after the <lb/>
            exchange sold timber to the value of more than thirty minas, <lb/>
            and (what is worst of all) who has concocted false debts for <lb/>
            the purpose of the exchange! Will you then decide that <lb/>
            this person has made out an honest inventory? Far be such <lb/>
            a thing from your thoughts, men of the jury! Failing to <lb/>
            get your verdict, what is one to have recourse to-when <lb/>
            wealthy men, who have never done any good to you, who <lb/>
            produce a large quantity of corn and wine and dispose of it <lb/>
            for treble the price they did. formerly, obtain undue advan­ <lb/>
            tage in your courts ? Let not this happen now, I entreat <lb/>
            you; but, as you have given public relief to all those engaged <lb/>
            in the mining business, so now afford relief to me in my <note type="footnote"> 1 Pabst—“und Dich vor Zeugen beachwor, nicht etwa erdichtete <lb/>

            of your fellow-citizen, yet, seeing my industrious habits and <lb/>
            my good will to you, you would have allowed me a respite <lb/>
            from my heavy charges, and called upon one of the rest who <lb/>
            was shirking his duty. I ask for the like treatment under <lb/>
            existing circumstances. Hereafter, when I have paid you <lb/>
            the three talents for which I became liable and have recovered <lb/>
            my losses, you will relieve some other distressed person and <lb/>
            come upon me. But now, men of the jury, discharge me, I <lb/>
            beseech you. I have made out an honest case, and 1 implore <lb/>
            you to give me your assistance, and not suffer me to be <lb/>

          <p>Or the more ancient divisions of Attica, and of the four tribes <lb/>
            which existed before the innovations of Clisthenes, it is not my inten­ <lb/>
            tion to give an account here. I shall content myself with referring <lb/>
            to my epitome of the subject under title Tribus in the Archaeological <lb/>
            Dictionary, and to the authorities there indicated. Let the reader <lb/>
            only bear in mind, that each tribe was divided into three <foreign xml:lang="grc">φρατρίαι</foreign>, <lb/>
            fraternities, or clans, (as I have translated it,) analogous in their poli­ <lb/>
            tical relations to the Roman Curiœ ; and each clan into thirty <foreign xml:lang="grc">γένη</foreign>, <lb/>
            or families, in the larger sense of the term family, corresponding to <lb/>
            the Roman Gens. Each family was distinguished by a name of a <lb/>
            patronymic form, derived from some hero or mythic ancestor, as Eu­ <lb/>
            molpidæ ; though in process of time, as might be expected, these <lb/>
            divisions did not necessarily import family connexion. The members <lb/>
            of the clans and families had their respective religious rites and festi­ <lb/>
            vals, which were preserved long after the communities had lost their <lb/>
            political importance.</p>
          <p>Before the time of Solon there was a gradation of ranks, said to <lb/>
            have been established by Theseus; the Eupatridœ, or Nobles; the <lb/>
            Geomori, or Agriculturists; and the Demiurgi, or Artisans. Solon <lb/>
            abolished these distinctions, and introduced his property qualification, <lb/>
            of which I have spoken elsewhere. (See Volume I. Appendix IV.) <lb/>
            He however made no change in the constitution of the ancient tribes; <lb/>
            which were thought to keep up artificial distinctions, not agreeing <lb/>
            with that fusion of all ranks, which it was the object of a later gene­ <lb/>
            ration to accomplish; and accordingly, after the expulsion of the sons <lb/>
            of Pisistratus, the four old tribes were abolished, and the whole state <lb/>
            reorganised.</p>
          <p>Clisthenes, the leader of this democratic reform, (wbose institu­ <lb/>
            tions continued to be in force, with some few interruptions, till the <lb/>
            overthrow of Athenian independence,) created ten new tribes, first <lb/>
            dividing the whole territory of Attica into a hundred parts, which he <lb/>
            called <foreign xml:lang="grc">δη̑μοι</foreign>, or townships, and assigning ten of these to each tribe; <lb/>
            not however ten contiguous ones, but so that each tribe might be <lb/>
            composed of townships locally separate. The object of this arrange­ <lb/>
            ment was, that by the breaking up of old associations a perteus <lb/>
             <pb n="305"/>
            revolution might be effected in the habits and feelings, as well as in the <lb/>
            political organisation of the people. The clans and families continued <lb/>
            to exist as private communities, and to preserve their peculiar reli­ <lb/>
            gious observances, with which Clisthenes did not choose to interfere. <lb/>
            Manypriestly offices belonged by ancient right to certain families; <lb/>
            and the removal of all distinction between them would have been <lb/>
            attended with a shock to religious sentiment. While however they <lb/>
            were retained for these and other private purposes, their political <lb/>
            importance was mostly transferred to the new corporations. And <lb/>
            they were kept quite distinct, so that people of the same clans and <lb/>
            families might belong to different tribes and townships.</p>
          <p>The tribes were named from the ancient Attic heroes, Cecropis, <lb/>
            Erechtheis, Pandionis, Ægeis, Hippothoontis, Œneis, Acamantis, An­ <lb/>
            tiochis, Leontis, Æantis. Such was the machinery of the new system, <lb/>
            that every tribe had an equal share of political honours and power. <lb/>
            The Council of five hundred was constituted by choosing fifty from <lb/>
            each tribe. The six thousand jurors were obtained by taking six hun­ <lb/>
            dred from each. So of the ten Generals, the ten Phylarchs (who com­ <lb/>
            manded the cavalry), the ten Auditors, the ten Treasurers, &amp;c. &amp;c.; <lb/>
            one was chosen from each tribe. All these whom I have mentioned <lb/>
            were taken from the tribes, but chosen by the people at large, either <lb/>
            by lot or suffrage. Some other public functionaries however were <lb/>
            elected by the tribes themselves, as the Shipbuilders, Trieropœi, the <lb/>
            Conservators of walls, Teichopœi ; likewise the Choragi, the Gymnast­ <lb/>
            archs, and Architheori (as to whom see Volume III. Appendix II.).</p>
          <p>There were tribe-meetings as well for the transaction of business <lb/>
            imposed by the state, as for the regulation of their corporate affairs: <lb/>
            for every tribe had lands and property of its own, its own business, <lb/>
            its own feasts, its own officers. Of these, the principal were the Super­ <lb/>
            intendents, Epimetetœ ; who presided at the tribe-meetings, and who, <lb/>
            as we learn from the oration against Midias, had various duties con­ <lb/>
            nected with the scenic and other exhibitions at the public festivals; <lb/>
            for example, to see that the Choragi were duly nominated, and per­ <lb/>
            formed the parts assigned to them; to preside at the games and con­ <lb/>
            tests, to assist in the preparations for them, preserve order, and the <lb/>
            like. (See Schömann, De Comitiis, 368—375.)</p>
          <p>That the tribes audited the accounts of officers entrusted with their <lb/>
            monies, and had power to impose pecuniary fines upon those who <lb/>
            were found guilty of embezzlement, may be collected from the oration <lb/>
            against Theocrines, who was condemned by his tribe (the Leontian) <lb/>
            to pay seven thousand drachms to the hero of the tribe,' for the pay­ <lb/>
            ment of which he afterwards made an arrangement under the sanction <lb/>
            of a decree of his fellow-tribesmen. (See Schömann, ibid. 373.)</p>
          <p>The townships, which were at first a hundred in number, were in <lb/>
            process of time subdivided, and in the time of Strabo they amounted <note type="footnote"> (1) a, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὠφλεν ὲν ταῑς εὐθύναις τψ̄ ὲπωνύμψ τη̃ς αύτο̄υ φυλη̃ς</foreign>. Demosth. cont <lb/>

             <pb n="306"/>
            to a hundred and seventy-four. This subdivision was found conve­ <lb/>
            nient, in consequence of the increase of population, the building of <lb/>
            new towns, and similar causes. Two new tribes had been created in <lb/>
            the year B.C. 307, which necessitated some change in the demi. A <lb/>
            list of all the demi is given in Reiske's Index Demosthenicus. Some of <lb/>
            them took their names from the towns, villages, or places within their <lb/>
            precinct, as Marathon, Acharnse, Brauron, Sunium, Pbalerum, Piræus, <lb/>
            Lampra,Icaria, Thoricus, Decelea, (Enoe, Eleusis, Rhamnus, Melita, <lb/>
            Colyttus : others from the families which settled in them, as the Bu­ <lb/>
            tadæ, Dædalidæ, lonidæ, Semachidæ, Cothocidæ, Pæonidæ, Philaidæ, <lb/>
            Cyrtiada;, Chollidæ, Scambonidæ, &amp;c. The largest of them all was <lb/>
            Acharnæ, famous for having given name to the Acharnians of Aristo­ <lb/>
            phanes, and which, as Thucydides tells us, furnished not less than <lb/>
            three thousand heavy-armed soldiers in the Peloponnesian war.</p>
          <p>The townships, like the tribes, had their corporate affairs, as well <lb/>
            as those of a more public nature, to attend to. Each of them had its <lb/>
            own separate property, its lands, temples, and religious worship; its <lb/>
            priests, councillors, and officers. The fellow-townsmen frequently <lb/>
            met, either for elections, or for financial business, or other purposes. <lb/>
            Their most important meetings were held at Athens; which was pro­ <lb/>
            bably most convenient; for men did not necessarily reside in the district <lb/>
            of which they were members. The chief magistrate of each township <lb/>
            was called the demarch, (prefect or mayor,) who, besides local duties, <lb/>
            performed many of considerable importance to the whole common­ <lb/>
            wealth. He convened and presided at the corporate assemblies, kept <lb/>
            the books of his township, collected rents or debts that were due to <lb/>
            it. He kept a register not only of the corporate property, but of the <lb/>
            landed estates of all private persons (whether townsmen or not towns­ <lb/>
            men) within his district; and from this he made returns for the pur­ <lb/>
            pose of the property-tax assessment.1 He also furnished a list of <lb/>
            such of his fellow-townsmen as were fit to serve in war, as we learn <lb/>
            from the oration against Policies (page 1208). A law is cited by <lb/>
            Demosthenes in the speech against Macartatus (page 1269), requiring <lb/>
            the demarch to provide for the burial of the dead, in case of neglect <lb/>
            by the heirs and relations, (to whom he was first to give notice,) and <lb/>
            imposing on him, in case of default, a penalty of a thousand drachms.</p>
          <p>There were forty itinerant judges, called sometimes the Forty, and <lb/>
            sometimes the District judges,2 who made circuits round the various <lb/>
            townships, to decide small causes, not exceeding the value of ten <lb/>
            drachms, and also actions of assault and battery, and certain actions <lb/>
            of trespass, and charges of rape. These they decided without a iurv 3 <note type="footnote"> (1) An Athenian citizen might possess land in a foreign township, paying a small <lb/>
            rent or acknowledgment to the demarch. Such possession was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ε̃γκτησις</foreign>. <lb/>
            Apollodorus (in the Oration against Polycles, 1208) says, he was returned in three <lb/>
            townships as a person fit to pay the <foreign xml:lang="grc">προεσφορά</foreign> </note><note type="footnote"> (2) <foreign xml:lang="grc">δικασταὶ κατὰ δήμους</foreign>. They were originally thirty; ten were afterwards added, <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>But the most important political service rendered by these corpo­ <lb/>
            rations was the preservation, by means of their register, of a genuine <lb/>
            list of Attic citizens. For every Athenian was obliged to be a mem­ <lb/>
            ber of some township, and no man could be admitted to exercise any <lb/>
            civic rights, until his name was entered in the roll. In the days of <lb/>
            their prosperity the Athenians were proud of their citizenship, and <lb/>
            careful to exclude those who were not entitled to it from its honours <lb/>
            and advantages. Occasionally it was conferred, by way of distinction, <lb/>
            upon some foreigner who had done service to the country; as upon <lb/>
            Sadocus, the Thracian prince, their ally, in the beginning of the Pelo­ <lb/>
            ponnesian war; and in later times the honour became more cheap, <lb/>
            and was conferred upon adventurers like Charidemus; but those were <lb/>
            generally cases where it was a mere honour, not attended with the <lb/>
            advantages which a resident at Athens would derive from it, and <lb/>
            which it was always more difficult to obtain. There were exceptional <lb/>
            instances; such as that on the first creation of the townships, when <lb/>
            Clisthenes, in order to strengthen the popular party, made a new <lb/>
            creation of citizens, including even slaves; and the occasion after the <lb/>
            plague, when, the strength of the nation having been wasted both by <lb/>
            war and by disease, it became necessary to recruit it by new blood. <lb/>
            But, setting aside these exceptional cases, we find that the Athenians <lb/>
            took the utmost precaution by law, to prevent the intrusion of aliens <lb/>
            into their community.</p>
          <p>The son of an Athenian citizen, upon attaining his eighteenth year, <lb/>
            or as soon after as was thought proper-but not (it seems) after the <lb/>
            completion of his twentieth year-was taken by his father or guardian <lb/>
            to a meeting of his fellow-townsmen, to have his name entered in the <lb/>
            register of the Demus. This was called the heritable register,1 <lb/>
            because the entry therein entitled him to take possession of any <lb/>
            property which he became heir to. Commonly those townsmen would <lb/>
            attend the meeting, who were friends or acquaintances of the candi­ <lb/>
            dates for enrolment: in case of any meditated opposition, there would <lb/>
            be a large attendance. The father or guardian proved the birth and <lb/>
            civic origin of the youth. Any member was at liberty to object upon <lb/>
            good ground, such as illegitimacy, or foreign extraction either by the <lb/>
            fathers or mother's side. The members present were sworn to adjudi­ <lb/>
            cate according to law, and, after hearing the evidence, the majority <lb/>
            decided whether the party objected to should be enrolled or not. <lb/>
            Upon his admission to the register, the youth became a member of <lb/>
            the township, and entitled to his heritable and civic rights. His <lb/>
            name was at the same time entered in the assembly-list,2 kept by the <lb/>
            demarch, showing who were entitled to take part in the popular <lb/>
            assembly. He was then a full citizen in every respect; only he could <lb/>
            not serve on juries, nor hold offices of state, until the age of thirty. <note type="footnote"> (1) <foreign xml:lang="grc">ληξιαρχζκὸν γραμματει̃ον</foreign>. To enter upon an inheritance was called <unclear>λαγχάνει</unclear> <lb/>

             <pb n="308"/>
            His civic designation and full address (as we should say) was his own <lb/>
            individual name joined to that of his father and his township—thus— <lb/>
            " Demosthenes, son of Demosthenes, of Pseania.” Of the importance <lb/>
            of this title we have had an illustration in the case of Mantitheus <lb/>
            against Bœotus.</p>
          <p>When an orphan was introduced to his fellow-townsmen for enrol­ <lb/>
            ment before his twentieth year, Schömann thinks that, as he would <lb/>
            take immediate possession of his inheritance, he underwent a personal <lb/>
            examination, to show that he had arrived at a state of manhood, so <lb/>
            that, if he were approved, he would be at once admitted to his <lb/>
            majority;1 otherwise, it would be postponed for some time longer. <lb/>
            As to this however there is a good deal of obscurity.</p>
          <p>Whoever, not being a lawful citizen, presumed to act as one, <lb/>
            whether his name was in the register or not, might be prosecuted and <lb/>
            severely punished, as I have already shown: (Volume III. Appendix <lb/>
            viii. page 345). As a further precaution against the admission of <lb/>
            spurious members into the corporate bodies, they were required occa­ <lb/>
            sionally by a decree of the people to revise their registers, and to <lb/>
            expunge those names which should appear, either by fraud or by <lb/>
            mistake, to have been improperly entered. When any such revision <lb/>
            was ordered, the townsmen met on the appointed day in the city of <lb/>
            Athens: the names were called over: if any one was objected to, the <lb/>
            grounds of objection were stated, and the case was heard, with the <lb/>
            evidence on both sides; the hearing and adjudication took place in <lb/>
            the same way as upon an objection to an original enrolment.2 A <lb/>
            member who was ejected might appeal to a jury; but, if he failed to <lb/>
            prove his title, he was sold for a slave.</p>
          <p>Our knowledge upon this subject is derived mostly from the <lb/>
            oration of Demosthenes against Eubulides; composed by him for <lb/>
            one Euxitheus, a member of the Halimusian demus, who, being <lb/>
            ejected on a revision, had appealed to the Athenian court. He com­ <lb/>
            plains strongly of the unfair and illegal manner in which he had been <lb/>
            treated at the meeting; imputing his expulsion to a cabal got up <lb/>
            against him by Eubulides, whom he had made his enemy by giving <lb/>
            testimony in a court of justice. Eubulides (he says) had contrived <lb/>
            that his case should be brought on late in the day. Out of seventy <lb/>
            members who had been present in the morning, forty had gone home, <lb/>
            as they resided in the Halimusian district, which was four or five <lb/>
            miles from Athens; most of those who remained were the party com­ <lb/>
            bined, against the appellant, and some of them had two or three <lb/>
            ballots furnished by Eubulides, who presided at the revision; in fact, <lb/>

            as there were members present. He charges his opponents with <lb/>
            jobbing and conspiring in other cases besides his own. He insinuates, <lb/>
            that there was a prejudice against him on account of his poverty, his <lb/>
            mother being a vendor of ribbons, and having taken children to nurse; <lb/>
            and also, that he had made himself unpopular formerly, when he was <lb/>
            prefect of the township, by enforcing payment of rents and dues. To <lb/>
            prove his legitimacy, lie calls, besides his relations, some members of <lb/>
            his clan and family; showing that, upon his father's marriage, the <lb/>
            members of his clan had partaken of the marriage sacrifice; that he, <lb/>
            when a child, had been introduced to the clan, and taken to religious » <lb/>
            worship at the temples.</p>
          <p>Here I may observe that, although for political purposes there was <lb/>
            (in general) no necessity for being admitted into the clans and <lb/>
            families, as there was to the townships, yet it was usual for all of <lb/>
            pure Attic blood to be so admitted to them; and therefore the fact <lb/>
            of a man's being an acknowledged member of those associations <lb/>
            afforded strong positive proof of his civic origin. And we find that <lb/>
            the clansmen and kinsmen were frequently called as witnesses to <lb/>
            prove family matters.1</p>
          <p>There was a distinction made by the law in cases of adoption. For <lb/>
            it was necessary that an adopted son should be registered not only in <lb/>
            the township, but also in the clan of the father, as we learn from <lb/>
            Isæus.2</p>

          </ab>
          <p>THE duties of guardians at Athens did not materially differ from <lb/>
            those which have been annexed to the office in other countries. The <lb/>
            father had the power of appointing guardians by will, to whom gene­ <lb/>
            rally was confided the personal care of the infant, as well as the <lb/>
            management of his property. If there was no testamentary guardian, <lb/>
            it devolved upon the Archon, as the official protector of orphans, to <lb/>
            appoint one; just as in England the Lord Chancellor will make a <lb/>
            similar appointment, upon an application made on the infant's behalf. <lb/>
            It seems that the nearest relation was usually entitled to be nomi­ <lb/>
            nated, in the absence of a direction by will. Meier has shown that <lb/>
            we cannot depend upon the statement of Diogenes Laertius, that by <lb/>
            a law of Solon the infant's nearest relation by the father's side could <note type="footnote"> (1) See Isæus, De PhUoctem. Hered. 13. Ed. Bekker. De PyrrI. Hered. 91, 92. <lb/>

            not be his guardian. There are in fact several passages in Isæus, <lb/>
            which show the contrary,1 and the practice of appointing the nearest <lb/>
            paternal relatives by will seems to indicate what the law was.2 If <lb/>
            there were no relatives, or none fit, or perhaps none who chose, to <lb/>
            undertake the office, then it fell upon the Archon to select one from <lb/>
            the whole body of Athenian citizens.</p>
          <p>The duties of the guardian were, to take care of the person of his <lb/>
            ward, and provide for his maintenance and education; also to manage <lb/>
            and improve his estate, so long as he remained in a state of pupillage. <lb/>
            Towards third parties and towards the state he was the ward s legal <lb/>
            representative: for example, in actions by or against the ward, he <lb/>
            Acted as his <foreign xml:lang="grc">κύριος</foreign>, prochein amy, or next friend; ( see Volume III. <lb/>
            Appendix IX. page 373:) and we have learned from the speech <lb/>
            against Aphobus (ante, page 94,) that he made returns on his behalf <lb/>
            for the property-tax assessment, the only public charge from which a <lb/>
            minor was not exempt, and made the necessary payments in his name <lb/>
            to the state. If the mother remained with the orphan, the guardian <lb/>
            was bound to make provision for her maintenance also.</p>
          <p>With respect to the administration of the ward's estate, as well as <note type="footnote"> (1) De Dicæog. Hered. 18. Ed. Bekker. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δικαιογενὴς ὲγγυτάτω ὤν γένους ἐπετρόπευεν</foreign>. <lb/>
            Be Cleon. Hered. 10—13. The heirs of Cleonymus, claiming his estate, allege that <lb/>
            Dinias, their paternal uncle, was their guardian, and that Cleonymus made a will <lb/>
            excluding them from the inheritance, because he had quarrelled with Dinias, and <lb/>
            did not wish that his property should be under the control of Dinias after his <lb/>
            death. Compare also the argument to the oration De Arist. Hered. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) The common law of England took the precaution of excluding from guardian­ <lb/>
            ship in socage (as it was called) those relatives to whom the inheritance would <lb/>
            descend, giving it to the next of kin, to whom the inheritance could not possibly <lb/>
            descend; therefore, if the land descended to the heir on the part of the father, the <lb/>
            mother, or other next relation on the part of the mother, had the wardship ; so, if <lb/>
            the land descended to the heir on the mother's side, the father, or his next of kin, <lb/>
            had the wardship. <lb/>
            The Roman law as to this point was like the Athenian; and therefore the Satirist <lb/>
            says- <lb/>
            Pupillum utinam, quern proximus heres <lb/>
            Impello, expungam. Persius, it 12. </note><note type="footnote"> There was a law of Charondas by which the management of the minor's property <lb/>
            was given to the nearest paternal relative, while his education was entrusted to the <lb/>
            next of kin by the mother's side. The same middle course was adopted by the <lb/>
            Scotch and the ancient French law, committing the pupil's estate to the person who <lb/>
            was entitled to the legal succession, because he is most interested in preserving it <lb/>
            from waste, but excluding him from the custody of the pupil's person. </note><note type="footnote"> Kent in his Commentaries (II. 223) has the following remarks upon this : <lb/>
            " The English, Scotch, and French laws, proceeded on too great distrust of the <lb/>
            ordinary integrity of mankind. They might with equal propriety have deprived <lb/>
            children of the custody and maintenance of their aged and impotent parents. It is <lb/>
            equally a mistake in politics and law, to consider mankind degraded to the lowest <lb/>
            depths of vice, or to suppose them acting under the uniform government of virtue. <lb/>
            Man has a mixed character, and practical wisdom does not admit of such extreme <lb/>
            conclusions. The old rule against committing the custody of the person and estate <lb/>
            of a lunatic to the heir at law has been overruled as unreasonable. If a presumption <lb/>
            must be indulged it would be in favour of kinder treatment and more patient forti­ <lb/>
            tudo from a daughter, as committee of the person and estate of an aged and afflicted <lb/>
            mother, than from the collateral kindred. The fears and precautions of the law­ <lb/>
            givers on this subject imply, according to Montesquieu, a melancholy consciousness <lb/>
            of the corruption of public morals.” </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="311"/>
            other matters, a testamentary guardian was bound to execute the <lb/>
            trusts of the will. A guardian appointed by law had a discretionary <lb/>
            power, him to but not an unlimited one. It seems that it was not lawful for <lb/>
            himto carry on a trade for his ward, or to risk his estate in dangerous <lb/>
            speculations, such as adventures at sea. It was his duty however to <lb/>
            increase it, if possible; and the most approved courses are said to <lb/>
            have been, either to purchase lands, or to lend out the whole property <lb/>
            on good security during the whole term of the ward's minority.1</p>
          <p>The property might be lent out either to a single person, or in <lb/>
            parcels to several. The former method appears to have been the most <lb/>
            profitable; and therefore, in the case of a safe borrower, the most <lb/>
            eligible. We have read how Theogenes, having borrowed three talents <lb/>
            and thirty have the property of Antidorus, paid back upwards of <lb/>
            six talents to him at the end of six years: (ante, page 108). It may <lb/>
            be thought strange, that such large interest should be paid on loans <lb/>
            by persons who were obliged to give good security for repayment. <lb/>
            We can only conclude that very considerable profits could be made <lb/>
            in those times by mercantile speculations. Compound interest appears <lb/>
            to have been unknown.</p>
          <p>It was competent for the guardian to lend the estate in this way <lb/>
            by private contract. But the better course, if he wished to relieve <lb/>
            himself from responsibility, was, to apply to the Archon, and act <lb/>
            under his authority. The Archon then held a court, of which public <lb/>
            notice was given, and the estate was lent to the highest bidder, <lb/>
            approved of by a jury.2</p>
          <p>If the guardian violated his duty, by neglecting the maintenance 01 <lb/>
            education of his ward, by ill-treatment of his person, or by mis­ <lb/>
            managing his property, or by any kind of fraud or injury, he was <lb/>
            liable to a criminal prosecution, which any Athenian might bring <lb/>
            against him during the term of the ward's pupillage. Of the different <lb/>
            forms of procedure, and the punishment which attended any miscon­ <lb/>
            duct of this kind, I have already spoken: (see Volume III. Appendix <lb/>
            viii. pages 351, 352, 360, 364). One consequence of conviction was <lb/>
            the removal of the guardian; which indeed, if accomplished early <lb/>
            enough, would be the most efficient remedy; for a fraudulent guardian <lb/>
            might in the course of a long minority do irreparable mischief. De­ <lb/>
            mosthenes says in the first speech against Onetor, (ante, page 136,) <lb/>
            that the frauds of his guardians had at an early period become noto­ <lb/>
            rious, and that many meetings were held on the subject before the <lb/>
            Archon. This was probably with a view to get up a criminal prose­ <lb/>
            cution.3 <note type="footnote"> (1) <foreign xml:lang="grc">μιϭθου̃ν τὸν οἳκον</foreign>. See Lysias, cont. Diog. 35. Ed. Bekker. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) Isæus, de Philoct.

            this volume, it is mentioned that on a against the guardian for not having let <lb/>
            the estate, the uncle of the wards persuaded the jury to let him administer the <lb/>
            estate. The expression of an opinion by the jury would very likely guide the discre. <lb/>
            tion of the Archon. (See ante, page 260: origin, page 991.) </note> <pb n="312"/>
             </p>
          <p>Upon the ward's attaining his majority, i.e. on the completion of his <lb/>
            seventeenth year, it was the guardian's duty to introduce him to his <lb/>
            fellow-townsmen, and have his name registered. He was then bound <lb/>
            to put him in possession of his estate, and to render him an account <lb/>
            of his own administration of it. If he failed to render an account, or <lb/>
            if he rendered a false one, or if he refused to give possession, or if <lb/>
            he had committed any breach of trust, the ward might bring an <lb/>
            action,' to recover compensation for the injury sustained; or, in case <lb/>
            the guardian had died, he might bring an action for compensation* <lb/>
            against the guardian's representatives. The case of Nausimachus <lb/>
            and Xenopithes is an example of such an action. These men, after <lb/>
            the death of their guardian, commenced actions against his sons, who <lb/>
            plead, (as we have seen,) that their father settled the claim against <lb/>
            him in his lifetime for three talents.</p>
          <p>The right to sue a guardian for breach of duty was, like most other <lb/>
            personal causes of action, barred by the lapse of five years. This was <lb/>
            the term prescribed by the Athenian statute of limitations.3</p>
          <p>I have hitherto spoken of a single guardian only, for the sake of <lb/>
            convenience; but it must be understood, that a father had power to <lb/>
            appoint any number of guardians that he pleased by his will; and <lb/>
            probably a similar discretion was vested in the Archon. Meier infers <lb/>
            from the case of Demosthenes, that, where there were several <lb/>
            guardians, they incurred a several and not a joint liability. The <lb/>
            inference however is not conclusive. It may be that, when the breach <lb/>
            of trust was the joint act of all, the ward might have the option of <lb/>
            suing them jointly; otherwise, where they had not acted together; <lb/>
            for it would be unjust to make them responsible for one another's <lb/>
            misconduct. But we have too little information to determine such <lb/>
            a point. Demosthenes made separate charges against each of his <lb/>
            guardians. Though their negligence might be considered a joint <lb/>
            offence, their pecuniary frauds or defalcations were distinct. (See <lb/>
            ante, page 96.) From the speech against Nausimachus we learn, <lb/>
            that each of the two wards sued each of the four sons of the guardians, <lb/>
            making eight actions out of a single cause of action; which may be <lb/>
            thought to indicate, that it was the policy of the Athenian law to <lb/>
            favour the severance of actions.</p>
          <p>No legal recompense was allowed to guardians for the perform­ <lb/>
            ance of their duty; but, as in our own country it is very common <lb/>
            for testators to give legacies to their executors and trustees, so we <lb/>
            may reasonably suppose, that the father of Demosthenes, in bequeath­ <lb/>
            ing large gifts to the three persons whom he left protectors of his <lb/>
            family, only did that which was frequently done by his countrymen. <lb/>
            Meier suggests, that the general dishonesty of the Athenian character <lb/>
            rendered it necessary thus to bribe guardians to be honest.4 If we <note type="footnote"> (1) <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκη ὲπιτροπη̃ς</foreign>.</note> <note type="footnote">(2) <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκη βλαβη̄ς</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> (3) See the Archæological Dictionary, title <foreign xml:lang="grc">προθεϭμια</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> (4) Bei dem grossem Mangel an Redlichkeit und Gewissenhaftigkeit, den wir in <lb/>

            can trust the statements made in the few speeches which have come <lb/>
            down to us upon this subject, they certainly make out frightful cases <lb/>
            of violated trust. The case in Lysias is far worse than that of <lb/>
            Demosthenes. Diogiton, who was both grandfather and uncle of his <lb/>
            wards, (for he had given his daughter in marriage to his brother,) <lb/>
            had received from the parent, or collected after his death, upwards <lb/>
            of fourteen talents; of the whole of which (nearly) he defrauded the <lb/>
            children, and, when they came of age, turned them into beggary out <lb/>
            of his house.</p>

          <p>THE Rendition of women at Athens and in the other parts of <lb/>
            Greece, their general treatment, and the position which they held in <lb/>
            relation to the other sex; all these matters have been fully and ably <lb/>
            discussed by Becker in his Charicles, and I shall only briefly advert <lb/>
            to them here.</p>
          <p>It may be gathered from the Homeric poems and the Attic tragedy, <lb/>
            that in the earlier times of Greece women held a more elevated posi­ <lb/>
            tion than we find them holding in the historic period. They had <lb/>
            more freedom, a more honourable place in the household, and greater <lb/>
            influence both at home and abroad. It has been particularly ob­ <lb/>
            served, that, while in early times the husband is described as pur­ <lb/>
            chasing his bride from her parents, in later times he expected a <lb/>
            suitable dowry to be given with his wife by the father or next <lb/>
            of kin.</p>
          <p>It is to the usages of Athens, in regard to the female sex, that I <lb/>
            am principally directing the reader's attention; though these did not <lb/>
            materially differ from the usages of other Greek states, except Sparta, <lb/>
            where the manners of the women were as singular and remarkable, as <lb/>
            the institutions of their countrymen in general.</p>
          <p>The main object of the Athenians, in their treatment of women, <lb/>
            seems to have been, to keep them in a state of retirement and <lb/>
            seclusion, to maintain a reserve and modesty in their conduct and <lb/>
            deportment, and, by confining them wholly to what were deemed <lb/>
            feminine occupations, to hold them (socially and intellectually) in <lb/>
            subjection to their husbands and guardians. Although this system <lb/>
            led to many evils, it is said that the Athenian women were dis­ <lb/>
            tinguished above most others for modesty and decorum in their dress <lb/>
            and behaviour.</p><pb n="314"/>
            
          <p>Their early training was such as to prepare them for a life of this <lb/>
            aort. Athens, with all her literary tastes, had no educational insti­ <lb/>
            tution for women; and not only that, but there were no private <lb/>
            schools for them, nor any mental tuition at home. The education of <lb/>
            the Athenian girl was left entirely to her mother and her nurse. <lb/>
            From them she got a smattering of letters, learned perhaps to read <lb/>
            and write, and, what was considered still more important, to weave <lb/>
            and spin, and to cook. She dwelt entirely in the Gynæconitis, or <lb/>
            that part of the house which was appropriated to females; never <lb/>
            went into any general society; lived, in short, very much the life of <lb/>
            a Turkish lady, seeing only her female relations and domestics, and <lb/>
            rarely even leaving the house, except on special occasions, as when <lb/>
            she had to walk in a religious procession, or to join some festival <lb/>
            from which men were excluded.</p>
          <p>The married life was in accordance with what the single had been; <lb/>
            though, as might be expected, the wife had more freedom and more <lb/>
            power in the domestic establishment than had been entrusted to the <lb/>
            daughter. She was in some respects the mistress of the house; the <lb/>
            keys of the apartments were delivered to her; she had the custody <lb/>
            of the furniture and stores, the superintendence of female slaves, and <lb/>
            general management of household affairs and duties, such as cooking, <lb/>
            nursing, &amp;c.</p>
          <p>Yet, though mistress of the house, the Athenian wife was not her <lb/>
            own mistress. She lived, as she had done before marriage, in the <lb/>
            female apartments, and was excluded from all male society. If her <lb/>
            husband had company, she did not sit at table with them, not even <lb/>
            with her own relations of the male sex. It was expected that she <lb/>
            should not leave the house without her husband's knowledge; it was <lb/>
            not respectable to go out without a slave; and to be seen at an open <lb/>
            window was considered indecorous. Hence it is that, when the news <lb/>
            of the disaster of Chæronea had reached Athens, the women, anxious <lb/>
            as they must have been to get intelligence of their husbands and <lb/>
            relatives who had been in the battle, are represented as coming no <lb/>
            farther than to the doors; and even this is mentioned as being un­ <lb/>
            seemly, and a sign of their great distress. (See Volume II. Appen­ <lb/>
            dix IX. page 392.)</p>
          <p>We read of legal restrictions against the women going abroad. <lb/>
            Plutarch in the life of Solon (21) says, that he passed a law for­ <lb/>
            bidding them to go out at night except in a chariot with a torch <lb/>
            before them; and Athenæus (XII. 521) mentions a similar law at <lb/>
            Syracuse, which forbade free women to go out at all after sunset. <lb/>
            The tendency of Solon's legislation apparently was, to curtail the <lb/>
            liberty of the female sex. He passed measures to check their ex­ <lb/>
            travagance in dress, and their disorderly conduct at festivals, sacri­ <lb/>
            fices, and mournings. There are said to have been officers called <lb/>
            Gynæconomi, whose business it was to see that Solon's regulations <lb/>
            were observed, and to punish improper excesses and breaches of <lb/>
             <pb n="315"/>
            decorum. It has been thought with some reason, that these officers <lb/>
            were not appointed till a later period. We find nothing about them <lb/>
            in the early Athenian writers; and the authority with which they are <lb/>
            said to have been invested was a little inconsistent with the freedom <lb/>
            of the Athenian democracy. For example, they had power to visit <lb/>
            private houses on festive occasions, such as weddings, and to see that <lb/>
            the lawful number of guests, which was thirty, was not exceeded. <lb/>
            This savours somewhat of a later age. If the Gynæconomi were a <lb/>
            Solonian institution, their functions were perhaps more limited in the <lb/>
            early times.</p>
          <p>From the passage in Plutarch, as well as from Aristopbanes and <lb/>
            other sources, we may collect, (what indeed is natural enough,) that, <lb/>
            when the women had their seasons of indulgence, as at the Thesmo­ <lb/>
            phoria, the Bacchic mysteries, and the like, they indemnified them­ <lb/>
            selves for the dull seclusion to which they were ordinarily condemned. <lb/>
            (See Volume III. Appendix VI. pp. 281, 307.)</p>
          <p>With respect to play-going, the better opinion is, that the women <lb/>
            were allowed to see tragedies, but not comedies. (Volume in. <lb/>
            Appendix VII. p. 323.) Decker however has shown, that they sat <lb/>
            separate from the men. (Cbaricles, Transl. p. 408.)</p>
          <p>It might perhaps have been expected, that it would have been a <lb/>
            part of a wife's duty to go to market, to purchase provisions for the <lb/>
            house. It is certain however, that this duty never devolved upon <lb/>
            the wife of an Athenian citizen, who was well to do in the world, and <lb/>
            could afford to keep a slave; which almost every respectable Athenian <lb/>
            did; for slaves were numerous and cheap, and carrying, as well as <lb/>
            other manual labour, was considered undignified even in a man. The <lb/>
            marketing therefore was done by the slaves, male and female. This <lb/>
            was the ordinary rule. Poverty of course made an exception; and <lb/>
            there were women, even the wives of citizens; who sold articles in <lb/>
            the market, such as bread, fruit, herbs, chaplets, &amp;c. We have seen <lb/>
            how Euxitheus complains of the prejudice excited against him in his <lb/>
            township because his mother sold ribbons (ante, page 309). And <lb/>
            the taunts of the comic poet about the mother of Euripides are well <lb/>
            known. (See the Charicles, Transl. pp. 287, 469.)</p>
          <p>It being deemed of so much importance to preserve feminine <lb/>
            modesty, one would suppose that the men would take especial care <lb/>
            to conduct themselves with decorum in the presence of females, and <lb/>
            to abstain from rude or indelicate language. That good taste and <lb/>
            propriety required this, was undoubtedly the general opinion of the <lb/>
            Athenians, as we know from their writings; though there is too <lb/>
            much reason to suppose that the duty was often violated. (See the <lb/>
            Oration against Midias, Vol. III. p. 91.) Becker, referring to this <lb/>
            passage, and quoting the words of Terence, "pudet dicere hâc præ­ <lb/>
            sente verbum turpe," says—“A beautiful observance, had it sprung <lb/>
            from true moral grounds, and not rather from motives of respect <lb/>
            to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">κύριος</foreign>, whoever he might be ”—(Charicles, p. 472). It was <lb/>
             <pb n="316"/>
            undoubtedly an affront to the husband or guardian of an Athenian lady, <lb/>
            to speak bad language in her presence; indeed it was an act of out­ <lb/>
            rage in a stranger to intrude at all into the female apartments, and <lb/>
            we have seen that Pantænetus treated this as a ground of action <lb/>
            against the intruder, (ante, p. 240.) Demosthenes however gives us <lb/>
            to understand, that offensive language before females was a thing of <lb/>
            itself to be reprobated, irrespective of the insult to the guardian, and <lb/>
            was generally repugnant to Athenian sentiment. Does the orator <lb/>
            attribute to those whom be addresses a higher tone of sentiment and <lb/>
            morality than really belonged to them ? Often he does; and it is the <lb/>
            policy and duty of a good speaker to do so; but there must be a <lb/>
            chord which he can strike in the minds of his hearers, or all appeal <lb/>
            to them will be in vain.</p>
          <p>The Athenian husband was desirous that his wife should look up <lb/>
            to him as the superior being; which she could hardly do, unless he <lb/>
            conducted himself as became an Athenian citizen, or, as we should <lb/>
            say, a gentleman, (<foreign xml:lang="grc">καλοκάγαθς</foreign>.) To do anything undignified in his <lb/>
            wife's presence would lower him in her esteem. In the oration <lb/>
            against Androtion it is spoken of as a hardship, that a man should be <lb/>
            driven to hide himself under the bed, in order to escape the tax­ <lb/>
            gatherer, and that he should be seen doing so by his wife. (Vol. III. <lb/>
            p. 155.) The wife could hardly look up to her husband with respect, <lb/>
            unless he were under some corresponding obligations to her. We <lb/>
            know from the oration of Andocides against Alcibiades (p. 117,) that, <lb/>
            if the husband brought a bad woman into the house, it afforded his <lb/>
            wife a legal ground to obtain a separation from him. And ill usage <lb/>
            of his wife subjected him to an indictment, as we have seen. (VoL <lb/>
            III. p. 351.)</p>
          <p>Looking at the manner in which women were brought up in <lb/>
            Athens, and at their general treatment and condition, we can easily <lb/>
            suppose, that love (in the sense in which that word is understood <lb/>
            in Christian countries) had but little to do with the formation of <lb/>
            Athenian marriages. It was indeed a rare thing, that a woman's <lb/>
            personal qualities were taken much into account. The case of <lb/>
            Callias, who fell in love with Elpinice, the sister of Cimon, and paid <lb/>
            her father's debt to the state that he might obtain her hand, may be <lb/>
            regarded as an exceptional case. Opportunities for falling in love <lb/>
            must have been very scarce. Becker in his Charicles, in order to find <lb/>
            a mistress for his hero, (a thing generally considered essential in <lb/>
            modern tales,) is obliged to invent an extraordinary incident. When <lb/>
            the passion of love was excited, it could not, under the circumstances, <lb/>
            have been one of a very refined character.</p>
          <p>Marriages were formed chiefly from family and political considera­ <lb/>
            tions. An Athenian took a wife to prevent the extinction of his race. <lb/>
            This was a duty which he owed to the state, to himself, and to the <lb/>
            memory of his ancestors. A religious sentiment was mingled with it. <lb/>
            That he should leave those behind him, who would continue to per­ <lb/>
             <pb n="317"/>
            form the religious worship of the family, was due not only to the <lb/>
            gods, but to the Manes of the departed. Such were his highest <lb/>
            motives for entering into the married life. In addition to these, <lb/>
            there would naturally be others of an economical character, such as <lb/>
            the desire to provide himself with a prudent and trusty housekeeper. <lb/>
            to form a good connexion, or to obtain a valuable dowry. In regard <lb/>
            to the last point, it was deemed most eligible to espouse a woman of <lb/>
            equal fortune and condition. Such a one was less likely to give <lb/>
            herself airs, or dispute her husband's supremacy.</p>
          <p>A maiden was seldom, if ever, consulted about the choice of he! <lb/>
            husband. The whole thing was managed by the relations. Plate <lb/>
            deplored this, and thought that the young people ought to have an <lb/>
            opportunity of seeing each other. But what could be expected in <lb/>
            such a state of society? We read of match-makers, <foreign xml:lang="grc">προμνήϭτριαι</foreign> <lb/>
            or <foreign xml:lang="grc">προμνηϭτρίδες</foreign>, who made it their business to effect matrimonial <lb/>
            alliances between their neighbours; though it would seem, they were <lb/>
            not in very good repute.</p>
          <p>We will now consider marriage in its legal aspects.</p>
          <p>It was essential to a strictly legal marriage at Athens, that both par­ <lb/>
            ties should be citizen-born. The laws of Solon did not prohibit a citizen <lb/>
            marrying a foreigner, and some eminent men in early times, as Cimon <lb/>
            and Themistocles, were the sons of foreign mothers; but, as the <lb/>
            Athenians became a powerful people, they grew jealous of foreign <lb/>
            intermixture, and Pericles passed a law, by which such a marriage <lb/>
            was declared illegal, and children by it were deprived of the civic <lb/>
            franchise. He himself had a son by Aspasia, in whose favour he <lb/>
            procured a special decree of the people, to exempt him from the <lb/>
            operation of this law. The violation of it subjected the parties to an <lb/>
            indictment, as we have already seen. (Vol. III. Appendix VIII. <lb/>
            p. 345.) The speech against Neæra furnishes an example of such a <lb/>
            proceeding. The prosecutor accuses Stephanus of having lived in <lb/>
            wedlock with Neæra, who was a slave and woman of infamous <lb/>
            character, and of passing off her children as his own legitimate issue. <lb/>
            Stephanus denies the charge, and says that he kept Neæra only as a <lb/>
            mistress, and his children were not by her. This speech, though <lb/>
            denied by critics to have been the genuine production of Demosthenes, <lb/>
            to whom it is attributed, is undoubtedly a genuine Attic production, <lb/>
            and full of instructive information upon the present subject.</p>
          <p>We must observe the distinction between a legitimate child, <foreign xml:lang="grc">γνήϭιος</foreign>, <lb/>
            and a free-born, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐλεύθερος</foreign>. A man might live with a concubine, and <lb/>
            declare the children that he had by her to be free. (See the law <lb/>
            cited in the oration against Aristocrates, Vol. III. p. 184.) Such <lb/>
            children, though free, would not have heritable rights, and, if the <lb/>
            mother were not an Athenian, they would by the law of Pericles be <lb/>
            deprived of the civic franchise.</p>
          <p>To make a legal marriage, it was further necessary, that the bride <lb/>
            should be affianced, or given away, by her guardian (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κύριος</foreign>,) whoever <lb/>
             <pb n="318"/>
            that was, i. e. her father, her brother, her paternal grandfather, or <lb/>
            other nearest relation. (See the law cited by Demosthenes in the <lb/>
            speech against Stephanus, page 1134.) Such regular espousals were <lb/>
            necessary to give the rights of legitimacy to the children. Cohabita­ <lb/>
            tion without espousals was regarded as mere concubinage.</p>
          <p>The contract itself was made not (as with us) between the man <lb/>
            and his intended wife, but between him and her guardian. Women <lb/>
            were incapable of entering into a contract, and therefore (whatever <lb/>
            their age) they were required to be given away by the persons, to <lb/>
            whom they were subject in law. (See Meier and Schömann, Att. <lb/>
            Proc. p. 409.)</p>
          <p>A husband might direct by will, that his widow should marry this <lb/>
            or that person. So the father of Demosthenes gave his widow to <lb/>
            Aphobus, Pasion gave his to Phormio, and the practice seems to have <lb/>
            been common. (See ante, pp. 94, 211.) It is somewhat doubtful <lb/>
            whether such a testamentary direction was compulsory on the widow; <lb/>
            but at all events it superseded the necessity of farther espousals.</p>
          <p>It would have been odd if Athenian nuptials (like those everywhere <lb/>
            else) had not been attended with various ceremonials. There was <lb/>
            the sacrifice to the tutelar gods of marriage,1 the bath taken by the <lb/>
            bride and bridegroom in the sacred fountain Callirrhoe, and of course <lb/>
            there was the wedding day, with its bridal dresses and garlands, its <lb/>
            cakes and sweetmeats, &amp;c., &amp;c. Nor must we forget, that the ladies <lb/>
            were allowed to be present on this special occasion. To return how­ <lb/>
            ever to the legal part of the matter-it appears that no ceremony <lb/>
            was actually necessary to bind the contract; the parties might pro­ <lb/>
            ceed to live together immediately; but it was customary to give a <lb/>
            marriage feast on the occasion, and to invite the friends and relations, <lb/>
            partly in compliance with religious feeling, and partly to give public <lb/>
            notoriety to the wedding, and preserve testimony to its legality. <lb/>
            (See what Demosthenes says, ante, p. 140.)</p>
          <p>If a woman had no property of her own by inheritance, (and she <lb/>
            could have none, if she had a brother,) a marriage portion was usually <lb/>
            given to her by the next of kin, by whom she was betrothed. To be <lb/>
            married without a portion, if the relations had the means of giving <lb/>
            one, was a disgrace either to her or to them, and might cause a <lb/>
            doubt to be raised as to the nature of the connexion. The Athenians <lb/>
            were liberal in these matters, and many a person would advance <lb/>
            money out of his own purse, rather than suffer a friend's daughter to <lb/>
            marry portionless. (See ante, p. 110, and Volume II. p. 99.)</p>
          <p>The money thus given to a woman upon her marriage was paid to <lb/>
            her husband, but was intended as a provision for her, and was usually <lb/>
            secured to her by a mortgage of the husband's real estate, or (if he <lb/>
            had no real estate) of his personal. The husband had the use and <lb/>
            sole management of his wife's property, while they lived together; <note type="footnote"> (1)<foreign xml:lang="grc">Προτέλεια γάμων</foreign>. As to this, and as to the whole subject of the nuptial <lb/>
            solemnities, I refer the reader to the Chat-idea, Tranalation, p. 482, &amp;c. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="319"/>
            but, on a separation, he was bound to restore it to her guardian, and <lb/>
            to pay eighteen per cent. interest, so long as he kept it in his own <lb/>
            hands. The interest so paid was called alimony or maintenance, as <lb/>
            being the interest of that fund out of which the woman had a right <lb/>
            to be maintained.1 The next of kin, to whom the money was restored, <lb/>
            became the legal owner thereof, but was bound in honour to apply it <lb/>
            to the woman's benefit, and to give it to her again upon a subsequent <lb/>
            marriage. Such was the custom of the country; and custom had the <lb/>
            force of an obligation.</p>
          <p>After the death of the husband, if the wife had no son by him, she <lb/>
            returned to the guardianship of her next of kin; if she had a son, the <lb/>
            choice was given her, either to stay with him and live under his pro­ <lb/>
            tection, or to return to her original family. In case she stayed with <lb/>
            her son, he became her guardian and the owner of her property, (that <lb/>
            is,) if he was of full age; if he was a minor, his guardian of course <lb/>
            acted for him.</p>
          <p>If the wife died before the husband, her property returned to her <lb/>
            next of kin, unless she had children, in which case they took it ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the rules of inheritance.</p>
          <p>Thus might property be settled upon a wife at Athens not very <lb/>
            differently from the way that it is with us. The various points of law <lb/>
            the reader has seen illustrated in the cases of Aphobus, Onetor, <lb/>
            Boeotus, and Spudias. The settlements, as we might expect, were <lb/>
            not always made in the simple form that I have supposed. For <lb/>
            example, in the case of Spudias, the plaintiff says that his wife's for­ <lb/>
            tune was not all paid down to him at the marriage, but one fourth of <lb/>
            it was agreed to be paid after her father's death, and it was secured <lb/>
            by the mortgage of a house. Demosthenes asserts that the marriage <lb/>
            portion of Onetor's sister was not paid down to Aphobus, but it was <lb/>
            arranged that the principal should remain in the hands of her former <lb/>
            husband, Timocrates, who was to pay Aphobus ten per cent. while he <lb/>
            retained it.</p>
          <p>That wedding presents, (such as clothes, jewellery, &amp;c.) were some­ <lb/>
            times given in addition to the settlement, and so as not to form a <lb/>
            part of it; and on the other hand, that such things might be given in <lb/>
            lieuof money, and taken into account in making up the dowry, if the <lb/>
            parties chose so to agree, as seems to have been the case upon the <lb/>
            marriage of Spudias; these are points that may deserve a brief notice, <lb/>
            as they have given rise to some discussion. The amount of these <lb/>
            wedding presents, (the or bride's trousseau, as we might call <lb/>
            it,) was limited, as Plutarch tells us, by the sumptuary law of Solon. <lb/>

            page 415.)</p>

            inherit their father's estate, which a girl could not do, if she had a <lb/>
            brother; for the estate went to him, and she was only entitled (by <lb/>
            the custom of the country) to a suitable dowry, that is, one cor. <lb/>
            responding to her father's or brother's position and means, and such <lb/>
            as would do credit to their liberality. A girl however, who had no <lb/>
            brother, stood upon a different footing. She inherited the patrimony, <lb/>
            and was called an heiress,1 whether the estate were great or small, or <lb/>
            even if there were no estate; for she was still the representative of <lb/>
            the family, succeeding to its traditions and religious usages. The <lb/>
            regulations of the Athenian law with respect to heiresses were pecu­ <lb/>
            liar, and arose from the care of the legislator, that all civic families, <lb/>
            with their traditions and usages, should be perpetuated.</p>
          <p>It was the business of the archon to see that an heiress was duly <lb/>
            married. The next of kin, not in the ascending line, had a right to <lb/>
            claim her hand, and, if there was any dispute as to the right, the <lb/>
            archon held a court for its decision. So far from having power to <lb/>
            choose a husband, the heiress was considered as little better than a <lb/>
            part of the estate, and was taken with it as a sort of incumbrance. <lb/>
            The father however could not disinherit his daughter; for, if he <lb/>
            devised his property, the devisee was obliged to marry her. And, as <lb/>
            the girl was deemed an heiress in law, whether she had an estate left <lb/>
            her or not, if she became by succession the representative of the <lb/>
            family, the next of kin was bound, either to take her for a wife, or to <lb/>
            give her a portion corresponding to his rank. This was but fair. It <lb/>
            was his privilege to marry a rich heiress; his duty to provide for a <lb/>
            poor one. And thus the object of the Athenian law, that no civic <lb/>
            family should become extinct, was accomplished.</p>
          <p>If there was but one daughter, she was the sole heiress; if there <lb/>
            were more, they inherited equally, like our co-parceners, and were <lb/>
            severally married to relatives, the nearest having the first choice.</p>
          <p>The husband of an heiress took her property until she had a son of <lb/>
            full age, who was usually adopted into his maternal grandfather s <lb/>
            family, and took possession of the estate. He then became his <lb/>
            mother's legal protector or guardian, and was bound to maintain her.</p>
          <p>It appears by these regulations concerning heiresses, that con­ <lb/>
            sanguinity was no bar to a matrimonial union at Athens. Uncles <lb/>
            frequently married their nieces; and even brother and sister were <lb/>
            allowed to marry, provided they were not by the same mother. Such <lb/>
            a union however was not sanctioned by public opinion; and marriage <lb/>
            was only allowed in the collateral branches. (See the Attic Process, <lb/>
            406. Charicles, TransL 477.)</p>
          <p>I have lastly to speak on the subject of divorce.</p>
          <p>In case of adultery committed by the wife, we have already seen, <lb/>
            that the husband was compelled by law to dismiss her, and that she <note type="footnote"> (1) She was called <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπίκληρος</foreign>. The girl who received a dowry only was called <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπἱπροικος</foreign>, the portioned, or endowed. See the Archaeological Dictionary, titles Dot <lb/>
            Spiclerus. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="321"/>
            was subjected to infamy and severe punishment. (See Volume III. <lb/>
            Appendix VIII. page 348.)</p>
          <p>In other cases, there is a doubt whether the husband had an un­ <lb/>
            limited power of dismissing his wife, or whether some cause must not <lb/>
            have been assigned. Becker inclines to the latter view, which is in <lb/>
            some degree favoured by the mention of an Attic form of action for <lb/>
            unjust dismissal.1 Such an action however may have related rather <lb/>
            to the method of proceeding adopted by the husband, than to the <lb/>
            causes of divorce. For example, we may presume that he could not <lb/>
            get rid of his wife by turning her out of doors, but was obliged to <lb/>
            take or send her back to the house of her legal protector, with her <lb/>
            clothes and paraphernalia, and in a decent and proper way. Beyond <lb/>
            this indeed very little ceremony seems to have been necessary. The <lb/>
            main thing which the wife's friends required was, that her portion <lb/>
            should be returned with her. Meier observes, that the practice of <lb/>
            divorcing, (so frightfully2 common at Athens in later times) was <lb/>
            unknown to the Greeks of the heroic age. Besides the various <lb/>
            motives, which naturally incline men to seek a new connexion or <lb/>
            break off the old, the Athenian law created artificial causes of divorce. <lb/>
            The heiress became the property of the next of kin. He, or she, or <lb/>
            both of them, might be married at the time when the inheritance <lb/>
            devolved upon her. In such a case the man was tempted to put <lb/>
            away his wife, the woman might be obliged to leave her husband.</p>
          <p>If a woman desired to obtain a divorce, and could not get her <lb/>
            husband's consent, she went in person to the archon, and stated in <lb/>
            writing the grounds of her application. Her right to a separation <lb/>
            would depend on the treatment she received. Of the nature of this <lb/>
            proceeding we know but little. It was the general duty of the archon <lb/>
            to protect the interests of married women, and to take cognizance of <lb/>
            all complaints against the husband for ill usage, for refusal to pay <lb/>
            alimony to his wife, or to return her portion. He also kept a register <lb/>
            of all divorces, whether made by consent or otherwise.</p>
          <p>A mad freak is recorded of Alcibiades; that having by his ill <lb/>
            treatment forced his wife Hipparete (daughter of Hipponicus) to <lb/>
            leave his house and sue for a divorce, he seized her in the archon's <lb/>
            presence, and dragged her home. <note type="footnote"> (1) <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκη</foreign> </note><note type="footnote"> (2) EiDer fur christliche Begriffe schrecklichen Gewohneit.

            <title type="sub">ONETOR'S CASE.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I HAVE shown elsewhere, that the successful party in an Athenian <lb/>
            suit had not the assistance of a public officer, like our Sheriff, to levy <lb/>
            execution; and that, if the sum awarded to him by judgment were not <lb/>
            paid by the appointed time, he had to satisfy himself by taking <lb/>
            personal possession of his adversary's goods or lands.' It is obvious <lb/>
            that this course was attended with some disadvantages. In the first <lb/>
            place, there was not the same security for the preservation of the <lb/>
            public peace, as where the process of the law is executed by its known <lb/>
            officer; and in the next place, the remedy of the creditor, in case of <lb/>
            resistance or dispute, was not quite so speedy.</p>
          <p>We are not however to suppose, because the creditor in levying <lb/>
            execution was not aided by any officers of the Jaw, that resistance to <lb/>
            an execution commonly or frequently led to acts of outrage or <lb/>
            violence. That this sometimes happened, we may take for granted ;2 <lb/>
            it would be strange if it had not; but, that in the ordinary course <lb/>
            of things it was otherwise, may be with some certainty gathered from <lb/>
            what we read in the Attic orators and elsewhere. The Athenians, in <lb/>
            the settled times of the republic, were a people accustomed to obey <lb/>
            the law, and to observe its outward forms and processes. Dishonest <lb/>
            men would endeavour to evade or defeat the law by artful shifts and <lb/>
            contrivances, but seldom dared to infringe it openly. Fraud was <lb/>
            common enough; violence not so. The course of things upon an <lb/>
            execution was the same as in taking possession of property upon <lb/>
            any other occasion. If a man desired to assert his title, say, to a piece <lb/>
            of land, (whether his title accrued by inheritance, or by purchase, or in <lb/>
            any other way), and if he had reason to think that it would be disputed, <lb/>
            he made a formal entry upon the land, and thereby became seised, or <lb/>
            possessed of it. If the adverse claimant came then to disturb his <lb/>
            possession, he might bring against him an action of ejectment: but, <lb/>
            before entry, he was not in a condition to bring such action. The <lb/>
            supposed ejectment however was (in general) a mere formality. The <lb/>
            opponent, upon entry being made, turned him off, either by gently <lb/>
            laying hands upon him, or by commanding him to leave. All this <lb/>
            took place quietly, and in the presence of witnesses. The party who <lb/>
            turned the other off the land became a trespasser in the eye of the <lb/>
            law, and liable to the action, which was brought to try the title.. <note type="footnote"> (1) Vol III. Appendix ix. page 391. </note><note type="footnote"> (2) See the Oration against Apaturins, ante page 162. </note><note type="footnote"> (3) This was the <foreign xml:lang="grc">έξούλης δίκη</foreign>.

            </p>
          <p>This was precisely what occurred in the case of Demosthenes.He <lb/>
            made entry, upon the farm of Aphobus, which he had a right to take <lb/>
            in execution. Onetor, claiming it as mortgagee, comes and orders <lb/>
            him off, or turns him off, and thereby subjects himself to an action of <lb/>
            ejectment. There is no actual force used. Demosthenes indeed says, <lb/>
            that Onetor did it in an insulting manner.1 This was perhaps an <lb/>
            exaggeration on the part of the orator ; but, whether so or not, he <lb/>
            does not pretend to charge Onetor with the exercise of any violence. <lb/>
            It was nothing but the formal act of ejectment.</p>
          <p>It was the same in the case of personal property. We have an <lb/>
            example in the speech written by Demosthenes for his uncle Demon, <lb/>
            in an action brought against him by Zenothemis. The case was this. <lb/>
            Zenothemis claimed a cargo of corn, which one Protus, an agent of <lb/>
            Demon, had imported. Upon his proceeding to enforce his claim by <lb/>
            taking possession, Protus goes to remove him. Zenothemis will not <lb/>
            give up possession to Protus, but insists that Demon shall join in the <lb/>
            removal; his object being, that he may acquire a cause of action <lb/>
            against Demon as well as against Protus, probably because he re­ <lb/>
            garded Demon as the more responsible person of the two. Demon, <lb/>
            desiring to retain possession of the corn, consents to join in the tres­ <lb/>
            pass, goes through the required formality of laying hands upon <lb/>
            Zenothemis, and thus subjects himself to the action, which Zenothemis <lb/>
            afterwards brings against him; in which, the formal trespass being <lb/>
            admitted, the title to the corn is the substantial question in dispute.::</p>
          <p>These formalities were a relic of ruder times, when people used to <lb/>
            assert their rights with violence, and the complaint of the injured <lb/>
            party was founded upon a real and not a supposed trespass. Lawyers <lb/>
            preserved the form when the reality no longer existed, and even con­ <lb/>
            sidered the form necessary as a foundation for legal proceedings. It <lb/>
            is interesting and instructive to observe, how the same sort of <lb/>
            .practices have prevailed in different countries, as if the one had <lb/>
            borrowed them from the other, or as if the attachment of lawyers to <lb/>
            unnecessary forms were the same all the world over. I shall mention <lb/>
            a few examples by way of illustration.</p>
          <p>At Rome in the early times, if the title to land were in dispute, the <lb/>
            claimant summoned his adversary by the words " ex jure te manum <lb/>
            consertum voco," to go with him to the land, and turn him off in the <lb/>
            presence of the Prætor and others; which ceremony was afterwards <lb/>
            changed to the symbolical act of breaking a clod of earth upon the <lb/>
            land, intimating that the person who broke it claimed the right of <lb/>
            property.</p>
          <p>In ancient times, no conveyance of lands was complete in this <lb/>
            country without livery of seisin, or corporal delivery of possession; <note type="footnote"> (1) <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάνυ ύβριϭτικω̄ς ἐνοβλήθην</foreign>. (864.) Afterwards he uses the more ordinary ex <lb/>
            pression, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξήγαέ, με ἐκ τη̄ς γη̄̄ς. γη̄ς</foreign>. (865.) </note><note type="footnote"> (2) See ante, page 166, and see the argument , of thespeech. </note> <note type="footnote"> T2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="324"/>
            and this was generally performed by the giving of a clod, or turf, or <lb/>
            twig. Of such symbolical tradition there are plenty of examples in <lb/>
            other countries. Thus among the Jews the evidence of a purchase <lb/>
            is defined in the book of Ruth, ch. iv. 7, 8.</p>
          <p>" Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning re­ <lb/>
            deeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man <lb/>
            plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour; and this was a <lb/>
            testimony in Israel.</p>
          <p>" Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz: Buy it for thee. So he <lb/>
            drew off his shoe."</p>
          <p>The giving of the shoe to the purchaser signified that he had full <lb/>
            right to walk and tread upon the land as his own.</p>
          <p>Among the Goths and Swedes contracts for sale of lands were <lb/>
            made in the presence of witnesses, who extended the cloak of the <lb/>
            buyer, while the vendor cast a clod into it, and a staff or wand was <lb/>
            delivered from the vendor to the vendee, which passed through the <lb/>
            hands of the witnesses. Blackstone (Commentaries II. 313) notices <lb/>
            a similar ceremony in the conveyance of our copyhold estates, from <lb/>
            the seller to the lord or his steward, by the delivery of a rod or <lb/>
            verge, and then from the lord to the purchaser, by the re-delivery of <lb/>
            the same, in the presence of a jury of tenants.</p>
          <p>In England the heir of land did not get complete ownership, till he <lb/>
            had made actual entry; and a lessee was obliged to enter, in order <lb/>
            to become a complete tenant. And if a man was disseised, or ousted <lb/>
            from possession, his remedy was to make entry upon the land, <lb/>
            declaring that he thereby took possession ; which entry restored him <lb/>
            to his seisin and ownership, and thereby to the capacity of conveying <lb/>
            it from himself by purchase or transmitting it by descent. It was <lb/>
            sufficient however to enter into a part of the lands in the name of <lb/>
            the whole, in the case of lands lying all in one county. If the disseised <lb/>
            party was prevented from making a peaceable entry by menaces or <lb/>
            bodily fear, he might make claim, going as near to the land as he <lb/>
            could, with the like forms and solemnities; which claim continued in <lb/>
            force for a year and a day.</p>
          <p>One of the most remarkable instances of legal fiction is the pro­ <lb/>
            cess in the English action of ejectment, which continued for many <lb/>
            centuries to be the regular mode of trying the title to land. The <lb/>
            claimant (say Joseph Smith) pretended to have granted a lease to one <lb/>
            John Doe, who pretended to have made an entry on the land, and to <lb/>
            have been ousted, or turned off, by one Richard Roe, against whom <lb/>
            he commenced an action for the trespass. Richard Roe sent notice <lb/>
            of this, with a copy of the declaration, to the real tenant, (say William <lb/>
            Rogers), advising him to appear to the action and defend his title. <lb/>
            The service of this notice on Rogers was the first real proceeding 'n <lb/>
            the case. Rogers then applied to be made defendant in the place if <lb/>
            Richard Roe, which he was allowed to do, on condition of his con­ <lb/>
            fessing the series of legal fictions above mentioned, (the lease, the <lb/>
             <pb n="325"/>
            entry, and the ouster,) and consenting to go to trial upon the real <lb/>
            question. Such consent being given, the action proceeded under the <lb/>
            name of "Doe on the demise of Smith against Rogers;" and, proof <lb/>
            of the mere formalities being dispensed with, the only question to be <lb/>
            tried was, whether Smith could make out a good title against Rogers, <lb/>
            or the landlord of Rogers. The object of this contrivance was to <lb/>
            supersede the cumbrous machinery of real actions, the more ancient <lb/>
            method of trying titles to land. All this however has been recently <lb/>
            abolished, and a simpler method of bringing actions of ejectment has <lb/>
            been substituted.</p>
          <p>I shall lastly refer to two other fictions, which until a recent period <lb/>
            were necessary in the commencement of actions in two of our English <lb/>
            courts; one of which will be found to resemble this fiction of the <lb/>
            Athenian law.</p>
          <p>Anciently the court of King's Bench had not cognizance of actions <lb/>
            of debt or any purely civil actions. In order to acquire it, the Judges <lb/>
            allowed a defendant to be brought into court upon a pretended charge <lb/>
            of trespass, over which the court always had jurisdiction. The bill <lb/>
            or process, by which he was brought in, alleged that he was in cus­ <lb/>
            tody of the marshal upon a supposed arrest; this assertion the <lb/>
            defendant was not allowed to dispute; and being in such custody, <lb/>
            the plaintiff was allowed to proceed against him for any other cause <lb/>
            of action of a personal nature. Thus the court of King's Bench en­ <lb/>
            larged their criminal jurisdiction to a civil one.</p>
          <p>In a similar way the court of Exchequer, which formerly only <lb/>
            entertained causes concerning the royal revenue, invented a process <lb/>
            by which it acquired the right to try ordinary civil actions. It had <lb/>
            always been held, that the king's debtors, farmers and accomptants <lb/>
            of the Exchequer, were privileged to sue other parties in that court; <lb/>
            and so the form of a writ was devised, in which the plaintiff pretended <lb/>
            that he was a debtor to the king, and that the withholding of his debt <lb/>
            or damages from him by the defendant prevented him from discharg­ <lb/>
            ing his debt to the royal treasury. The writ was called a writ of <lb/>
            quo minus, because it alleged in Latin, " that the defendant had done <lb/>
            the plaintiff an injury, by which he was the less able to pay his debt <lb/>
            to the king:" "quo minus sufficiens existit, &amp;c.” This surmise, like <lb/>
            that in the other court, the defendant was not at liberty to contest; <lb/>
            and down to the reign of William IV. it continued to be a necessary <lb/>
            part of the process in a civil action, and indeed the foundation of the <lb/>
            proceeding. Blackstone and other English lawyers have boasted of <lb/>
            these ingenious devices, and referred complacently to the maxim­ <lb/>
            " in fictione juris consistit æquitas.”</p>
          <p>In this case of Onetor the real question for the jury to try was, <lb/>
            whether Aphobus had mortgaged his land bondfide, or whether it was <lb/>
            merely a colourable and collusive contrivance. Onetor alleged in proof <lb/>
            of its validity, that the mortgage was given before Demosthenes <lb/>
            recovered his judgment. Had it been given after, probably it would <lb/>
             <pb n="326"/>
            have been bad in law altogether; but the fact of its being regular in <lb/>
            point of form and other external matters would not render the trans­ <lb/>
            action valid, if it was designed for a fraudulent purpose, viz. to defeat <lb/>
            the rights of a third party. Demosthenes answers Onetor by saying <lb/>
            —“True, you took the mortgage before my judgment, but you took <lb/>
            it under the expectation that I should recover judgment, and in order <lb/>
            to prevent my levying execution." And if this was so, the trans­ <lb/>
            action, as against Demosthenes, was a mere nullity.</p>
          <p>The same tricks are played in modem times that were played two <lb/>
            thousand years ago; and similar questions are tried in our English <lb/>
            courts, and brought to trial in a manner not very dissimilar. The <lb/>
            sheriff, levying an execution for A against B, receives a notice from <lb/>
            C, that the property seized belongs to him, alleging that it has been <lb/>
            transferred or mortgaged to him by bill of sale. If the Sheriff dis­ <lb/>
            regards the notice and proceeds with the execution, the claimant C <lb/>
            brings an action against him: but if he wishes to relieve himself, as <lb/>
            he generally does, and leave the battle to be fought out between A <lb/>
            and C, he obtains an order of interpleader, directing an issue to be <lb/>
            tried between those parties, to determine whether the title of C is <lb/>
            good against A. Here the same question frequently arises as between <lb/>
            Demosthenes and Onetor; whether the alleged bill of sale is not all <lb/>
            a pretence, whether C is not a friend of B, lending his name for the <lb/>
            purpose of defrauding A. If that be the case, the bill -of sale is <lb/>
            mere waste paper. The way to get at the truth is, by inquiring into <lb/>
            the circumstances of the alleged transfer, the relation of the parties <lb/>
            to each other, the consideration given, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
          <p>The consequence of a verdict for the plaintiff in such a case as this <lb/>
            of Onetor was, in the first place, that the property was adjudged to <lb/>
            the plaintiff, and secondly, that the defendant was condemned to pay <lb/>
            to the public treasury a sum equal to the value of the property. <lb/>
            This was the means by which the plaintiff ultimately got the fruits <lb/>
            of his judgment. For the defendant became a state-debtor, and was <lb/>
            thereby disfranchised, and might in course of time become liable to <lb/>
            imprisonment, as we have already seen. I incline to Schomann's <lb/>
            opinion, that the state did not discharge the defendant from the <lb/>
            public debt, unless he also satisfied the plaintiff by giving up to him <lb/>
            the property in question or paying him his damages.</p>
          <p>The Athenians, for an ordinary mortgage of real property, appear <lb/>
            not to have used deeds or writings. The only evidence of the hypo­ <lb/>
            thecation were these opot, or tablets, of which mention is frequently <lb/>
            made in Demosthenes. They were stone tablets, or marble slabs, <lb/>
            (steinerne Tafeln Meier calls them,) which were set up on the bound­ <lb/>
            aries of the land, or on some conspicuous part of the house, as over <lb/>
            the door or on the wall, with an inscription, stating that the land <lb/>
            or house was mortgaged to such and such a person for so much <lb/>
            money. The name of the Archon, in whose year of office the security <lb/>
            was given, was always mentioned. Böckh has published two inscrip­ <lb/>
             <pb n="327"/>
            tions upon two several stones of this kind. One, which was found <lb/>
            at Acharnæ, denotes that the mortgage was given in the Archonship <lb/>
            of Theophrastus for the unpaid purchase-money of land sold by Pha­ <lb/>
            nostratus of Pæania.1 The other, found at Marathon, which is <lb/>
            imperfect, states that a house and land had been given to secure the <lb/>
            orphan son of Diogiton of Probalintbus.2 Meier mentions an unpub­ <lb/>
            lished inscription, of a lease for forty years given by the townsmen of <lb/>
            Aixone to one Autocles, in which the lessors stipulate that, in case <lb/>
            the rent is in arrear, the produce of the land shall be mortgaged to <lb/>
            them, and they shall be at liberty to put up stones, two on each side <lb/>
            of the land, not less than three feet high.8</p>
          <p>That these stones or tablets were a very ancient usage at Athens, <lb/>
            may be learned from Plutarch, who informs us that, when Solon <lb/>
            established his famous disburdening ordinance,4 he removed the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅροι</foreign> <lb/>
            which were set up in all parts of the country on the lands of the <lb/>
            small proprietors, as the evidences of their obligations to the more <lb/>
            wealthy class. It is plain that they were adapted to a rude age, <lb/>
            when writing materials were scarce, and transfers of land were <lb/>
            accompanied by delivery of possession, or something of the sort, to <lb/>
            make them notorious. They could be of little use however, except <lb/>
            in a small community, where the creditor might constantly have them <lb/>
            before his eye. Without such opportunity of inspection, there would <lb/>
            be nothing to prevent a fraudulent debtor from removing them, and <lb/>
            mortgaging his land over again. One may be a little surprised at <lb/>
            Reiske's note—“ Mos hie apud nos quoque si obtineret, quem optan­ <lb/>
            dum erat obtinere, quam multos ejusmodi <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅρους</foreign> esset videre!” One <lb/>
            would have thought Reiske might have learned from Demosthenes, <lb/>
            that pillars are as easily removed as they are put up. It is still more <lb/>
            strange however to find Blackstone expressing himself in the same <lb/>
            strain, and lamenting that we cannot return to the old times when <lb/>
            land was transferred to the mortgagee in the presence of the neigh­ <lb/>
            bours : he writes thus, (Commentaries, II. page 159:)</p>
          <p>" In Glanvil's time, when the universal method of conveyance was <lb/>
            by livery of seisin or corporal tradition of the lands, no gage or pledge <lb/>
            of lands was good unless possession was also delivered to the credi­ <lb/>
            tor : ' si non sequatur ipsius vadii traditio, curia domini regis hujus­ <lb/>
            modi privatas conventiones tueri non solet:<foreign xml:lang="grc">᾽</foreign> for which the reason <lb/>
            given is, to prevent subsequent and fraudulent pledges of the land: <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_19_fig4.jpg"/></figure><note type="footnote"> (4) <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϭειϭάχθεια</foreign>. The exact nature of this measure is uncertain. It was probably <lb/>
              an arrangement for a redaction of the debts of the poorer class, not a total abolition <lb/>
              of them, as some have supposed. Whether this was effected by a direct cancelling <lb/>
              of a portion of the debt, or by a depreciation of the currency, has been a matter of <lb/>
              dispute. Bee Plutarch, Vit. Solon. 13. </note> <lb/>
               <pb n="328"/>
              'cum in tali casu possit eadem res pluribus ales creditoribus tum <lb/>
              prius turn posterius invadiari.' And the frauds which have arisen <lb/>
              since the exchange of these public and notorious conveyances for <lb/>
              more private and secret bargains have well evinced the wisdom of <lb/>
              our ancient law."</p>
          <p>Things are much changed since the time of Glanvil, who wrote in <lb/>
            the reign of Henry II. 1 need hardly say, that livery of seisin and <lb/>
            corporal tradition would not be notorious at the present day. A man's <lb/>
            neighbours make but a small part of the world he lives in, and they <lb/>
            do not pay much attention to his transfers or his mortgages. As­ <lb/>
            suredly we shall never go back to livery of seisin, or notices upon the <lb/>
            land, or any contrivance of that sort. In our country title deeds are <lb/>
            the evidence of property in land, and no cautious creditor will accept <lb/>
            a mortgage, unless all the title deeds in the mortgagor's possession <lb/>
            are delivered to him. That difficulties frequently occur in the inves­ <lb/>
            tigation of the title to real property, and that frauds are occasionally <lb/>
            committed, we all know; to prevent which it has often been proposed, <lb/>
            and many attempts have been made, to establish a public register of <lb/>
            title. But this is a subject fraught with difficulty, and upon which <lb/>
            there is a great difference of opinion. Here I can do no more than <lb/>
            glance at it.</p>
          <p>The name of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅροι</foreign> was probably given to these stones, because they <lb/>
            were fixed on the boundaries, and thus denoted the extent of land <lb/>
            which was subject to the mortgage. It once occurred to me, that <lb/>
            the term might be used to designate the interests of the parties <lb/>
            concerned, in the same way as we use the words limit and limitation <lb/>
            in our law. For example we say " an estate limited to A B for life, <lb/>
            with remainder to his son in fee." But there is no authority for <lb/>
            such a supposition with respect to the Attic term; and it is alto­ <lb/>
            gether more probable that it had reference to a terminal boundary.</p>

          <p>THE importance of foreign commerce to the Athenians rendered it <lb/>
            necessary for them to enact various laws for its regulation, and for <lb/>
            the protection of those engaged in it. Of the numerous commodities <lb/>
            which they imported-as corn, wine, salt-fish, hides, leather, wool, <lb/>
            timber, wax, tar, linen, carpets, gold, copper, iron, slaves, &amp;c.—some <lb/>
            were necessary to their existence, or at least to their prosperity, <lb/>
            others were articles of luxury and comfort, which habit had rendered <lb/>
            almost indispensable. These they were enabled to procure, directly <lb/>
             <pb n="329"/>
            or indirectly, in exchange for the native produce or manufactures of <lb/>
            their own country, namely, oil, honey, olives, figs, marble, silver, <lb/>
            lead, works of art in wood and metal, articles of furniture and dress, <lb/>
            armour, hardware, earthenware, jewellery, &amp;c.</p>
          <p>it was by means of individual enterprise, as now, that this com­ <lb/>
            merce was carried on. It was both just and politic, that the capi­ <lb/>
            talists and other people who embarked in it should be encouraged, <lb/>
            their rights secured, their contracts duly enforced. That such was <lb/>
            the policy of the Athenian law, we are frequently informed by <lb/>
            Demosthenes. I may instance in particular what he says at the <lb/>
            close of the speech against Phormio, (ante, 184,185 ;) from which <lb/>
            we learn that frauds practised upon those who lent money on mer­ <lb/>
            cantile adventures might be punished with the utmost severity. The <lb/>
            establishment of special tribunals for the speedy trial of mercantile <lb/>
            causes was, as I have shown, that merchants might not be impeded <lb/>
            in their business by legal delays. (See the Argument to the speech <lb/>
            against Zenothemis. ante, 150.)</p>
          <p>The manner in which maritime commerce was carried on by the <lb/>
            ancient Athenians differed from that of modern times in some <lb/>
            important respects.</p>
          <p>With us, a trading ship is employed in two different ways. In the <lb/>
            one case-the ship, or the principal part thereof, is let by the owners <lb/>
            for some particular voyage; this is usually done by an agreement <lb/>
            under seal, called a charter-party, and the ship is said to be chartered. <lb/>
            In the other case-the owners of a ship destined to make a particular <lb/>
            voyage engage with various persons, unconnected with each other, <lb/>
            to convey their respective goods to the place of destination; a ship <lb/>
            thus employed is called a general ship. The owners rarely navigate <lb/>
            the ship themselves, but leave the management of it to the master, <lb/>
            by whose lawful contracts during the time of his employment they <lb/>
            are held to be bound. When the goods are put on board, the master <lb/>
            gives an acknowledgment called a bill of lading, by which he under­ <lb/>
            takes to deliver them to the party therein named or to his assignee. <lb/>
            A duplicate of this, signed by the master, is sent by the shipper to <lb/>
            his consignee abroad; to whom, on its production, the goods are to <lb/>
            be delivered. The merchant himself rarely goes on the voyage, <lb/>
            though sometimes be sends out a supercargo to protect his interests.</p>
          <p>Such are the general features of a trading voyage in modern times. <lb/>
            The character of the whole business however is much altered by the <lb/>
            practice of insurance, which was unknown to the ancients.1 <note type="footnote"> (1) " In the middle ages”—says Park, in his treatise on marine insurance— <lb/>
            .. almost all the commerce of Europe centred amongst the Italians. As they <lb/>
            at that time carried on and established a regular trade with the East in the ports of <lb/>
            Egypt, and drew from thence all the rich produce of India; it is reasonable to <lb/>
            suppose, that in order to support so extensive a commerce, these industrious and <lb/>
            ingenious people were the first who introduced insurances into the system of mer­ <lb/>
            cantile affairs. It is true, there is no direct authority to warrant a positive assertion, <lb/>
            that they were the inventors of this kind of contract: but it Is certain, that the <lb/>
            knowledge of it came with them into the different maritime states, in which parties </note> <pb n="330"/>
            </p>
          <p>At Athens the system was different. There were usually the <lb/>
            following parties to a trading voyage:—1. The shipowner; 2. The <lb/>
            merchant adventurers ; 3. The capitalists, who lent money to those <lb/>
            respective parties on the security of the ship, freight, and goods. <lb/>
            The owner of the ship was often obliged to borrow money for his <lb/>
            outfit and navigation; for this he mortgaged the ship and freight. <lb/>
            The merchant adventurer was usually a person who had little or no <lb/>
            capital, who purchased the outward cargo with borrowed money, <lb/>
            went out with it to sea, sold it at the place of destination, and then <lb/>
            procured a return cargo which he brought home. The capitalist, <lb/>
            who supplied the fund for this, was commonly a banker, or some <lb/>
            person acquainted with the nature of the trade, who found it advan­ <lb/>
            tageous to employ a portion of his spare money in this way, on <lb/>
            account of the high rate of the profit which it yielded.</p>
          <p>Such appears to have been the ordinary course of things. But <lb/>
            that this was sometimes varied-and that the relations of the parties <lb/>
            did not always stand exactly on the same footing—we may readily <lb/>
            imagine. For example-the shipowner might carry merchandise on <lb/>
            his own account; or the merchant might trade with his own money, <lb/>
            either wholly or in part.</p>
          <p>Let me illustrate what I have said by reference to the cases in <lb/>
            this present volume. First take that of Zenothemis. We have <lb/>
            Hegestratus. the shipowner, who is alleged to have borrowed money <lb/>
            on a pretended security of goods; the ship and freight having pro­ <lb/>
            bably been pledged before. Zenothemis and Protus are merchant <lb/>
            adventurers, trading with borrowed money, and going out on the <lb/>
            voyage. Demon and his partners and the Syracusan creditors are <lb/>
            the capitalists who find the funds for these persons.</p>
          <p>In the case of Apaturius, the defendant tells us, that for a con­ <lb/>
            siderable time he was engaged in foreign commerce and used himself <lb/>
            to make voyages; that, having saved some money, he gave up going <lb/>
            to sea, but lent his capital to other merchants. Here we have the <lb/>
            merchant adventurer, who had been successful in trade, retiring from <lb/>
            the personal risk and toil of a seafaring life, and becoming a money- <lb/>
            lender only. Compare what Nicobulus says of himself, (ante, <lb/>
            241, 242.) <note type="footnote"> of them settled: and when it is admitted that they were the carriers, manufacturers, <lb/>
            and bankers of Europe, it is probable that they also led the way to the establishment <lb/>
            of a contract, which is so essentially necessary to the support and cultivation of <lb/>
            commerce. It has however been asserted by the writers of the French nation, that <lb/>
            insurance dates its origin in the year 1182, and that it was introduced by the Jews, <lb/>
            who were banished from France about that period, and who took that method to <lb/>
            facilitate and secure the removal of their effects. They proceed to say, that the <lb/>
            Lombards, who were not idle spectators of this contrivance, adopted it, and in a <lb/>
            short time improved it considerably. It is not very necessary to inquire into the <lb/>
            truth of this fact, nor indeed are there materials to enable us to do so: but it is <lb/>
            observable that the President Montesquieu mentions that the Jews upon this occa­ <lb/>
            sion invented bills of exchange, but does not say a syllable of policies of insurance <lb/>
            It is agreed, however, that, if the Lombards were not the inventors, they were at <lb/>
            least the first who brought the contract of insurance to perfection, and introduced it <lb/>
            to the world... </note> <pb n="331"/>
            </p>
          <p>The premium upon money lent on a maritime adventure was neces­ <lb/>
            sarily high, on account of the risk run by the lender. There was, in <lb/>
            the first place, the hazard of losses by sea, including shipwreck and <lb/>
            damage by tempest, capture or detention by enemies or pirates, &amp;c. <lb/>
            &amp;c.; and the rule was, that the lender was not entitled to payment, <lb/>
            if the ship or cargo was lost. In addition to this, the personal <lb/>
            credit of the merchants, especially if they were foreigners, was very <lb/>
            low; and the security which they offered could not be much relied <lb/>
            upon, for it was, from necessity, in great measure withdrawn from <lb/>
            tue control of the lenders. (See the observations in the plaintiffs <lb/>
            opening of the speech against Dionysodorus.)</p>
          <p>Even when the ship was mortgaged, if the owner went out with it, <lb/>
            there could be no certainty that he would return; and international <lb/>
            law afforded but little protection in those days. The cargo was a <lb/>
            still more precarious security, for it was exposed to more casualties. <lb/>
            There were two ways of lending; either on the voyage out, or on the <lb/>
            voyage out and home. In the former case, the loan was repayable <lb/>
            on the ship's reaching its outward place of destination, and the <lb/>
            creditor had an agent on board, or in the foreign port, to receive it. <lb/>
            In the latter case, the creditor was entitled to receive payment upon <lb/>
            a safe return to the port where he had lent his money.</p>
          <p>A loan upon the voyage out was evidently attended with less <lb/>
            hazard. The lender took care that the goods which constituted <lb/>
            his security were duly shipped. On their arrival at the port of <lb/>
            destination, his agent was entitled to hold or have control over them <lb/>
            till they were sold, and then to receive what was due to him out of <lb/>
            the proceeds.</p>
          <p>Upon a loan on the voyage out and home, the creditor had like-. <lb/>
            wise to see that the outward cargo of goods was put on board; for, <lb/>
            though he had no control over them, it was by their sale in the foreign <lb/>
            port that the merchant was enabled to purchase the return cargo, <lb/>
            which, upon its safe arrival home, formed the real security of the <lb/>
            creditor; for then. he was entitled to the possession of it, until his <lb/>
            principal and interest were repaid. This risk was augmented, not <lb/>
            only by the double sea-voyage, but by the larger credit and greater <lb/>
            power given to the merchant; consequently he demanded a higher <lb/>
            rate of interest. Chrysippus, we have seen, was to receive from <lb/>
            Phormio upon such a loan thirty per cent. (ante, 170). Androcles <lb/>
            and Nausicrates were to have in one event twenty-two and a half per <lb/>
            cent., and in another thirty per cent. (ante, 185). But this was <lb/>
            virtually interest on the half-year.</p>
          <p>In every case it seems to have been stipulated, that the merchant <lb/>
            should not give a second mortgage on the same goods. If he did, <lb/>
            it was considered a fraud upon the first as well as the second <lb/>
            mortgagee; and indeed with good reason. For, though we may <lb/>
            presume that the first mortgagee would have priority, yet the re­ <lb/>
            pledging of his security might very possibly involve him in trouble <lb/>
             <pb n="332"/>
            or litigation; and, by increasing the debtor's liabilities, it might <lb/>
            cripple his means of payment, and lead him into temptation to <lb/>
            commit fraud.</p>
          <p>The rate of interest upon these maritime loans was not restricted <lb/>
            by law; nor were commercial enterprises greatly harassed by legis­ <lb/>
            lative interference. Protective duties were unknown at Athens. A <lb/>
            duty of two per cent., imposed for the sake of the revenue, was <lb/>
            levied upon all exports and imports; and no trade was altogether <lb/>
            prohibited, except with those people, who were either at war, or in <lb/>
            a state of permanent enmity, with the Athenians. The few restrict ire <lb/>
            regulations, by which Athenian commerce was fettered, were with a <lb/>
            view to secure to the country a supply of the principal necessaries <lb/>
            of life, especially corn.</p>
          <p>The population of Attica, including both freemen and slaves, was <lb/>
            not less than half a million. Of the corn necessary for their con­ <lb/>
            sumption two-thirds only were supplied by Attica itself; the rest <lb/>
            was brought, from foreign countries, chiefly from the coast of the <lb/>
            Euxine, the Crimea, the Thracian Chersonese, Syria, Egypt, Sicily, <lb/>
            Euboea. Every precaution was taken both by the government and <lb/>
            the legislature to secure an abundant supply; and among other <lb/>
            measures which they adopted were the following. The exportation <lb/>
            of corn from Attica was entirely prohibited by law. No man <lb/>
            resident in Athens was allowed to convey corn to any other port <lb/>
            than the Athenian, as we have already seen, (ante, p. 181.) And <lb/>
            two-thirds of the corn imported was to be brought into the city of <lb/>
            Athens and sold there. With respect to the laws against engrossing <lb/>
            and regrating and the frauds and tricks of the corn-dealers, I shall <lb/>
            content myself with referring to article <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σι̂τος</foreign> in the Archaeological <lb/>
            Dictionary, and to the copious discussion of Böckh. 1 must. how­ <lb/>
            ever draw the reader's attention here to the commercial law cited in <lb/>
            the speech against Lacritus, (ante, p. 200;) in which there is a diffi­ <lb/>
            culty (as I have already noticed) in construing one of the clauses, <lb/>
            and of which the general meaning is by no means free from obscurity.</p>
          <p>The words of the original are--</p><figure type="illustration">
            <graphic url="ENG_BELL_19_fig5.jpg"/></figure>
          <p>Böckh's interpretation of this passage is, that no one was allowed <lb/>
            to lend money on a vessel which did not return to Athens with a <lb/>
            cargo of corn or other commodities. He refutes the opinion of <lb/>
            Salmasius, that the law related to the corn trade only, and so far we <lb/>
            must agree with him; for the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ τἅλλα</foreign> To <foreign xml:lang="grc">γεγραμμένα</foreign> repi <lb/>
             <pb n="333"/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">εκάϭτου αὐτω̑ν</foreign>, however we interpret them, clearly indicate some other <lb/>
            merchantable articles besides corn, as being enumerated either in the <lb/>
            law itself, or in the agreement of loan; and further, it appears even <lb/>
            from the case of Lacritus, that it was not necessary for every ship to <lb/>
            bring corn, as part of its return cargo, to Athens. But, says Böckh, <lb/>
            it was required by law, to make a loan on the voyage legal, that the <lb/>
            ship should bring either corn or some other commodity to Athens. <lb/>
            It appears to me, (with all due deference to so high an authority,) <lb/>
            that there are difficulties in the way of this explanation.</p>
          <p>Böckh concedes, as he was obliged to do, that a loan on the voyage <lb/>
            out was legal; but, to reconcile this with his interpretation of the <lb/>
            law, he contends that such a loan was not legal, unless the ship was <lb/>
            to return to Athens with such a cargo as the law required. Was it <lb/>
            necessary then, that in every agreement for a loan on the voyage out <lb/>
            a stipulation should be inserted, binding the merchant to bring back <lb/>
            the requisite cargo to Athens? Supposing this to be so, what <lb/>
            security would it be to the Athenian state ? If the lender was to <lb/>
            be absolved from all penal consequences, merely by inserting such a <lb/>
            clause, it would always be inserted, and it would have no effect <lb/>
            whatever. On the other hand, if the lender was bound to go further, <lb/>
            and to be answerable for the bona fides, or for the acts, of the mer­ <lb/>
            chant and the shipowner, it would have been a terrible hardship on <lb/>
            him; for why should he be implicated in their proceedings, after the <lb/>
            discharge of the outward cargo on which he had lent his money P If <lb/>
            this had been the case, it would never indeed have been safe to <lb/>
            lend money on the voyage out. Yet we know for certain, that it was <lb/>
            a common practice to do so.</p>
          <p>Again-the law does not specify what amount of corn or other <lb/>
            commodities were to be brought to Athens. How large a cargo then <lb/>
            would have satisfied the law ? If the smallest possible would have <lb/>
            been sufficient, then the statute would easily have been evaded ; if a <lb/>
            substantial cargo was required, such a construction of the statute <lb/>
            would have led to oppression and injustice; for how could it be <lb/>
            determined what was a substantial cargo ? The question, whether <lb/>
            there had been a breach of law, must have depended on the state of <lb/>
            the foreign market, the fortune of the voyage, and many other <lb/>
            chances. Such are the absurdities in which this theory of the <lb/>
            matter appears to involve us. If the law had simply provided, that <lb/>
            no man should lend on a ship which was not to return to Athens, it <lb/>
            would at least have been intelligible; but this does not agree with <lb/>
            the words.</p>
          <p>I may add, that the supposed regulation would have been by no <lb/>
            means conducive to what the Athenians desired to accomplish, viz. <lb/>
            to secure a plentiful importation of corn and other provisions. For <lb/>
            example, there is a trade in corn from Syracuse to Athens. If, after <lb/>
            the arrival of a Syracusan corn-ship at Athens, an Athenian was pre­ <lb/>
            vented from lending on the voyage back to Syracuse, the importation <lb/>
             <pb n="334"/>
            of corn to Athens would have been. discouraged. A voyage from <lb/>
            Athens to Syracuse and back was perfectly legitimate; that is con­ <lb/>
            ceded. Nor was there any objection to lending on a voyage from <lb/>
            Syracuse to Athens, as appears from the speech against Dionysodorus, <lb/>
            (p. 1286.) Why then should there be a prohibition against lending <lb/>
            on a voyage to Syracuse ?</p>
          <p>Now let us consider the latter words of the statute—<foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ δίκη <lb/>
            αὐτω̜̑ μὴ ἤϭτω</foreign> 'repi <foreign xml:lang="grc">του̑ ἀργυρίου, ὃ ἄν ἐκδω̜̂ ἄλλοϭέ ποι ἤ Ἀθήναζε</foreign>. <lb/>
            These words, standing alone, would seem to prohibit the lending on <lb/>
            a voyage out, which we know cannot be their meaning. They do <lb/>
            not imply any command to bring a cargo to Athens; they are <lb/>
            simply prohibitory. But it is clear that they are to be taken in con­ <lb/>
            nexion with the previous clauses of the statute; and this leads <lb/>
            perhaps to a solution of the difficulty. The substance of what the <lb/>
            statute enacted may be as follows-,, No man shall lend money for <lb/>
            the carriage of corn elsewhere than to Athens, nor for the carriage <lb/>
            of any return cargo elsewhere than to Athens ; if he does, he shall be <lb/>
            liable to a Phasis, &amp;c., and he shall have no action to recover his <lb/>
            money." The words in Italics contain the substance of what was <lb/>
            omitted by the orator, and in lieu of which are inserted the hope­ <lb/>
            lessly obscure words <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ τἄλλα</foreign> &amp;c. How then do I understand the <lb/>
            law? How do I make it reconcileable with the admitted legality of <lb/>
            loans on the voyage out P This is already indicated by the above <lb/>
            paraphrase of the law, but I will make it yet plainer. It was not <lb/>
            lawful to lend money on a cargo shipped in a foreign port on return <lb/>
            unless that cargo was to be carried to Athens. For example-it was <lb/>
            lawful to lend on a voyage from Athens to Bosporus: it was lawful <lb/>
            also to lend on a return cargo to be brought from Bosporus to <lb/>
            Athens: but it was not lawful to lend on a return cargo to be <lb/>
            shipped in Bosporus and carried to Chios. This we know from the <lb/>
            speech against Lacritus ; and it agrees with what the speaker says <lb/>
            in the case of Dionysodorus. The plaintiffs there lent money to the <lb/>
            defendants on a voyage from Athens to Egypt and back. They had <lb/>
            been requested to lend on the voyage to Egypt, and thence to Rhodes <lb/>
            or Athens; but this they had refused, apparently because it was <lb/>
            illegal. The borrowers violated their contract, carried a cargo of <lb/>
            corn from Egypt to Rhodes, and did not bring the ship back to <lb/>
            Athens, as they were bound to do under a penalty; for which an <lb/>
            action was brought in the Athenian court.</p>
          <p>This view of the matter is confirmed by what is said in the speech <lb/>
            against Zenothemis about the mercantile actions, (ante, p. 151, orig. <lb/>
            882 ;)—<foreign xml:lang="grc">οἱ νόμι κελεύουϭι τὰς δίκας εἶναι</foreign> rots <foreign xml:lang="grc">ναυκλήροις καὶ τοι̑ς <lb/>
            ἐμπόροις τω̑ν Αθήναζε καὶ τω̑ν Ἀθήνηθεν ϭυμβολαίων</foreign>—which I take to <lb/>
            be the same in substance with what is said in the speech against <lb/>
            Phormio, (ante, 172, 183, orig. 908, 919.) Loans were good, on <lb/>
            voyages direct from Athens; but a loan on goods from Egypt to <lb/>
            Rhodes was not direct from Athens.</p><pb n="335"/>
            
          <p>And there was a reason for the law as thus explained. For <lb/>
            the lending on a return cargo from one foreign port to another, <lb/>
            besides that it tended to diminish the importation of necessary com­ <lb/>
            modities to Athens, brought no customs duty to the state. On <lb/>
            goods carried from Athens to Egypt there was an export duty; on <lb/>
            goods from Egypt to Athens there was an import duty; on goods <lb/>
            from Egypt to Rhodes there was neither.</p>
          <p>I now proceed to examine more in detail the terms of these <lb/>
            maritime loans.</p>
          <p>In the cases of Zenothemis, Phormio, and Dionysodorus, tne <lb/>
            principal features of the agreements may be gathered from a perusal <lb/>
            of the speeches. In the case of Lacritus we have an agreement set <lb/>
            out in full; and this therefore will afford the best example for <lb/>
            illustration.</p>
          <p>It occurs in page 189 of this translation. The clauses which I <lb/>
            have here particularly to notice are—I. Those prescribing the course <lb/>
            of navigation and rate of interest: II. Those relating to the security: <lb/>
            III. Those which allow a deduction from the payment in certain <lb/>
            cases: IV. Those which provide for the event of the ship or cargo <lb/>
            being lost.</p>
          <p>I. The voyage is to be from Mende or Scione, and thence to the <lb/>
            Thracian Bosporus, with liberty to sail on the left coast of the <lb/>
            Euxine as far as the mouth of the Borysthenes. The merchants are <lb/>
            to pay interest of twenty-two and a half per cent. on the loan, unless <lb/>
            in the event of their returning from the Euxine to Hierum in <lb/>
            Bithynia after the rise of Arcturus in September, when the dangers <lb/>
            of navigation commenced; then, in consequence of the increased <lb/>
            risk, they were to pay thirty per cent. In the event of their not <lb/>
            entering the Euxine, in order to escape the tempests of the dog­ <lb/>
            days, they were to remain in the Hellespont, at the end of July, <lb/>
            ten days after the early rise of the dog-star, paying in that case the <lb/>
            lower rate of interest. And none of the goods are to be unladed <lb/>
            in any port where the Athenians are in a state of hostility with the <lb/>
            natives.</p>
          <p>Here we have a particular route prescribed for the voyage, with <lb/>
            liberty to vary it to some extent, subject to the payment of a higher <lb/>
            premium in case the peril is increased. There is a prohibition, as we <lb/>
            might expect, against unlading in an enemy's country. No penalty <lb/>
            is expressly imposed for a violation of these terms; but we may <lb/>
            fairly presume that an infringement of them would be attended with <lb/>
            legal consequences, such as an action for any damage sustained by <lb/>
            the breach of contract, or forfeiture of the benefit, which the saving <lb/>
            clauses gave to the merchant in case of a loss. It is impossible to <lb/>
            speak with certainty upon such a question, as we have so few cases <lb/>
            handed down to us, and we cannot sustain every point of law which <lb/>
            suggests itself by reference to a precedent. The analogies of modern <lb/>
            law will be found most useful to explain and illustrate a subject of <lb/>
             <pb n="336"/>
            this nature; there being a great similarity between the commercial <lb/>
            laws of all nations.</p>
          <p>In these days, when the place of destination is fixed by the charter- <lb/>
            party, it is the duty of the master to proceed to it without delay, and <lb/>
            without stopping at any intermediate port, or deviating from the <lb/>
            straight and shortest course, unless such stopping or deviation be <lb/>
            necessary to repair the ship from the effects of accident or tempest, <lb/>
            or to avoid enemies or pirates, or unless the ship sails to the places <lb/>
            resorted to in long voyages for a supply of water or provisions by <lb/>
            common and established usage.</p>
          <p>A deviation, without necessity or reasonable cause, from the <lb/>
            regular and usual course of the voyage, has an important effect upon <lb/>
            contracts of insurance. It is necessary to insert in every policy of <lb/>
            insurance the place of the ship's departure, and also of her destina­ <lb/>
            tion. Hence it is an implied condition to be performed on the part <lb/>
            of the insured, that the ship shall pursue the most direct course, of <lb/>
            which the nature of things will permit, to arrive at the destined <lb/>
            port. If this be not done; if there be no special agreement to allow <lb/>
            the ship to go to certain places out of the usual track, or if there <lb/>
            be no just cause assigned for such a deviation, the underwriter (or <lb/>
            insurer) is no longer bound by his contract, the insured having failed <lb/>
            to comply with the terms on which the policy was made. For, if the <lb/>
            voyage be changed after the departure of the ship, it becomes a dif­ <lb/>
            ferent voyage, and not that, against which the insurer has undertaken <lb/>
            to indemnify: the risk may be ten times greater, which probably the <lb/>
            insurer would not have run at all, or, at least, would not have run <lb/>
            without a larger premium. Nor is it material, whether the loss be <lb/>
            or be not an actual consequence of the deviation; for the insurers <lb/>
            are in no case answerable for a subsequent loss, in whatever place it <lb/>
            happen, or to whatever cause it may be attributed. Neither does it <lb/>
            make any difference, whether the insured was, or was not, consenting <lb/>
            to the deviation.</p>
          <p>These are principles, founded upon the exigencies of commerce, <lb/>
            which have been fully established in our English courts.</p>
          <p>II. As to the security. The money is stated in the agreement to <lb/>
            have been lent on the security of 3,000 casks of Mendean wine. <lb/>
            The expression is remarkable, because the wine was not to be put <lb/>
            on board until the ship had arrived at Mende or Scione, and was <lb/>
            afterwards to be sold in the Thracian Bosporus or the Euxine, and a <lb/>
            return cargo purchased with the proceeds. If the lenders had any <lb/>
            control over the wine by means of an agent of their own, it would <lb/>
            have been a security in the stricter sense of the term; otherwise, it <lb/>
            could be a security no further than this, that it formed a part of the <lb/>
            contract that the borrowers should ship the cargo of wine; and, if they <lb/>
            did so, it afforded them the means of procuring the return cargo, which <lb/>
            constituted the effectual security of the lenders, if it was brought <lb/>
            home safe; for then, by the terms of the agreement, it was to be <lb/>
             <pb n="337"/>
            delivered entire to the lenders, and to be under their absolute control, <lb/>
            until repayment of what was due to them. (See the observations in <lb/>
            the note at page 172.) It does not appear that Androcles and Nau­ <lb/>
            sicrates, who lent their money to the brothers of Lacritus, either <lb/>
            sent out an agent in the ship, or had one in any of the foreign ports. <lb/>
            Hippias, who went out as supercargo, though he gives evidence for <lb/>
            the plaintiffs, is not represented as having any connexion with them. <lb/>
            It is reasonable indeed to suppose, that the capitalists who supplied <lb/>
            funds to the merchants would sometimes repose confidence in the <lb/>
            owner or master of the ship, or in some of the passengers or other par­ <lb/>
            ties going out, who, if they could not check or prevent fraud, would at <lb/>
            least have the means of reporting and disclosing it. Thus, for example, <lb/>
            Chrysippus and his brother in the first instance place reliance on <lb/>
            Lampis, who gave them information concerning Phormio's breach of <lb/>
            contract, though afterwards (as they say), he entered into a league <lb/>
            with Phormio against them. Androcles and Nausicrates stipulate <lb/>
            that the return cargo shall be brought home in the same ship that <lb/>
            takes the outward cargo, the ship, namely, of Hyblesius, in whom, or <lb/>
            in whose servants or connexions, they may have had reason to put <lb/>
            trust. It is observable that the brother of Hyblesius, and the pilot, <lb/>
            as well as the supercargo, give evidence for the plaintiffs.</p>
          <p>With respect to the guarantee alleged to have been given by <lb/>
            Lacritus on behalf of his brothers, there appears to be no evidence <lb/>
            to support it. At the same time, it is likely enough that his posi­ <lb/>
            tion and presence in Athens operated as some inducement to give <lb/>
            credit to his brothers. In the case of Dionysodorus, one of the bor­ <lb/>
            rowers remains at Athens, while the other goes to sea. A foreign <lb/>
            merchant, who had neither family nor friends nor property in Athens, <lb/>
            could have had very little personal credit, generally speaking.</p>
          <p>We may further notice, that by express contract all the property <lb/>
            of Artemo and Apollodorus, as well as the return cargo, is made <lb/>
            liable for repayment of the loan, in the event of their security <lb/>
            being found deficient; and the creditors are empowered to seize <lb/>
            their property in execution, in the same manner as if a judgment <lb/>
            had been recovered. This right however was subject to the clauses <lb/>
            providing for abatement in certain events, and for the case of a <lb/>
            total loss.</p>
          <p>IIL As to the proviso for deductions.</p>
          <p>The agreement declares that no abatement shall be allowed, except <lb/>
            for jettison, made by a common resolution of the passengers, or for <lb/>
            payments made to enemies.</p>
          <p>Jettison is the throwing overboard of a portion of the merchandize <lb/>
            in the vessel, in order to lighten the vessel and preserve the rest of <lb/>
            the cargo. The regulations respecting it have prevailed among <lb/>
            maritime nations for many ages, and are founded on principles of <lb/>
            natural equity. It happens usually in a storm. The heaviest or <lb/>
            most cumbrous goods are thrown over. as a matter of necessity: <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> z </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="338"/>
            the merchant is obliged to submit to it for the common welfare, <lb/>
            and is entitled to contribution from those who have reaped the <lb/>
            benefit, in proportion to the value of the property which has been <lb/>
            saved to them respectively. As the reader will get little or no in­ <lb/>
            formation upon this subject from the ordinary writers on Attic law, <lb/>
            and the subject is interesting and important, it is desirable to throw <lb/>
            some light upon it by reference to the laws of other countries.</p>
          <p>The contribution above mentioned, which is made by all parties <lb/>
            towards a loss sustained by some for the common benefit, has in <lb/>
            modern times been called by the name of " general average." The <lb/>
            custom is said to have been derived from the laws of Rhodes, and <lb/>
            was adopted in the Digest of Justinian, with an express recognition <lb/>
            of its origin in the Rhodian law, though, as appears from this legal <lb/>
            document produced by Demosthenes, the principle was not unknown <lb/>
            to the Athenians. The principle has been recognized by most com­ <lb/>
            mercial codes, but with some variation in the practice.</p>
          <p>The rule of the Rhodian law, which is said to have been intro­ <lb/>
            duced into England by William the Conqueror, is as follows.--If <lb/>
            goods are thrown overboard in order to lighten the ship, the loss, <lb/>
            incurred for the sake of all, shall be made good by the contribution <lb/>
            of all. The goods must be thrown overboard. The mind and <lb/>
            agency of man must be employed ; if the goods are forced out of the <lb/>
            ship by the violence of the waves, or are destroyed in the ship by <lb/>
            lightning or tempest, the merchant alone must bear the loss. They <lb/>
            must be thrown overboard to lighten the ship ; if they were cast over­ <lb/>
            board by the wanton caprice of the crew or the passengers, they, or the <lb/>
            masters and owners for them, must make good the loss. The goods <lb/>
            must be thrown overboardfor the sake of all; not because the ship is <lb/>
            too heavily laden to prosecute an ordinary course through a tranquil <lb/>
            sea, which would be the fault of those who had shipped or received <lb/>
            the goods; but because at a moment of distress and danger their <lb/>
            weight, or their presence, prevents the extraordinary exertions re­ <lb/>
            quired for the general safety. When the ship is in danger of perish­ <lb/>
            ing from wind or tempest; or when a pirate or an enemy pursues, <lb/>
            gains ground, and is ready to overtake; no measure, that may facili­ <lb/>
            tate the motion and passage of the ship, can be injurious to any one, <lb/>
            who is interested in the welfare of any part of the adventure, and <lb/>
            ; every such measure may be beneficial to almost all. In such emergen­ <lb/>
            cies, therefore, it is lawful to have recourse to every mode of preserva­ <lb/>
            tion, and to cast out the goods in order to lighten the ship, for the <lb/>
            sake of all. But if the ship and the residue of the cargo be saved <lb/>
            from the peril by the voluntary destruction or abandonment of part <lb/>
            of the goods, equity requires that the safety of some should not be <lb/>
            purchased at the expense of others, and therefore all must contribute <lb/>
            to the loss.</p>
          <p>Many foreign ordinances have prescribed certain forms to be <lb/>
            adopted with reference to jettison; some of them have even named <lb/>
             <pb n="339"/>
            the persons to be consulted before it takes place, and some have <lb/>
            specified the sorts of goods that shall be first thrown over; and <lb/>
            various minute rules have been laid down. It has justly been observed <lb/>
            by Lord Tenterden in his treatise on the law concerning Merchant <lb/>
            Ships and Seamen, that " Regulations prescribed by persons at ease <lb/>
            in the closet or the senate house will seldom be followed at the <lb/>
            moment when life or liberty is in jeopardy ; at such a moment every <lb/>
            one present will exclaim with the friend of Juvenal, <lb/>
            " Fundite quæ mea aunt, etiam pulcherrima." <lb/>
            And, if the jettison has been the effect of danger and the cause of <lb/>
            safety, all writers agree that contribution ought to be made, although <lb/>
            the forms have not been complied with. Previous deliberation, if <lb/>
            there was time to deliberate, and a due choice of the heaviest and <lb/>
            most cumbersome articles, may be proofs of the necessity and pro­ <lb/>
            priety of the act; but they are not the only proofs, and therefore <lb/>
            are not to be deemed essential. It has been said also by the last <lb/>
            mentioned writer, that in this case, as in many others, too close a <lb/>
            compliance with forms, at a moment of supposed danger, may afford <lb/>
            ground for a suspicion of fraud. In all cases, however, and in all <lb/>
            countries, it has been required of the master that he draw up an <lb/>
            account of the jettison, and verify it by the oath of himself and <lb/>
            some of his crew, as soon as possible after his arrival at any port, <lb/>
            that there may be no opportunity to purloin goods from the ship and <lb/>
            then pretend that they were cast over in the time of peril.</p>
          <p>Other goods which are damaged or destroyed, in order to accom­ <lb/>
            plish the jettison, are to be included in the contribution; and also <lb/>
            expenses incurred in relation to them, as where it has been necessary <lb/>
            to unlade, repair, and reship. And the same rule extends to the <lb/>
            ship, its tackle and furniture; as where the masts and cables are <lb/>
            cut away to prevent shipwreck; or where the deck or sides have <lb/>
            been cut to facilitate a jettison, or other extraordinary damage has <lb/>
            been done, or expense incurred, with the same view.</p>
          <p>The agreement in Demosthenes allows for jettison only where it <lb/>
            has been made under a common resolution of all on board. This <lb/>
            accords in some measure with the rule laid down by Beawes in his Lex <lb/>
            Mercatoria, who says that in order to make the jettison legal three <lb/>
            things must concur­</p>
          <p>" First, that what is so condemned to destruction, be in conse­ <lb/>
            quenoe of a deliberate and voluntary consultation held between the <lb/>
            master and men.</p>
          <p>" 2ndly. That the ship be in distress, and that sacrificing a part be <lb/>
            necessary in order to preserve the rest.</p>
          <p>" 3rdly. That the saving of the ship and cargo be actually owing to <lb/>
            the means used with that sole view."</p>
          <p>Of these the first and third conditions are not imperative in our <lb/>
            law. but only the second. <note type="footnote"> z2 </note> <pb n="340"/>
            </p>
          <p>It appears also that, by, the laws of Wisbuy,1 in an emergency of <lb/>
            such a nature as to justify the lightening of the ship, it was neces­ <lb/>
            sary first to consult the owner of the goods or the supercargo; but, <lb/>
            if they would not consent, the merchandize might, notwithstanding <lb/>
            their refusal, be ejected, if it appeared necessary to the rest of the <lb/>
            people on board; a regulation evidently founded on necessity, to pre­ <lb/>
            vent a sordid individual from obstructing a measure so essential to <lb/>
            the general safety.</p>
          <p>If the jettison does not save the ship, but she perish in the storm, <lb/>
            the rule is, that there shall be no contribution of such goods as may <lb/>
            happen to be saved; because the object for which the goods were <lb/>
            thrown overboard was not attained. But if the ship, being once <lb/>
            preserved by such means, and continuing her course, should after­ <lb/>
            wards be lost, the property saved from the second accident shall con­ <lb/>
            tribute to the loss sustained by those whose goods were cast out on <lb/>
            the occasion of the former peril.</p>
          <p>With respect to insurance, the law is laid down by Roccus, to the <lb/>
            effect that the insurers are liable to pay the insured for all expenses <lb/>
            arising from general average, in proportion to the sums which they <lb/>
            have underwritten; and in England the underwriter almost always <note type="footnote"> (1) " It would be improper to pass over the laws, which were ordained by an indus­ <lb/>
            trious and respectable body people, who inhabited the city of Wisbuy, famous for <lb/>
            its commerce, and renowned on the shores of the Baltic. The merchants of this city <lb/>
            carried on so extensive a trade, and gave themselves up so entirely to commerce, <lb/>
            that they must doubtless have found a great inconvenience in having no maritime <lb/>
            code, to which they could refer to decide their disputes. To such a cause we are <lb/>
            probably indebted for those laws and marine ordinances, which bear the name of <lb/>
            Wisbuy, which were received by the Swedes, at the time they were composed, as a <lb/>
            just and equitable rule of action, and which were long respected and observed by the <lb/>
            Germans, Swedes, Danes, and all the Northern nations; although the city in which <lb/>
            they received their origin has dwindled into insignificance. At what time these laws <lb/>
            were compiled is a matter of dispute. The writers of the North pretend that Wisbuy <lb/>
            was a great commercial city in the ninth century; from whence they argue, that <lb/>
            their laws must be of very high antiquity; that they were the model from which <lb/>
            those of Oleron were copied, and that they were received and acknowledged by all <lb/>
            nations in Europe, even to the Straits of Gibraltar. On the other hand it is answered, <lb/>
            and with much strength of reasoning, that the Northern code is a transcript from <lb/>
            that of Oleron, although it contains several additions ; for it has been shewn, that <lb/>
            the laws of Oleron were promulgated by Richard the First about the close of the <lb/>
            twelfth century, at which time, as appears by the report of a Swedish historian, the <lb/>
            city of Wisbuy was not built, nor for near a century afterwards; that the inhabitants <lb/>
            were merely strangers collected together from different parts, who, so far from <lb/>
            having any power or influence over their neighbours, were not absolute masters of <lb/>
            their own city. Besides, if their laws had been prior to those of Oleron, we should <lb/>
            have found in the latter some regulations respecting insurances; because a copyist <lb/>
            never would have omitted so material a branch of commercial legislation, the laws <lb/>
            of Wisbuy having expressly mentioned insurances, and provided that, if the mer­ <lb/>
            chant obliged the master to insure the ship, the merchant shall be obliged to insure <lb/>
            tne masters life against the hazards of the sea. </note><note type="footnote"> “But, if the laws of Wisbuy were not prior to those of Oleron, yet it is much to <lb/>
            their honour, and shews in what estimation they were held in the greatest part of <lb/>
            Europe, that, after having for a long course of time enjoyed the highest authority in <lb/>
            all the Northern tribunals for maritime affairs, they were thought worthy of being <lb/>
            adopted as the basis of the ordinances of the Hanseatic league Park's Introduction <lb/>
            to his treatise on Marine Insurance. </note> <lb/>

            engages by express contract to indemnify against losses from general <lb/>
            average.</p>
          <p>How far the customs of the ancient Greeks, or at least the Athen­ <lb/>
            ians and those with whom they traded, resembled the customs of <lb/>
            modern nations, with respect to this matter, it is impossible to declare <lb/>
            with any certainty. We know that Androcles and Nausicrates agreed <lb/>
            to make an allowance to Artemo and Apollodorus for any loss incurred <lb/>
            by jettison, which should have been made by a resolution of all the <lb/>
            passengers, meaning (I presume), a resolution passed by the majority. <lb/>
            Itmay beasked-did this mean that an allowance was to be made <lb/>
            for jettison of the borrowers' goods only, in case any of them were <lb/>
            cast overboard; or does it presuppose a general average, so that the <lb/>
            allowance would be for their lost goods, so far as they had not been <lb/>
            indemnified by contribution, or for the share which they had contri­ <lb/>
            buted to the loss of any other persons P I can hardly doubt that <lb/>
            there was this general average, or something equivalent to it. The <lb/>
            fact, that a vote of the passengers was necessary to authorise a jet­ <lb/>
            tison, warrants the inference that there must have been some indem­ <lb/>
            nity given to the persons whose goods were selected to be thrown <lb/>
            over. The heaviest and most cumbrous goods would commonly be <lb/>
            selected for that purpose: but it would be a monstrous injustice <lb/>
            that the owner of such goods should be a victim for all the rest. It <lb/>
            was the more necessary in those times that an equitable contribution <lb/>
            should be resorted to, as the practice of insurance was unknown.</p>
          <p>An allowance was also to be made under the Attic agreement for <lb/>
            it payments made to enemies." This (I presume) would include all <lb/>
            monies paid by way of ransom upon any capture or detention by <lb/>
            enemies or pirates, and all compulsory payments made to enemies <lb/>
            for liberty to proceed on the voyage or on any other account. Under <lb/>
            modem ordinances it has been laid down, that, if part of the cargo <lb/>
            be voluntarily, and without any fraud or cowardice, delivered up to a <lb/>
            pirate or an enemy by way of ransom or composition, to induce him <lb/>
            to spare the vessel and the residue of the cargo, or if a sum of money <lb/>
            be paid by way of ransom, the value of what is saved must contribute <lb/>
            to such loss; not so however, if the enemy or pirate, having over­ <lb/>
            powered the ship, select for himself such plunder as he chooses to <lb/>
            take; for then it is not the price of safety to what remains. It has <lb/>
            been said also that, if a ship has been carried into an enemy's port, <lb/>
            and the crew remain on board to reclaim and take care of her, not only <lb/>
            the charges of reclaiming her, but the wages and expenses of the <lb/>
            ship's company shall be brought into general average. In England <lb/>
            however ransom can rarely be made the subject of general average, <lb/>
            for it was forbidden under a heavy penalty by a statute passed in the <lb/>
            reign of George III., " unless in case of extreme necessity to be <lb/>
            allowed by the Court of Admiralty," and all contracts for ransom <lb/>
            contrary to the statute were declared void.</p>
          <p>Capture by the enemy has been very commonly made the subject <lb/>
             <pb n="342"/>
            of insurance in our own country, and the policy is expressed to <lb/>
            include " all loss or damage by the arrests, restraints, and detain­ <lb/>
            ments of kings, princes, and people." The rights created between <lb/>
            the parties by such a contract may be briefly stated;</p>
          <p>The ship is to be considered as lost by the capture, though she be <lb/>
            never condemned, nor carried into any port or fleet of the enemy, <lb/>
            and the insurer must pay the value. If, after a condemnation, the <lb/>
            owner recover or retake her, the insurer is in the same situation as <lb/>
            if she had been retaken or recovered before condemnation. He runs <lb/>
            the risk of the insured, and undertakes to indemnify; he must there­ <lb/>
            fore bear the loss actually sustained, and can be liable to no more. <lb/>
            If therefore, after condemnation, the owner recovers the ship in her <lb/>
            complete condition, but has paid salvage, or been at any expense in <lb/>
            getting her back, the insurer must make good the loss so actually <lb/>
            sustained. No capture by the enemy can be so total a loss as to <lb/>
            leave no possibility of recovery. If the owner himself should retake <lb/>
            at any time, he will be entitled; and if an English ship retake the <lb/>
            vessel captured, either before or after condemnation, the owner is <lb/>
            entitled to restitution upon stated salvage. His chance does not, <lb/>
            however, suspend the demand for a total loss upon the insurer; but <lb/>
            justice is done by putting him in the place of the insured, in case of <lb/>
            a recapture.</p>
          <p>Questions arise sometimes, whether a capture was just, and <lb/>
            whether a detention was of such a character as to come within the <lb/>
            terms of the policy. It has been laid down that detentions or re­ <lb/>
            straints " by people " mean acts by the ruling power of the country, <lb/>
            such as an embargo, not any tumultuous seizure by a mob. And the <lb/>
            insured forfeits his rights under the policy, if he navigates contrary <lb/>
            to the laws of the country where he is detained; for a man is never <lb/>
            allowed to take advantage of his own wrong.</p>
          <p>IV. The money was to be repaid, if the goods were brought <lb/>
            home safe.</p>
          <p>Herein this agreement differs from those in the cases of Zeno­ <lb/>
            themis and Phormio, where the ship's safe arrival was made a condi­ <lb/>
            tion of repayment. We have here a special clause, that, even <lb/>
            though the ship be lost, the cargo, if saved, shall enure to the benefit <lb/>
            of the creditors. A difficulty occurs in the expression, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κοινὰ</foreign> rots <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">δανείσασιν</foreign>. I have suggested in a note, that it might be intended to <lb/>
            comprise those who had a claim for salvage; but I am bound to say, <lb/>
            that this is an uncertain conjecture. Salvage is the compensation <lb/>
            paid to those persons, by whose assistance a vessel or its cargo is <lb/>
            rescued from some peril of t he sea, or recovered after actual loss : as <lb/>
            to which there are ordinances in aiU maritime codes, fixing the rate <lb/>
            at which it should be paid, stating the circumstances and conditions <lb/>
            under which it becomes due, adjusting the interests of various <lb/>
            parties concerned, forbidding plunder and pillage in case of ship­ <lb/>
            wreck, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p><pb n="343"/>
            
          <p>The principle on which all the Athenian mercantile loans are <lb/>
            based—viz. that the lender runs the hazard of the voyage, receiving <lb/>
            a high premium if it turns out prosperously, and losing both prin­ <lb/>
            cipal and interest, if the ship or cargo is lost--deserves the reader's <lb/>
            particular attention. I have adverted to the perilous character of <lb/>
            the speculation in ancient times, when insurance was unknown; and <lb/>
            from the examples in the Demosthenic speeches we learn the frauds <lb/>
            to which the lenders were exposed. On the other hand, when we <lb/>
            see that the merchant could afford to pay twenty or thirty per cent. <lb/>
            for half a year's use of the money, we may conclude that the profits <lb/>
            of trade must have been very considerable. Contracts on the same <lb/>
            principle have been common in modern times, and have been held to <lb/>
            be perfectly legal and conscientious, even in countries where there <lb/>
            were severe laws against usury; for it was considered that such laws <lb/>
            did not apply to adventures, where the lender risked the loss of his <lb/>
            principal. In our own country it was not lawful, until very lately, to <lb/>
            lend money at higher interest than five per cent. Upon an ordinary <lb/>
            loan, for example, of 100l. by A. to B., where the money was to be <lb/>
            repaid some time or other at all events, it was not lawful to receive <lb/>
            a higher interest than the legal rate. But if he lent 100l. upon such <lb/>
            a contract as this, which we are considering, he would not have been <lb/>
            amenable to the statutes of usury. Contracts of this kind have been <lb/>
            called contracts of bottomry or respondentia; of which I proceed to <lb/>
            give a more particular account. I cannot do better than subjoin the <lb/>
            definition given of these terms by Park in his treatise on Marine <lb/>
            Insurance:</p>
          <p>" The contract of bottomry is in the nature of a mortgage of a <lb/>
            ship, when the owner of it borrows money to enable him to carry on <lb/>
            the voyage, and pledges the keel or bottom of a ship, as a security <lb/>
            for the repayment; and it is understood that, if the ship be lost, the <lb/>
            lender also loses his whole money; but if it return in safety, then he <lb/>
            shall receive back his principal, and also the premium or interest <lb/>
            stipulated to be paid, however it may exceed the usual or legal rate <lb/>
            of interest. When the ship and tackle are brought home, they are <lb/>
            liable, as well as the person of the borrower, for the money lent. <lb/>
            But when the loan is not made upon the vessel, but upon the goods <lb/>
            and merchandize laden thereon, which, from their nature, must be <lb/>
            sold or exchanged in the course of the voyage then the borrower <lb/>
            only is personally bound to answer the contract ; who therefore in <lb/>
            this case is said to take up money at respondentia. In this consists <lb/>
            the difference between bottomry and respondentia; that the one is a <lb/>
            loan upon the ship, the other upon the goods: in the former, the <lb/>
            ship and tackle are liable, as well as the person of the borrower; in <lb/>
            the latter, for the most part, recourse must be had to the person only <lb/>
            of the borrower. Another observation is, that in a loan upon bot­ <lb/>
            tomry the lender runs no risk, though the goods should he lost: and <lb/>
            upon respondentia the lender must be paid his principal and interest. <lb/>
             <pb n="344"/>
            though the ship perish, provided the goods are safe. But in all other <lb/>
            respects the contract of bottomry and that of respondentia are upon <lb/>
            the same footing; the rules and decisions applicable to one, are <lb/>
            applicable to both.</p>
          <p>* * * * * <lb/>
            " These terms are also applied to another species of contract, <lb/>
            which does not exactly fall within the description of either; namely, <lb/>
            to a contract for the repayment of money, not upon the ships and <lb/>
            goods only, but upon the mere hazard of the voyage itself, as if a <lb/>
            man lend 1,0001. to a merchant, to be employed in a beneficial trade, <lb/>
            with a condition to be repaid with extraordinary interest, in case a <lb/>
            specific voyage named in the condition shall be safely performed; <lb/>
            which agreement is sometimes called fœnus nauticum, or usura <lb/>
            maritima.”</p>
          <p>The contracts above mentioned, as the reader will perceive, closely <lb/>
            resemble the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ναυτικὸν συμβόλαιον</foreign> of the Greeks. It was the opinion <lb/>
            of the learned writer, whom I have quoted, that bottomry took its <lb/>
            origin from the custom of permitting the master of a ship, when in a <lb/>
            foreign country, to hypothecate the ship in order to raise money to <lb/>
            refit. True it is, that such a permission has in modern times beeu <lb/>
            found necessary for the carrying on of commerce advantageously; <lb/>
            for, unless the master had such power in case of necessity, the ship <lb/>
            might be lost, before he had time to obtain instructions from the <lb/>
            owner, or, at least, the object of the voyage might be frustrated; and <lb/>
            accordingly the laws of Oleron and the Hanse towns declare dis­ <lb/>
            tinctly, that " the master being in a strange country, if necessity <lb/>
            drive him to it, may take up money on bottomry, if he cannot get it <lb/>
            without, and the owners shall bear the charge ;” and other laws <lb/>
            accord with these, confining the power of the master to foreign <lb/>
            countries, where he cannot communicate with the owner in time. <lb/>
            The contract itself however, whether made by the master abroad, or <lb/>
            by the owners at home, is the same in character with these men­ <lb/>
            tioned in Demosthenes, and was probably handed down from a very <lb/>
            early period.</p>
          <p>In those fragments of the famous sea laws of the Rhodians, which <lb/>
            have been preserved and transmitted to our times, there are evident <lb/>
            traces of this species of contract. In one section it is said, " that <lb/>
            when masters of ships, who are proprietors of one-third of the lading, <lb/>
            take up money for the voyage, whether for the outward or the home­ <lb/>
            ward bound, or both, all transactions shall pass according to the <lb/>
            writings drawn up between the master and lender, and the latter <lb/>
            shall put a man on board the ship to take care of his loan." But in <lb/>
            another place these laws speak more explicitly, and with a direct <lb/>
            reference to the distinction between naval interest and that which is <lb/>
            given for a land risk—“ If masters or merchants borrow money for <lb/>
            their voyages, the goods, freights, ships, and money, being free, they <lb/>
            shall not make use of suretysmp, unless there be some apparent <lb/>
             <pb n="345"/>
            danger either of the sea or of pirates. And for the money so lent the <lb/>
            borrowers shall pay naval interest." From these two quotations, <lb/>
            little doubt can be entertained that the Rhodians used to borrow <lb/>
            and lend upon the hazard of the voyage for an increased premium. <lb/>
            It has been mentioned that the Rhodian laws in general were <lb/>
            adopted by the Romans, and consequently that branch of them <lb/>
            which relates to bottomry, amongst the rest; for you can hardly <lb/>
            open a book upon the Roman law, but you meet with chapters, do <lb/>
            nautico fænore, de nauticis usuris, which plainly show that this con­ <lb/>
            tract was well known to the jurists of that distinguished nation. <lb/>
            It was also called by them pecunia trajectitia ; because it was given <lb/>
            to the borrower to be employed by him in commerce upon and beyond <lb/>
            the sea.</p>
          <p>The temptations, to which a needy. merchant was exposed under a <lb/>
            bottomry contract, are obvious. He might take up loans far beyond <lb/>
            the value of the articles pledged. When he had agreed to purchase <lb/>
            and ship goods in a foreign port, he might put none on board, or <lb/>
            some of trifling value only, and these he might contrive to sink or <lb/>
            destroy. There might be a conspiracy between the merchant and <lb/>
            the master or ship-owner, such as that of which Zenothemis and <lb/>
            Hegestratus are accused, to sink the vessel and cheat the creditors. <lb/>
            A multitude of frauds of a similar nature are practised in these days <lb/>
            against underwriters and insurance companies, upon naval policies, <lb/>
            and upon fire and life policies. A man insures his house and the <lb/>
            goods which it contains against fire, greatly overrating their value, <lb/>
            and then purposely sets them on fire. Life assurance, one of the <lb/>
            most valuable institutions of modern times, has occasionally led not <lb/>
            only to fraud but to murder. It is important to bear in mind, that <lb/>
            misrepresentations by the parties effecting an insurance, irrespective <lb/>
            of any criminal or fraudulent intention, will generally vitiate the <lb/>
            policy. The frauds committed against insurers and lenders on bot. <lb/>
            tomry fell under the notice of the English legislature in the reign of <lb/>
            Charles II., and a statute was passed for their repression, which has <lb/>
            been followed by others, imposing the severest penalties on such <lb/>
            practices. I may here mention, that all frauds of this kind, com­ <lb/>
            mitted by the master or mariners of a ship, whether by running away <lb/>
            with her, sinking her, deserting her, embezzling the cargo, and the <lb/>
            like, are designated by the general term barratry, derived from the <lb/>
            Italian barratrare, which signifies to cheat; and they are commonly <lb/>
            among the perils insured against by a sea-policy.</p>
          <p>The statute of Charles II., passed in the 22nd year of his reign, <lb/>
            after reciting " that it often happens that masters and mariners of <lb/>
            ships having insured or taken upon bottomry greater sums of money <lb/>
            than the value of their adventure, do wilfully cast away, burn, ot <lb/>
            otherwise destroy the ships under their charge, to the merchants' <lb/>
            and owners' great loss," enacts " that if any captain, master, mariner, <lb/>
            or other officer belonging to any ship, shall wilfully cast away, burn, <lb/>
             <pb n="346"/>
            or otherwise destroy the ship, unto which lie belongeth, or procure <lb/>
            the same to be done, he shall suffer death as a felon."</p>
          <p>This has been followed by divers others, one of which, the 11th <lb/>
            George I. chapter 29, section 6, enacts—“ That, if any owner of, or <lb/>
            captain, master, mariner, or other officer, belonging to, any ship or <lb/>
            vessel, shall wilfully cast away, burn, or otherwise destroy the ship <lb/>
            or vessel, of which he is owner, or to which he belongeth, or in any­ <lb/>
            wise direct or procure the same to be done, with intent or design to <lb/>
            prejudice any person or persons, that bath or shall underwrite any <lb/>
            policy or policies of insurance thereon, or any merchant or mer­ <lb/>
            chants that shall load goods thereon, or any owner or owners of <lb/>
            such ship or vessel, the person or persons offending therein being <lb/>
            thereof lawfully convicted, shall be deemed and adjudged a felon <lb/>
            or felons, and shall suffer as in cases of felony without benefit of <lb/>
            clergy.</p>
          <p>Lastly, I subjoin a few modern forms of contract, the perusal of <lb/>
            which may be found instructive.</p>

            in the city of Lisbon, in my office personally appeared Iacomo Mazzola, <lb/>
            captain of the ship called the Gratitudine, whom I know to be the <lb/>

            or to his order, the sum of 2,0001., principal and premium of risk and <lb/>
            sea exchange, at the rate of twenty per cent., the which principal he <lb/>

            Calvert, in current money of this kingdom, under the denomination <lb/>
            of true and legitimate money of sea exchange and bottomry, on the <lb/>

             <pb n="347"/>
            those of barratry of the master, and of average as well particular <lb/>

            when the ship shall leave her first anchor, to set sail from this port, <lb/>
            and shall cease in twenty-four hours after having come to an anchor; <lb/>
            and for the ready payment of the aforesaid sum, he the captain binds <lb/>

            ship with her freight shall at all times after the said voyage be liable <lb/>
            for the payment of the said 1,2001., according to the true intent and <lb/>
            meaning of these presents.</p>
          <p>And lastly, it is hereby declared and agreed by and between the <lb/>
            said parties to these presents, that in case the said ship shall be lost, <lb/>
            miscarry, or be cast away before her arrival at the said port of London <lb/>
            from the said intended voyage, then the payment of the said 1,200/. <lb/>
            shall not be demanded, or be recoverable by the said C. D., his exe­ <lb/>
            cutors, administrators, or assigns, but shall cease and determine, and <lb/>
            the loss thereby shall be wholly borne and sustained by the said C. D., <lb/>
            his executors and administrators, and that then and from thenceforth <lb/>
            every act, matter, and thing herein mentioned on the part and <lb/>
            behalf of the said A. B. shall be void, anything herein contained to <lb/>
            the contrary notwithstanding.</p>

            hands and seals to four bonds of this tenor and date, one of <lb/>
            which being paid, the others shall be null and void. <lb/>

            <title type="sub">CHARACTER OF THE ATHENIAN TRIBUNALS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>IN Arnold's History of Rome we read as follows:</p>
          <p>" What record of mere battles and sieges, wars and facts, could <lb/>
            afford such fulness of knowledge, as to the real state of Greece, in all <lb/>
            points which are most instructive, as we derive from the pamphlets <lb/>
            (as they may be called) of Isocrates, from the dialogues of Plato, the <lb/>
            moral and political treatises of Aristotle, and the various public and <lb/>
            private orations of Isæus, Æschines, and Demosthenes ?”</p>
          <p>This is especially true of the forensic speeches of the Attic orators. <lb/>
            No record of antiquity gives us so clear an insight into the life and <lb/>
            character of the Athenians. Here we have the citizen of Athens, not, <lb/>
            as depicted by Thucydides, in the assembly or the camp; not carica­ <lb/>
            tured, as by Aristophanes; but in his real and individual character, <lb/>
            in all the relations of social life; in the corn market or on the ex­ <lb/>
            change; in the factory or the banking house; attending to his farm <lb/>
            in the country, or negotiating in the harbour with merchants and <lb/>
            ship-owners; assisting at the registration of a birth, or surrounded by <lb/>
            friends on his deathbed, and making his last will. No part of history <lb/>
            is so pleasing or instructive as that which brings us behind the cur­ <lb/>
            tain of society, exhibiting to us men as they are seen in domestic life, <lb/>
            in their dealings and intercourse with their neighbours.</p>
          <p>To understand and duly profit by these speeches, the reader must <lb/>
            not come unfurnished with previous instruction. As to the public <lb/>
            orations you should bring with you a certain amount of historical <lb/>
            learning, so the private speeches require some general acquaintance <lb/>
            with the system of Attic jurisprudence. You need no more than this <lb/>
            general acquaintance, to begin with. As you proceed with the perusal <lb/>
            of the orators themselves, you fill up the outline which you have got <lb/>
            in your head with those details, which give life and reality to the <lb/>
            picture. A knowledge of the laws is of no use without reading the <lb/>
            speeches, and the speeches cannot be read without knowing the laws.</p>
          <p>In connexion with this translation I have, in the humble hope of <lb/>
            assisting the reader, presented him with a series of commentaries on <lb/>
            Attic history and archaeology, illustrating the various topics handled <lb/>
            or touched on by Demosthenes. In doing this I have simply sought <lb/>
            to be useful. I do not pretend to have made any discoveries, or to <lb/>
            advance anything which is new; but only to give information upon <lb/>
            dull and difficult subjects in an easier form than it is given elsewhere. <lb/>
            I have therefore made free use of the labours of men far more learned <lb/>
            than myself, both German and English, mingling my own observations <lb/>
             <pb n="352"/>
            occasionally where I deemed it desirable, or where I might happen to <lb/>
            differ in opinion from any writer whom I quoted. The object which <lb/>
            I have proposed to myself has been, so to dress up matters of <lb/>
            antiquity as to make them readable. Elaborate treatises, most valu­ <lb/>
            able as storehouses of materials, can rarely be read except by the <lb/>
            learned few. Nor can they be much improved in this respect by <lb/>
            abridgment, which, while it destroys their utility as books of refe­ <lb/>
            rence, renders them less intelligible as the materials are condensed. <lb/>
            I have therefore endeavoured to handle topics of this kind in a more <lb/>
            popular manner, as far as was consistent with the nature of the sub­ <lb/>
            ject; so as to render them more intelligible to the ordinary reader, <lb/>
            and to fix them better in the memory of all; keeping in view what <lb/>
            Schömann says of himself in the preface to his " Antiquitates Juris <lb/>
            Public! Græcorum "—" brevitatem ita secutus sum, ut non officeret <lb/>
            perspicuitati; summas tantum rerum proposui, sed has ipsas quan­ <lb/>
            tum fieri potuit plane et dilucide."</p>
          <p>In explaining points of Attic law, I frequently, for the purpose of <lb/>
            illustration, refer to the laws of modem times. This hardly needs an <lb/>
            apology. In the legislation of all civilized countries we may trace <lb/>
            certain common principles, amidst an infinite variety of codes and <lb/>
            ordinances. When we find such agreement in essential points, we <lb/>
            ascribe it not to accident or imitation, but to the natural instinct of a <lb/>
            social being. In mere conventional rules and matters of form, it is <lb/>
            not unpleasing to discover a resemblance between the institutions of <lb/>
            remote ages. A comparison of laws, by exhibiting the advantages of <lb/>
            one system and the defects of another, affords to the observant <lb/>
            reader materials for many a practical lesson; while it is useful to all, <lb/>
            inasmuch as every subject of knowledge is better taught by the help <lb/>
            of analogy. Nor is it without advantage, at the same time to illustrate <lb/>
            the law of Athens, and to introduce the reader to some acquaintance <lb/>
            with his own: for I may fairly suppose, that the greater part of my <lb/>
            readers will be young men, pursuing their studies at the University <lb/>
            or elsewhere.</p>
          <p>I have already explained the general features of the Attic law, the <lb/>
            constitution of its courts, and their procedure and practice. It re­ <lb/>
            mains only to notice some peculiarities attending them, and to make <lb/>
            such observations upon their character, as reflection and experience <lb/>
            suggest.</p>
          <p>The principal point to be noticed is the tribunal itself, by which <lb/>
            Attic causes were tried; I mean the jury. Its members, its powers, <lb/>
            its temper and qualification for judicial duties, are subjects demanding <lb/>
            particular attention.</p>
          <p>The Heliastic tribunal, or jury, was originally designed by Solon <lb/>
            for political purposes, to revise the laws, to correct constitutional <lb/>
            abuses, and punish offenders against the state. A body of six thou­ <lb/>
            sand citizens was therefore chosen by lot every year, to form a supreme <lb/>
            court, called Heliæa, which was divided into several smaller courts <lb/>
             <pb n="353"/>
            varying in number according to the exigency of the occasion. The <lb/>
            qualifications required for the Heliæa were the same with those <lb/>
            required for the popular Assembly, except that the members of the <lb/>
            former must have reached their thirtieth year of age. The political <lb/>
            object which Solon had in view appears partly (as Thirlwall has <lb/>
            observed) from the oath prescribed to its members; and still more <lb/>
            from the enactments respecting the revision of the laws, and the <lb/>
            punishment of persons who sought to introduce new laws against the <lb/>
            spirit of the constitution. The oath occurs in the speech against <lb/>
            Timocrates (ante, p. 38,) and with respect to the revision of the laws <lb/>
            &amp;c., the reader will find every information in that same speech and in <lb/>
            Volume II. Appendix VIL</p>
          <p>From this body of men, originally constituted with a political <lb/>
            object, were taken the juries who were impanelled to try private <lb/>
            causes; and hence it came about, first, that they were impanelled in <lb/>
            such large numbers, rarely less than two or three hundred, and some­ <lb/>
            times five hundred or a thousand; and secondly, that they were <lb/>
            entrusted with the whole judicial power, after the cause was brought <lb/>
            into court, the power (namely) of deciding upon the Jaw as well as <lb/>
            the fact, without being directed or controlled by a presiding judge <lb/>
            Such being the origin of this regulation, we will proceed to examine <lb/>
            some of its effects and consequences. But before we do so, let us <lb/>
            see what Thirlwall has said upon the subject in his History of Greece. <lb/>
            (Vol. II. p. 47.)</p>
          <p>" Solon believed that no higher qualities were requisite for the <lb/>
            discharge of the duties he assigned to them, than the ordinary degree <lb/>
            of intelligence and integrity which might be expected in every citizen, <lb/>
            aided by that practical experience, which it was the great object of <lb/>
            his institutions to impart equally to all. Nothing seems more directly <lb/>
            opposite to his views, and to the genius of his system, than the design <lb/>
            attributed to him by Plutarch, who fancies that he wrapt his laws in <lb/>
            studied obscurity, for the purpose of multiplying the causes of litiga­ <lb/>
            tion. It is possible that their antique simplicity itself may have laid <lb/>
            them more open to be wrested by chicanery than those framed in ages <lb/>
            of greater refinement. But the legislator himself assuredly thought <lb/>
            their sense so plain, as to be within the reach of the commonest <lb/>
            capacity. Hence he was not led to draw that nice distinction, which <lb/>
            is so familiar to us, between the province of the judge and jury: <lb/>
            hence every magistrate, within whose sphere of administration legal <lb/>
            controversies might arise, was empowered to preside over the court <lb/>
            to which they were referred: hence at Athens there was no class of <lb/>
            men who dedicated themselves to the study of the law as a profes­ <lb/>
            sion ; the only persons who there corresponded in some degree to the <lb/>
            Roman jurists, were the expounders of the traditional rules and forms <lb/>
            concerning religious observances.' It was Solon's wish to accustom <lb/>
            every citizen to consider himself as personally concerned in the <note type="footnote"> (1) <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξηγηταί</foreign>. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> A A </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="354"/>
            maintenance of the laws: the best state, he is reported to have said, is <lb/>
            that in. which all who witness wrong are no less active in procuring <lb/>
            its redress and the punishment of the aggressor, than the sufferer <lb/>
            himself. Hence he permitted and encouraged every citizen to come <lb/>
            forward as a prosecutor, in cases affecting the interest of the state; <lb/>
            and he multiplied the avenues to justice, by affording the means of <lb/>
            choosing among a great variety of modes of proceeding. The motive <lb/>
            which fed Solon to direct that so great a number of jurors as com­ <lb/>
            posed each of the Heliastic courts, never amounting to less than <lb/>
            several hundreds, should sit together on the same cause, must be <lb/>
            referred to the view he took of them as representatives of the people. <lb/>
            Hence, to ensure that the spirit with which they were animated <lb/>
            should always he in accordance with the opinions and sentiments of <lb/>
            the whole body, it might seem necessary to collect them in large <lb/>
            masses. For the same reason they were free from all legal respon­ <lb/>
            sibility; and they were screened from disgrace, not only by the great. <lb/>
            ness of their numbers, but by the secrecy of their votes. It might <lb/>
            reasonably have been expected, that the danger arising from the cer­ <lb/>
            tainty of impunity, accompanying the exercise of almost absolute <lb/>
            power, would have been in some measure compensated by the security <lb/>
            which seemed to be afforded by the same causes against venality and <lb/>
            corruption. We learn however, that means were at length discoverec <lb/>
            of eluding these obstacles, and that the practice of bribery in the <lb/>
            courts of justice was reduced to a regular system."</p>
          <p>The charge of corruption which has been brought against the <lb/>
            Athenian juries rests upon too slender authority to be fully credited. <lb/>
            Anytus may possibly (as Plutarch says) have bribed the jury upon <lb/>
            his own trial for treason; but that bribery was reduced to a system <lb/>
            is not sufficiently made out by a quotation from Aristotle by Harpo­ <lb/>
            cration.1 We find no evidence of it in the Attic orators; and the <lb/>
            number of the jury, as well as their voting by ballot, renders the <lb/>
            supposition improbable. I am inclined to think, that the Attic jurors <lb/>
            were tolerably free from motives of direct personal interest; though, <lb/>
            in their collective character, they were subject to certain other <lb/>
            dangerous influences, natural and perhaps inevitable under the cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances.</p>
          <p>With a large body of men there is not the same feeling of respon. <lb/>
            sibility as with a small body; and more especially when they vote by <lb/>
            ballot. No juror could by his own suffrage secure a righteous judg­ <lb/>
            ment, and the shame of an unjust one was nothing, when shared <lb/>
            among so many. The reader will remember what Demosthenes says <lb/>
            on the trial of Aristogiton, (ante, p. 81, 82.) And Lycurgus ex­ <lb/>
            pressed a similar fear, when he said to the jury—“ remember, though <lb/>
            each of you will vote in secret, he cannot conceal his intention from <lb/>
            the gods."</p>
          <p>The political character of the Attic jurors caused some arguments <note type="footnote"> (1) Sub voce <foreign xml:lang="grc">δεκάζων</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="355"/>
            to be addressed to them, and supported by evidence, which in our <lb/>
            country would be regarded as irrelevant and inadmissible. Such <lb/>
            were the attacks made upon the adversary for concealing his property <lb/>
            and evading the public services, and the assumption of credit to the <lb/>
            speaker for his own liberality and public spirit. Thus, Chrysippus <lb/>
            claims the gratitude of the jury for himself and his brother, on <lb/>
            account of their donations of corn to the people, of which he pro­ <lb/>
            duces evidence; and urges how unlikely it was that persons proved <lb/>
            to have been so generous should bring an unfounded action for <lb/>
            twenty minas: (ante, p. 182.) In the defence of Phormio the advo­ <lb/>
            cate calls witnesses to contrast the virtues of his client with the <lb/>
            vicious character of the plaintiff; showing that the latter had brought <lb/>
            vexatious actions and prosecutions against a multitude of people, <lb/>
            while the defendant had done many acts of generosity, both public <lb/>
            and private; and he reminds the jury, that the property in dispute <lb/>
            would be more serviceable to them in the hands of Phormio, who <lb/>
            was always so kind to those who desired his assistance: (ante, <lb/>
            p. 218.)</p>
          <p>These arguments present themselves in three different aspects. In <lb/>
            the first place, the gratitude of the jury is invoked in favour of one <lb/>
            of the parties for having rendered public service. This, though we <lb/>
            should consider it wholly inadmissible in a private cause between <lb/>
            man and man, was nevertheless an appeal to an amiable feeling, and <lb/>
            seems not to have been at all objected to at Athens. (Compare <lb/>
            ante, p. 250.) Secondly, evidence to character is offered, for the one <lb/>
            party, and against the other. This with us is only done on criminal <lb/>
            trials, and then only for the accused, and not against him, except, <lb/>
            under certain circumstances, in the case of a previous conviction. <lb/>
            The thing itself however is far from being absurd; nay, it might in <lb/>
            many cases be attended with advantage; though I allow that it is <lb/>
            better to adhere to the general rule. Thirdly, we have an appeal to <lb/>
            feelings of a more objectionable kind, when the jury are reminded of <lb/>
            the benefit they would derive by deciding for the party addressing <lb/>
            them. The same argument is still more pointedly urged in the per­ <lb/>
            oration of the second speech against Aphobus; (ante, p. 119;) and it <lb/>
            is impossible not to regard it with disapprobation. It appeals to the <lb/>
            selfishness of the jury. At the same time we must remember, it is a <lb/>
            political, not an individual selfishness, which is appealed to; a selfish <lb/>
            patriotism, if such an expression may be allowed. If the jury were <lb/>
            influenced by such an argument, it might be in some measure from a <lb/>
            sense of duty, though a mistaken one.</p>
          <p>Examples of similar arguments from Lysias and Isæus will be <lb/>
            found in Volume III. Appendix II.</p>
          <p>There is one also in the Trapezitic oration of Isocrates. This was <lb/>
            written for a client, a merchant of Bosporus, who had brought an <lb/>
            action against Pasion the banker, to recover a deposit. He produces <lb/>
            a letter written in his favour by Satyrus, king of the country, whose <note type="footnote"> A A 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="356"/>
            minister the plaintiff's father was; and reminds the Athenians of the <lb/>
            numerous acts of kindness which Satyrus and his father had done <lb/>
            them, by sending corn to Athens in times of scarcity.</p>
          <p>One of the most striking instances of attack upon the adversary's <lb/>
            character is that in the speech against Midias, where a paper is read <lb/>
            reciting various injurious acts which Midias had committed in the <lb/>
            course of his life. (See Volume III. p. 109, and the Argument to <lb/>
            the speech.)</p>
          <p>As the court partook so much of the character of a popular <lb/>
            assembly, it must have been susceptible of the various impulses and <lb/>
            passions by which that assembly was agitated, and the orators knew <lb/>
            how to work upon such materials. We observe how often they <lb/>
            address the jury as if they were addressing the whole people of <lb/>
            Athens. Decrees of the assembly, or verdicts of other juries, are <lb/>
            spoken of as being the acts of the court before whom the speaker <lb/>
            stands. " You did this and that-your practice is so and so”—such <lb/>
            are the ordinary expressions. Chrysippus says (ante, p. 184)—" You <lb/>
            are the same persons who punished with death a man who had <lb/>
            obtained fresh loans upon your exchange and did not provide for his <lb/>
            creditors their securities." I need not multiply examples. The <lb/>
            impulses of a popular body are most commonly honest and generous ; <lb/>
            and the great thing is to give a right direction to them. Zeal foi <lb/>
            the commonwealth is one; and this was most frequently misdi­ <lb/>
            reeled at Athens. Sympathy with the oppressed, indignation against <lb/>
            cruelty and insolence, are feelings quickly excited in a multitude. <lb/>
            These prompted the Athenian courts to favour orphans, heiresses, <lb/>
            and people in humble circumstances, and to dislike usurers and <lb/>
            avaricious and proud people who gave themselves airs. Hence, as <lb/>
            Demosthenes assures us, he was urged by so many people not to <lb/>
            drop his prosecution against Midias; (Vol. III. p. 134.) And the <lb/>
            son of Aristæchmus is bold enough to tell the jury, that his father, <lb/>
            upon an action being brought against him by his wards for eighty <lb/>
            talents, did wisely to compromise it for three talents, considering the <lb/>
            advantages which the plaintiffs would have had; for, says he, " they <lb/>
            were orphans and young, and their characters were unknown; things <lb/>
            that with you, as every one knows, outweigh a multitude of argu­ <lb/>
            ments."</p>
          <p>To give way to these good feelings too hastily, too impetuously, <lb/>
            too credulously, and so to be imposed upon frequently by designing <lb/>
            parties, was inevitable with a court so constituted; nor indeed can <lb/>
            any judicial body avoid being led into occasional error even by its <lb/>
            virtues. Apollodorus says in the action against Stephanus, that the <lb/>
            speech made in Phormio's defence made such an impression on the <lb/>
            court, that they would not hear a word that he had to say: (ante, <lb/>
            p. 203:) and Nicobulus makes a similar complaint against the jury <lb/>
            who condemned Euergus: (ante, p. 240.) There are plenty of <lb/>
            instances where the orator speaks of previous verdicts as having been <lb/>
             <pb n="357"/>
            given hastily and wrongly; and how often do they insinuate their <lb/>
            fears,lest the opponent should prevail against them by a crafty <lb/>
            speech or other improper means.</p>
          <p>It was not possible in a city like Athens, that a bench, composed <lb/>
            of three or four hundred persons, should be entirely free from pre­ <lb/>
            judice and partiality, either on private or political grounds: nor were <lb/>
            such influences discountenanced as they should have been. Plutarch <lb/>
            reports Themistocles to have said—“ Heaven forbid that, if I were <lb/>
            on the bench, I should not favour a friend more than a stranger." <lb/>
            I do not attach so much importance to this story, as to the express <lb/>
            statements of the orators, and the general tenor of their arguments. <lb/>
            Personal enmity was held to be a just ground for undertaking x <lb/>
            prosecution, and why should the judge have a higher code of morality <lb/>
            than the prosecutor? (See the opening of the speeches against <lb/>
            Androtion, Timocrates, Nicostratus, Neæra; and see what Manti­ <lb/>
            theus says, ante, pages 256, 260. On the other hand, Lycurgus on <lb/>
            the prosecution of Leocrates, and Euthycles on that of Aristocrates, <lb/>
            disclaim motives of private enmity.) The practice of bringing friends <lb/>
            into court to influence the jury, if it was not considered perfectly. <lb/>
            legitimate, was at all events tolerated, and stood pretty much on the <lb/>
            same footing with the custom of producing a man's children at the <lb/>
            bar, to move the compassion of the jury, and obtain a mitigation of <lb/>
            his sentence. The term <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρασκευή</foreign>, which (according to its natural <lb/>
            import) might signify the whole preparation for conducting a cause, <lb/>
            was understood in a more limited sense to denote an array of friends, <lb/>
            who by their appearance in court, or by open intercession and advo­ <lb/>
            cacy, endeavoured to influence the bench. (See the opening of the <lb/>
            speech of Andocides On the Mysteries.) Cicero's language is a <lb/>
            paraphrase of this term: " non una est ratio defensionis ea, quæ <lb/>
            posita est in oratione. Omnes qui adsunt, qui laborant, qui salvum <lb/>
            volunt, pro suâ parte atque auctoritate defendunt." Lycurgus, who <lb/>
            was one of the most pure and high-minded men that Athens ever <lb/>
            produced, condemns the practice in his speech against Leocrates: <lb/>
            (20. Ed. Bekker:) His words are: " You are aware, men of Athens, <lb/>
            of the efforts which are made by accused persons to influence the <lb/>
            court, and the earnest petitions which are made for them by their <lb/>
            friends. You well know, that many witnesses are induced by jobbing <lb/>
            and by bribery either to have a conveniently bad memory, or to <lb/>
            absent themselves, or find excuses." Demosthenes is constantly <lb/>
            attacking, either obliquely or directly, the supporters of his opponent, <lb/>
            who were perhaps standing near to the speaker, or looking at the <lb/>
            jury, and making themselves conspicuous and offensive by sneers and <lb/>
            expressions of dissent. The spirit of party and club-fellowship was <lb/>
            powerful at Athens, and would lead men to support one another in <lb/>
            courts of justice as well as in the assembly and elsewhere. Other <lb/>
            bonds of union of a less reputable character are sometimes spoken of <lb/>
            by the orators, such as the gangs of swindlers in the Piræus and <lb/>
             <pb n="358"/>
            similar combinations; (ante, pages 153, 240, 256:) but allow­ <lb/>
            ance must always be made for the exaggerating language of an <lb/>
            adverse speaker. The attendance of friends and partisans, to sway <lb/>
            the votes of the jury, was far more common, and doubtless considered <lb/>
            more legitimate, in criminal than in civil cases; yet it occurred in <lb/>
            both, and especially on important trials, and in the case of persons, <lb/>
            who by their station or popularity were able to command influence, <lb/>
            such as Æschines, Timotheus, or a rich banker like Phormio: (See <lb/>
            ante, pages 41, 68, 138.) It might happen that a party had made <lb/>
            himself unpopular in the city by his habits of life, or even by his <lb/>
            manners and personal appearance, and people who saw him every day <lb/>
            in the street or market might be on the bench. This would operate <lb/>
            against him, and the more so, as he was obliged to be in court, and <lb/>
            generally to conduct his own cause. Nicobulus deprecates the pre­ <lb/>
            judice which might be raised against him by the fact of his being a <lb/>
            money-lender, or by his coarse demeanour and other personal peen. <lb/>
            liarities ; and adroitly endeavours (or rather Demosthenes, who wrote <lb/>
            his speech, endeavours for him) to turn the prejudice against the <lb/>
            adversary, for having sought to take an unfair advantage of those <lb/>
            circumstances: (ante, p. 241.)</p>
          <p>Another consequence of having a numerous jury taken from a small <lb/>
            population was, that the jurors must often have had a knowledge of <lb/>
            the facts of the case, or some of them, and this knowledge was often <lb/>
            appealed to, and sometimes for lack of other proof. In many cases <lb/>
            there could be no great harm in this; at all events, it was unavoid­ <lb/>
            able, and the same for both parties. Things which had passed in the <lb/>
            popular assembly, or upon other trials, would be referred to as noto­ <lb/>
            rious. (See ante, pp. 5, 142.) There is an example in the speech <lb/>
            against Euergus and Mnesibulus, p. 1152: and one in that of Lysias <lb/>
            against Theomnestus. The plaintiff has brought an action for <lb/>
            defamation. The defendant had some time before been impeached <lb/>
            for cowardice in battle, and, because the plaintiff had given evidence <lb/>
            against him, he called him a parricide. The plaintiff says in the <lb/>
            opening of his speech—“ I shall be at no loss for witnesses; for I see <lb/>
            that many of you who are now on the bench were present at the <lb/>
            former trial." In the speech against Onetor, Demosthenes speaks of <lb/>
            the notoriety of the misconduct of his guardians, and of meetings <lb/>
            having been held during his minority before the archon and other <lb/>
            persons. Statements of this kind abound, and are often made <lb/>
            artfully and designedly. One of the most remarkable cases of appeal <lb/>
            to general notoriety is that of Æschines on the accusation of <lb/>
            Timarchus: (89, Ed. Bekker.) He calls on the jurors to be his <lb/>
            witnesses, excusing himself for not producing other testimony on <lb/>
            account of the difficulty of procuring it, because the only direct <lb/>
            evidence would be that of accomplices, who could not be expected to <lb/>
            oome forward and criminate themselves. But the whole previous life <lb/>
            of Timarchus, he contends, was before the court, and everyone knew <lb/>
             <pb n="359"/>
            the vices which he had been addicted to. " Such -says the orator <lb/>
            —“is the testimony given by the whole people of Athens, and it is <lb/>
            not meet that they should be supposed guilty of falsehood." In <lb/>
            support of his argument, he refers to the practice of the Areopagus, <lb/>
            and proceeds thus:</p>
          <p>" fake for example the council of Areopagus, the strictest tribunal <lb/>
            in the city. Many have I seen convicted before that court, who <lb/>
            spoke exceedingly well and produced witnesses; others I have known <lb/>
            to succeed, who spoke very badly and offered no evidence. The <lb/>
            judgments of that council are not formed from the speeches and <lb/>
            witnesses alone, but are the result of their own knowledge and <lb/>
            inquiry; therefore it has ever continued to hold the highest reputa­ <lb/>
            tion in this republic. In the same manner ought you, Athenians, to <lb/>
            pass sentence now. Let nothing weigh with you so much as your <lb/>
            own knowledge and impression respecting the conduct of Timarchus; <lb/>
            and, in forming your opinions, look to the past rather than to the <lb/>
            present time. The reports, which were spread in former times about <lb/>
            Timarchus and his mode of life, were founded in truth; whereas the <lb/>
            statements, which you will hear to-day, are concerted to deceive you <lb/>
            at the trial. Upon these principles give your judgment, having <lb/>
            regard to length of time and to truth, and to the facts within your <lb/>
            own knowledge."</p>
          <p>Then he dilates on the efficacy of Fame or Rumour, who was <lb/>
            worshipped as a goddess at Athens, and quotes verses in praise of <lb/>
            her from Hesiod, Homer, and Euripides.</p>
          <p>The argument is commented on by Demosthenes in the Oration on <lb/>
            the Embassy, where he contends that Æschines ought to be convicted <lb/>
            on his own principles. (Vol. II. p. 191.)</p>
          <p>Originally our own jurors were only witnesses; which came about <lb/>
            in this way. A custom sprang up in ancient times of calling in the <lb/>
            assistance of the neighbours, or inhabitants of the county or district, <lb/>
            to speak to facts within their own knowledge upon important trials. <lb/>
            Various examples of this practice are recorded both in the Saxon era, <lb/>
            upon trials in the old county courts, and in the first century after the <lb/>
            Conquest, upon trials before the king's justiciary. The persons thus <lb/>
            called in to assist the courts by their information were at first nothing <lb/>
            more than witnesses, speaking to facts within their own knowledge. <lb/>
            Sometimes a very large number of these were called in, and being <lb/>
            supposed to represent all the testimony of the county or district, the <lb/>
            courts deferred to their superior knowledge and gave judgment in <lb/>
            accordance with it. So it became the practice on important occasions <lb/>
            to summon such persons to attend the courts; and these bodies of <lb/>
            men, taken from the neighbourhood, from witnesses became a sort of <lb/>
            referees, and virtually the deciding tribunal. The thing was made <lb/>
            perpetual by the establishment of the Grand Assize in the reign of <lb/>
            Henry II. and the practice that grew up under it; which was <lb/>
            adapted, with some variation, to criminal cases. And both in these <lb/>
             <pb n="360"/>
            and in civil cases it long continued to be an essential qualification for <lb/>
            a juror, that he should have some previous knowledge of the facts; <lb/>
            and therefore all the jurors were obliged to be summoned from the <lb/>
            neighbourhood ; in criminal cases, from the neighbourhood where the <lb/>
            crime was committed, and in civil cases, from the neighbourhood <lb/>
            where the disputed property lay, or where the litigants resided. It <lb/>
            was not sufficient to have a jury from the county at large, as it now <lb/>
            is; it was necessary that the jury should be drawn from the parish <lb/>
            or district, in order that they might assist the court with their <lb/>
            knowledge of the circumstances.</p>
          <p>This ancient law in England gradually gave way to a change in <lb/>
            public opinion, but not till the close of the seventeenth century. It <lb/>
            then became a maxim, (which is now finally settled in our law,) that <lb/>
            juries were not to find verdicts of their own knowledge, but to decide <lb/>
            wholly by the evidence which they heard in court; and, if any juror <lb/>
            possessed private information upon the subject, he was bound to <lb/>
            inform the court of it. This principle once being established, there <lb/>
            ceased to be any advantage in having juries from the immediate <lb/>
            neighbourhood; indeed, it was considered better to avoid the pre­ <lb/>
            judice or partiality which a jury consisting of neighbours might <lb/>
            import into the trial; and so, after the old practice had been for <lb/>
            some time considerably relaxed, it was enacted by a statute in the <lb/>
            reign of Queen Anne, that juries in civil cases should be summoned <lb/>
            from the body of the county; and the same rule was afterwards <lb/>
            applied to criminal trials.</p>
          <p>In a city where the whole body of jurors was only six thousand, it <lb/>
            was impossible to apply such a rule as now prevails with us: the <lb/>
            bench must always have been composed (more or less) of the neigh­ <lb/>
            bours of the parties. As the Athenians never retired to consider <lb/>
            their verdict, but gave their votes immediately after the termination <lb/>
            of the speeches, they had not much opportunity of communicating <lb/>
            with each other. If any juror possessed a private knowledge of the <lb/>
            facts, he might whisper it perhaps to the man who sat next him, or <lb/>
            lie might indicate by some sign his assent to the speaker's statement; <lb/>
            but such a medium of proof must have been uncertain and dangerous. <lb/>
            We may conceive that a party might have a friend on the bench, who <lb/>
            helped him in this way. It was a common trick for the parties to <lb/>
            assume that certain facts, from their general notoriety, needed no <lb/>
            proof, and to use such expressions as the following—“ You are of <lb/>
            course aware”—“ I presume, none of you are ignorant." We have <lb/>
            seen how Demosthenes, who employs the artifice so frequently himself, <lb/>
            cautions the jury against being taken in by it: (ante, p. 279:)—" he <lb/>
            is such a crafty knave, that, what he has no witnesses to prove, he <lb/>
            will say is well known to you, men of the jury: a trick which all <lb/>
            people resort to, who have no good argument to offer. Should he <lb/>
            attempt such a trick, put him down; expose him. What any one of <lb/>
            you does not know, don't let him fancy his neighbour knows : require <lb/>
             <pb n="361"/>
            Boeotus to give clear proof of everything he asserts, &amp;c.” It appears, <lb/>
            as if he were asking the jurors to express their dissent to any asser­ <lb/>
            tions that should be made in this way.</p>
          <p>With respect to the ability of the Athenian jurors to perform the <lb/>
            judicial duty imposed on them, there is a good deal to be said on both <lb/>
            sides. That they should perform it in a thoroughly business-like <lb/>
            manner, or so as to fulfil what may have been Solon's conception of <lb/>
            the trust confided to them, was hardly in the nature of things. They <lb/>
            had to administer justice according to the written law, and of course <lb/>
            to interpret that law; where there was no written statute, they were <lb/>
            bound to decide according to the best of their ability; that is, in the <lb/>
            absence of any express legislative provision, they were required to <lb/>
            apply the general principles of law and justice to the case before <lb/>
            them. They were also sole judges of the facts of every case. They <lb/>
            were persons of no legal education or learning; taken at haphazard <lb/>
            from the whole body of citizens, and mostly belonging to the lowest <lb/>
            and poorest class of them. On the other hand, the Athenians were <lb/>
            naturally the quickest and cleverest people in the world. Their wits <lb/>
            were sharpened by the habit of attending the theatres and public <lb/>
            assemblies, of taking an active part in important debates, and hearing <lb/>
            the most splendid orators. There was so much litigation at Athens, <lb/>
            that they were constantly either engaged as jurors, or present as <lb/>
            spectators in courts of law. Cases of all varieties were brought <lb/>
            before them, involving difficult questions concerning pedigree and <lb/>
            succession, marital and filial right, mercantile and mining contracts, <lb/>
            besides assaults, trespasses, frauds, and criminal charges of every <lb/>
            description. Then they lived an out-of-door life, constantly meeting <lb/>
            in the market-place or elsewhere, hearing foreign news, discussing <lb/>
            politics, &amp;c. All this was a sort of education, and, if not the best, <lb/>
            still it fitted the people in some measure for the performance of the <lb/>
            duties we are speaking of.</p>
          <p>The materials for the trial were prepared by the parties themselves <lb/>
            or their pleaders, under the superintendence of the magistrate; and I <lb/>
            apprehend that important cases were generally got up under the <lb/>
            advice of pleaders, at least where the suitors were not men of expe­ <lb/>
            rience or ability. The jury had to decide upon the materials thus <lb/>
            prepared. There was no examination of witnesses in court, requiring <lb/>
            a nice application of rules of evidence: all that was done beforehand. <lb/>
            As there were no multiplied copies of the statutes, they depended for <lb/>
            their law upon the copies or extracts produced by the parties. The <lb/>
            orators have been accused of sometimes misquoting or garbling the <lb/>
            law; and such a thing may hare been done occasionally; yet it must <lb/>
            have been a dangerous experiment; for the laws which either party <lb/>
            relied on were always reduced to writing and put into the box <lb/>
            together with the other evidentiary documents; the production of a <lb/>
            fictitious law was an offence punishable with death; and, as every <lb/>
            citizen had access to the temple of Cybele and other places where the <lb/>
             <pb n="362"/>
            laws were open to inspection, we may conclude that the vigilance of <lb/>
            the adversary, as well as that of the magistrate, would operate as a <lb/>
            check upon such malpractices. Although the laws were not very <lb/>
            complicated, it is likely enough that the court made many mistakes <lb/>
            in the interpretation of them, as the judges do in all countries; and <lb/>
            they would often depart from the letter of the law, in order to do <lb/>
            what they thought substantial equity. There must have been many <lb/>
            cases too, where the law was not properly laid before the court, <lb/>
            through the ignorance of the suitors themselves.</p>
          <p>The hearing of a cause in some respects resembled an English trial <lb/>
            at common law, in others it was more like a hearing in Chancery; <lb/>
            the evidence being all reduced to the shape of depositions, though the <lb/>
            witnesses attended in court to confirm them, or to disclaim them, if <lb/>
            they were not such as they could assent to. The jury liked to see <lb/>
            the witnesses, to be able to judge of them by their demeanour; <lb/>
            but no cross-examination was permitted. The time allowed to <lb/>
            each party for his speech was limited, the scheme of the whole <lb/>
            arrangement being, to compress the trial into a reasonably short <lb/>
            compass. To judge from the speeches which have come down to us, <lb/>
            it would appear that ample time was allowed for addressing the <lb/>
            court. While the evidence was read, the water-glass was stopped, as <lb/>
            the limitation of time applied to the speeches only. The plan of <lb/>
            reading the evidence during the speech was attended with much <lb/>
            advantage, but was not free from evil, as a little reflexion will show.</p>
          <p>The rule was, that every assertion either of fact or law, which <lb/>
            required proof, should be proved at the time that it was made, or as <lb/>
            soon after as possible. Nothing seems fairer than this, and nothing <lb/>
            is fairer, if the rule can be fully carried out. In practice however it <lb/>
            would be found exceedingly difficult; for, in relating a series of facts, <lb/>
            if you stop every moment to prove each fact which you assert, your <lb/>
            story is interrupted, and the effect of it weakened. Comments and <lb/>
            inferences too have to be interwoven with your facts, so that the <lb/>
            whole may be presented in the shape of an argument; and for this <lb/>
            you must have some latitude of discretion as to the time when you <lb/>
            produce your evidence. It is obvious therefore, that the rule, which <lb/>
            required proof to follow assertion, could not be observed literally; <lb/>
            nor did any Athenian ever imagine that it could. It is true, the <lb/>
            spirit, of the rule might have been complied with, by the production <lb/>
            of evidence at the close of every distinct narrative or argument: but, <lb/>
            on the other hand, it was easy to evade it, and we see by the speeches <lb/>
            of the Attic orators, that they did evade it. The plan was, to string <lb/>
            a number of assertions together, and to prove some of them only, and <lb/>
            so to manage the thing, that the jury should not remember what was <lb/>
            proved and what was not. In a meagre case the great art must have <lb/>
            been, to eke it out with the least possible testimony, and to put the <lb/>
            speech together in such a way, that it should appear to contain more <lb/>
            proof than it really did. Evidence was frequently offered upon corn. <lb/>
             <pb n="363"/>
            paratively immaterial points; irrelevant topics were introduced, and <lb/>
            laws quoted, which had little or no bearing on the question. For <lb/>
            example; in the case of Lacritus, there are many depositions put. in <lb/>
            evidence, to prove the breaches of agreement by his brothers, but not <lb/>
            one to fix the defendant with liability for the acts of his brothers, <lb/>
            which was the main point to be established.</p>
          <p>But would it have been better for the Athenians, if they had had <lb/>
            official and permanent judges to direct and control the jury; to point <lb/>
            out the fallacies, the falsehoods, the quibbles and artifices of the <lb/>
            speakers, and to decide the various points of law which arose ? Such <lb/>
            a thing would not only have been incompatible with the spirit of the <lb/>
            constitution, but would not, in my opinion, have promoted the ends <lb/>
            of justice. Under the existing system, a sort of rough justice was <lb/>
            done by the Athenian jurors, and it was owing to their freedom, and <lb/>
            to the free government of the state. Under a different system, they <lb/>
            might have had no justice at all. How was the law for many centu­ <lb/>
            ries administered in our own country? The main object of the <lb/>
            judges was to enlarge their jurisdiction; they were servile to the <lb/>
            crown, and oppressive to the people. To the juries they were dicta­ <lb/>
            torial and insolent. Bacon advised them, that they should be lights <lb/>
            to jurors to open their eyes, not guides to lead them by the noses; <lb/>
            but this maxim they forgot, in their anxiety to get verdicts for the <lb/>
            crown or for other sinister purposes. Fair trials could never be had <lb/>
            before the Revolution. Since that time there has certainly been a <lb/>
            great change. The press and the public exercise a control over our <lb/>
            courts; a better tone of morality prevails; and the judges are obliged <lb/>
            to be externally on their good behaviour. Yet there are always some <lb/>
            who are not to be trusted, who cover an insidious purpose under the <lb/>
            mask of candour and moderation, and who are ready to sum up on <lb/>
            one side or the other, to favour this or that particular counsel. I <lb/>
            would rather try an important case before a thousand independent <lb/>
            jurors without a judge, than before a pliant jury with a judge. We <lb/>
            owe all our liberties to the circumstance that English juries occa­ <lb/>
            sionally displayed a little English obstinacy.</p>
          <p>To estimate rightly the judicial capacity of the Athenian tribunal, <lb/>
            we must look at their moral condition as well as their intellectual; <lb/>
            and we must look at the condition of the world around them. Even <lb/>
            since Christianity has been established, how much there is of vice, <lb/>
            fraud, selfishness, baseness of every kind; how few thoroughly good <lb/>
            people in the world. A little yeast leavens the whole mass, or I <lb/>
            know not what would become of us. But in the ancient world, and <lb/>
            especially in large and wealthy cities, what a mass of corruption <lb/>
            pervade d the public mind. The great republics in early ages furnish <lb/>
            undoubtedly splendid examples of generous devotion and patriotism. <lb/>
            But in later times the public spirit degenerated, and national charac­ <lb/>
            ter was debased. The fine literature of Athens must not blind us to <lb/>
            the vice and sensuality that prevailed there. As the administration <lb/>
             <pb n="364"/>
            of justice depends more upon virtue and honesty than upon any <lb/>
            forensic skill or judicial acumen, too much is not to be expected in <lb/>
            such a state of society as that which existed at Athens, with all her <lb/>
            eloquent orators and mercurial-witted people. Let us look more <lb/>
            closely into the matter.</p>
          <p>We read in the Oratio pro Flacco­</p>
          <p>" Hoc dico de toto genere Graecorum. Tribuo illis literas; do <lb/>
            multarum artium disciplinam; non adimo sermonis leporem, ingeni­ <lb/>
            orum acumen, dicendi copiam; denique etiam si qua sibi alia sumant, <lb/>
            non repugno; testimoniorum religionem et fidem nunquam ista natio <lb/>
            eoluit, totiusque hujusce rei quae sit vis, quae auctoritas, quod <lb/>
            pondus, ignorant."</p>
          <p>This savours of the libellous; yet do not the Attic orators them­ <lb/>
            selves, in effect, depreciate their countrymen? Are not they con­ <lb/>
            stantly declaring, that the parties opposed to them were leagued <lb/>
            in a foul conspiracy—that they came into court relying entirely on <lb/>
            false testimony-that false witnesses were always to be had for <lb/>
            money-that the testimony of freemen was of far less value than <lb/>
            that of slaves—and the like ? In the speech against Lacritus it is <lb/>
            asserted, " that all the Phaselite merchants were rogues -in that for <lb/>
            Phormio, " that in the commercial world it was thought a wonderful <lb/>
            thing for a good man of business to be honest." True it is, that a <lb/>
            great deal of this was rhetorical exaggeration. Phormio is set up by <lb/>
            the speaker as a pattern of probity; and he reminds his opponent that <lb/>
            " to be honest was a more profitable thing than to possess a heap of <lb/>
            gold." (See ante, pages 214, 217.) But we must bear in mind, <lb/>
            that the strain of wholesale invective, which runs through the Attic <lb/>
            orations, was not poured out in the excitement of the moment, but <lb/>
            was the artful composition of the pleader, meditating in the closet <lb/>
            over his case, and judging from his experience what was the best <lb/>
            style of argument to be adopted. We can hardly doubt, that the <lb/>
            abuse lavished upon the witnesses and persons concerned in a cause <lb/>
            must, by its constant reiteration, have produced a powerful effect on <lb/>
            the minds of the jurors, and weakened their belief in the truth of <lb/>
            testimony and the honesty of mankind in general: and we cannot <lb/>
            wonder, under such circumstances, that people should venture to try <lb/>
            speculative actions, and to supply their deficiency of evidence by bold <lb/>
            assertion and calumny.</p>
          <p>If the charges, which the Attic orators make against their adver­ <lb/>
            saries, could have been proved, our estimate of Athenian character <lb/>
            must have been far lower than what it is. But a large proportion of <lb/>
            it must have been idle abuse. AEschines, in the prosecution of <lb/>
            Timarchus, makes the most odious charges against Demosthenes; <lb/>
            charges which were not relevant to the case, were unsupported by <lb/>
            any evidence, and do not bear the stamp of credibility. Among other <lb/>
            things, he accuses him of having swindled Aristarchus, when a young <lb/>
            man, out of three talents. How far Æschines himself was guilty of <lb/>
             <pb n="365"/>
            the crimes imputed to him by his rival, we cannot say; but they have <lb/>
            stronger marks of probability.</p>
          <p>Pasion, the banker, carried on a lucrative business for many years, <lb/>
            and is represented by Demosthenes to have been a man highly trusted <lb/>
            and respected. If the client of Isocrates is to be believed, he was <lb/>
            capable of committing any fraud. But the charge made against him <lb/>
            was probably untrue; for he carried on his business with credit to <lb/>
            the last.</p>
          <p>The cases of Apollodorus and Phormio are among the most <lb/>
            interesting to be found in Demosthenes. The comparison of his <lb/>
            speech for Phormio with those against Stephanus is a study for the <lb/>
            lawyer. Each of these men represents the other to be a knave.</p>
          <p>Few characters have stood better in history than that of Timotheus. <lb/>
            Isocrates, his secretary and friend, has written an elaborate panegyric <lb/>
            of him. Apollodorus however, who brought an action against him <lb/>
            for a debt due to the bank, represents him in a very different light. <lb/>
            For, if his statements are true, Timotheus was not only guilty of <lb/>
            fraud, but of gross ingratitude to the plaintiff's father Pasion, who <lb/>
            had assisted him so often in his difficulties. Timotheus had proposed <lb/>
            to take an oath in his own discharge; and Apollodorus thus remarks <lb/>
            upon it:</p>
          <p>" I have a word to say about the challenges to oaths; that which <lb/>
            I gave to the defendant, and that which he gave me. For, when I <lb/>
            bad put an oath into the box, he too proposed to take one and dis­ <lb/>
            charge himself. If I had not been well aware, how many solemn <lb/>
            oaths he has sworn, (to states and individuals) and perjured himself, <lb/>
            I should have allowed him to take this oath. But when I can prove <lb/>
            by witnesses and strong circumstantial evidence, that his nominees <lb/>
            received the money from the bank, I think it would be folly to allow <lb/>
            him to swear."</p>
          <p>Let us consider for a moment the case against Olympiodorus, in <lb/>
            which Demosthenes wrote the speech for the plaintiff.</p>
          <p>I must first premise, that, when an Athenian died without issue, <lb/>
            and the title to his inheritance was disputed, the various claimants <lb/>
            were required to come before the court and interplead. One trial <lb/>
            was appointed for all, and the estate was adjudged to the person or <lb/>
            persons, who appeared to have the best title. This was a good <lb/>
            regulation enough; but there seems to have been mismanagement in <lb/>
            the details. Each party was allowed a certain time for speaking, <lb/>
            measured by the water-glass; and there were as many balloting urns <lb/>
            for the jury, as there were parties in distinct interests. Room was <lb/>
            thus afforded for collusion, if the weaker titles coalesced against the <lb/>
            stronger, or if unfounded claims were put in, to embarrass the court <lb/>
            and the opponent. The adjudication was not final. New claimants, <lb/>
            who by absence, or some other reason, were prevented from trying <lb/>
            their right before, might afterwards come in and sue the successful <lb/>
            party.</p><pb n="366"/>
            
          <p>Conon, a relation of the plaintiff, died without issue. The plaintiff <lb/>
            sent for his brother in law, Olympiodorus, to assist him in performing <lb/>
            the last offices to the deceased. He attended as desired, and took <lb/>
            occasion to mention, that his mother was related to Conon, and he <lb/>
            considered himself entitled to a share in the inheritance. This <lb/>
            astonished the plaintiff, who knew the claim to be unfounded. A <lb/>
            warm dispute ensued, but ended in a compromise, and an agreement <lb/>
            to share the deceased's property between them. The terms were <lb/>
            reduced to writing; they bound themselves to make a fair and equal <lb/>
            division, and to take all measures in concert for the preservation of <lb/>
            the estate. This last clause was dictated by a well-grounded appre­ <lb/>
            hension, that other persons would put in claims, and especially <lb/>
            Callippus, the plaintiff's brother, who was at that time abroad. <lb/>
            Claimants, in fact, soon appeared, and among others Callippus, who <lb/>
            demanded a moiety of the estate. Olympiodorus and the plaintiff <lb/>
            determined to resist them all; and it was settled that the former <lb/>
            should make title to the whole inheritance, the latter to a moiety. <lb/>
            The parties were called before the court in the usual way; but, just <lb/>
            as the trial was coming on, the confederates (such was the number of <lb/>
            claimants, and the suddenness of their appearance) found themselves <lb/>
            unprepared with their case. They then deliberated how they could <lb/>
            get the trial put off, and (says the plaintiff) " by good luck it so <lb/>
            happened, the Athenians were persuaded to send troops into Acar­ <lb/>
            nania, and Olympiodorus was compelled to join the army." The <lb/>
            cause however came on. The plaintiff made an affidavit, stating the <lb/>
            absence of Olympiodorus, and the cause thereof; on the other hand <lb/>
            it was sworn, that he had gone abroad for delay; the latter view of <lb/>
            the case being taken by the jury, the trial proceeded, and the plaintiff <lb/>
            declining to defend for the moiety, judgment was given for some <lb/>
            of the other parties. On the return of Olympiodorus, he and the <lb/>
            plaintiff instantly took measures for the recovery of the estate; and <lb/>
            they resolved to proceed as before, putting in separate claims, but <lb/>
            secretly co-operating with each other. This was done. The holders <lb/>
            of the estate are again brought into court, to try the title. Olym­ <lb/>
            piodorus produces false evidence, which the plaintiff, appearing <lb/>
            ostensibly as a distinct party, supports and corroborates; and by <lb/>
            this means he obtains a verdict. Upon taking possession, he is <lb/>
            required by the plaintiff to give him his share, in pursuance of the <lb/>
            agreement. This he refuses to do, and the plaintiff thereupon <lb/>
            commences an action against him.</p>
          <p>Such is the plaintiff's own account of the transaction; and, in so <lb/>
            far as he criminates himself, it may be relied on as correct. He <lb/>
            admits his own collusion with Olympiodorus, but seeks to take <lb/>
            advantage of his own wrong, and to recover contribution from his <lb/>
            partner in fraud. In our country the rule " in pari delicto potior est <lb/>
            conditio possidentis" would prevail in such a case. As we do not <lb/>
            know whether the suit was successful, we must not too hastily con­ <lb/>
             <pb n="367"/>
            demn the Athenian court: but the moral sense of the court must <lb/>
            have been somewhat different from that of our courts, or the suit <lb/>
            could hardly have been commenced. The only comment that A. G. <lb/>
            Becker makes upon the case is as follows—“ This speech alone may <lb/>
            convince us, how insecure the possession of property was at Athens, <lb/>
            and how thoughtlessly and carelessly the jurors often gave their <lb/>
            verdicts upon the most important occasions."</p>
          <p>How far the Athenian jurors were disposed to favour plaintiffs, <lb/>
            and to encourage litigation, for the sake of the three obols which <lb/>
            were allowed to them for every sitting, it is not easy to say. <lb/>
            Aristophanes plainly enough insinuates this. Isocrates complains, <lb/>
            that the citizens stayed at home to sit in the law-courts, instead of <lb/>
            manning the ships of war. These writers belonged to the aristocratic <lb/>
            party. Their opponents contended that the juries were the bulwarks <lb/>
            of the constitution. The multitude were unquestionably tenacious <lb/>
            of their judicial power; but less, as I conceive, from any such sordid <lb/>
            motives, than from attachment to democracy as by law established. <lb/>
            If they were to employ their time in judicial duties, it was but <lb/>
            reasonable, at all events, that they should receive a small remu­ <lb/>
            neration.</p>
          <p>The attachment of the Athenian people to their jurisdiction is de­ <lb/>
            scribed with some truth, but with much asperity, by Xenophon, in his <lb/>
            treatise on the Republic, where he is speaking of the lawsuits of the <lb/>
            allies, which were sent to Athens for trial.1 It was the policy of the <lb/>
            Athenians, while they possessed the empire of the sea, to compel their <lb/>
            subjects in the Ægean islands to send their causes to be tried at <lb/>
            Athens. By this means, says Xenophon, great advantages accrued to <lb/>
            the imperial city. In the first place, the revenue was increased by <lb/>
            the payment of suitors' fees and harbour dues. Secondly, the influx <lb/>
            of strangers furnished employment for a great number of citizens. <lb/>
            But the chief advantage was this; that the Athenians, under colour <lb/>
            of a jurisdiction, really exercised a political power. They preserved <lb/>
            their ascendancy over the subject states, by favouring those parties <lb/>
            who were most active in promoting their interest. A foreign tribunal <lb/>
            might have done just the reverse; favoured the enemies, and sacrificed <lb/>
            the friends of Athens. Besides, if the allies had been suffered to have <lb/>
            domestic courts, the only class of Athenians, to whom they paid <lb/>
            respect, would have been the generals and ambassadors; the sovereign <lb/>
            people they would have disregarded. Being obliged to come to <lb/>
            Athens for justice, they found it necessary to court the populace, who <lb/>
            filled the judicial benches, and who loved nothing better than the <lb/>
            servile flattery of the suitors.</p>
          <p>Such is Xenophon's account of the matter. He indeed goes much <lb/>
            further. He asserts that any thing could be done at Athens for <lb/>
            money, either with the Council or with the people. He represents <note type="footnote"> (1) As to these, see <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δίκαι ὰπὶ συμβόλων</foreign> in the Archæological Dictionary. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="368"/>
            their corrupt practice as a well concerted scheme for the maintenance <lb/>
            of democracy. The people, he tells us, well knew the difference <lb/>
            betweeen good and bad, but preferred the latter, as being more con­ <lb/>
            ducive to their interests. Confiscation, plunder, and oppression were <lb/>
            according to him) essential to the existence of the constitution. He <lb/>
            denounces democracy itself, but praises the sagacity of the Athenians, <lb/>
            for contriving to keep up a set of abuses, which were a necessary part <lb/>
            of the machinery for carrying on the government. This however is <lb/>
            to write like a political enemy, not an historian. A scheme of esta­ <lb/>
            bushing popular supremacy upon the ruin of all that is great and good <lb/>
            never entered the head of any but the wildest fanatic; certainly, no <lb/>
            such scheme was deliberately acted on by the Athenians. If it had <lb/>
            been, the republic could not have lasted for ten years; whereas it <lb/>
            flourished for upwards of a century, and, during that period, men of <lb/>
            high reputation and ability presided from time to time in every depart­ <lb/>
            ment of public affairs.</p>
          <p>The same remarks apply to the censures of Isocrates.</p>
          <p>There is a passage in his oration on the Exchange of estates, where <lb/>
            he says: " When I was a boy, wealth was considered so secure and <lb/>
            honourable, that all men gave themselves out to be richer than they <lb/>
            really were. Now, to be wealthy is a crime, and a man must clear <lb/>
            himself of the charge, if he wishes to remain in safety." Isocrates <lb/>
            wrote this at the age of eighty-two; aud if the statement could be <lb/>
            relied on, it would mark the period of an important revolution in <lb/>
            Athenian affairs. It cannot however be relied upon. Isocrates was a <lb/>
            worthy man; but, when he wrote this oration, he was not in a very <lb/>
            good humour with the Athenian democracy.</p>
          <p>That property was pretty secure at Athens in the flourishing time <lb/>
            of the republic, is clear from the fact that many large fortunes were <lb/>
            amassed and enjoyed at Athens, that it was a great mart of commerce, <lb/>
            and selected as a favourite place of residence by a multitude of fo­ <lb/>
            reigners. Isocrates himself acquired considerable wealth, and lived <lb/>
            in the enjoyment of it to a great age.</p>
          <p>If justice was not well administered at Athens, it certainly was not <lb/>
            for lack of provision by the legislature, or attention to the subject of <lb/>
            jurisprudence. They had statutes in abundance, forms of action, <lb/>
            processes and pleadings, practice and rules of evidence. The speech- <lb/>
            writers and orators worked out a course of practice, which the philo­ <lb/>
            sopher afterwards analysed in his closet, and out of which he developed <lb/>
            his system of rhetoric, so far as it concerns judicial inquiry, just as <lb/>
            from Homer and the Attic tragedians he got materials for his Art of <lb/>
            Poetry. He gives us his definitions of crimes and offences, law and <lb/>
            equity, his methods of persuasion, proofs artificial and proofs unarti­ <lb/>
            ficial, rules as to style and elocution, divisions of speeches into argu­ <lb/>
            ment, exordia, perorations, &amp;c. &amp;c. I shall not trouble the reader <lb/>
            with any discussion upon these matters, partly because the Aristo­ <lb/>
             <pb n="369"/>
            celian language does not agree with that of modem times,' and partly <lb/>
            because I bear in mind the lines of Butler, <lb/>
            All a chetorician's rules <lb/>
            Teach us but to name our <unclear>too</unclear>.</p>
          <p>But let us stop for a few moments to consider how certain practical <lb/>
            points of evidence were dealt with by the Attic orators.</p>
          <p>With respect to their depreciation of direct testimonial evidence­ <lb/>
            this, as I have already intimated, arose partly from the low standard <lb/>
            of morality which prevailed. It was a topic resorted to by the party <lb/>
            who was not so well off for witnesses; for the orators comment <lb/>
            strongly enough upon the absence of testimony, where it suits their <lb/>
            purpose. (See examples ante, pages 139, 179.) But how patent is <lb/>
            the fallacy of making a general attack on witnesses. If you have <lb/>
            witnesses of your own, your disparaging observations apply to them <lb/>
            as well as to those of the adversary. If you have none, what do you <lb/>
            rely upon ? Your own assertions ? But why should they be believed <lb/>
            more than the adverse testimony P Or the circumstances of the case ? <lb/>
            But they are proved by witnesses. A document, it is said, cannot <lb/>
            he. No; not when it is proved to be a genuine document. But it <lb/>
            can only be proved to be so by human testimony.</p>
          <p>In the case of Apaturius, the defendant asserts that not he, but <lb/>
            Archippus. was the surety in certain articles of submission. The <lb/>
            articles, which had been in the custody of the plaintiff's friend, were <lb/>
            said to have been lost, and the defendant had reason to expect that <lb/>
            evidence would be given by the plaintiff to prove the contents He <lb/>
            himself had offered no direct evidence to prove that Archippus was <lb/>
            the surety; but he reasons in this way-" Perhaps the plaintiff <lb/>
            will call a witness against me; that's an easy course for persons who <lb/>
            mean to make out a false claim. It ought not to be allowed, as he <lb/>
            has lost the document. If I were suing the witness for false testi­ <lb/>
            mony, he would be obliged to produce the document: then he ought <lb/>
            to be obliged now." All this is absurdly fallacious reasoning. It <lb/>
            was a fair matter of observation, that the plaintiff's friend had lost <lb/>
            the document; and if the plaintiff's witness were contradicted by <lb/>
            good evidence on the other side, it ought perhaps to have turned the <lb/>
            scale; but there was nothing more in the point. (Ante, p. 168.)</p>
          <p>Let us consider what is so frequently urged by the orators with <lb/>
            reference to the evidence of slaves, and the refusal of the adverse <lb/>
            party to give up his slave to be examined by torture. As to the <note type="footnote"> (1) Aristotle's artificial proofs, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔντεχνοι</foreign>, are those which we prepare for <lb/>
            ourselves, such as arguments, inferences, prejudices excited by manner and style of <lb/>
            address, or by appealing to the passions. His unartificial proofs, or <foreign xml:lang="grc">πίστεις ἄτεχνοι</foreign> <lb/>
            are mostly what we call evidence. He enumerates five kinds, viz. laws, witnesses, <lb/>
            agreements, statements extracted by torture, and evidentiary oaths. (Rhetoric, 1.15.) </note><note type="footnote"> These verbal distinctions are not to be found in the orators. Demosthenes often <lb/>
            distinguishes <foreign xml:lang="grc">μαρτυρίαι</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">τεκμήρια</foreign>, the evidence of witnesses from that of circum­ <lb/>
            stances. Between <foreign xml:lang="grc">τεκμήρια</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὶκὐτα</foreign> there is strictly this difference: the former <lb/>
            are the evidentiary facts; the latter, the results which are obtained by combining <lb/>
            such facts together and reasoning upon them. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> B B </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="370"/>
            value of evidence extracted by torture, I shall have something to say <lb/>
            bv and by. To the honour of the Athenians it should be mentioned, <lb/>
            that this supposed test was not often resorted to; for the masters <lb/>
            very rarely gave up their slaves, when they were demanded But <lb/>
            the demand was commonly made, with a view to draw an inference <lb/>
            from the adversary's refusal, and so, in effect, to substitute assertion <lb/>
            or defective argument for evidence. Thus, a man, who wanted to <lb/>
            prove the contents of a lost agreement, demanded the examination of <lb/>
            a slave whom he alleged to have written it out. The master refused: <lb/>
            the challenging party commented upon the refusal, and argued that <lb/>
            the slave would have proved his case if the master had let him. His <lb/>
            mode of reasoning was in effect this—“I give no proof of my asser­ <lb/>
            tion, because I have none to give; I should have had proof, if the <lb/>
            slave had been questioned; but my opponent would not allow it; <lb/>
            therefore you must presume everything against him." This proof is <lb/>
            defective under any circumstances; but there is no kind of founda. <lb/>
            tion for it, unless it is shown that there was an agreement, that the <lb/>
            slave wrote it out, and that he was still living and might have been <lb/>
            examined. But it rather appears from a perusal of the Athenian <lb/>
            orators, that they were in the habit of using this sort of argument <lb/>
            without laying any foundation for it.</p>
          <p>Before I pass from this topic, I have a few words to say on the <lb/>
            subject of circumstantial evidence, upon which a good deal of mis­ <lb/>
            understanding has prevailed. We hear people say, how dangerous it I <lb/>
            is to convict on circumstantial evidence; and again we are often told. <lb/>
            that circumstantial evidence is more to be depended on than direct. <lb/>
            Let us see how the matter stands.</p>
          <p>Direct is that which applies itself immediately to the principal fact <lb/>
            in question; circumstantial applies itself mediately to the principal <lb/>
            fact, and immediately to some fact evidentiary of the principal. Thus, <lb/>
            if I say I saw the prisoner inflict the mortal wound on the deceased, <lb/>
            this is direct evidence of the murder. But if several witnesses are <lb/>
            called, one to prove that the prisoner bought the poison, one that he <lb/>
            mixed it in a glass, one that he gave the glass to the deceased to <lb/>
            drink, one that the deceased died soon afterwards; all this is circum­ <lb/>
            stantial evidence of the murder.</p>
          <p>Circumstantial evidence is in itself weaker than direct; for proof <lb/>
            of the evidentiary fact cannot be so convincing as proof of the fad <lb/>
            itself; but it often happens, owing to extrinsic causes, it is stronger.</p>
          <p>Thus, if I saw the prisoner stab the deceased to the heart, my evi­ <lb/>
            dence is stronger to prove the murder, than if I entered the room <lb/>
            and saw him standing over the deceased with the bloody knife in his <lb/>
            hand. But if various circumstances are proved against the prisoner <lb/>
            by different witnesses, as, that he had a quarrel with the deceased <lb/>
            that he had threatened to kill him, that he was in the same room <lb/>
            with him a short time before the murder, that he was seen short <lb/>
            after with marks of blood about his person, and that the knife wit <lb/>
             <pb n="371"/>
            which the murder was committed belonged to him ; all these circum­ <lb/>
            stances may be more convincing than my direct evidence, not because <lb/>
            the circumstances themselves are precisely equivalent to the fact <lb/>
            disclosed by me, but because they are better proved, the witnesses <lb/>
            being more numerous, and the chances of error or deceit fewer. If <lb/>
            three or four persons, instead of one, had witnessed the doing of the <lb/>
            deed, this might turn the scale in favour of the direct evidence; and <lb/>
            the same would be the result, if my evidence could be deemed per­ <lb/>
            fectly credible in all respects. Confession (the strongest evidence of <lb/>
            guilt) may be regarded as the direct testimony of one whom there is <lb/>
            the least cause to disbelieve.</p>
          <p>Wills, in his treatise on Circumstantial Evidence, defines it thus:</p>
          <p>" On a superficial view, direct and indirect, or circumstantial, would <lb/>
            appear to be distinct species of evidence; whereas these words denote <lb/>
            only the different modes in which those classes of evidentiary facts <lb/>
            operate to produce conviction. Circumstantial evidence is of a nature <lb/>
            identically the same with direct; the distinction is, that by direct <lb/>
            evidence is intended evidence which applies directly to the fact which <lb/>
            forms the subject of inquiry, the factum probandum; circumstantial is <lb/>
            equally direct in its nature, but, as its name imports, it is direct evidence <lb/>
            of a minor fact or facts, incidental to or usually connected with some <lb/>
            other fact as its accident, and from which such other fact is therefore <lb/>
            inferred. A witness deposes that he saw A. inflict on B. a wound, of <lb/>
            which he instantly died; this is a case of direct evidence. B. dies of <lb/>
            poisoning; A. is proved to have had malice against him and to have <lb/>
            purchased poison, wrapped in a particular paper; the paper is found <lb/>
            in a secret drawer, and the poison gone. The evidence of these facts <lb/>
            is direct; the facts themselves are indirect and circumstantial, as ap­ <lb/>
            plicable to the inquiry whether a murder has been committed, and <lb/>
            whether it was committed by A."</p>
          <p>The difference between affirmative and negative evidence is com­ <lb/>
            mented on by Demosthenes in his defence of the witness Phanus: <lb/>
            (ante, p. 130.) Aphobus had asked to have Milyas, a slave, examined. <lb/>
            Demosthenes contends that he could not have given material evidence. <lb/>
            " For”—says he—“ what could Aphobus most desire him to say ? <lb/>
            That he is not aware of his having any of the property P Suppose he <lb/>
            says so: does it follow that Aphobus has none? No; for I pro­ <lb/>
            duced witnesses, who spoke to the affirmative from their own know­ <lb/>
            ledge and eyesight. That some man knows something to be in his <lb/>
            possession, is material evidence; but, that some one does not know <lb/>
            it, is no evidence at all: there might be plenty of witnesses of that <lb/>
            sort."</p>
          <p>Here the reasoning of Demosthenes might be very good, as applied <lb/>
            to the case before him; but the proposition which he lays down is <lb/>
            an overstatement of the truth. The real question was, whether <lb/>
            M ilyas had an opportunity of knowing whether Aphobus had any of <lb/>
            the property. Mere ignorance, unaccompanied with other circum- <note type="footnote"> B B 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="372"/>
            stances, is undoubtedly no evidence at all. But where the negative <lb/>
            witness had an opportunity of learning whether the fact was so or <lb/>
            not, and where it is probable he would have known it if it was true, <lb/>
            his evidence is worth something; and, as you increase this probability, <lb/>
            in the same proportion you increase the value of his testimony. Thus, <lb/>
            Demosthenes calls a person who sailed in the ship, to prove that there <lb/>
            was no cargo of wine on board, and to contradict the adversary's <lb/>
            assertion that there was one: (ante, p. 196.) Here the negative <lb/>
            evidence might be almost, if not quite, as good as the affirmative.</p>
          <p>A man's own conduct may have been such, that negative evidence <lb/>
            throws great doubt upon, or even outweighs, his affirmative assertions. <lb/>
            For example; if a man declares that he was attacked and robbed or <lb/>
            his way home, but the members of his family declare, that he came <lb/>
            home the same evening and never spoke a word to them about the <lb/>
            matter, and no cause is shown for his silence, our belief in his asser. <lb/>
            tion might be considerably shaken.</p>
          <p>And sometimes a man's own acts are in the nature of negative <lb/>
            evidence, tending to invalidate his positive testimony: as, if he dt <lb/>
            mands a debt many years after it is alleged to have become due, and <lb/>
            has never made any demand for it in the interval, when it might have <lb/>
            been expected he would have done so: or, if he impeaches a transac­ <lb/>
            tion, which he never complained of at the time, having full knowledge <lb/>
            of the circumstances. Objections of this kind are frequently made <lb/>
            (See ante, pages 207, 212, 247, 274, 286, 288.)</p>
          <p>The necessity of evidence being relevant to the question is frequently <lb/>
            urged by Demosthenes: (see ante, pages 99, 127, 278, 280, 285.) <lb/>
            Yet he himself violates the rule, when it suits him, as do all the <lb/>
            orators; and indeed it was impossible to prevent them doing it <lb/>
            Even with us, though evidence irrelevant to the issue is not admissible, <lb/>
            it is difficult to restrain counsel in their speeches from travelling be­ <lb/>
            yond the question. The water-glass was some check upon the Athenian <lb/>
            speaker; but this was only when he had a good case, and could not <lb/>
            afford to waste his time.</p>
          <p>The relevancy, or the materiality, of evidence might become an <lb/>
            important question in the Athenian courts, upon a proceeding agains <lb/>
            the witness for false testimony. Of this an example is furnished in <lb/>
            the defence of Phanus: (see the Argument, ante, 120.) Aphobus sued <lb/>
            Phanus for having given evidence, that he had confessed Milyas to be <lb/>
            a freeman. The main question in the cause is, whether this evidence <lb/>
            was true or false. But we see that Demosthenes (in his speech foi <lb/>
            the defendant) does not confine himself to this question, but endea­ <lb/>
            vours to show that the evidence was immaterial to the decision of the <lb/>
            cause between Aphobus and himself. We are naturally tempted t&lt; <lb/>
            ask; was this a legitimate ground of defence P I have little doubt <lb/>
            that it was so. The plaintiff seeks to recover damages; he is bound <lb/>
            to show that the evidence of the defendant was injurious to him b <lb/>
            the influence which it had upon the verdict. But it is equally dec <lb/>
             <pb n="373"/>
            that, in order to raise this inference, very slight proof ought to be <lb/>
            required on the part of the plaintiff. The moment he shows, that the <lb/>
            defendant's evidence had even a remote bearing on the issue in <lb/>
            the cause, he raises a presumption that he influenced the verdict. To <lb/>
            rebut such presumption, the defendant ought to prove very clearly and <lb/>
            satisfactorily, that his evidence was not material. In the case before <lb/>
            us, the arguments of Demosthenes appear to me too weak to sustain <lb/>
            this ground of defence. He shows, that Phanus was called to prove <lb/>
            a collateral point only, and not one of the principal matters in the <lb/>
            cause. But may not the proof of a collateral point have an important <lb/>
            effect on the verdict ? Every link in the chain of evidence is impor­ <lb/>
            tant, though it does not connect itself immediately with the ultimate <lb/>
            question; and small and seemingly trifling matters often turn the <lb/>
            scale with the jury. The object of calling Phanus was, to overthrow <lb/>
            an argument of the adversary. Aphobus had demanded Milyas to be <lb/>
            given up for the torture, alleging that he could furnish evidence against <lb/>
            hismaster. Demosthenes refused to give him up, on the ground that he <lb/>
            was a freeman, and alleged that Aphobus knew and had confessed him to <lb/>
            be such. If Aphobus really knew this, the demand of Milyas and the <lb/>
            argument founded upon its refusal were vexatious and fraudulent, and <lb/>
            the proof of his confession might throw discredit upon his whole case. <lb/>
            The evidence therefore of Phanus, so far from being immaterial, might <lb/>
            have been (for aught that we can see) highly important to the issue. <lb/>
            The strong point for Demosthenes was, that this evidence was true; <lb/>
            but naturally enough he avails himself of every argument which the <lb/>
            practice of his country allowed. In the cause against Stephanus, <lb/>
            where Demosthenes was for the plaintiff, he condemns this line of <lb/>
            argument, and thus cautions the jury against it :</p>
          <p>" It would be a strange proceeding, when all had given false evi­ <lb/>
            dence, for each to prove who did the greatest injury, instead of show­ <lb/>
            ing his own evidence to be true. A witness ought not to get off by <lb/>
            showing another to be more guilty, but by proving the truth of his <lb/>
            own evidence."</p>
          <p>We may collect from these two speeches, that it was the practice <lb/>
            for all defendants in such actions to use the same argument; and <lb/>
            plaintiffs often gave them cause for it, by selecting for attack some of <lb/>
            the least important witnesses, while they took no measures against <lb/>
            the rest. We may observe also, that however difficult it might be <lb/>
            for a defendant, to show that his evidence was wholly immaterial, and <lb/>
            thus entitle himself to a verdict, it was extremely important, with a <lb/>
            view to reduction of damages, to prove the comparative insignificance <lb/>
            of the testimony complained of.</p>
          <p>How Demosthenes, in defending Phanus, was himself interested in the <lb/>
            result, appears from what I have said in Volume III. pages 344, 394.</p>
          <p>The Athenians were not without their precautionary rules to im­ <lb/>
            prove the quality of evidence, and guard against deception.</p>
          <p>The rule, that all testimony should be put in the shape of a depo. <lb/>
             <pb n="374"/>
            sition, though it could not fulfil all the exigencies of judicial inquiry, <lb/>
            was attended with some advantage. A deposition is less open to <lb/>
            mistake than oral testimony; and the witness is more careful, when <lb/>
            his evidence is in writing, because it furnishes an authentic record <lb/>
            against him upon an indictment for perjury; though oral testimony <lb/>
            has certainly more effect with a jury, for reasons which are obvious. <lb/>
            The attendance of the witness at Athens to confirm his deposition <lb/>
            had less effect, as he was not subject to cross-examination.</p>
          <p>The importance of producing documents, when they were in exist­ <lb/>
            ence, was understood by the Athenians, and is insisted upon by the <lb/>
            orators: (see ante, 103,113,169.) And certain things were required <lb/>
            to be in writing, as wills, mercantile contracts, and challenges. They <lb/>
            had no rules of primary and secondary evidence, or notices to produce.</p>
          <p>Hearsay evidence was inadmissible with them, as with us. To this <lb/>
            rule we allow certain exceptions, which are necessary to justice; as <lb/>
            dying declarations, statements of deceased members of the family in <lb/>
            pedigree cases, traditionary reputation upon questions of boundary <lb/>
            and other public rights. The Athenians allowed a still wider excep­ <lb/>
            tion, viz. the declarations of all deceased persons. They, like us, <lb/>
            permitted a hostile witness to be contradicted by proof that he had <lb/>
            made a different statement at another time; of which we have seen <lb/>
            an example in the case of Zenothemis.</p>
          <p>While the Athenians rejected hearsay evidence, they either did not, <lb/>
            or could not, prevent hearsay assertions by the speaker. Thus, De­ <lb/>
            mosthenes, in the speech against Aphobus, tells the jury what his <lb/>
            mother said about the contents of his father's will. And there are <lb/>
            plenty of other instances.</p>
          <p>The only case in which the attendance of the witness could be dis­ <lb/>
            pensed with was, when he was ill or out of the country. His evidence <lb/>
            then might be received by persons deputed for that purpose. In like <lb/>
            manner we send commissions to examine witnesses abroad.</p>
          <p>Testimony was generally given upon oath, but not always nor <lb/>
            necessarily, as it would seem,' though a friendly witness, who declined <lb/>
            to be sworn, would have less credit with the jury. The oath was <lb/>
            taken at an altar either in the magistrate's office, or in court; most <lb/>
            commonly in the former. What form of words they used, we know not.</p>
          <p>None but freemen could appear as witnesses: the rule excluded <lb/>
            women, minors, and slaves. There was no incompetency on the <lb/>
            ground of interest, nor for any kind of crime, unless it was followed <lb/>
            bydeprivation of the civic franchise. Disfranchised persons were <lb/>
            considered to be hostile to the state, and therefore not to be trusted. <lb/>
            We have seen how Demosthenes, in order to create a prejudice against <note type="footnote"> (1) Schomann takes this view. Platner confounds the oath of the witness with <lb/>
            the voluntary one of the party, which was of a more solemn kind. That an oath <lb/>
            was not indispensable to the giving of testimony, may be inferred from this, that an <lb/>
            absent witness was allowed to depose without any such test. And the form <foreign xml:lang="grc">μαρτ <lb/>
            η̄ ὲξομνύειν</foreign> seems to show, that the hostile witness was only required to swear, if he <lb/>
            adopted the latter alternative. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="375"/>
            Midias, produces in court a person, whose evidence he could not put <lb/>
            in, because Midias had by a trick caused him to be disfranchised. <lb/>
            (Volume III. page 97.)</p>
          <p>The parties could not give evidence for themselves, though they <lb/>
            were at liberty to state their own cases to the jury, and a clever <lb/>
            speaker, might perhaps obtain credence without being supported by <lb/>
            testimony. How far this operated in practice, we cannot say.</p>
          <p>The interrogatories put by one party to the other, the evidence of <lb/>
            slaves by torture, and the challenges to oaths, are subjects which, for <lb/>
            the sake of convenience, I have thrown into distinct chapters.</p>
          <p>Many ask—what need is there of any technical rules, or tests of <lb/>
            admissibility ? Why not allow all kinds of information to be received, <lb/>
            just as you would in the common affairs of life ? One kind of evi­ <lb/>
            dence is better than another; but why should any be excluded P</p>
          <p>It cannot be denied, that the observance of strict rules in the <lb/>
            examination of witnesses and the production of evidence leads often to <lb/>
            an exclusion of truth and a denial of justice. An irregular inquiry <lb/>
            will sometimes discover that which escapes the scrutiny of a regular <lb/>
            one. There is sometimes abundant moral persuasion of a fact, of <lb/>
            which there exists no legal proof. Many a prisoner has been acquitted <lb/>
            after a confession of his crime, because that confession was improperly <lb/>
            extorted and could not be given in evidence. An agreement, which <lb/>
            has been committed to writing, is capable of being proved by parol, <lb/>
            and perhaps by means equally satisfactory; yet this is not allowed, if <lb/>
            the writing might have been produced. A statement, which the <lb/>
            witness has received from one, in whose word he has good reason to <lb/>
            place implicit confidence, is not suffered to be repeated in a court of <lb/>
            law,because it is hearsay. These and the like inconveniences, the <lb/>
            necessary consequence of adhering to general rules, have led some <lb/>
            people to think that every species of proof ought to be admitted, the <lb/>
            judge or the jury being left to form their own estimate of its value. <lb/>
            On the other hand it has been urged in favour of rules of evidence, <lb/>
            that it is impossible to remove every impediment to the course of <lb/>
            judicial inquiry, without reposing in its managers a most dangerous <lb/>
            discretionary power; that there is a necessity of guarding as well <lb/>
            against the encroachment of the judge, as against the mental infirmity <lb/>
            of the jury; that men are but too ready to- jump to conclusions upon <lb/>
            slight and insufficient grounds; that a bench of twelve men, taken <lb/>
            not from the best educated portion of the community, may be very <lb/>
            useful for certain purposes, but that its utility would be impaired, if <lb/>
            it were too much exposed to the chances of error or the influence of <lb/>
            prejudice; further, that the administration of justice should not only <lb/>
            be pure, but generally believed to be so; and that nothing tends <lb/>
            more to secure public confidence, than a steady observance of rules <lb/>
            and principles, and a system of deliberate caution, throughout the <lb/>
            whole of the judicial proceedings. Another argument is, that a con­ <lb/>
            trary practice would lead to a loose and careless mode of transacting <lb/>
             <pb n="376"/>
            business; which would produce an infinity of misunderstandings and <lb/>
            disputes, and a vast increase of litigation. For example, written <lb/>
            instruments would be of comparatively small value, if proofs of an <lb/>
            inferior nature were generally admitted in their stead, or to contradict <lb/>
            or explain them. Those safeguards, with which a prudent man may <lb/>
            now effectually arm himself against the negligence and the dishonesty <lb/>
            of his neighbours, would then afford but a precarious protection; he <lb/>
            would still be exposed to the mercy of frail memories, conjecture, and <lb/>
            falsehood. In criminal trials a latitude of discretion would be still <lb/>
            more dangerous.</p>
          <p>The latter view of the question, to which for many centuries the <lb/>
            English law gave an undue prevalence, was thus expounded by <lb/>
            Starkie in his treatise on evidence :</p>
          <p>" The necessity for resorting to superior tests of the truth is founded <lb/>
            on an apprehension, that the evidence, on which an individual in ordi­ <lb/>
            nary transactions might safely rely,, could not without such tests be <lb/>
            safely relied on in judicial investigations. In the ordinary business <lb/>
            of life neither so many temptations, nor so many opportunities occur <lb/>
            for practising deceit, as in the course of judicial investigations, where <lb/>
            property, reputation, liberty, even life itself, are so frequently at stake. <lb/>
            In the common business of life each individual uses his own discretion <lb/>
            with whom he shall deal, and to whom he shall trust. He has not <lb/>
            only the sanction of general reputation and character for the confidence <lb/>
            which he reposes, but slight circumstances and even vague reports <lb/>
            are sufficient to awaken his suspicion, and place him on his guard; <lb/>
            and where doubt has been excited, he may suspend his judgment, till <lb/>
            by extended and repeated inquiries doubt is removed. In judicial <lb/>
            inquiry it is far otherwise. The character of a witness cannot easily <lb/>
            be subjected to minute investigation. The nature of the proceedings <lb/>
            usually excludes the benefit which might result from an extended and <lb/>
            protracted inquiry; and a jury are under the necessity of forming <lb/>
            their conclusions on a very limited and imperfect knowledge of the <lb/>
            witnesses, on whose testimony they are called upon to decide.</p>
          <p>" It has been justly observed, there is a tendency among mankind <lb/>
            to speak truth, for it is easier to speak truth than to invent. It is <lb/>
            equally apparent, the suspicion of mankind would usually depend on <lb/>
            their ordinary experience of human veracity. Hence jurors would be <lb/>
            inclined to repose a higher degree of confidence in ordinary testimony, <lb/>
            than would be due to it in the absence of peculiar guards against deceit; <lb/>
            for, as temptations to deceive by false evidence in judicial inquiries are <lb/>
            far greater than in the ordinary transactions of life, they would be apt to <lb/>
            place the same reliance on testimony offered to them as jurors which <lb/>
            they would in ordinary cases, and would therefore in many instances <lb/>
            overvalue it.</p>
          <p>" The law therefore wisely requires, that the evidence should be of <lb/>
            the purest and most satisfactory kind which the circumstances admit <lb/>
            of, and warranted by the most weighty and solemu sanctions."</p><pb n="377"/>
            
          <p>Notwithstanding these arguments, public opinion has gradually <lb/>
            undergone a change in this country, and in the course of the last <lb/>
            twenty years the rules of evidence have been considerably relaxed. <lb/>
            The principal reforms which have been introduced are these—Wit­ <lb/>
            nesses are no longer rendered incompetent by their interest in the <lb/>
            suit. The parties themselves may be examined as witnesses; and so <lb/>
            may their wives; except in a few cases. One other improvement <lb/>
            is much to be desired; viz. that a prisoner should be allowed to give <lb/>
            evidence for himself upon his own trial.</p>

            <title type="sub">INTERROGATORIES.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>IT has been stated, that in a cause at Athens either party was at <lb/>
            liberty to put questions to the other, and to insist upon having them <lb/>
            answered, both at the hearing before the magistrate and at the trial. <lb/>
            The answers given before the magistrate were taken down in writing, <lb/>
            and afterwards produced in evidence duly verified, if thought neces­ <lb/>
            sary. At the trial the questions were answered in the presence of <lb/>
            the jury ; they could only be put by the party who was addressing <lb/>
            the court; for no man was allowed to interrupt the speech of his <lb/>
            opponent. The jury however might at any time stop the speaker, <lb/>
            and cross-examine him, either on matter of fact or argument; and the <lb/>
            parties often .requested the jury to exercise this right, and suggested <lb/>
            the questions to be asked.</p>
          <p>The following is an example from Isœus, (De Hagniæ hereditate, <lb/>
            s.4.)</p>
          <p>The speaker calls up the guardian of the claimant, and desires him <lb/>
            to state now he makes out his pedigree, at the same time having the <lb/>
            law read, which pointed out the true course of inheritance : He pro­ <lb/>
            ceeds thus:</p>
          <p>" Now, as you are so clever at calumny and perversion of the laws, <lb/>
            get up here. Usher, read the law." [The law is read.] " Stop. Let <lb/>
            me ask you. Is the boy brother to Hagnias, or brother's son, or <lb/>
            sister's son ? Or is he a cousin, or son of a cousin by the father's or <lb/>
            the mother's side ? Which of these titles belongs to him, to which <lb/>
            the law gives the right of succession? Don't tell me that he is my <lb/>
            nephew: the question is not about my estate, for I am alive. If I <lb/>
            had been deceased without issue, and he was claiming my property, <lb/>
            it would have been proper to give that answer to the question. But <lb/>
            now you say, that a moiety of the estate of Hagnias belongs to the <lb/>
            boy. You must establish that by his descent he is heir to Hagnias. <lb/>
             <pb n="378"/>
            Show this to the jury—You see, that he can make out no relation­ <lb/>
            ship ; but his answers are anything rather than what you want to <lb/>
            hear."</p>
          <p>Such questioning was allowed at Athens in criminal as well as in <lb/>
            civil proceedings. Thus Dinarchus interrogates Demosthenes on his <lb/>
            trial for accepting the bribe of Harpalus :</p>
          <p>" Did you frame this decree, Demosthenes ? You did. You can't <lb/>
            deny it. Did the Council receive authority by your delegation ? It <lb/>
            did. Have any of our citizens been put to death ? They have. Was <lb/>
            your own decree put in force against them? It is impossible for <lb/>
            him to deny it."</p>
          <p>The reader is referred also to Andocides on the Mysteries, 101, <lb/>
            Edit. Bekker.</p>
          <p>Lysias, on the trial of Eratosthenes, one of the thirty tyrants, calls <lb/>
            him up and questions him:</p>
          <p>" Did you take Polemarchus to prison, or did you not ? ”</p>
          <p>” I obeyed the orders of the government, through fear."</p>
          <p>" Were you in the council-room, when the discussion about us took <lb/>
            place ?"</p>
          <p>" I was."</p>
          <p>“ Did you speak in favour of the motion for putting us to death, or <lb/>
            against it ? "</p>
          <p>“Against it."</p>
          <p>“To save our lives ? "</p>
          <p>“ Yes."</p>
          <p>“Thinking that we were unjustly treated ? "</p>
          <p>“ Yes."</p>
          <p>“Cruel man! you spoke to save my brother, and yet apprehended <lb/>
            him for execution ! "</p>
          <p>Shortly after he says to the jury: <lb/>
            " Eratosthenes must show one of two things, either that he did not <lb/>
            take him to prison, or that he took him lawfully. But he has con­ <lb/>
            fessed that he took him unlawfully; therefore your verdict becomes <lb/>
            an easy matter."</p>
          <p>The next example is also from Lysias. A corndealer is charged <lb/>
            with the offence, which in our language is termed engrossing, and con­ <lb/>
            sists in the buying up large quantities of provisions, especially corn, with <lb/>
            intent to resell them at a high price; against which, and the similar <lb/>
            offence of regretting, there used to be severe and absurd penalties, <lb/>
            now abolished. The prosecutor calls him up :</p>
          <p>" Tell me, are you a resident alien P "</p>
          <p>" Yes."</p>
          <p>" Do you reside with intention to obey the laws of the state, or to <lb/>
            do what vou please ? "</p>
          <p>" To obey the laws."</p>
          <p>" Ought you not to suffer death, if you do any illegal act for which <lb/>
            death is the punishment P "</p><pb n="379"/>
            
          <p>“ I ought."</p>
          <p>" Answer me now. Do you confess you bought up a greater quan­ <lb/>
            tity of corn than fifty bushels, which the law allows ? ”</p>
          <p>" I bought by order of the Archons."</p>
          <p>" Well, men of the jury; if he can show there is a law, which <lb/>
            requires corndealers to buy up the corn because the Archons order <lb/>
            them, acquit him. If he cannot show this, you are bound to convict <lb/>
            him; for I have produced you the law, which declares, that no person <lb/>
            in the city shall buy a greater quantity than fifty bushels."</p>
          <p>That the accused should be entitled to examine the prosecutor, <lb/>
            was of course highly just and proper, and would be allowed in all <lb/>
            courts where justice is decently administered.</p>
          <p>Socrates (in the defence written for him by Plato) avails himself <lb/>
            of this privilege, by putting a series of questions in his own peculiar <lb/>
            way to Melitus, the accuser. They are very amusing, but too long to <lb/>
            be quoted here. Aristotle refers to them in his chapter on interro­ <lb/>
            gatories : (Rhetoric, III. ] 8).</p>
          <p>In England there was formerly no interrogating of parties except <lb/>
            that of the defendant by the plaintiff in courts of equity; but now in <lb/>
            the courts of common law parties may examine one another, just as <lb/>
            they may give evidence for themselves. This does not extend to <lb/>
            criminal cases, in which the accused party can never be interrogated; <lb/>
            and even in a civil cause a witness may always object to answer a <lb/>
            question, if the answer would tend to cnminate himself. I expressed <lb/>
            an opinion in the last chapter, that parties accused of crime should <lb/>
            be permitted to give evidence for themselves as witnesses in their <lb/>
            trial. It must be understood, that I would not make this examina­ <lb/>
            tion compulsory. If they volunteer to give evidence, they would, as <lb/>
            a matter of course, subject themselves to cross-examination; which <lb/>
            men conscious of guilt would rarely do ; the result would be, that <lb/>
            the option of giving testimony would prove an advantage to the inno­ <lb/>
            cent, and a means of convicting the guilty. To shrink from the test, <lb/>
            would of itself be some indication of guilt; to undergo it would <lb/>
            generally lead to detection.</p>
          <p>Again-while I would never force a man by threats, or induce him <lb/>
            by promises, to criminate himself, I do not approve of the course which <lb/>
            is so often adopted, and which originated in a mistaken humanity, of <lb/>
            cautioning prisoners against saying anything to criminate themselves, <lb/>
            and encouraging them not to plead guilty, when they are disposed to <lb/>
            make confession. The discovery of truth is the chief thing to be <lb/>
            attained. Let it be attained by any fair means. Let no temptation <lb/>
            be held out one way or the other, either to confess or deny; but <lb/>
            don't let a man's mouth be stopped, when he is willing to make dis­ <lb/>
            closure of what he knows.</p>
          <p>The importauce of the subject induces me to annex the following, <lb/>
            written by myself in a weekly journal in March 1859:</p>
          <p>" A bill has been brought into the House of Lords by Lord <lb/>
             <pb n="380"/>
            Brougham, which, although it is likely to meet with some opposition, <lb/>
            will, we doubt not, in due time become the law of the land. It is a <lb/>
            bill to extend the Act of 1851, which enabled parties in civil cases <lb/>
            to give evidence, to criminal cases, so that the accused party may, if <lb/>
            he pleases, be examined as a witness. We consider that this change <lb/>
            is urgently required, both as a measure of justice to the accused, and <lb/>
            as an improvement in the administration of justice.</p>
          <p>" The accused has a right to demand it, on the simple principle that <lb/>
            every man is presumed to be innocent until he is proved to be guilty. <lb/>
            If he has a right to be examined in a civil cause, why not on a crimi­ <lb/>
            nal charge, when, by the hypothesis of the law itself, his character <lb/>
            and credibility are not destroyed? True, his evidence would be <lb/>
            open to some suspicion; it would be that of a strongly interested <lb/>
            party; this however is an argument against its weight, not against <lb/>
            its admissibility. Every interested witness is liable to the same ob­ <lb/>
            servation. If all testimony was to be rejected but that which is <lb/>
            wholly free from the suspicion of selfish motives, a very large propor­ <lb/>
            tion of the evidence, upon which courts of justice are in the habit of <lb/>
            acting from day to day, would be excluded from them. The incon­ <lb/>
            venience, or rather the injustice, of such a practice bad long been <lb/>
            apparent to lawyers, when Lord Denman's Act was passed, which <lb/>
            provided that the interest of a witness should be no ground of his <lb/>
            exclusion. This Act led naturally to the Act of 1851, above referred <lb/>
            to; and the measure now proposed is a just and necessary extension <lb/>
            of the same principle.</p>
          <p>" We contend for a positive right on the part of the accused, upon <lb/>
            general grounds, irrespective of any hardship existing in particular <lb/>
            eases. There are, however, many such cases of hardship. It often <lb/>
            happens that a trial which assumes a criminal form is reaHy nothing <lb/>
            more than a cause between party and party; and to give the prose­ <lb/>
            cutor the advantage of being heard upon his oath, while his adversary's <lb/>
            tongue is tied, is contrary to the first principles of justice. Charges <lb/>
            of perjury, conspiracy, false pretences, and many others, are examples <lb/>
            of what we mean; in which a man complaining of some fraud prac­ <lb/>
            tised upon him (perhaps after having failed in the assertion of his <lb/>
            right in the civil court) invokes the aid of a criminal tribunal to <lb/>
            punish the offender. For instance, a plaintiff in an action has lost <lb/>
            the verdict by the testimony of two witnesses. He indicts them for <lb/>
            a conspiracy. He and his witnesses are examined in support of the <lb/>
            charge; the testimony of the defendants is excluded. But the jury <lb/>
            on the former trial had heard them, and had believed them. Why <lb/>
            should not the second jury have the same opportunity of hearing and <lb/>
            believing ? Why should not the second trial be conducted in the same <lb/>
            manner as the first? Oh, because the first was a civil trial, and the <lb/>
            second is a criminal! As if the proper way to investigate truth were <lb/>
            not the same in both! According to our view of the matter, the <lb/>
            prosecutor in such a case abuses the process of the law, in order to <lb/>
             <pb n="381"/>
            obtain an unfair advantage; and the existing law of evidence favours <lb/>
            the manoeuvre.</p>
          <p>" So much tor the right of the accused party. But it is urged, that <lb/>
            the conferring of such right would be injurious to criminals, because <lb/>
            in every case where they declined to give evidence the jury would be <lb/>
            prejudiced against them, and they would lose that benefit of a doubt' <lb/>
            which, under the present system, turns the scale in their favour, <lb/>
            whenever there is some mystery in a case which has not been fully <lb/>
            cleared up. If the object of criminal trials were to mystify the judge <lb/>
            and jury, or to enable clever criminals to escape, or clever counsel to <lb/>
            help them in the attempt, we should assent to this argument; but, as <lb/>
            we consider that the administration of the criminal law has for its <lb/>
            object the elucidation of truth and the punishment of the guilty, we <lb/>
            utterly and strongly dissent from it. Let us see how the thing works.</p>
          <p>" Evidence is given against a prisoner, strong perhaps, but not <lb/>
            entirely free from doubt. The prisoner, or his counsel for him, says, <lb/>
            ' If I could give evidence, I could clear up the matter; I could give <lb/>
            a full explanation.' Then why shouldn't he ? The guilty man alone <lb/>
            gains by silence; and he is precisely the person who ought not to <lb/>
            gain. It may be said that the innocent has the ' benefit of the <lb/>
            doubt,' as well as the guilty; but then he doesn't want it; he would <lb/>
            rather give the explanation in open court, and have the opportunity <lb/>
            of fully clearing his character at once, than walk out of court under <lb/>
            the protection of ' the doubt.' Now let us take another case.</p>
          <p>" Strong evidence has been adduced; strong enough to convict the <lb/>
            prisoner, if believed. He has no means of refuting it but by giving <lb/>
            his own testimony. An innocent man will desire to do so. By a <lb/>
            plain unvarnished tale, he may give a totally different aspect to the <lb/>
            affair. He is subject to cross-examination; but this, in the con­ <lb/>
            sciousness of innocence, he does not dread. That he should have <lb/>
            the opportunity of telling his tale, is most important; and especially <lb/>
            in a case of strong circumstantial evidence, where perhaps the onlv <lb/>
            person who can explain the circumstances is the prisoner himself. <lb/>
            A guilty man would not benefit by the opportunity, even if he availed <lb/>
            himself of it; because he would shuffle, equivocate, prevaricate; his <lb/>
            tale itself, as well as his whole demeanour, would strengthen the case <lb/>
            against him; while, on the other hand, the honest man, answering <lb/>
            promptly and candidly to every question, would obtain a deserved <lb/>
            credence.</p>
          <p>" There is nothing, therefore, in the objection but this, that some <lb/>
            criminals shrinking from cross-examination, for fear the whole truth <lb/>
            should come out, would by their own act create a reasonable pre­ <lb/>
            judice against themselves; while others, taking the desperate chance <lb/>
            (as they now frequently do) of saving themselves by an artful tale, <lb/>
            would generally, by subjecting themselves to cross-examination, <lb/>
            ensure their conviction. We can only say that these are results by <lb/>
            no means to be deprecated.</p><pb n="382"/>
            
          <p>" Lord Campbell said, the refusal of a prisoner to be examined would <lb/>
            be taken as a confession of guilt, and the jury would always in such <lb/>
            a case find a verdict against him. This would not be so. A sufficient <lb/>
            amount of evidence would be required for conviction then, as it is <lb/>
            now; and, whenever the evidence was not sufficiently strong, it would <lb/>
            be the duty of the judge to direct an acquittal. But, when there is <lb/>
            enough legal evidence to convict, we can see no reason for giving the <lb/>
            accused the benefit of a doubt, which he himself has the power to <lb/>
            clear up. The principle applies, of course, to every kind of charge, <lb/>
            the more serious as well as the less serious; and when Lord Campbell <lb/>
            urges as an argument against the bill, that it would extend to high­ <lb/>
            treason, he is only putting an extreme case, which does not alter the <lb/>
            general question.</p>
          <p>" It was objected that the proposed law was un-English, and bor­ <lb/>
            rowed from the French system. This sort of talk is often resorted <lb/>
            to, for lack of more solid argument. If a thing be good, it is none <lb/>
            the worse for being borrowed from the French; and if bad, it is not <lb/>
            to be recommended by any example or any length of usage. The <lb/>
            present bill, however, does not adopt the French system. In France <lb/>
            the examination of the accused is compulsory. Lord Brougham <lb/>
            proposes that it should be optional with him to give evidence or not, <lb/>
            the same as in a civil cause.</p>
          <p>" The English people have been slow to adopt changes in the law. <lb/>
            So many absurdities have been tolerated for centuries, that we look <lb/>
            upon the antiquity of a practice as a very slender recommendation <lb/>
            for its continuance. It was not until the reign of William IV. that <lb/>
            a person charged with felony was allowed to be heard by counsel. <lb/>
            Since that time many important amendments have been made in the <lb/>
            criminal law; and we trust that they will speedily be followed by <lb/>
            this equally beneficial one, which Lord Brougham has just intro­ <lb/>

          <p>Or the challenges to examine slaves at Athens, and the practice in <lb/>
            relation thereto, enough has already been said. (See Volume III. <lb/>
            Appendix IX. page 382, and this Volume, ante, pages 237, 369.) It <lb/>
            is a remarkable thing, that, while all the orators agree in asserting, <lb/>
            that torture was an infallible test of the truth, and that it was <lb/>
            generally admitted to be far superior to that of ordinary testimony, <lb/>
            yet the slaves were hardly ever given up to the question. This is to <lb/>
            be attributed partly (no doubt) to the humanity of the Athenians, <lb/>
             <pb n="383"/>
            and partly (I cannot help thinking) to a secret disbelief in the efficacy <lb/>
            of the test. Did a man never offer his slave for examination, except <lb/>
            when he was sure that he would give evidence in his own favour P <lb/>
            Did a man never demand the adversary's slave, except when there <lb/>
            was no risk that he would favour his master ? The thing is some­ <lb/>
            what strange. All the arguments turn upon the refusal to give up a <lb/>
            slave. Why have we no example of conflicting comments by the <lb/>
            Attic speakers upon the answers extracted from slaves ?</p>
          <p>Cicero, in the Oratoriœ Partitiones (34), advises how, when evi­ <lb/>
            dence taken by torture is put in, the topic should be handled by the <lb/>
            party who produces it. Before I quote his words, let me observe, <lb/>
            that he misstates the practice of the Athenians, who never applied <lb/>
            the torture to freemen, to extract testimony from them in the ordi­ <lb/>
            nary course of law, but only on extraordinary occasions, to extort <lb/>
            confession from persons charged with some high misdemeanour, or <lb/>
            by way of punishment upon conviction.</p>

          <p>In the early history of the Romans we find no traces of the <lb/>
            torture: it was introduced during the republic, but was applied to <lb/>
            slaves and foreigners only, upon charges of murder and personal <lb/>
            violence. Slaves could not be tortured to prove charges against <lb/>
            their masters, except in the case of incest (mentioned by Cicero), <lb/>
            which was a crime against the Gods, or in such an extraordinary case <lb/>
            as that of the Catilinarian conspiracy. Under the empire the use of <lb/>
            torture was extended, and applied to freemen in cases of treason, <lb/>
            though only to freemen of low degree: and thus the civil law ex­ <lb/>
            presses it—“ milites, nobiles, senatores, decuriones, horumque liberi, <lb/>
            non aunt torquendi." Cicero, notwithstanding what he says in the <lb/>
            passage above quoted, speaks differently of the torture, Pro Sullâ, <lb/>
            28 ; there he argues upon its fallacy and uncertainty—“ Quæstiones <lb/>
            nobis servorum ac tormenta accusator minitatur: in quibus quanquam <lb/>
            nihil periculi suspicamur; tamen ilia tormenta gubernat dolor, mo­ <lb/>
            deratur natura cujusque turn animi, turn corporis; regit quæsitor, <lb/>
            flectit libido, corrumpit spes, infirmat metus, ut in tot rerum angus­ <lb/>
            tiis nihil veritati loci relinquatur. Vita Sullæ torqueatur: ex ea <lb/>
            quæratur, num quæ occultetur libido, num quod lateat facinus—Nul. <lb/>
             <pb n="384"/>
            lum in hâc causa testem timemus: nihil quenquam scire, nihil vidisse, <lb/>
            nihil audisse, arbitramur." Even the civil law, which authorises and <lb/>
            directs the application of judicial torture, speaks of it doubtfully as a <lb/>
            means of discovering truth. " Evidence obtained by torture "-says <lb/>
            the Digest, lib. 48, tit. 18—“is to be received with caution; it is <lb/>
            not always to be trusted, nor is it always to be disbelieved ; it is at <lb/>
            best but a deceitful and dangerous instrument, and very often fails to <lb/>
            elicit the truth; for many persons are gifted with such a patience or <lb/>
            power of enduring torments, that the truth cannot by this means be <lb/>
            I pressed out from them, while in others there is such a faintness of <lb/>
            heart, that they will tell any kind of falsehood rather than undergo <lb/>
            the torture; and thus it often happens, that the latter kind of per­ <lb/>
            sons will, from dread of pain, tell all manner of fables, not only <lb/>
            falsely accusing themselves, but bringing other innocent persons into <lb/>
            suspicion and danger." The commentators upon the civil law in <lb/>
            various countries have spoken of it in similar terms.</p>
          <p>To show how inefficient it is as a means for the attainment of <lb/>
            truth, numerous authentic instances are recorded, both in ancient and <lb/>
            modern times, of false accusations and false confessions made under <lb/>
            torture. Tacitus relates, that when Octavia, the wife of Nero, was <lb/>
            falsely charged by a concubine of the emperor with adultery, her <lb/>
            female attendants were put to the torture, and some of them, over­ <lb/>
            come by pain, allowed the truth of the charge, while the majority <lb/>
            persisted in maintaining the chastity of their mistress. (Annal. XIV. <lb/>
            60.) Heineccius mentions a remarkable instance of a German soldier, <lb/>
            charged with robbing his officer, who was repeatedly tortured, in <lb/>
            order to discover what had become of the stolen property, and who <lb/>
            under torture accused himself and others of many crimes, and even <lb/>
            murders, which had never been committed. (Exercitatio de He­ <lb/>
            ligione judicantium circa reorum confessiones.) Shortly before the <lb/>
            French Revolution the Parliament of Paris suspended two judges, <lb/>
            who had ordered the execution of a man for the alleged murder of a <lb/>
            woman, proved only by his own confession under torture; the woman <lb/>
            being found alive after the execution of the supposed murderer.</p>
          <p>Rushworth tells us in his Collections (I. 638), that when Felton, <lb/>
            who stabbed the Duke of Buckingham, was brought before the <lb/>
            Council, he confessed the murder, and was then urged to confess <lb/>
            who had set him on to do it, and he was asked whether the Puritans <lb/>
            had not had a hand in it. He denied this, and declared to the last <lb/>
            that he had no accomplice, and that he had revealed his intention to <lb/>
            no man living. Bishop Laud, who was at the Council-table, told him, <lb/>
            if he would not confess, he must go to the rack. Felton replied: <lb/>
            "if it must be so, he could not tell whom he might nominate in the <lb/>
            extremity of torture, and, if what he should then say must go for <lb/>
            truth, he could not tell whether his lordship (meaning the Bishop of <lb/>
            London), or which of their lordships he might name, for torture <lb/>
            might draw unexpected things from him.” He was not put to the <lb/>
             <pb n="385"/>
            torture; for it appeared there were no grounds for supposing that he <lb/>
            had any confederates.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding the cruelty of the practice—notwithstanding that <lb/>
            it has been disapproved and condemned by all enlightened men in <lb/>
            Christian countries, and by many even in ancient times-history tells <lb/>
            the melancholy tale, that torture has been used as a means of ex­ <lb/>
            torting evidence and confession in all ages, and has not been wholly <lb/>
            discontinued in Europe until the present century.</p>
          <p>Jardine in his Reading "On the use of torture in the criminal law <lb/>
            of England," has shown by extracts from the Council books, that in <lb/>
            the reigns of the Tudor family and the two first of the Stuarts torture <lb/>
            was constantly used in the investigation of offences, at the discretion <lb/>
            of the Sovereign and the Privy Council; nor was it confined to State <lb/>
            offences, or those pertaining to religion, but was applied also to <lb/>
            ordinary crimes, such as murder, robbery, embezzlement, &amp;c., and no <lb/>
            question was ever made of its legality. It is true, that the applica­ <lb/>
            tion of torture either to criminals or witnesses was contrary to the <lb/>
            common law of this country; so it is expressly laid down by For­ <lb/>
            tescue, Coke, and many other distinguished jurists; and Grotius in <lb/>
            one of his Epistles cites England as an example of a country, <lb/>
            " where people might live in safety under the laws without the use of <lb/>
            torture." But it is not less true, that torture, though opposed to <lb/>
            the genius and principles of our common law, and indeed expressly <lb/>
            contrary to Magna Charta, was a practice adopted and exercised by <lb/>
            regal authority, and was handed down by a course of precedents as <lb/>
            an unquestionable prerogative of the Crown.</p>
          <p>It appears to have been most commonly applied to accused parties, <lb/>
            with a view to extort confession of guilt and disclosure of accom­ <lb/>
            plices; but sometimes also it was applied to innocent persons, <lb/>
            suspected of having a knowledge of the guilt of others; as when the <lb/>
            Duke of Norfolk was accused of conspiring with the Queen of Scots, <lb/>
            a warrant was issued to Sir Thomas Smith and Dr. Wilson, a Master <lb/>
            of Requests, commanding them to examine Barker and Bannister, <lb/>
            servants of the Duke, " and, if they should not confess plainly their <lb/>
            knowledge, to cause them to be brought to the rack; and, if they <lb/>
            still refused to confess the truth, then to cause them to be put to <lb/>
            the rack, and to find the taste thereof until they should deal more <lb/>
            plainly." This warrant was under the Queen's signet, and in the <lb/>
            handwriting of Lord Burleigh. Sir Thomas Smith, who was himself <lb/>
            averse to torture, writes to Lord Burleigh in answer-" To-morrow <lb/>
            we'intend to bring a couple of them to the rack, not in any hope to <lb/>
            get anything worthy that pain or fear, but because it is so earnestly <lb/>
            commanded to us."</p>
          <p>Hume in his History of England (V. 457), notices this cruel <lb/>
            exertion of prerogative in Elizabeth's reign, not only by her own <lb/>
            Privy Council, but by the Council in the Marches of Wales, who <lb/>
            were empowered bv their commission to use torture whenever they <note type="footnote"> VOL. IT. </note> <note type="footnote"> c c </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="386"/>
            thought proper. (Compare Hallam's Constitutional History, L 201, <lb/>
            204. II. 11.)</p>
          <p>Sherwood, a Catholic, committed in 1577 by the Ecclesiastical <lb/>
            Commissioners for hearing a mass, had made a confession which was <lb/>
            construed to imply that the Queen, as a heretic, had no title to the <lb/>
            crown. The Attorney-General was directed to examine him, and <lb/>
            draw from him the names of other persons who held similar doctrines, <lb/>
            and from whom he had got his belief; and the Lieutenant of the <lb/>
            Tower was ordered to place him in the Dungeon among the rats, "if <lb/>
            he did not name them willingly." This " Dungeon among the rats," <lb/>
            was a cell in the Tower below high-water mark, totally dark, and <lb/>
            into which, as the tide flowed up, innumerable rats, that infested the <lb/>
            muddy banks of the Thames, were driven through the orifices of the <lb/>
            walls. Instances are related of prisoners, from whose arms and legs <lb/>
            the flesh had been torn during sleep by the voracity of those animus. <lb/>
            Sherwood's courage having withstood the horrors of this dungeon, a <lb/>
            warrant was issued authorising the Lieutenant of the Tower, the <lb/>
            Attorney-General, the Solicitor- General, and the Recorder, " to assay <lb/>
            him at the rack." This failing to shake his constancy, he was sent to <lb/>
            be executed for high treason.</p>
          <p>In the reign of Henry the Eighth Sir William Skevington, a lieu­ <lb/>
            tenant of the Tower, immortalised himself by the invention of a new <lb/>
            engine of torture, called Skevington's irons, afterwards known by <lb/>
            the name of Skevington's daughters, and corrupted into " the Scaven­ <lb/>
            ger's daughter.” We are not (it seems) to confound this with a <lb/>
            rack which, Coke tells us, was brought into the Tower in the reign <lb/>
            of Henry VI. and called the Duke of Exeter's daughter. (III. Insti. <lb/>
            tute, 35.) The former is thus described, and its operations distin­ <lb/>
            guished from that of the rack, in Tanner's History of the Jesuits; <lb/>
            cited bv Jardine:</p>
          <p>“Praecipuum torture post equuleum Anglis species est, Filia <lb/>
            Scavenger! dicta, priori omnino opposita. Cum enim ille membra, <lb/>
            alligatis extractisque in diversa manuum pedumque articulis, ab <lb/>
            invicem distrahat; hæc e contra violenter in unum veluti globum <lb/>
            colligat et constipat. Trifarium hie corpus complieatur, craribus ad <lb/>
            femora, femoribus ad ventrem appressis, atque ita arcubus ferreis <lb/>
            duobus includitur, quorum extrema dum ad se invicem labore <lb/>
            carnificum in circulum coguntur, corpus interim miseri inclusum <lb/>
            informi compressione pene eliditur. Immane prorsus et dirius <lb/>
            equuleo cruciamentum; cujus immanitate corpus totum ita arcta­ <lb/>
            tur, ut aliis ex eo sanguis extremis manibus et pedibus exudet, <lb/>
            aliis, ruptâ pectoris crate, copiosus e naribus faucibusque sanguis <lb/>
            effundatur."</p>
          <p>This engine is noticed in the Journal of the House of Commons of <lb/>
            14th May, 1604. A committee had been appointed to inquire into <lb/>
            the state of a dungeon in the Tower called “ Little Ease;" and they <lb/>
            reported that this engine, called " Skevington's Daughters,'* was <lb/>
             <pb n="387"/>
            found in Little Ease, and that the place itself was very loathsome <lb/>
            and unclean.</p>
          <p>Another English instrument of torture was called " the manacles," <lb/>
            which was used in Bridewell, and is mentioned in a warrant of <lb/>
            Council, " to examine Euatace White, a seminary priest, and Brian <lb/>
            Lassy, a distributor of letters to papists, and, if they refuse to answer <lb/>
            directly, to put them to the manacles, and such other tortures as are <lb/>
            used in Bridewell." After this it became in common use. It seems <lb/>
            to have operated by compressing the neck towards the feet. Jardine <lb/>
            thinks that Shakspeare alludes to it in the Tempest, Act I. Be. 2- <lb/>
            He's a traitor: <lb/>
            I'll manacle thy neck and feet together.</p>
          <p>The case which 1 am about to mention affords proof, that the <lb/>
            Privy Council assumed an authority to award compensation, where a <lb/>
            person had been put to the torture upon a false charge. We have <lb/>
            seen (ante, p. 238,) that at Athens the <foreign xml:lang="grc">βασανιστὴς</foreign>, or questioner, <lb/>
            was sometimes by special agreement empowered to estimate the <lb/>
            damage which the master might sustain by the questioning of his <lb/>
            slave. This may have operated in some measure to check the use of <lb/>
            torture, and to mitigate its cruelty. That the occasional awarding <lb/>
            of compensation, where the torture failed to establish guilt, would <lb/>
            check the practice as it was carried on in England, can hardly be for <lb/>
            a moment supposed.</p>
          <p>One William Monke was charged in 1626 with treasonable con­ <lb/>
            duct, and put to the torture. The warrant was directed to the Lieu­ <lb/>
            tenant of the Tower, a serjeant-at-law, and two clerks of the Council, <lb/>
            authorising them to examine him, and " to use the manacles to him if , <lb/>
            in their discretion they should think it fit." It appears that nothing <lb/>
            was proved against him; but in the following year he presented a <lb/>
            petition to the Lords of the Council, of which there is a record in <lb/>
            the Council register, stating—“that he by the malicious practice and <lb/>
            accusation, tending to high treason, of one John Blackburn and his <lb/>
            wife, had been imprisoned in the Tower of London, and there tor­ <lb/>
            tured upon the rack, and had been thereby utterly disabled to main­ <lb/>
            tain himself, his wife and nine children depending on his labour­ <lb/>
            that the same being discovered, the petitioner had been set at liberty, <lb/>
            and a warrant granted from the Board for the apprehending of the <lb/>
            b8id accusers, who, out of a conscience of their guilt, were fled and <lb/>
            could not be found—that the said accuser, John Blackburn, was <lb/>
            possessed of lands and other profits, out of which the petitioner <lb/>
            humbly sought to be relieved." It goes on to state that the Lords <lb/>
            of the Council, in consideration of the petitioners sufferings and <lb/>
            distressed state, and to the end that he might have some meaus and <lb/>
            relief assigned to him out of the said John Blackburn's estate, <lb/>
            directed an inquiry to be made as to the situation and extent of the <lb/>
            property alleged to belong to him, and then assigned a part of it to <lb/>
            the petitioner by way of compensation. <note type="footnote"> c o3 </note> <pb n="388"/>
             </p>
          <p>Dr. Abbott, a chaplain of James I, afterwards Bishop of Salisbury, <lb/>
            who wrote a tract to prove Father Gamet's connexion with the <lb/>
            Gunpowder Plot, describes it as being the common course with the <lb/>
            Commissioners appointed to inquire into State offences to use tor­ <lb/>
            ture—“ speciales delegati confessiones scelerum vel interrogatis <lb/>
            eliciunt, vel argumentis et testimoniis evincunt, vel, ubi opus est, <lb/>
            tormentis exprimunt.” In the investigation of the Gunpowder <lb/>
            Plot itself there is some uncertainty how far the torture was used; <lb/>
            though it appears that a warrant was issued in the king's own hand, <lb/>
            authorising the Commissioners to examine Fawkes upon the rack, <lb/>
            " using the gentler tortures first, et sic per gradus ad ima tenditur." <lb/>
            Catholic writers assert that many of the witnesses in this affair were <lb/>
            put to the question; and a dreadful case is related of Nicholas Owen, <lb/>
            a confidential servant of Father Garnet, who was examined in the <lb/>
            Tower, and at first denied all knowledge of his master; this being a <lb/>
            manifest falsehood, he was brought up again, and one of the king's <lb/>
            gentler species of torture was applied to him; his thumbs were tied <lb/>
            together, and he was suspended by them from a beam, while the <lb/>
            questions were repeated. He then confessed his knowledge of <lb/>
            Garnet and his attendance upon him, but insisted that he had nothing <lb/>
            more to disclose, upon which he was threatened with the rack on the <lb/>
            following day: in the meantime he contrived to get a knife, and <lb/>
            ripped open his belly. (Jardine, page 47.)</p>
          <p>The last recorded instance of the application of torture in England <lb/>
            is the case of one Archer, a glover, supposed to have been concerned <lb/>
            in a tumultuous attack upon Archbishop Laud's palace at Lambeth. <lb/>
            He was racked in the Tower, to make him confess his accomplices. <lb/>
            The warrant for his examination was given under the king's signet, <lb/>
            addressed to the Lieutenant of the Tower, directing him, in con­ <lb/>
            junction with two king's serjeants, to take the prisoner to the rack, <lb/>
            and “ if upon sight of the rack he does not make a clear confession, <lb/>
            to cause him to be racked as in their discretions shall be thought <lb/>
            fit."</p>
          <p>To the use of torture by royal prerogative the Commonwealth put <lb/>
            a final termination in England. Torture however continued to be <lb/>
            used in Scotland, partly under the authority of the civil law, which <lb/>
            then prevailed, and partly as an irregular and occasional practice. <lb/>
            (See Hume, VII. 55. Burnet, I. 212.) The thumb-screw, the boot, <lb/>
            and other such instruments, were employed against the Covenanters <lb/>
            during the days of terror in the reign of Charles II, which have been <lb/>
            rendered familiar to us by the romance of Sir Walter Scott. After <lb/>
            the Union however such things were put an end to. The 7th Anne, <lb/>
            c. 21, s. 5, enacts: " that no person accused of any capital offence or <lb/>
            other crime in Scotland shall suffer or be subject or liable to any <lb/>
            torture: provided that this act shall not extend to take away that <lb/>
            judgment which is given in England against persons indicted or <lb/>
            felony, who shall refuse to plead or decline triaL</p><pb n="389"/>
            
          <p>The judgment referred to in the last proviso was the peine forte el <lb/>
            dure, a species of torture of an exceptional nature certainly, yet <lb/>
            prescribed, not by the royal prerogative, but by the ordinary law of <lb/>
            England. It was a judgment pronounced against a prisoner who, on <lb/>
            an arraignment for felony, stood mute and refused to plead, and was <lb/>
            in the terms following:</p>
          <p>" That the prisoner should be remanded to prison, put in a low <lb/>
            and dark chamber, and laid naked on his back; that there should be <lb/>
            placed on his body as great a weight of iron as he could bear, and <lb/>
            more; that he should have no sustenance, save only on the first day <lb/>
            three morsels of the worst bread, and on the second day three <lb/>
            draughts of standing water that should be nearest to the prison door; <lb/>
            and in this situation that such should be his daily diet till he died."</p>
          <p>Blackstone distinguishes this extraordinary penance from the rack <lb/>
            or question, because (says he) " this was only used to compel a man <lb/>
            to put himself upon his trial, that was a species of trial in itself." <lb/>
            And he excuses it in some measure by saYIng, that " it was a judg­ <lb/>
            ment purposely ordained to be exquisitely severe, that by that very <lb/>
            means it might be rarely put in execution." (Commentaries, IV. <lb/>
            325.) Upon this there is an interesting note by Christian; which I <lb/>
            need not apologise for quoting:</p>
          <p>" Aulus Gelhus with more truth has made the same observation <lb/>
            upon the cruel law of the Twelve Tables, Be inope debitore secando : <lb/>
            ‘ eo consilio tanta immanitas pœnæ denunciata est, ne ad earn unquam <lb/>
            perveniretur:' for he adds: ' dissectum esse antiquitus nemmem <lb/>
            equidem neque legi neque audivi.' But with respect to the horrid <lb/>
            judgment of the peine forte et dare, the court could exercise no dis­ <lb/>
            cretion, and show no favour to a prisoner who stood obstinately mute. <lb/>
            And in the legal history of this country there are numerous instances <lb/>
            of persons, who have had resolution and patience to undergo so ter­ <lb/>
            rible a death, in order to benefit their heirs by preventing a forfeiture <lb/>
            of their estates, which would have been the consequence of a convic­ <lb/>
            tion by verdict. There is a memorable story of an ancestor of an <lb/>
            ancient family in the north of England. In a fit of jealousy he killed <lb/>
            his wife, and put to death his children who were at home, by throw­ <lb/>
            ing them from the battlements of his castle; and proceeding with an <lb/>
            intent to destroy his only remaining child, an infant nursed at a farm- <lb/>
            house at some distance, he was intercepted by a storm of thunder and <lb/>
            lightning. This awakened in his breast the compunctions of con­ <lb/>
            science. He desisted from his purpose, and, having surrendered <lb/>
            himself to justice, in order to secure his estate to this child, he had <lb/>
            the resolution to die under the dreadful judgment of peine forte et <lb/>
            dure.”</p>
          <p>This horrid practice continued to be a disgrace to our law till the <lb/>
            twelfth year of the reign of George III, when it was enacted, that a <lb/>
            person arraigned of felony, who stood mute, should be convicted of <lb/>
            the offence charged. It is evident, that the more humane and just <lb/>
             <pb n="390"/>
            course was, to construe the silence of the accused as a plea of not <lb/>
            guilty, rather than a confession : and at length this view was adopted, <lb/>
            and the 7th and 8th George IV, c. 28, directs that, when the prisoner <lb/>
            stands mute of malice, or will not directly answer to the charge, a <lb/>
            plea of not guilty may be entered for him by order of the court.</p>
          <p>That the practice of using torture in England was derived from the <lb/>
            civil law, appears not only from the absence of any sanction by the <lb/>
            common law, but from several other circumstances-as, from the <lb/>
            appointment of a Master of Requests, who was a civilian, to be <lb/>
            present at the examination-from the recital in the earlier warrants <lb/>
            of the " vehement suspicion " of guilt, which was originally considered <lb/>
            necessary, and which corresponds to the indicia torturœ, amounting <lb/>
            to the semiplena probatio, required by the civil law-also from the <lb/>
            custom of bringing the party to the rack, to put him in fear of it, <lb/>
            before it was applied, the same distinction which existed between the <lb/>
            territio and tortura of the civilians. It is further to be observed that <lb/>
            there is no instance in our country of the application of torture to <lb/>
            persons of noble blood, which agrees with the Roman law. Sir <lb/>
            Edward Coke reports it to have been agreed in the Countess of <lb/>
            Shrewsbury's case, that " it was a privilege which the law gives for <lb/>
            the honour and reverence of the nobility, that their bodies are not <lb/>
            subject to torture in causá criminis lœsœ majestatis.” (12 Reports, <lb/>
            96.)</p>
          <p>It should be mentioned in justice to the civil law, and to those <lb/>
            who administered it, that the torture was resorted to by them not in <lb/>
            any spirit of inhumanity, but from an overabundant anxiety to obtain <lb/>
            sufficient evidence in capital charges, and a distrust in ordinary testi­ <lb/>
            mony, unless it were well confirmed, not very dissimilar to that <lb/>
            which the Attic orators represent to have been the feeling of their <lb/>
            countrymen. Nor was the exercise of this dangerous power left to <lb/>
            the arbitrary discretion of the judges and magistrates under the <lb/>
            Roman law; but they were bound by the letter of their code to use <lb/>
            it with certain limitations, and under definite rules: they could only <lb/>
            apply the torture on their individual responsibility: if they used it <lb/>
            improperly, or on an occasion which did not justify its application, <lb/>
            the offence was capital by the letter of the law, and they were liable <lb/>
            to make full compensation to the injured party. In England, on the <lb/>
            other hand, its use was arbitrary and unrestricted, for the very reason <lb/>
            that it was not sanctioned by the law of the country. There was no <lb/>
            rule of law to guide those who applied it, nothing but the will of the <lb/>
            crown, which was superior to law, and which transfused its spirit <lb/>
            into the minds of those who executed its warrants.</p>
          <p>Blackstone, who draws a contrast between the English and the <lb/>
            Roman law to the advantage of the former, but says very little of the <lb/>
            superseding of law in England by royal prerogative, observes in rela­ <lb/>
            tion to the use of torture: "it seems astonishing that this usage <lb/>
            should be said to arise from a tenderness to the lives of men; and <lb/>
             <pb n="391"/>
            yet this is the reason given for its introduction in the civil law, and <lb/>
            its subsequent adoption by the foreign nations; viz. because the laws­ <lb/>
            cannot endure that any man should die upon the evidence of a false <lb/>
            or even a single witness ; and therefore they contrive this method, <lb/>
            that innocence should manifest itself by a stout denial, or guilt by a <lb/>
            plain confession: thus rating a man's virtue by the hardiness of his <lb/>
            constitution, and his guilt by the sensibility of his nerves."</p>
          <p>The scruples of the civil law in regard to testimony are assigned in <lb/>
            an ancient statute, the 27th of Henry VIII, chapter 4, as a reason <lb/>
            for changing the mode of trying certain offences. It recites that <lb/>
            pirates, thieves, robbers, and murderers upon the sea, many times <lb/>
            escape unpunished, because the trial of their offences bath heretofore <lb/>
            been ordered before the Admiral, or his lieutenant or commissary, <lb/>
            after the course of the civil law, the nature whereof is, that, before <lb/>
            any judgment of death can be given against the offenders, either they <lb/>
            must plainly confess their offence, (which they will never do without <lb/>
            torture or pains,) or else their offences be so plainly and directly <lb/>
            proved by witnesses indifferent, such as saw their offences committed, <lb/>
            which cannot be gotten but by chance at few times, &amp;c.”—and then <lb/>
            it enacts, that such offences shall be tried under the king's commis­ <lb/>
            sion directed to the lord admiral, &amp;c., according to the course of the <lb/>
            common law.</p>
          <p>The practice of torture, together with the other procedure of the <lb/>
            civil law, passed into the judicial system of most European countries, <lb/>
            and continued to form a part of it until a recent period.</p>
          <p>In France the Question préparatoire, which was used in order to <lb/>
            enforce confessions where strong presumptive evidence of guilt was <lb/>
            not thought sufficient to warrant capital punishment, was first for­ <lb/>
            bidden by a decree of 24th August, 1780; and by a law of 9th Octo­ <lb/>
            ber, 1789, torture was entirely abolished throughout the French <lb/>
            dominions. In Russia the use of torture in judicial inquiry was first <lb/>
            interrupted by a recommendation of the Empress Catherine in 1763 ; <lb/>
            and its final abolition as a part of the Russian law was effected by an <lb/>
            imperial ukase in 1801. In the middle of last century it was pro­ <lb/>
            hibited in Prussia, Saxony, and Austria; but not in other German <lb/>
            states till the present century. For instance, in Bavaria and Wur­ <lb/>
            temburg it was first suspended by ordinances in 1806, in Hanover in <lb/>
            1822, and in the Duchy of Baden in 1831. The inquisitorial tribu­ <lb/>
            nals of Spain and Italy have been slow and reluctant to abandon a <lb/>
            practice so congenial to their institution.</p><pb n="392"/>

            <title type="sub">OATHS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>THE manner of taking oaths in ancient times and modern, the <lb/>
            origin of the practice, its use, intent, and purpose, are the subjects of <lb/>
            this appendix.</p>
          <p>The definition of an oath, as given by Paley, is this—“ it is the <lb/>
            calling upon God to witness, i. e. to take notice of what we say, and <lb/>
            invoking his vengeance, or renouncing his favour, if what we say be <lb/>
            false, or what we promise be not performed."</p>
          <p>The forms of oaths, like other religious ceremonies, have been <lb/>
            various; but they have generally consisted of some bodily action, <lb/>
            accompanied by a prescribed form of words. The bodily action has <lb/>
            commonly been the touching of something sacred, with a view to <lb/>
            confirm the sanctity of the appeal. I shall show how this ceremony <lb/>
            came to be adopted, and in what its efficacy is supposed to consist. <lb/>
            First let me observe that the common expression corporal oath is not <lb/>
            derived from the bodily action which accompanies it, that (namely) <lb/>
            of laying the hand on the bible; but, as Paley tells us, is borrowed <lb/>
            from the ancient usage of touching the corporate, or cloth which <lb/>
            covered the consecrated elements.</p>
          <p>The primary idea in swearing is, that you call the Deity to witness <lb/>
            the truth of what you say; and in so doing you invoke him to come <lb/>
            near you, or to be present while you take the oath, as Abraham did, <lb/>
            when lifting up his hand to heaven he swore an oath to the King of <lb/>
            Sodom. The holding up of his hand was a pointing to the supposed <lb/>
            residence of the Deity. Afterwards, when men came to use idols and <lb/>
            symbols to represent the Deity, they used to touch these while in <lb/>
            the act of swearing, and supposed that by so doing they made him <lb/>
            present at the oath, just as Jupiter actually was present, when Vesta, <lb/>
            touching his head, (in Homer's hymn,) takes the oath which the <lb/>
            poet's lines express: <lb/>
            Touching the head of Ægis-bearing Jove <lb/>
            A mighty oath she swore, and bath fulfilled, <lb/>
            That she among the Goddesses of heaven <lb/>
            Would still a virgin be.</p>
          <p>The heathen nations generally touched the altar of the God by <lb/>
            whom they swore, and the sanctity of the oath depended much on <lb/>
            the particular God who was appealed to. For each nation had a <lb/>
            favourite deity, as the Carthaginians, Juno; the Ephesians, Diana; <lb/>
            the Tyrians, Hercules; and also favourite temples, rites, forms, and <lb/>
            other appendages of religion. The ceremony is described in a passage <lb/>
            in Plautus thus: <lb/>
            G. Tange aram bane Veneris. L. Tango. <lb/>
            G. Per Venerem hanc jurandum est tibi.</p><pb n="393"/>
            
          <p>Tliucydides tells us, that at the peace of Nicias it was stipulated <lb/>
            that each of the belligerent powers should swear the most solemn <lb/>
            oath according to the custom of their country.1 In Virgil's twelfth <lb/>
            Æneid, where king Latinus swears to the treaty made with the <lb/>
            Trojans before the single combat of Æneas and Turnus, he stands by <lb/>
            the altar and performs this ceremony; as the reader will see by <lb/>
            Dryden's translation, which I quote: <lb/>
            I touch the sacred altars, touch the flames, <lb/>
            And all these powers attest, and all their names; <lb/>
            Whatever chance befal on either side, <lb/>
            No term of time this union shall divide; <lb/>
            No force nor fortune shall my vows unbind, <lb/>
            Or shake the stedfast tenor of my mind.</p>
          <p>The touching of the altar was often accompanied with other rites, <lb/>
            as libation, burning of incense, or sacrifice. The immolation of full­ <lb/>
            grown victims gave peculiar sanctity to the oath of a Greek.2</p>
          <p>A military oath is described by Æschylus in the play of the Seven <lb/>
            Chiefs: <lb/>
            Over the hollow of a brazen shield <lb/>
            A bull they slew, and touching with their hands <lb/>
            The sacrificial stream, they called aloud <lb/>
            On Mars, Enyo, and bloodthirsty Fear, <lb/>
            And swore an oath, or in the dust to lay <lb/>
            These walls, and give our people to the sword, <lb/>
            Or perishing to steep the land in blood.</p>
          <p>We read of Scythians and other barbarous people cutting their <lb/>
            fingers, pouring the blood into a cup, and tasting it, to cement a <lb/>
            compact of friendship or alliance. The Saxons and other German <lb/>
            tribes swore by their arms, and punished the false swearer by cutting <lb/>
            off the hand that bore them.</p>
          <p>The fire ordeal of the middle ages had its origin in a ceremony, of <lb/>
            which mention is made at a very early period. Demosthenes in the <lb/>
            action against Conon, (where there are some good observations on <lb/>
            the subject of oaths,) speaks of those who walked through fire in <lb/>
            order to sanctify their oaths. And in the Antigone of Sophocles the <lb/>
            messenger, who brings tidings of the burial of Polynices, says: <lb/>
            Ready were we to grasp the burning steel, <lb/>
            To pass thro' fire, and by the Gods to swear, <lb/>
            The deed was none of ours, nor aught we knew <lb/>
            Of living man, by whom 'twas plann'd or done.</p>
          <p>Compare Virgil, AEneid XI. 785.</p>
          <p>An Athenian witness was sworn at an altar belonging to the deity <lb/>
            who presided over the courts of justice; the hero Lycus, namely: or <lb/>
            Apollo, according to Müller. The evidentiary oath, or wager of law, <lb/>
            being attended with more important results, as I have elsewhere <lb/>
            shown, the swearing of it was accompanied with greater solemnity. <lb/>
            If the party swore by his children, he made them stand before him, <note type="footnote"> (1) <foreign xml:lang="grc">έπιχώριον ὄρκον τὸνμέγιστον</foreign>. Thucyd. v. 47. </note><note type="footnote"> 2) Hence <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀμόσυι καθ᾽ ἱερω̄ν τελείων</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="394"/>
            and then, laying his hand upon their heads,1 pronounced a curse <lb/>
            upon them if he swore falsely. If he had no children, he would <lb/>
            imprecate destruction upon himself and his whole race, and add force <lb/>
            to his words by touching the holy victims.</p>
          <p>The oath by the children was the most solemn of all. A peculiar <lb/>
            power was attributed to the parental curse. It was at once produc­ <lb/>
            tive and prophetic of the evil which it prayed for. Polynices, in the <lb/>
            play of Sophocles, ascribes his expulsion from Thebes to the Fury of <lb/>
            his father; and, when his father has cursed him, Antigone asks, who <lb/>
            will dare to follow him to the war after the prediction of Œdipus ? <lb/>
            Nor has this notion been confined to ancient times. The curse of <lb/>
            Lear upon Goneril seems to carry with it its own fulfilment.2</p>
          <p>A singular rite occurs in the history of the patriarchs Abraham and <lb/>
            Jacob. Abraham says to his servant (Genesis, c. XXIV.):</p>
          <p>" Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh; And I will make <lb/>
            thee swear by the Lord, the God of Heaven and Earth, that thou <lb/>
            shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, <lb/>
            among whom I dwell;</p>
          <p>" But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred; and <lb/>
            take a wife unto my son Isaac."</p>
          <p>Jacob makes Joseph perform the same ceremony when he promises <lb/>
            to carry him out of Egypt and bury him in the burying-place of his <lb/>
            fathers. According to some commentators, this was equivalent to <lb/>
            swearing by the Messiah, who was to spring from the loins of <lb/>
            Abraham.</p>
          <p>The Jews of a later age touched the book of the law, or then <lb/>
            phylacteries, upon which extracts of the law were written. When <lb/>
            Christians kiss the Bible, or lay their hands upon the cross or relics <lb/>
            in taking an oath, or when Mahometans do the same upon the Koran, <lb/>
            we recognise at once the source from which their practice has been <lb/>
            derived. Some persons may be disposed to think that the custom <lb/>
            smacks of idolatry; some may think, that, even if it does, it is one of <lb/>
            an innocent kind. It is not my intention to pronounce any opinion <lb/>
            upon such a question. My wish is simply to draw attention to the <lb/>
            historical facts connected with the subject. It is curious indeed to <lb/>
            observe how the rite which we have been noticing has found its way <lb/>
            into some of the every-day practices of life. Thus, the hand has <lb/>
            always been considered sacred to faith, and hence to grasp the hand <lb/>
            of a person, to whom a promise was made, was to give a pledge of <lb/>
            faith. This is kept up at the present day; and hence we say " to <lb/>
            clench a bargain." In the same way the eye was sacred to Love; <note type="footnote"> (1) This is the exact meaning of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀμνύναι κατὰ παίδων</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">καθ᾽ ἱερω̄ν</foreign>, and is the <lb/>
            origin of the expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατ</foreign>’<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξωλείυς</foreign> </note><note type="footnote"> (2) This is one of the most affecting scenes in the whole of Shakspeare Sophocles <lb/>
            fails to excite our sympathies in favour of Œdipus, because the wrongs done him <lb/>
            by his son are not brought before our eyes; they are narrated, not dramatized. <lb/>
            The suppliant address of Polynices disarms our wrath, and makes the cure seem <lb/>
            revolting. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="395"/>
            and therefore the lover used to touch and swear by the eyes of his <lb/>
            mistress, and she often by her own, as in Propertius: <lb/>
            Viles isti videantur ocelli, <lb/>
            Per quos sæpe mihi credita perfidia est.</p>
          <p>It is specially worthy of notice, that God, that is, the true God, <lb/>
            swears by Himself, because he can swear by none greater. See <lb/>
            Hebrews, chap. VI.; Genesis chap. XXII.; and Milton's Paradise <lb/>
            Lost, bk. V. <lb/>
            Your head I him appoint. <lb/>
            And by myself have sworn; to him shall bow <lb/>
            All knees in heaven, and shall confess him Lord.</p>
          <p>It is in this spirit that Juliet, in the excess of her devotion to <lb/>
            Romeo, exclaims:- <lb/>
            Do not swear at all, <lb/>
            Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, <lb/>
            Which is the God of my idolatry, <lb/>
            And I'll believe thee.</p>
          <p>The early Greeks attached the utmost sanctity to the obligation of <lb/>
            an oath, and had a firm belief that an oath-breaker would be punished <lb/>
            both in this world and the next. Pindar places those who kept their <lb/>
            oaths in Elysium, while those who broke them were in torment. in <lb/>
            the Frogs of Aristophanes, Bacchus asks Xanthias, when they are in <lb/>
            the infernal region: <lb/>
            What lies beyond there ? <lb/>
            X. Mire and darkness. <lb/>
            B. See you the parricides and oathbreakers <lb/>
            Of whom he told us1</p>
          <p>However the Greeks may afterwards have degenerated, the opinion <lb/>
            of the moralist respecting perjury continued to be the same; as we <lb/>
            may see indeed from the orators, who, while they are constantly <lb/>
            accusing their adversaries of false swearing, always speak of the <lb/>
            offence as one of a most odious character.</p>
          <p>It has often been observed, that the frequency of oaths, and the <lb/>
            habit of administering them on light and trivial occasions, tend to <lb/>
            weaken their effect, and to diminish their sacredness in the minds of <lb/>
            the people. Frivolous swearing amounts to that taking of God's <lb/>
            name in vain, which is so solemnly forbidden. Paley recommended <lb/>
            long ago, that declarations, attended with penal consequences in case <lb/>
            of falsehood, might in many cases be substituted for oaths with <lb/>
            advantage. And this recommendation has been to a considerable <lb/>
            extent adopted. There are some who would go further, and abolish <lb/>
            oaths altogether, at least all official and judicial oaths. Such was the <lb/>
            advice of that acute but eccentric man, the late Jeremy Bentham; <lb/>
            who, writing on the subject of oaths, pronounces them to be useless, <lb/>
            and worse than useless. Without pronouncing any opinion of my <lb/>
            own, I shall give my readers an opportunity of judging of his argu­ <lb/>
            ments :—</p>
          <p>" The supposition of an oath's efficiency is absurd in principle. It <lb/>
            ascribes to man a power over his Maker. It places the Almighty in <lb/>
             <pb n="396"/>
            the station of a sheriff's officer, under the command of every justice <lb/>
            of the peace. It supposes him to stand engaged, no matter how, but <lb/>
            absolutely engaged, to inflict on every individual by whom the cere­ <lb/>
            mony has been profaned a punishment, which (but for the ceremony <lb/>
            and the profanation) he would not have inflicted.</p>
          <p>" Either the ceremony causes punishment to be inflicted by the <lb/>
            Deity in cases where otherwise it would not have been inflicted, or it <lb/>
            does not. In the former case, the same sort of authority is exercised <lb/>
            by man over the Deity, as that which in English law is exercised <lb/>
            over the judge by the legislature, or over the sheriff by the judge. <lb/>
            In the latter case, the ceremony is a mere form, without any useful <lb/>
            effect whatever.</p>
          <p>" Under the ceremony of an oath are included two very different <lb/>
            ties, the moral and the religious. The one is capable of being made <lb/>
            more or less binding upon all men; the other upon such only as are <lb/>
            of a particular way of thinking. The same formulary which under­ <lb/>
            takes to draw down upon a man the resentment of the Deity in case <lb/>
            of contravention, does actually, in the same event, draw down upon <lb/>
            him the resentment and contempt of mankind. The religious tie is <lb/>
            that which stands forth, which makes all the show, which offers itself <lb/>
            to view; but it is the other tie that does by far the greatest part of <lb/>
            the business.</p>
          <p>" Applied to judicial testimony, if there be an appearance of its <lb/>
            exercising a salutary influence, it is because this supposed power acts <lb/>
            in conjunction with two real and efficient ones; the power of the <lb/>
            political sanction, and the power of the moral or popular sanction. <lb/>
            When, to preserve a man from mendacity, he has, in addition to the <lb/>
            fear of supernatural punishment, the fear of fine, imprisonment, or <lb/>
            pillory, on the one hand; the fear of infamy, the contempt and <lb/>
            hatred of all that know him, on the other; it is no wonder that it <lb/>
            should appear powerful. Strip it of these accompaniments, deprive <lb/>
            it of these supports, its impotence appears immediately.</p>
          <p>" In certain cases the tie of an oath is seen to have a powerful <lb/>
            effect upon mankind. In what cases ? Where the force of public <lb/>
            opinion acts under its command; where it employs itself in insuring <lb/>
            the veracity of witnesses in courts of justice. In other cases oaths <lb/>
            are cobwebs, or (at best) hairs. In what ? In all in which the force <lb/>
            of public opinion runs counter, or withholds its aid; in the case of <lb/>
            jurymen's oaths in a variety of instances;1 in the case of various <lb/>
            other offices; in the case of university oaths, custom house oaths, <lb/>
            and subscriptions.</p>
          <p>" It was in the earliest stages of society, that this, together with <lb/>
            so many other articles in the list of supernatural securities, or sub- <note type="footnote"> (1) He alludes to such cases as these: where some of the jury give up their <lb/>
            opinions to the rest, in order to agree upon a verdict, which must be unanimous ; or <lb/>
            where they acquit a guilty prisoner, in order to save him from a cruel punishment; <lb/>
            or wherever they find a verdict manifestly contrary to law and to the evidence, in <lb/>
            order to do what they consider substantial justice. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="397"/>
            atitutes for testimonial veracity, took their rise-ordeals in all their <lb/>
            forms ; trials by battle; trials without evidence (understand human <lb/>
            evidence;) trials by supernatural, to the exclusion of human, evidence; <lb/>
            trials by evidence secured against mendacity by supernatural means, <lb/>
            by the ceremony of an oath.</p>
          <p>" As the powers of the human understanding gain strength, <lb/>
            invigorated by nourishment and exercise, the natural securities rise <lb/>
            in value, the supernatural, understood to be what they are, drop, one <lb/>
            after another, off the stage. First went ordeal; then went duel; <lb/>
            after that went, under the name of wager of law, the ceremony of an <lb/>
            oath in its pure state, unpropped by that support which this efficient <lb/>
            security receives at present from those efficient ones which are still <lb/>
            clogged with it; by and bye, its rottenness standing confessed, it <lb/>
            will perish off the human stage; and this last of the train of super­ <lb/>
            natural powers, ultima cœlicolúm, will be gathered like Astræa into <lb/>
            its native skies."</p>
          <p>Without attempting to answer the above, I will only observe, as <lb/>
            the result of my own experience, that oaths operate very differently <lb/>
            upon different persons. Many take them as a matter of business, and <lb/>
            are not much affected by them. Some appear to have a sense of <lb/>
            their obligation, others pretend to have; and among the former class, <lb/>
            there are those that have a religious, and those that have a super­ <lb/>
            stitions veneration for the ceremony. Let any one attend in a court <lb/>
            of justice, and watch the demeanour of the various witnesses as they <lb/>
            come to the box to be sworn, and especially at the moment when <lb/>
            they kiss the book. The sight is both amusing and instructive. <lb/>
            Some will kiss the book reverently, some with an affectation of <lb/>
            reverence, as if to impress the court with a great idea of their regard <lb/>
            for an oath. Others take it up carelessly, as if to show their con­ <lb/>
            tempt for the practice, or their indifference to the matter at issue. <lb/>
            Occasionally youwill see persons raise the sacred volume near to <lb/>
            their lips, and pretend to kiss it, while they kiss only the empty air, <lb/>
            their object seemingly being to escape from the obligation which the <lb/>
            ceremony is thought to impose; and such persons are sometimes <lb/>
            reproved by the judge, and desired to salute the book with their <lb/>
            mouths in the proper way. It would be exceedingly difficult in any <lb/>
            case to estimate the nature and degree of influence which an oath <lb/>
            exercises on the mind. To judge from the language of counsel, who <lb/>
            are continually reminding the witnesses that they are upon their <lb/>
            oaths, you would imagine that an oath was forgotten almost as soon <lb/>
            as it was sworn.</p>
          <p>There are many who have scruples as to the lawfulness of oaths. <lb/>
            Upon this point, referring my readers to the 39th article of our <lb/>
            Church and Burnet thereupon, I will conclude with a quotation from <lb/>
            Paler:</p>
          <p>"Quakers and Moravians refuse to swear upon any occasion; <lb/>
            founding their scruples concerning the lawfulness of oaths upon out <lb/>
             <pb n="398"/>
            Saviour's prohibition, Matt. V. 34. ‘ I say unto you, swear not <lb/>
            at all.'</p>
          <p>" The answer which we give to this objection cannot be understood, <lb/>
            without first stating the whole passage: ' Ye have heard that it bath <lb/>
            been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but <lb/>
            shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths. But I say unto you, <lb/>
            Swear not at all; neither by heaven, for it is God's throne; nor by <lb/>
            the earth, for it is his footstool; neither by Jerusalem, for it is the <lb/>
            city of the great King. Neither, shalt thou swear by thy head, <lb/>
            because thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your <lb/>
            communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay; for whatsoever is more than <lb/>
            these, cometh of evil.'</p>
          <p>" To reconcile with this passage of Scripture the practice of swear­ <lb/>
            ing, or of taking oaths, when required by law, the following observa­ <lb/>
            tions must be attended to.</p>
          <p>"1. It does not appear, that swearing ‘ by heaven,' ‘ by the earth,' <lb/>
            'by Jerusalem,' or 'by their own head,' was a form of swearing <lb/>
            ever made use of amongst the Jews in judicial oaths: and, con­ <lb/>
            sequently, it is not probable that they were judicial oaths which <lb/>
            Christ had in his mind when he mentioned those instances.</p>
          <p>" 2. As to the seeming universality of the prohibition, ‘ Swear not <lb/>
            at all: the emphatic clause ' not at all' is to be read in connexion <lb/>
            with what follows; ' not at all,' i. e. neither ‘ by the heaven,' nor <lb/>
            by the earth,' nor by Jerusalem,' nor by thy head:' 'not at <lb/>
            all: does not mean upon no occasion, but by none of these forms. <lb/>
            Our Saviour's argument seems to suppose, that the people, to <lb/>
            whom he spake, made a distinction between swearing directly by the <lb/>
            name of God and swearing by those inferior objects of veneration, <lb/>
            the heavens, the earth, Jerusalem, or their own head. In opposi­ <lb/>
            tion to which distinction, he tells them that, on account of the <lb/>
            relation which these things bore to the Supreme Being, to swear by <lb/>
            any of them, was in effect and substance to swear by him; ' by <lb/>
            heaven, for it is his throne;’ 'by the earth, for it is his footstool;' <lb/>
            ' by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King;' ' by thy head,' <lb/>
            for it is his workmanship, not thine,—‘thou canst not make one <lb/>
            hair white or black;' for which reason he says, ' Swear not at all' <lb/>
            that is, neither directly by God, nor indirectly by anything related to <lb/>
            him. This interpretation is greatly confirmed by a passage in the <lb/>
            23rd chapter of the same gospel, where a similar distinction, made by <lb/>
            the Scribes and Pharisees, is replied to in the same manner.</p>
          <p>"3. Our Saviour himself being 'adjured by the living God,' to <lb/>
            declare whether he was the Christ, the Son of God, or not, con­ <lb/>
            descended to answer the high-priest, without making any objection <lb/>
            to the oath (for such it was) upon which he examined him.—‘ God is <lb/>
            my witness,' says St. Paul to the Romans, ' that without ceasing I <lb/>
            make mention of you in my prayers:" and to the Corinthians still <lb/>
            more strongly, ‘ I call God for a record upon my soul, that, to spare <lb/>
             <pb n="399"/>
            you, I came not as yet to Corinth.' Both these expressions contai n <lb/>
            the nature of oaths. The epistle to the Hebrews speaks of the <lb/>
            custom of swearing judicially, without any mark of censure or disap­ <lb/>
            probation; 'Men verily swear by the greater; and an oath, for <lb/>
            confirmation, is to them an end of all strife.'</p>
          <p>" Upon the strength of these reasons, we explain our Saviour's <lb/>
            words to relate, not to judicial oaths, but to the practice of vain, <lb/>
            wanton, and unauthorized swearing in common discourse. St. James's <lb/>
            words, chapter V. 12, are not so strong as our Saviour's, and there­ <lb/>
            fore admit the same explanation with more ease."</p>

            <title type="sub">THE EMPIRE OF ATHENS.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>No people can safely or permanently hold a great empire, who are <lb/>
            not a military people, and who do not maintain a powerful army. <lb/>
            Those states which have depended on a naval force, or on foreign <lb/>
            mercenaries, have been all ultimately subdued. So fell Athens, and <lb/>
            so fell Carthage. An insular, or quasi-insular position, protected by . <lb/>
            a navy, affords undoubtedly a great security against attack, and has <lb/>
            enabled some people, with a scanty territorial dominion, to become <lb/>
            independent and powerful; yet even this cannot hold out against a <lb/>
            well-directed military power. Tyre yielded to Alexander; and Venice <lb/>
            sank to decay. Carthage was the first mercantile nation in the world, <lb/>
            and by means of her great wealth raised hosts of mercenaries, and <lb/>
            subdued a great portion of Sicily and Spain; by the extraordinary <lb/>
            genius of Hannibal she wrested the greater part even of Italy from <lb/>
            the Romans: yet a Roman army landing in Africa strikes her to the <lb/>
            heart, and all her power at once collapses. The Romans, with a <lb/>
            warlike population and warlike institutions, annexing and by <lb/>
            a wise and liberal policy firmly uniting to their state the sur­ <lb/>
            rounding nations of Italy, who were nearly as brave as themselves, <lb/>
            gradually widened the circle of their power, and conquered the world.</p>
          <p>Never was there a braver and better disciplined army than that of <lb/>
            Sparta; but it was too small for purposes of conquest, or even of <lb/>
            defence, unless she was supported by her neighbours. The institu­ <lb/>
            tions of Lycurgus were not calculated for empire. The Spartans <lb/>
            were ignorant and illiberal; they kept themselves in a state of isola­ <lb/>
            tion, and were disliked even by their allies, who rejoiced at the <lb/>
            defeat of Leuctra. They only became great by the misconduct of <lb/>
            Athens, and could not maintain their position long.</p>
          <p>The Theban army, naturally brave, was raised to great perfection <lb/>
            by Epaminondas and Pelopidas, and Thebes was for a few years the <lb/>
            head of a strong confederacy: but her allies were at a distance; they <lb/>
             <pb n="400"/>
            were attached to her by fear of Sparta, rather than by anv permanent <lb/>
            ties, and fell off under a change of circumstances. She was sur. <lb/>
            rounded by hostile neighbours, and, after losing her two great states­ <lb/>
            men, relapsed into comparative insignificance.</p>
          <p>Athens at an early period, through the energy and ability of her <lb/>
            statesmen and commanders, and a concurrence of fortunate circum­ <lb/>
            . stances, acquired a great maritime power, receiving tribute from the <lb/>
            numerous islands of the Ægæan, and many flourishing cities on the <lb/>
            coast of Asia Minor, Macedonia and Thrace. She aspired to be the <lb/>
            mistress of Greece; she was very nearly becoming, and probably <lb/>
            would have become so, had she provided herself with a military <lb/>
            power commensurate to her projects. Had she formed an intimate <lb/>
            alliance, on terms of mutual advantage, with Eubœa and the most <lb/>
            important of the islands, and had she, with their aid, maintained a <lb/>
            well-disciplined army, strong enough to repel an enemy from her <lb/>
            frontiers, she might have defied any hostile confederacy that could <lb/>
            have been formed against her. With strong garrisons at Eleusis, <lb/>
            Panactum, Decelea, and Oropus, and a force of ten thousand cavalry <lb/>
            permanently stationed in the country, Attica would have been pro­ <lb/>
            tected from invasion, while her fleets ravaged the coasts of the <lb/>
            enemy. As it was, while attempting to make distant conquests, she <lb/>
            . was unable to hold her own. Attica was ravaged in the Pelopon­ <lb/>
            nesian war by an enemy, whom the Athenians were unable to <lb/>
            encounter, and the occupation of Decelea was a source of constant <lb/>
            peril and distress.</p>
          <p>Nor indeed could Athens have been defended against an army of <lb/>
            sixty thousand Peloponnesians, had they possessed the science of <lb/>
            besieging which was learned a century later. Alexander with such a <lb/>
            force would have taken Athens, as he took Thebes, by storm. A <lb/>
            country denuded of its defences may be smitten by a coup de main, <lb/>
            while it is sending its armaments all over the world. The dialogue <lb/>
            in Henry V. act I. scene 2, contains truths applicable to all time:</p>

          <p>But there's a saying very old and true— <lb/>
            If that you will France win. <lb/>
            Then with Scotlandfirst begin :</p>
          <p>Philip of Macedon began with his neighbours before he turned his <lb/>
            arms against southern Greece; and took care to subjugate Greece <lb/>
            before tie thought of attacking Asia. The Athenians, in their first <lb/>
            struggle for supremacy in Greece, ruined themselves by distant wars. <lb/>
            The expedition to Egypt, B.C. 460, lost them two hundred gallies, and <lb/>
            contributed to cripple their efforts when they were engaged in war in <lb/>
            their own neighbourhood. Rash as this was, it is far exceeded in <lb/>
            folly by the enterprise against Sicily, undertaken at a time when <lb/>
            there was a confederacy of powerful states ready to assail them at <lb/>
            the first opportunity. The attack on Syracuse was a measure <lb/>
            of doubtful advantage, even bad it succeeded. Alcibiades had <lb/>
            formed a plan to conquer Sicily, Carthage, and the Italian peninsula, <lb/>
            which last country would supply abundant material for augmenting <lb/>
            the Athenian navy; he would then raise a large body of Iberian mer­ <lb/>
            cenaries, and attack Peloponnesus by land and sea; Greece must <lb/>
            thus finally yield to their arms. This was the very thing which <lb/>
            Carthage tried against Rome and failed. And Athens must have <lb/>
            failed, with all her distant conquests, if unprovided with a domestic <lb/>
            force for defence: the combined power of the Greek allies would <lb/>
            have been too much for her. But it did not come to this: the <lb/>
            Sicilian expedition was ill-planned, and ill-managed; and its failure <lb/>
            led to the first overthrow of Athenian power.</p>
          <p>Nor was Athens any wiser—wiser, I mean, in her imperial pro­ <lb/>
            jects—after her recovery from the great disaster of the Peloponnesian <lb/>
            war. Her spirit had formerly been greater than her strength: much <lb/>
            of this survived, and she again aspired to empire, but did not adopt <lb/>
            those measures which were necessary to insure success She re­ <lb/>
            covered indeed a good deal of her former power, owing to the inca­ <lb/>
            pacity of the Lacedœmonians, who alienated their best allies, and had <lb/>
            not the means of standing by themselves. But the very facility with <lb/>
            which Athens reascended to her former position seems to have caused <lb/>
            her second downfall. The people were indisposed to military service; <lb/>
            their discipline became still more relaxed; they hired mercenaries <lb/>
            over whom they had little control, and w horn they did not pay with <lb/>
            regularity. In short, their system of warfare was infected with those <lb/>
            vices which Demosthenes so forcibly points out in his Philippics, <lb/>
            and which I need not recapitulate. One of the disastrous con­ <lb/>
            sequences was the Social war, which deprived them of some of their <note type="footnote"> 70L. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> D D </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="402"/>
            best allies, and crippled their resources, at the critical time when <lb/>
            they were engaged in hostilities with Philip. This mattered less <lb/>
            while the war was carried on at a distance. Though Philip captured <lb/>
            their towns-on the coast of Macedonia and Thrace, they retained most <lb/>
            of the Ægæan islands, and were able to annoy him by their navy. <lb/>
            But when Philip, having reduced Thessaly and Phocis, was in a con­ <lb/>
            dition to carry the war into Attica, then was felt the want of that <lb/>
            foresight, which should have provided long beforehand a national <lb/>
            force capable of repelling invasion. The extraordinary exertions of <lb/>
            Demosthenes contrived even then to procure allies, and to bring the <lb/>
            contest to a doubtful issue. A few more men. and a little better disci­ <lb/>
            pline and generalship might have turned the scale the other way. To <lb/>
            illustrate the matter by a few striking facts—At Marathon, where <lb/>
            Athens fought for her existence, her heavy-armed were 10,000. At <lb/>
            Tanagra and at Chæronea, where she fought for her independence, <lb/>
            they were scarcely 12,000. In the expedition against Syracuse she <lb/>
            lost in men, including all kinds of force, upwards of 60,000, besides <lb/>
            all her ships and materials of war. At Tanagra the scale was turned <lb/>
            against her by the desertion of the Thessalian horse. Had she been <lb/>
            able to bring ten thousand horse into action against Philip, she might <lb/>
            have won Chæronea, or prevented his taking the field.</p>
          <p>What is done cannot be undone; yet it may be read as a lesson to <lb/>
            future time. Athens fell for the reasons above indicated; because <lb/>
            her people, though buoyant with spirit and energy, though proud of <lb/>
            their imperial sway and ambitious of its extension, had not the pru­ <lb/>
            deuce to organise, to cement, to consolidate; they did not discipline <lb/>
            their strength, nor make the most of their resources; consequently, <lb/>
            though they could gain dominion, they could not keep it. Was this <lb/>
            the fault of their political institutions? No. It is attributable <lb/>
            rather to the want of historical experience.</p>
          <p>But the real empire of Athens-that which was destined to be the <lb/>
            most glorious, the most extended, and the most durable-was not one <lb/>
            of material power, nor of commercial prosperity, but an empire of <lb/>
            art, science, and literature. With this she was to conquer not armies <lb/>
            and fortresses, but the minds and souls of men, and to establish over <lb/>
            them a peaceful and civilising sway.</p>
          <p>Solon, in the beginning of the sixth century before Christ, had <lb/>
            given them a code of laws admirable for its wisdom and moderation, <lb/>
            for its practical character, for the skill by which it reconciled opposing <lb/>
            classes to each other, and provided for the growing wants of a people <lb/>
            who were rising into mental activity and national power. Notwith­ <lb/>
            standing the intervening usurpation of Pisistratus, the Solonian insti­ <lb/>
            tutions took root in the mind of Athens, and produced their fruits at <lb/>
            a later period. The Persian wars not only roused up the popular <lb/>
            energies, but gave the impulse to that genius in art and poetry, <lb/>
            which astonished the world. Then Phidias and his scholars; then <lb/>
            Ictinus, Calibrates, Mnesicles, Callimachus, Corœbus, Metagenes, <lb/>
             <pb n="403"/>
            displayed their wonderful talents in architecture and sculpture. The <lb/>
            Parthenon and Propylæa, the Odeum, the temple of Eleusis, the <lb/>
            colossal image of Pallas, and the other magnificent productions of <lb/>
            that period, were the most glorious trophies of Marathon and Salamis. <lb/>
            Athens then became one of the principal seats of pictorial art, and <lb/>
            though the greatest painters did not happen to be natives of her city, <lb/>
            she had her own. Micon,. her Pleistænetus, Panænus, Apollodorus; <lb/>
            while she excited emulation, and gave encouragement to all.</p>
          <p>"Before the Persian war"—says Thirlwall—"Athens had con­ <lb/>
            tributed less than many other cities, her inferiors in magnitude and <lb/>
            in political importance, to the intellectual progress of Greece, She <lb/>
            had produced no artists to be compared with those of Argos, Corinth, <lb/>
            Sicyon, Ægina, Laconia, and of many cities both in the eastern and <lb/>
            western colonies. She could boast of no poets so celebrated as those <lb/>
            of the Ionian and Æolian schools. But her peaceful glories quickly <lb/>
            followed and outshone that of her victories, conquests, and political <lb/>
            ascendancy. In the period between the Persian and Peloponnesian <lb/>
            wars, both literature and the fine arts began to tend towards Athens, <lb/>
            as their most favoured seat. For here, above all other parts of <lb/>
            Greece, genius and talents were encouraged by an ample field of <lb/>
            exertion, by public sympathy and applause, as well as by the prospect <lb/>
            of other rewards, which however were much more sparingly bestowed. <lb/>
            Accordingly it was at Athens that architecture and sculpture reached <lb/>
            the highest degree of perfection which either ever attained in the <lb/>
            ancient world, and that Greek poetry was enriched with a new kind <lb/>
            of composition, the drama, which united the leading features of every <lb/>
            species before cultivated in a new whole, and exhibited all the grace <lb/>
            and vigour of the Greek imagination, together with the full compass <lb/>
            and the highest refinement of the form of the language peculiar <lb/>
            to Attica."</p>
          <p>After the imagination of the people had been excited by the <lb/>
            sublime muse of AEschylus, their ears charmed and their taste refined <lb/>
            by the graceful composition of Sophocles and Euripides, and after <lb/>
            the theatre bad resounded with the wild drolleries of the comic poets, <lb/>
            then, and not before, arose the prose literature of Athens. Thucydides, <lb/>
            somewhere about the year B. a. 456, had heard the father of history <lb/>
            recite a portion of his marvellous work at the Olympic games. It <lb/>
            drew tears from his eyes, and awakened in him the spirit of emula­ <lb/>
            tion ; so says the story. There had been, prose composition before <lb/>
            Herodotus, but none of. it had survived. Pherecydes of Soyros had <lb/>
            written mythical narratives and discourses: Xanthus of Lydia, Cad­ <lb/>
            mus and Hecatæus of Miletus had applied prose to historical sub­ <lb/>
            jects : but Herodotus was the first who handled his subjects in such <lb/>
            a manner as to deserve the title of historian. A Halioarnassian by <lb/>
            birth, he became in his middle age an admirer of Athenian institu­ <lb/>
            tions, and even drew some of his inspiration from Athens. In the <lb/>
            year B'. c. 448 he read a portion of his history at- the <unclear>Panathenale</unclear> <note type="footnote"> D D 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="404"/>
            festival, and received a reward of ten talents. At a later period be <lb/>
            accompanied the Athenian colony to Thuri. It has been observed <lb/>
            by Lytton Bulwer, that " something of the art of Sophocles may be <lb/>
            traced in the easy skill of his narratives, and the magic yet tranquil <lb/>
            energy of his descriptions." Donaldson has noticed the same thing, <lb/>
            and expressed an opinion in some part of his writings, (I speak from <lb/>
            memory,) that Herodotus, in the revising of his history, may have <lb/>
            adopted some of the language of Sophocles. The concluding lines of <lb/>
            the CEdipus strikingly remind one of the speech of Solon to Crœsus. <lb/>
            But here Sophocles most probably borrowed from the historian.</p>
          <p>The history of the Peloponnesian war has become a household <lb/>
            book in England. The merits of Thucydides as an historian, and his <lb/>
            defects as a writer, are pretty fairly stated by Cicero in the subjoined <lb/>
            passage from the Orator: (s. q) Xenophon committed errors as an <lb/>
            historian; yet is there not a wonderful charm about his Cyropædia <lb/>
            and Anabasis ? Cicero calls his language sweeter than honey, and <lb/>
            the voice of the Muses:</p>
          <p>" Thucydides res gestas et bella narrat, et prælia, graviter sane et <lb/>
            probe; sed nihil ab eo transferri potest ad forensem usum et publi­ <lb/>
            cum. Ipsæ illæ condones ita multas habent obscuras abditasque <lb/>
            sententias, vix ut intelligantur: quod est in oratione civili vitium vel <lb/>
            maximum. Quæ est autem in hominibus tanta perversitas, ut, in <lb/>
            ventis frugibus, glande vescantur? An victus hominum Athenien <lb/>
            slum beneficio excoli potuit, oratio non potuit ? Quis porro unquam <lb/>
            Græcorum rhetorum a Thucydide quidquam duxit ? At laudatus est <lb/>
            ab omnibus: fateor: sed ita, ut rerum explicator prudens, severus, <lb/>
            gravis; non ut in judicii3 versaret causas, sed ut in historiis bella <lb/>
            narraret. Itaque nunquam est numeratus orator. Nee vero, si <lb/>
            historiam non scripsisset, nomen ejus extaret, cum præsertim fuisset <lb/>
            honoratus et nobihs. Hujus tamen nemo neque verborum neque sen­ <lb/>
            tentiarum gravitatem imitatur; sed, cum mutila quædam et hiantia <lb/>
            locuti sunt, quse vel sine magistro facere potuerunt, germanos se <lb/>
            putant esse Thucydidis. Nactus sum etiam qui Xenophontis similem <lb/>
            esse se cuperet; cujus sermo est ille quidem melle dulcior, sed a <lb/>
            forensi strepitu remotissimus."</p>
          <p>From the time when prose literature commenced it Athens to the <lb/>
            time of her decay as a republic, there was no lack of writers there. <lb/>
            The city was illuminated with a variety of publications-speeches, <lb/>
            essays, pamphlets and treatises, on questions of politics and public <lb/>
            economy, on agriculture and mining, on natural history, poetry, <lb/>
            rhetoric, ethics and metaphysics. The names of Antiphon, Isocrates, <lb/>
            Plato, Antisthenes, Aristotle, Theophrastus, and others, immediately <lb/>
            occur to us. Philosophy, during the time I am speaking of, received <lb/>
            its greatest development at Athens. Its origin is referable to a much <lb/>
            earlier period. Apart from its connexion with religion and poetry, <lb/>
            the philosophy of the Greeks may be said to have begun with the <lb/>
            seven sages, of whom Athenian Solon was one, in the sixth century. <lb/>
             <pb n="405"/>
            Thales of Miletus was a mathematician and astronomer. He and <lb/>
            his pupil Anaximenes made known to the world their speculations on <lb/>
            cosmogony and the nature of the Deity. Subtle theories were pro­ <lb/>
            pounded by those of the Eleatic school, Xenophanes, Parmenides, <lb/>
            and Zeno. Pythagoras taught his doctrine of the transmigration of <lb/>
            souls, and communicated discoveries in geometry and other science. <lb/>
            Anaxagoras first promulgated a belief in the unity of the Godhead, <lb/>
            for which the Athenians, intolerant as yet of any tenets inconsistent <lb/>
            with the established religion, threw him into a prison, and he was <lb/>
            with difficulty extricated by his friend Pericles. Something in the <lb/>
            nature of philosophy was infused into the public mind through the <lb/>
            medium of the drama, chiefly by the writings of Euripides. The <lb/>
            Sophists (as they were called) gave lectures, and taught the art of <lb/>
            subtle disputation. But he who most effectually contributed to rouse <lb/>
            the true spirit of philosophical inquiry was the man, whose name <lb/>
            stands pre-eminent in the heathen world for wisdom and virtue, <lb/>
            whom the Delphic oracle pronounced to be the wisest of men, viz. <lb/>
            Socrates, the son of Sophroniscus.</p>
          <p>As I am not writing a history of Socrates, I stop not to enter into <lb/>
            a discussion concerning his character, or his opinions, or the nature <lb/>
            of his teaching. Enough to say, that he believed in the immortality <lb/>
            of the soul; he was practically, as well as theoretically, a good man; <lb/>
            as he had been a brave soldier, so was he a lover of truth, and a <lb/>
            detester of humbug and affectation. He taught, by precept and <lb/>
            example, the duties of patience and fortitude, of being firm in action <lb/>
            and mild in language. The more abstruse doctrines ascribed to him <lb/>
            in the Platonic dialogues probably represent the opinions of Plato <lb/>
            himself rather than his master. Socrates however gave the impulse <lb/>
            to those inquiries, which his disciples so ardently pursued. From <lb/>
            his school sprang, directly or indirectly, the various sects of philoso­ <lb/>
            phers, whose doctrines were soon to be carried to the farthest ends of <lb/>
            the Grecian world, and three centuries afterwards enlightened the <lb/>
            mind of the illustrious Roman who has discoursed about them so <lb/>
            copiously:</p>
          <p>" Socrates mihi videtur. id quod constat inter omnes, primus a <lb/>
            rebus occultis, et ab ipsa natura involutis, in quibus omues ante eum <lb/>
            philosophi occupati fuerunt, avocavisse philosophiam, et ad vitam <lb/>
            communem adduxisse: ut de virtutibus et vitiis, omninoque de <lb/>
            bonis rebus et mails quæreret; ccelestia autem vel procul esse a <lb/>
            nostra cognitione censeret, vel, si maxime cognita essent, nihil tamen <lb/>
            ad bene vivendum. Hic in omnibus fere sermonibus, qui ab iis, qui <lb/>
            ilium audierunt, perscripti varie, copiose sunt, ita disputat, ut nihil <lb/>
            affirmet ipse, refellat alios; nihil se scire dicat, nisi id ipsum; eoque <lb/>
            præstare ceteris, quod illi, quæ nesciant, scire se putent; ipse se <lb/>
            nihil scire, id unum sciat; ob eamque rem se arbitrari ab Apolline <lb/>
            omnium sapientissimum esse dictum, quod hæc esset una omnis <lb/>
            sapientia, non arbitrari sese scire, quod nesciat: quæ cum diceret <lb/>

            intelligi potest Platonis autem auctoritate, qui varius et multiplex <lb/>
            et copiosus fuit, una et consentiens duobus vocabulis philosophiæ <lb/>
            forma instituta est, Academicorum et Peripateticorum; qui rebus <lb/>
            congruentes, nominibus differebant. Nam cum Speusippum, sororis <lb/>
            filium, Plato philosophiæ quasi heredem reliquisset; duos autem præ­ <lb/>
            stantissimos studio atque doctrinâ, Xenocratem Chalcedonium, et <lb/>
            Aristotelem Stagiritem; qui erant cum Aristotele, Peripatetici dicti <lb/>
            sunt, quia disputabant inambulantes in Lyceo: illi autem, qui Plato­ <lb/>
            nis institute in Academia, quod est alterum gymnasium, cœtus erant, <lb/>
            et sermones habere soliti, e loci vocabulo nomen habuerunt. Sed <lb/>
            utrique, Platonis ubertate completi, certam quandam disciplinæ for­ <lb/>
            mulam composuerunt, et earn quidem plenam ac refertam: illam <lb/>
            autem Socraticam dubitationem de omnibus rebus et nullâ affirma­ <lb/>
            tione adhibitâ consuetudinem disserendi reliquerunt. Ita facta est, <lb/>
            quod minime Socrates probabat, ars quædam philosophiæ, et rerum <lb/>
            ordo et descriptio disciplinæ: quæ quidem erat prime duobus, ut <lb/>
            dixi, nominibus una; nihil enim inter Peripateticos et illam veterem <lb/>
            Academiam differebat: abundantiâ quâdam mgenii præstabat, ut mihi <lb/>
            videtur quidem, Aristoteles: sed idem fons erat utrisque, et eadem <lb/>
            rerum expetendarum fugiendarumque partitio."—(Academ. Quæst. <lb/>
            I. 4.)</p>
          <p>Of Aristotle says the Roman elsewhere—" excepto Platone, baud <lb/>
            scio an recte dixerim principem philosophorum." Not the born child <lb/>
            of Athens, he was hers by adoption. Athens may fairly claim the man, <lb/>
            who was so many years the disciple of Plato, and whose teaching has <lb/>
            made the name of her Lyceum so renowned. Consider now for a <lb/>
            moment, what Athens has done. In the course of three centuries <lb/>
            she has either introduced, or encouraged and brought to perfection, <lb/>
            legal and political science-architecture, sculpture, and painting-the <lb/>
            drama, history, oratory, philosophy. Teachers of all kinds, emanat­ <lb/>
            ing from the Socratic school, under the various names of Academics, <lb/>
            Stoics, Peripatetics, Epicureans, become the instructors of the <lb/>
            heathen world, and continue to be so, till a higher and more authori­ <lb/>
            tative teacher comes to supersede, them. This was the true empire <lb/>
            of Athens. Her political power wanes and disappears; kingdoms <lb/>
            rise and fall; revolution after revolution passes over the face of <lb/>
            Europe as well as of Greece; yet new triumphs still come to the <lb/>
            Alma Mater of Grecian learning; people of all nations congregate to <lb/>
            the fountain of knowledge by her Acropolis, and her missionaries, in­ <lb/>
            cluding almost all of the Greek race, have gone over the world, to con­ <lb/>
            quer it with civilisation. At first, the Ægæan and the coasts of Asia <lb/>
            Minor are the scene of her activity; at a later period, we shall find, <lb/>
            she forms the intellect of the colonies of Sicily and Magna Græcia; <lb/>
            she has penetrated Italy, and is shedding the light of knowledge and <lb/>
             <pb n="407"/>
            awakening thought through Gaul by Marseilles, and along the coast <lb/>
            of Africa by means of Cyrene. She has sailed up both sides of the <lb/>
            Euxine, and deposited her literary wares, as traders nowadays leave <lb/>
            samples of merchandise. The whole of Asia Minor and Syria re­ <lb/>
            sounds with her teaching; barbarians are quoting fragments of her <lb/>
            tragedians; Greek manners are introduced and perpetuated on the <lb/>
            Tigris and Euphrates, the Hydaspes and Acesines. But there is no . <lb/>
            place so intimately connected with the glories of Athens, as that city <lb/>
            which rose about the time of her political decline—I mean Alexan­ <lb/>
            dria—rose as if for the very purpose of becoming a capital seat of <lb/>
            learning, to spread the literature of Athens to the most distant <lb/>
            regions; fulfilling in this the desire of her beneficent founder, the <lb/>
            pupil of Aristotle, whose soul, uniting a devotion to letters with a <lb/>
            genius for sovereignty, was not content with conquests, unless they <lb/>
            added to the field of knowledge, and who, when he was in India, paid <lb/>
            a graceful homage to the city of intellect, by confessing that he was <lb/>
            doing his great acts to gain the immortal praise of the Athenians.</p>
          <p>That Athens became so intellectually great was owing to many <lb/>
            causes-to her democratic energy and early military successes-to <lb/>
            her situation, climate, and natural beauties—to her commerce-to the <lb/>
            habits of life and customs of her people.</p>
          <p>A confined triangle, perhaps fifty miles its greatest length, and <lb/>
            thirty its greatest breadth; two elevated rocky barriers, meeting at <lb/>
            an angle; three prominent mountains, commanding the plain, Parnes, <lb/>
            Pentelicus, and Hymettus; a mild climate; a somewhat meagre soil, <lb/>
            containing sufficient pasture for sheep and goats, yielding barley <lb/>
            and even wheat to the skilful cultivator; with good figs, excellent <lb/>
            oil and honey; fisheries productive; silver and metallic earths, and <lb/>
            quarries of beautiful marble-such was Attica, regarded in an agri­ <lb/>
            cultural and material point of view. Looking at her commercial <lb/>
            capabilities, we should notice her central situation with respect to <lb/>
            Greece, and her commodious harbours, which were so placed as to <lb/>
            receive vessels during all winds. And these natural advantages were <lb/>
            improved by the industry of the population, and by the encourage­ <lb/>
            ment afforded to strangers who settled at Athens for the purposes of <lb/>
            trade. All of which helped to make Athens a seat not only of naval <lb/>
            power and commercial wealth, but one of art and learning. For of <lb/>
            course it was necessary that the artists and students and all the tribe <lb/>
            of visitors, who flocked to the metropolis of knowledge, should have <lb/>
            the means of living well and enjoying themselves. And this accord­ <lb/>
            ingly they found in abundance. Athens had only too many resources <lb/>
            for an elegant, nay, a luxurious abode. So plentiful were the imports <lb/>
            of the place, that it was a common saying, that the productions, <lb/>
            which were found singly elsewhere, were brought all together in <lb/>
            Athens. The native wine of Attica was not of the best quality; but <lb/>
            the richest wines were brought from the isles of the Ægæan; the <lb/>
            finest wool and carpeting from Miletus; all varieties of luxuries <lb/>
             <pb n="408"/>
            came from Asia and the Euxine and the coasts of the Mediterranean <lb/>
            The Athenians did not much condescend to manufactures themselves; <lb/>
            but they encouraged them in others; and a population of foreigners <lb/>
            caught at the lucrative occupation both for home consumption and <lb/>
            for exportation. Their cloth, and other textures for dress and furni- <lb/>
            I ture, and their hardware, for instance, armour, were in great request. <lb/>
            Labour was cheap; stone and marble in plenty ; and the taste and <lb/>
            skill, which at first were devoted to public buildings, as temples and <lb/>
            porticos, were in course of time applied to the mansions of public <lb/>
            men.</p>
          <p>But the mental inspiration or the Athenians was owing less to any <lb/>
            artificial improvement of the natural advantages of their fatherland, <lb/>
            than to the nature and quality of the air they breathed and the soil <lb/>
            they trod. It is agreed on all hands, that the purity of the air of <lb/>
            Attica had a beneficial effect not only on the buildings and the vege­ <lb/>
            tation of the country, but on the temper and genius of the people. <lb/>
            And who can tell how the enthusiasm of the poets and orators may <lb/>
            have been kindled by the rock of the Acropolis and the magnificent <lb/>
            scenery which it commanded, independently even of its historical <lb/>
            traditions and reminiscences? An eloquent writer in the Catholic <lb/>
            University Gazette warms with the subject, as if he had been himself <lb/>
            an Athenian—</p>
          <p>" Many a more fruitful coast or isle is washed by the blue Ægæan; <lb/>
            many a spot is more beautiful or sublime to see, many a territory <lb/>
            more ample; but there was one charm in Attica, which in the same <lb/>
            perfection was nowhere else. The deep pastures of Arcadia, the <lb/>
            plain of Argos, the Thessalian vale, these had not the gift; Bœotia, <lb/>
            which lay to its immediate north, was notorious for its very want <lb/>
            of it. The heavy atmosphere of that Bceotia might be good for <lb/>
            vegetation; but it was associated in popular belief with the dulness <lb/>
            of the Bœotian intellect: on the contrary, the special purity, elasticity, <lb/>
            clearness, and salubrity of the air of Attica, fit concomitant and <lb/>
            emblem of its genius, did that for it which earth did not;-it brought <lb/>
            out every bright hue and tender shade of the landscape on which it <lb/>
            was spread, and would have illuminated the face even of a more bare <lb/>
            and rugged country.</p>
          <p>" The Attic olive tree was so choice in nature and so noble in <lb/>
            shape, that it excited a religious veneration; and it took so kindly to <lb/>
            the light soil, as to expand into woods upon the open plain, and to <lb/>
            climb up and fringe the hills. The clear air brought out, yet blended <lb/>
            and subdued, the colours on the marble, till they had a softness and <lb/>
            harmony, for all their richness, which in a picture looks exaggerated, <lb/>
            yet is after all within the truth. The same delicate atmosphere <lb/>
            freshened up the pale olive, till the olive glowed like the arbutus or <lb/>
            beech of the Umbram hills."</p>
          <p>He goes on to speak of the thyme and thousand fragrant herbs <lb/>
            which carpeted Hymettus, and the hum of bees upon its flowery hill <lb/>
             <pb n="409"/>
            the prospect over the Ægæan, where we might " follow with our eyes <lb/>
            the chain of islands, which, starting from the Sunian headland, seemed <lb/>
            to offer to the fabled divinities of Attica, when they would visit their <lb/>
            Ionian cousins, a sort of viaduct thereto across the sea: the dark <lb/>
            violet billows with their white edges down below; those graceful <lb/>
            fan-like jets of silver close upon the rocks, which slowly rise aloft <lb/>
            like water spirits from the deep, then shiver and break and spread <lb/>
            and shroud themselves, and disappear, in a soft mist of foam; the <lb/>
            gentle, incessant heaving and panting of the whole liquid plain; and <lb/>
            the long waves, keeping steady time, like a line of soldiery, as they <lb/>
            resound upon the hollow shore."</p>
          <p>Our greatest poets have celebrated the intellectual achievements of <lb/>
            Athens; none so well as Milton:</p>
          <p>Behold <lb/>
            Where on the Ægean shore a city stands, <lb/>
            Built nobly, pure the air, and light the soil; <lb/>
            Athens, the eye of Greece, mother of arts <lb/>
            And eloquence, native to famous wits <lb/>
            Or hospitable, in her sweet recess, <lb/>
            City or suburban, studious walks and shades. <lb/>
            See there the olive grove of Academe, <lb/>
            Plato's retirement where the Attic bird <lb/>
            Trills her thick-warbled notes the summer long; <lb/>
            There flowery hill Hymettus, with the sound <lb/>
            Of bees' industrious murmur, oft invites <lb/>
            To studious musing; there Ilissus rolls <lb/>
            His whispering stream: within the walls then view <lb/>
            The schools of ancient sages; his, who bred <lb/>
            Great Alexander to subdue the world, <lb/>

            There shalt thou hear and learn the secret power <lb/>
            Of harmony in tones and numbers hit <lb/>

            Of moral prudence, with delight received <lb/>
            In brief sententious precepts, while they treat <lb/>
            Of fate and chance and change in human life, <lb/>
            High actions and high passions best describing: <lb/>
            Thence to the famous orators repair, <lb/>
            Those ancient, whose resistless eloquence <lb/>
            Wielded at will that fierce democratic, <lb/>
            Shook the arsenal, and fulmined over Greece <lb/>
            To Macedon and Artaxerxes' throne: <lb/>

            On the unapprehensive wild <lb/>

            Grew savage yet, to human use unreconciled; <lb/>

            Like the man's thought dark in the infant's brain, <lb/>
            Like aught that is which wraps what is to be, <lb/>

            Of kingliest masonry: the ocean floors <lb/>
            Pave it; the evening sky pavilions it; <lb/>
            Its portals are inhabited <lb/>
            By thunder-zoned winds, each head <lb/>
            Within its cloudy wings with sunfire garlanded, <lb/>
            A divine work I Athens diviner yet <lb/>
            Gleamed with its crest of columns, on the will <lb/>

            For thou wert, and thine all-creative skill <lb/>
            Peopled with forms, that mock the eternal dead <lb/>
            In marble immortality, that hill <lb/>
            Which was thine earliest throne and latest oracle.</p>
          <p>Within the surface of Time's fleeting river <lb/>
            Its wrinkled image lies, as then it lay <lb/>
            Immoveably unquiet, and for ever <lb/>
            It trembles, but it cannot pass away I <lb/>
            The voices of thy bards and sages thunder <lb/>
            With an earth-awaking blast <lb/>
            Through the caverns of the past; <lb/>
            Religion veils her eyes; Oppression shrinks aghast; <lb/>
            A winged sound of joy, and love, and wonder, <lb/>
            Which soars where Expectation never flew, <lb/>
            Rending the veil of space and time asunder <lb/>
            One ocean feeds the clouds, and streams, and dew; <lb/>
            One sun illumines heaven; one spirit vast <lb/>

          <p>Where was the education which produced these results ?—Such is <lb/>
            a question which a modern philanthropist, busied in schemes for the <lb/>
            dissemination of useful knowledge, would be inclined to ask: and <lb/>
            certain it is, that, whatever be the natural capabilities of men, what­ <lb/>
            ever their advantages of descent, race, soil, climate, &amp;c., there must <lb/>
            be some training to draw forth their native powers, and furnish their <lb/>
            minds with knowledge. The ordinary scholastic education at Athens <lb/>
            would not be thought much of now-a-days. The schools were day­ <lb/>
            schools, established on speculation by persons seeking to gain a <lb/>
            livelihood, varying in quality according to the attainments of the <lb/>
            different masters, (Demosthenes boasts that he had been sent to <lb/>
            respectable schools,) yet all pursuing pretty much the same system <lb/>
             <pb n="411"/>
            of teaching Boys went to them at the age of six and remained tilt <lb/>
            they were sixteen. During this period the son of a respectable citizen <lb/>
            was committed to the charge of his Pædagogus, usually an intelligent <lb/>
            slave, who took him every day (except on festivals and holidays) to <lb/>
            the school and the gymnasium; for bodily exercises were considered <lb/>
            as important as those of the mind. The rudiments at school were <lb/>
            grammar, writing, and cyphering: the higher literary instruction <lb/>
            consisted in reading the poets, especially Homer, and committing <lb/>
            portions of them to memory. At the best schools the lesson was <lb/>
            very likely accompanied with instructive comment and explanation. <lb/>
            Reading of prose authors probably came in. fashion as the number of <lb/>
            prose works increased. Music was deemed an important, though <lb/>
            not absolutely essential, part of a liberal education. It was com­ <lb/>
            menced at the age of thirteen. The favourite instrument in more <lb/>
            ancient times was the flute, and Aristotle tells us, that at the close of <lb/>
            the Persian war there was hardly any Athenian citizen who could not <lb/>
            play it; but afterwards the harp and the lyre were preferred, because <lb/>
            the flute distorted the face and did not allow accompaniment with <lb/>
            the voice.</p>
          <p>Such was the routine of schooling at Athens, better there probably <lb/>
            than anywhere else; (and we know that Theban parents sometimes <lb/>
            sent their sons to Athenian schools;) yet the amount of actual <lb/>
            acquirement was not very great. Arithmetic and the rudiments of <lb/>
            music; such a knowledge of his own language, and such cultivation <lb/>
            of literary taste, as enabled him to enjoy the works of Greek writers, <lb/>
            and to express himself with propriety; this, together with good <lb/>
            manners, formed the sum total of what the best educated Athenian <lb/>
            learned at school. There was no higher course of scholastic educa­ <lb/>
            tion; nothing further was open to the aspiring youth, except the <lb/>
            lectures of the sophist or rhetorician; but this sort of instruction did <lb/>
            not come into vogue till after the close of the Peloponnesian war. <lb/>
            At sixteen the state took him in hand, and for two years compelled <lb/>
            his attendance at the public gymnastic schools, where he was dis­ <lb/>
            ciplined in manly exercises, and served that apprenticeship which <lb/>
            enabled him to perform military service for his country.</p>
          <p>Nor were there any public institutions at Athens for popular <lb/>
            education; although some of the measures of her leading statesmen <lb/>
            tended indirectly to promote that end. Pisistratus formed a library, <lb/>
            to which he gave access to his countrymen, and made a careful col­ <lb/>
            lection of the Homeric poems. These and other poems, to diffuse <lb/>
            the knowledge of them, were recited at the Panathenæa; an edict <lb/>
            was issued by Hipparchus, making such recital compulsory. Measures <lb/>
            of this sort were most important, when books, or manuscripts, were <lb/>
            scarce and dear. According to Böckh there was no trade in books <lb/>
            at Athens before the time of Plato. It is shown in the Charicles, <lb/>
            that books were sold, and private libraries formed, at an earlier <lb/>
            period; but the price of them must have been very high.</p><pb n="412"/>
            
          <p>Cimon employed his ample fortune in embellishing the city and <lb/>
            adoming the public places with trees. He built the first of those <lb/>
            noble porticos, of which we hear so much in Athens, and formed the <lb/>
            groves, which in process of time became the celebrated Academy. <lb/>
            Formerly it was a piece of waste ground, two miles north of the city: <lb/>
            under Cimon's hands it became a park or grove, laid out with shady <lb/>
            walks and fountains, and containing open lawns and courses for <lb/>
            exercise or recreation. Little thought the gallant soldier, what <lb/>
            sort of lessons would be learned a century later in the walks of <lb/>
            Academus.</p>
          <p>It was Pericles who did the most to foster the genius of his <lb/>
            countrymen. It was his wish to make Athens a seat of empire: in <lb/>
            this he failed; but he succeeded in making her a seat of knowledge, <lb/>
            without aiming at it so directly, as well by his patronage of art and <lb/>
            science, as by the whole tenor of his administration. It was his <lb/>
            policy to increase the power of the multitude, and to elevate their <lb/>
            minds to a sense of their own importance. With this view he <lb/>
            heightened the attractions of the theatres, and threw them open to <lb/>
            all the citizens, and, while he laboured to render Athens more glorious <lb/>
            and more magnificent, he taught the people to consider that this <lb/>
            glory, this magnificence, was their own. Thus were the feelings <lb/>
            of every Athenian identified with his country; his civic duties <lb/>
            ennobled his character, and advanced him as a social and intellectual <lb/>
            being. Here then lay a part of the secret-how Athens was enabled <lb/>
            to achieve so much as an instructress of men. The topic has been <lb/>
            well handled by Lytton Bulwer in his "Rise and Fall of Athens</p>
          <p>" We cannot but allow the main theory of the system to have been <lb/>
            precisely that most favourable to the prodigal exuberance of energy, of <lb/>
            intellect, and of genius. Summoned to consultation upon all matters, <lb/>
            from the greatest to the least ;-compelled to a lively and unceasing <lb/>
            interest in all that arouses the mind, or elevates the passions, or <lb/>
            refines the taste ;-supreme arbiters of the art of the sculptor, as the <lb/>
            science of the lawgiver—judges and rewarders of the limner and the <lb/>
            poet, as of the successful negociator or the prosperous soldier;—we <lb/>
            see at once the all-accomplished, all-versatile genius of the nation, <lb/>
            and we behold at the same glance the effect and the cause :-every­ <lb/>
            thing being referred to the people, the peopled learned of everything <lb/>
            to judge. Their genius was artificially forced, and in each of its <lb/>
            capacities. They had no need of formal education. Their whole life <lb/>
            was one school. The very faults of their assembly, in its proneness <lb/>
            to be seduced by extraordinary eloquence, aroused the emulation of <lb/>
            the orator, and kept constantly awake the imagination of the audience. <lb/>
            An Athenian was, by the necessity of birth, what Milton dreamt <lb/>
            that man could only become by the labours of completest education: <lb/>
            in peace a legislator, in war a soldier-in all times, on all occasions, <lb/>
            acute to judge, and resolute to act. All that can inspire the thought <lb/>
            or delight the leisure were for the people. Theirs were the portico <lb/>
             <pb n="413"/>
            and the school-theirs the theatre, the gardens, and the baths; they <lb/>
            were not, as in Sparta, the tools of the state-they were the state! <lb/>
            Lycurgus made machines, and Solon men. Lacedæmon flourished <lb/>
            and decayed, bequeathing to fame men only noted for hardy valour, <lb/>
            fanatical patriotism, and profound but dishonourable craft, attracting <lb/>
            indeed the wonder of the world, but advancing no claim to its grati­ <lb/>
            tude, and contributing no single addition to its intellectual stores. <lb/>
            But in Athens the true blessing of freedom was rightly placed in the <lb/>
            opinions of the soul. Thought was the common heritage which every <lb/>
            man might cultivate at his will. This unshackled liberty had its <lb/>
            convulsions and its excesses, but producing unceasing emulation and <lb/>
            unbounded competition, an incentive to every effort, a tribunal to <lb/>
            every claim, it broke into philosophy with the one-into poetry with <lb/>
            the other-into the energy and splendour of unexampled intelligence <lb/>
            with all. Looking round us at this hour, more than four-and-twenty <lb/>
            centuries after the establishment of the constitution we have just <lb/>
            surveyed-in the labours of the student-in the dreams of the poet <lb/>
            -in the aspirations of the artist-in the philosophy of the legislator <lb/>
            —we yet behold the imperishable blessings we derive from the liber­ <lb/>
            ties of Athens and the institutions of Solon. The life of Athens <lb/>
            became extinct, but her soul transfused itself, immortal and immor­ <lb/>
            talising, through the world."</p>
          <p>" As the Romans deified law"—says the same eloquent writer in <lb/>
            the Catholic University Gazette,' who has been already quoted­ <lb/>
            " so the Athenians deified the beautiful. A people so speculative, so <lb/>
            imaginative, which throve upon mental activity as other races upon <lb/>
            repose, and to whom it came as natural to think, as to a barbarian to <lb/>
            smoke or to sleep, such a people were in a true sense born teachers, <lb/>
            and merely to live among them was a cultivation of mind. Hence <lb/>
            they suddenly took their place in this capacity from the time that <lb/>
            they had emancipated themselves from the aristocratic families, with <lb/>
            which their history opens. The Athenians felt that a democracy was <lb/>
            but the political expression of an intellectual isonomy, and, when <lb/>
            they had obtained it, and taken the Beautiful for their Sovereign, <lb/>
            instead of Pisistratus, they came forth as the civilizers, not of Greece <lb/>
            only, but of the European world.</p>
          <p>" A century had not passed from the expulsion of the Pisistratidæ, <lb/>
            when Pericles was able to call Athens the education or schoolmistress <lb/>
            of Greece. And, ere it had well run out, upon the Athenian misfor­ <lb/>
            tunes in Sicily, the old Syracusan, who pleaded in behalf of the <lb/>
            prisoners, conjured his fellow-citizens, 'in that they had the gift of <lb/>
            Reason,' to have mercy upon those, who had opened their land as a <lb/>
            common school to all men; and he asks—' To what foreign land will <lb/>
            men betake themselves for liberal education, if Athens be destroyed ?' <lb/>
            And the story is well known, when, in spite of his generous attempt, <lb/>
            the Athenian prisoners were set to work in the stone-quarries, how <lb/>
            those who could recite passages from Euripides, found the talent <lb/>
             <pb n="414"/>
            serve them instead of ransom, for their liberation. It was hardly <lb/>
            more than the next generation, when her civilization was conveyed <lb/>
            by the conquests of Alexander into the very heart of further Asia, <lb/>
            and was the life of the Greek kingdom which he founded in the east. <lb/>
            She became the centre of a vast intellectual propagandism, and had <lb/>
            in her hands the spell of a more wonderful influence than the semi­ <lb/>
            barbarous power which first conquered and then used her. Wherever <lb/>
            the Macedonian phalanx held its ground, thither came a colony of <lb/>
            her philosophers; Asia Minor and Syria were covered with her <lb/>
            schools, while in Alexandria her children, Theophrastus and Deme­ <lb/>
            trius, became the life of the great literary undertakings which have <lb/>
            immortalized the name of the Ptolemies."</p>
          <p>It was the boast of Pericles, that the Athenians loved virtue and <lb/>
            sought to do what was right and good and noble, not from servile <lb/>
            feeling, not because they were obliged, not from fear of the law or <lb/>
            any penal consequences of acting differently, but because it was their <lb/>
            nature so to act, because it was so truly pleasant. Their political <lb/>
            bond was good wall and generous sentiment. They were loyal citi­ <lb/>
            zens, active, hardy, brave, munificent, from their love of what was <lb/>
            high, and because the virtuous was the enjoyable, and the enjoyable <lb/>
            was the virtuous. While in private and personal matters each <lb/>
            Athenian was suffered to please himself, without any tyrannous <lb/>
            public opinion to make him feel uncomfortable, the same freedom of <lb/>
            will did but unite them together in concerns of national interest, <lb/>
            because obedience to the magistrates and the laws was with them a <lb/>
            sort of passion; it was their instinct to shrink from dishonour and to <lb/>
            repress injustice. They could be splendid in their feasts and spec­ <lb/>
            tacles without extravagance, because the crowds whom they attracted <lb/>
            from abroad repaid them for the outlay; and such large hospitality <lb/>
            did but cherish in them a frank, unsuspicious, and courageous spirit, <lb/>
            which better protected them than a pile of state secrets and exclu­ <lb/>
            sive laws. Nor did this joyous mode of life relax them, as it might <lb/>
            relax a less noble race; for they were warlike without effort, and <lb/>
            expert without training, and rich in resources by the gift of nature, <lb/>
            and, after their fill of pleasure, were only more gallant in the field, <lb/>
            and more patient and enduring on the march. They could love the <lb/>
            fine arts and study the sciences without becoming effeminate; debate <lb/>
            did not blunt their energy, nor foresight of danger chill their daring; <lb/>
            but, as their tragic poet expresses it, " the loves were the attendants <lb/>
            upon wisdom, and had their share in the action of every virtue. <lb/>
            Thus boasted Pericles, and orators who succeeded him gave expres­ <lb/>
            sion to similar opinions.</p>
          <p>Such then was the condition of the Athenian mind, such the <lb/>
            temper of the people, when the professors of philosophy first ap­ <lb/>
            peared among them, and attracted attention by offering to teach &amp; <lb/>
            higher and more important knowledge than any which had been <lb/>
            taught before. These persons received no direct patronage from the <lb/>
             <pb n="415"/>
            ruling power of the country, nor from parents or guardians. They <lb/>
            did not establish schools, where boys or young men (to speak in <lb/>
            modern phraseology) " finished their education." Most parents were <lb/>
            deterred by the high fees which the Sophists demanded for their <lb/>
            lectures. But among the rising generation there was a spirit of <lb/>
            curiosity and inquiry, which could not be idle, an ambition which <lb/>
            could not rest, nor endure to remain in ignorance while knowledge <lb/>
            was within its reach. And therefore, when persons calling them­ <lb/>
            selves wise men," and professing to be masters of science and <lb/>
            reason and eloquence, began to open their mission, the aspiring <lb/>
            young Athenians, unfettered by conventional ideas, became their <lb/>
            followers. The excitement they created in Athens is described by <lb/>
            Plato in one of his Dialogues. Protagoras came to the bright city <lb/>
            with the profession of teaching the political art; and the young <lb/>
            flocked around him ; not because he promised them entertainment or <lb/>
            novelty, such as the theatre might promise; nor because he had any <lb/>
            bribe of definite advantage to offer; he engaged to prepare them <lb/>
            generally for the business of life, by giving them mental cultivation, <lb/>
            and to prepare them better than Hippias or Prodicus. who were at <lb/>
            Athens with him. Whether he was really able to do this, is another <lb/>
            question; but it is clear, the very promise of knowledge operated as a <lb/>
            potent spell upon the minds of the young Athenians.</p>
          <p>Let us hear the state of the case from the mouth of Hippocrates <lb/>
            himself, the youth, who in his eagerness woke Socrates, himself a <lb/>
            young was at the time, while it was yet dark, to tell him that <lb/>
            Protagoras was come to Athens. " When we had supped, and were <lb/>
            going to bed -he says—" then my brother told me that Protagoras <lb/>
            was arrived, and my first thought was to come and see you imme­ <lb/>
            diately ; but afterwards it appeared to me too late at night. As soon <lb/>
            however as sleep had refreshed me, up I got, and came here."­ <lb/>
            " And I," continues Socrates, giving an account of the conversation <lb/>
            -" knowing his earnestness and excitability, said:—'What is that <lb/>
            to you ? does Protagoras do you any harm ?' He laughed and said: <lb/>
            ' That he does, Socrates; because he alone is wise, and does not make <lb/>
            me so.' 'Nay,' said I; 'if you give him money enough, he will <lb/>
            make you wise too.' 'O heavens'—cried he—'that it depended <lb/>
            upon that! For I would spare nothing of my own, or of my friends' <lb/>
            property either; and I have now come to you for this very purpose, <lb/>
            to get you to speak to him in my behalf. For, besides that I am too <lb/>
            young, I have never yet seen Protagoras, or heard him speak; for I <lb/>
            was but a boy when he came before. However all praise him, <lb/>
            Socrates, and say that he is the wisest man to speak. But why do <lb/>
            we not go to him, that we may find him at home ?'"—They went on <lb/>
            talking till the light; and then they set out for the house of Callias, <lb/>
            where Protagoras, with others of his own calling, were lodged. <lb/>
            There they found him pacing up and down the portico, with his host <lb/>
            and others, among whom was a son of Pericles on one side of him <lb/>
             <pb n="416"/>
            while another son of Pericles, with another party, were on the other. <lb/>
            A party followed, chiefly of foreigners, whom Protagoras had be­ <lb/>
            witched, like Orpheus, by his voice. On the opposite side of the <lb/>
            portico sat Hippias, with a bench of youths before him, asking him <lb/>
            questions in physics and astronomy. Prodicus was still in bed, with <lb/>
            some listeners on sofas round him. The house is described as quite <lb/>
            full of guests. Such is the sketch given us by Plato of this school <lb/>
            of Athens; and we learn from him how powerfully it interested the <lb/>
            hearers. We see what it was that filled the Athenian lecture-halls <lb/>
            and porticos: not the fashion of the day, not the patronage of the <lb/>
            great, nor pecuniary prizes, but the reputation of talent and the <lb/>
            desire of knowledge-ambition, if you will, personal attachment, but <lb/>
            not an influence, political or other, external to the school. " Such <lb/>
            Sophists," says Grote, referring to the passage in Plato," had nothing <lb/>
            to recommend them except superior knowledge and intellectual fame, <lb/>
            combined with an imposing personality, making itself felt in the <lb/>
            lectures and conversation."</p>
          <p>And so the thing went on. The real character of the Sophists we <lb/>
            need not trouble ourselves about. Some of them might be mere <lb/>
            pretenders, professing to know what they did not know, and to teach <lb/>
            what they could not teach. But what we are concerned with is this. <lb/>
            There were the élite of the Athenian youth, with a thirst for know­ <lb/>
            ledge, which required to be satisfied. If Protagoras and Prodicus <lb/>
            were unable to do what they promised, there were others to come, <lb/>
            who were better able to accomplish the task. Accordingly the scene <lb/>
            shifts; the Sophists pass from the stage, and those whom history has <lb/>
            designated Philosophers begin to play their part. There is still no <lb/>
            lack of pupils ; and no compulsory discipline, to enforce their atten­ <lb/>
            dance. In learning, as in life, the voluntary system, so lauded by <lb/>
            Pericles, prevails. It was the method of influence, the action of <lb/>
            personality, the play of mind upon mind, which by a spontaneous <lb/>
            force kept the schools of Athens going, and made the pulses of <lb/>
            foreign intellect keep time with hers.</p>
          <p>But of what advantage either to Athens or to the world were these <lb/>
            intellectual acquirements? Did the Athenians possess practical <lb/>
            wisdom ? or good morals ? Were they not in public life rapacious, <lb/>
            rash, fickle, tyrannical? in private, sensual and profligate? Was <lb/>
            their boasted philosophy anything more than a dream ?</p>
          <p>With respect to the political state of Athens, I consider that she <lb/>
            enjoyed the best constitution in Greece, and, although she committed <lb/>
            many errors, she conferred upon her people, during the period of her <lb/>
            independence, a greater amount of happiness and security than was <lb/>
            to be found anywhere else. In aiming at empire, she did that which <lb/>
            all conquering nations have done, and which seems only to be justi­ <lb/>
            fied by two things; by success, and by making a good use of success. <lb/>
            Yet we may fairly say, that the subjects of Athens were as well off <lb/>
            under her sovereignty, as they were under that of Persia, or Sparta, <lb/>
             <pb n="417"/>
            or Macedonia. With respect to the vices of private life, we must <lb/>
            bear in mind that we are considering the condition of a pagan <lb/>
            country. Where the light of religion has not shone, there is always <lb/>
            danger, as the Catholic writer says, that the love of the beautiful will <lb/>
            become the love of the sensual. It is impossible to read history <lb/>
            without seeing that there was far too much of this at Athens. The <lb/>
            indecencies of Aristophanes could not be exhibited on a Christian <lb/>
            stage. A modem tribunal would not regard with favour the act of <lb/>
            Hyperides, who, in order to obtain a verdict for the lovely Phryne, <lb/>
            tore open her vest, and displayed her bosom to the jury. On the <lb/>
            other hand, we must not lose sight of the redeeming points in the <lb/>
            character of the Athenians, and the circumstances which distin­ <lb/>
            guished them from their contemporaries-for example, their respect <lb/>
            for law and legal ordinances-their sensibility to the appeals of a lofty <lb/>
            eloquence-their toleration of the reproof addressed to themselves <lb/>
            by their orators and comic poets-the general mildness with which <lb/>
            they administered their penal laws-their good manners and behaviour <lb/>
            in society, (acknowledged by the Thebans, when they quartered the <lb/>
            Athenian troops in their houses)—the provision which they made for <lb/>
            infirm citizens, and the orphans of those who fell in war—the <lb/>
            humanity which they exercised to slaves (witness their frequent <lb/>
            emancipation, as after the battle of Arginusæ, and contrast such con­ <lb/>
            duct with the treatment of the Helots at Sparta)—again, their insti­ <lb/>
            tution of clubs, for charitable as well as for social purposes, and the <lb/>
            numerous acts of generosity and public spirit recorded of individual <lb/>
            Athenians. Even in their sensuality there was a mixture of refine­ <lb/>
            ment. They were less devoted to the pleasures of the table than <lb/>
            most other people: taste gave laws to the symposium; the carouse <lb/>
            was enlivened by the charms of wit and the intercourse of soul with <lb/>
            soul. Thus (to borrow the language of Burke) vice lost much of its <lb/>
            evil by a diminution of its grossness. But conceding to the full, <lb/>
            that Athens was tainted with vice and sensuality, the question still <lb/>
            occurs-was this owing to mental cultivation and philosophy ? or did <lb/>
            they not mitigate the evil to some extent P Are we to believe that <lb/>
            refinement of taste and sentiment is itself vicious? that art is <lb/>
            debasing? philosophy demoralising? Did AEschylus by his sublime <lb/>
            drama corrupt his audience? Did men become worse because <lb/>
            Socrates taught the doctrine of the soul's immortality, and inculcated <lb/>
            the practice of virtue; or because the Stoics contended that virtue <lb/>
            was sufficient for happiness and that a wise man regarded pain as no <lb/>
            evil P Athens is to be judged in comparison with the nations that <lb/>
            surrounded her; and her teachers and sages with reference to the <lb/>
            condition of the world in their time. For example; was it better to <lb/>
            live (morally and intellectually speaking) in an Athenian or in a <lb/>
            Bœotian atmosphere P was better teaching to be had at Athens, or at <lb/>
            Sparta P Was it not more improving to man's nature to embrace the <lb/>
            tenets of Socrates and Plato, than to believe the obscene myths of <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> E E </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="418"/>
            polytheism ? Granted, that Socrates and Plato did not teach with <lb/>
            authority, and that nothing which they taught, either in religion or in <lb/>
            morals, could be more than partially true. A glimmering of light <lb/>
            however is better than none at all; and Providence may have so <lb/>
            ordered it, that these imperfect doctrines, revealed by the light of <lb/>
            nature, and illustrated by the reasoning of thoughtful men, should <lb/>
            continue to temper the grossness of heathenism, till the time arrived <lb/>
            when Divine truth was to take the place of human speculation. The <lb/>
            literature handed down to us by Athenian sages is of that serene <lb/>
            and severe beauty, which has ever been associated with the term <lb/>
            "classical," and it is grave and profound enough for the ancient <lb/>
            fathers to have considered it a good preparation for the Gospel. As <lb/>
            Greek philosophy must before the Christian era have been the most <lb/>
            elevating and purifying study that could be found, so even now it <lb/>
            has its use as showing the limits to which the human mind could <lb/>
            reach without the aid of divine Revelation, and proving that natural <lb/>
            theology, rightly understood, is in harmony with Revealed.</p>
          <p>Regarding it in this point of view, we cannot but acknowledge the <lb/>
            justice of those praises which philosophy has received both from <lb/>
            heathens and Christians:</p>

            Casting bright images of heavenly youth <lb/>
            To make the world less mournful—TALFOURD'S Athenian Captive.</p>
          <p>Lastly, I have to notice the assertion which has frequently been <lb/>
            made, that the devotion of the Athenians to literature and philosophy <lb/>
            led to the decay of their military energy and thus to the loss of <lb/>
            independence. "Athene"—says the Catholic writer—"needed to <lb/>
            be of sterner stuff: she was of too fine and dainty a nature for the <lb/>
            wear and tear of life." " As in despotisms "-says Lytton Bulwer­ <lb/>
            " a coarse and sensual luxury rots away the vigour and manhood of a <lb/>
            conquering people, so in this intellectual republic it was the luxury <lb/>
            of the intellect which gradually enervated the great spirit of the <lb/>
            victor race of Marathon and Salamis, and called up generations of <lb/>
            eloquent talkers and philosophical dreamers. The spirit of poetry, <lb/>
            or the pampered indulgence of certain faculties to the prejudice of <lb/>
            others, produced in a whole people what it never fails to produce in <lb/>
            the individual ;-it unfitted them-just as they grew up into a man­ <lb/>
            hood exposed to severer struggles than their youth had undergone­ <lb/>
            for the stern and practical demands of life, and suffered the love of <lb/>
            the Beautiful to subjugate or soften away the common knowledge of <lb/>
            the Useful. Genius itself became a disease, and poetry assisted <lb/>
            towards the euthanasia of the Athenians."</p>
          <p>This sounds very well, and the substance of it has often been <lb/>
            repeated: the Roman Senate acted on the same notion, when they <lb/>
            committed Greek treatises to the flames, and when they expelled <lb/>
            Greek philosophers and rhetoricians from the city, for fear of their <lb/>
            introducing studies which would unfit the youth of Rome for the <lb/>
            performance of civil and military duties. Yet it is not so easily to be <lb/>
            conceded, that intellectual tastes and pursuits—(I speak not of such <lb/>
            as lead to idleness and dissipation)—-must necessarily enfeeble the <lb/>
            courage of men, or incapacitate them for active exertion. AEschylus <lb/>
            and Socrates were brave soldiers. Alexander's princely aspirations <lb/>
            were in no way slackened by his having been a pupil of Aristotle. <lb/>
            Xenophon, Epaminondas, (to mention a few out of many examples,) <lb/>
            were men who united personal courage and military talents with high <lb/>
            mental culture. Nor does the history of Athens in any way establish <lb/>
            the proposition which we are considering. The Athenians fought <lb/>
            with courage during the Peloponnesian war, though they had imbibed <lb/>
            a taste for the arts and the drama; their disasters at Syracuse and <lb/>
            Ægospotamos were owing not to lack of courage, but to the mis­ <lb/>
            conduct of their commanders. They lost Chæronea: so did the <lb/>
            Thebans. One may as well say, that the Thebans were beaten <lb/>
            because they were dull in intellect, as that the Athenians were beaten <lb/>
            because they were the reverse of dull. If they had bad a large <lb/>
            numerical force and had run away like sheep, there would have been <lb/>
            more to say. That they were not better prepared in numbers and <note type="footnote"> E. E 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="420"/>
            discipline, was, as I have already intimated, a political error; but <lb/>
            why charge it upon poetry and philosophy ? The like errors were <lb/>
            committed by other states, which were quite innocent of Attic taste <lb/>
            and refinement, or Greece would not have been subjugated by Philip. <lb/>
            Disunion, mutual jealousies, want of foresight, and narrow policy, <lb/>
            left no chance against a man who possessed large military resources, <lb/>
            and was constantly augmenting and improving them, extending his <lb/>
            influence and alliances, and preparing long beforehand for the blow <lb/>
            which he finally struck. Philip could not have conquered an army of <lb/>
            40,000 Spartans; nor could he have beaten Sparta, Thebes, and <lb/>
            Athens, united together; but he was more than a match for only <lb/>
            two of them, with his improved phalanx, and powerful force of <lb/>
            cavalry and light troops. Demosthenes truly said, that, if there had <lb/>
            been a few more statesmen in Greece like himself, Hellenic liberty <lb/>
            might have been preserved. We see what he was able to effect even <lb/>
            with the scanty means at his command. From the struggle at <lb/>
            Chæronea, as well as from the partial success of the Athenians in the <lb/>
            Lamian war, it is apparent what might have been accomplished if <lb/>
            the orator's warnings had been duly attended to. There is more <lb/>
            practical wisdom to be learned from the counsels of Demosthenes, <lb/>
            urging his countrymen to exert themselves with hopefulness and <lb/>
            courage, than from the theories of persons reasoning after the event, <lb/>
            and making out that things must have been so because they were so.</p>
